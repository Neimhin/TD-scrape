            <p eId="para_51">The boards under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach are the National Statistics Board, the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum, the Information Society Commission, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, the Law Reform Commission and the IFSC groups. The National Statistics Board does not meet the minimum target that 40% of membership be from either gender, and only six of 32 members of the National Economic and Social Council board are women.</p>
            <p eId="para_52">Moreover, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, which held its first meeting recently, does not meet the target, with five female and nine male members. I am sure the Taoiseach would always wish to display leadership in the specific commitments in the programme for Government aimed at improving gender equality on the State boards. Given that his Department and the bodies under its aegis and responsibility do not meet those requirements, how can we expect everyone else to toe the line in this regard? For instance, can the Taoiseach indicate why only six of the NESC's 32 members are women? Is it because women were not asked, or because of a failure to find people of suitable ability who were willing to take up the positions? Perhaps there is an explanation for this quite extraordinary gap.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">As for the NESC, to be precise, the percentage of women stands at 19%. Most of the boards in question should have many more women serving on them. However, these bodies are all composed of representatives of the social partners. Farmers, employers and trade unions do not have a tendency to appoint anything which resembles a fair representation of women, in spite of ongoing arguments and battles about it. As Deputy Kenny correctly noted, my Department does not control many appointments. However, an effort is made in the case of our independent nominees, who form a small portion of the total, as well as the Oireachtas nominees, who are a matter for the Oireachtas. Nevertheless, the figures from the social partners are not great. All I can do is to relay again the House's concern about the representative bodies. While the social partners could do better, they tend not to.</p>

            <p eId="para_59">Yes. I understand that it has 32 members, only six of whom are women. However, the Taoiseach's reply cited a figure of 19%, which, being a percentage, looks better than a figure of six.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">Such people are nominees of the social partners and one cannot refuse to take them. It is an ongoing battle. As for bodies such as the IFSC, in which there are clearing house groups, rather than boards, we have a high proportion of women. However, in respect of the main bodies, the National Statistics Board is different because it is a specialist board with a good percentage of women serving on it. The social partners are notorious for not appointing women.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">Does the Taoiseach acknowledge the desirability of ensuring that State boards, where practical and appropriate, should have an all-Ireland character and approach? Will this be reflected in future appointments? To take the example of the National Economic and Social Forum, does the Taoiseach agree that it would be appropriate for such a body to have an all-Ireland character and approach, particularly now, given the changed political dispensation on this island? When vacancies present, or when the next appointment of the five Government appointees comes about, will this be reflected in the numbers appointed by the Taoiseach as representatives of Government? Does the Taoiseach believe they should come from a variety of experiences and backgrounds, including local government, trade unions, community and voluntary sectors, the business sector and farming interests? Is it the case that meeting the desire to ensure we reflect on an all-Ireland approach to these appointments, there are such limitations in the current number of appointees that it may require revisiting? Is the Taoiseach considering this? Is legislation required to revisit the make up of the NESF, and other State boards for which the same arguments properly apply, into the future?</p>

            <p eId="para_63">Over the years there has always been an effort to include northern input and representation on the board of NESC and other bodies, maybe not a high number but it would not justify a high number. That has been done by successive Governments and it is still the position. We should include such representation on State boards in general, particularly where there is an economic, social or cultural dimension. We are in favour of greater cross-Border all-Ireland economy joint initiatives and collaborations in the health and education areas. I have no difficulty saying that should be a representative group across knowledge, foresight and professionalism. Recently a number of business, education and cultural representatives from Northern Ireland have been put on State boards, which is an important practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">It would not necessarily require changes in legislation but it would be helpful, particularly in my area, if the social partnership groups were to pick a Northern representative. Most of them could do that because they have close associations in business, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is an all-island organisation. They are not bad at doing that. As distinct from what I said earlier to them about the gender balance, they keep strong representation from Northern Ireland in their executives and in their committee delegations.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">Does the issue of disabilities come into play in appointments to State boards? The question arises from the news item that referred to 3% being too low for the number of people with disabilities employed in Departments. Has the Taoiseach given that any thought, given the number of people with disabilities, for example, qualified graduates, who cannot get jobs is much higher than that in the wider population?</p>
            <p eId="para_67">Is there a code of practice in the operation of State boards that would include, for example, a requirement to take minutes of meetings? It is not under his Department's remit but obviously the stories concerning Bord na gCon bring the question to mind.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">Disability does not really apply to these boards but the National Disability Council has a strong board and there are others where disabilities are well represented. Some of the nominees to some of these organisations feed into some of the wider social partnership groups, where disabilities groups are strongly represented in their pillar, and also NESC, NESF and NCPP include people who have an interest. The 3% issue relates to employees and it is not relevant to these questions. However, it is relevant that it is important to people who have an interest and the knowledge.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">I refer back to the question on the participation of women and the fact that the rate of such participation is going backwards from the days the former Deputy, Mervyn Taylor, was Minister for Equality and Law Reform and sought to ensure the 40% participation requirement was applied. Does the Taoiseach agree that as long as his Government acquiesces in representative organisations not putting forward women for these appointments, the position is unlikely to improve? Has the time come for the Taoiseach to give a lead in his Department and say if organisations such as the IFA and the ICTU do not put forward a more representative sample of women to participate on boards under the aegis of his Department, he will not make the appointments? Would that not quickly bring them to heel? The suggestion that women cannot be found in the trade union movement, the farming community or business who are suitable to function on one of these boards in 2006 lacks credibility and the time has come for the Government to take a tougher line with representative organisations.</p>

            <p eId="para_78">Generally, the figure has remained high and across most boards it is fairly good. With regard to the representative groups, it continues to be a problem. In so far as I engage in these appointments, I put pressure on my Department. The last appointment in January was to the board of the National Centre for Partnership and Performance and the point raised by the Deputy was relevant. We have argued this previously. Five out of 12 or 13 people appointed to boards under the aegis of my Department are women. It is a battle with the social partners to keep up their 50% and time and again the Government is left in the position of trying to improve the balance. The Government includes many women in its nominees and, while there is nothing wrong with that, it would be better if the social partners appointed a higher proportion of women.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">I take the Deputy's point that many relevant people in the trade union movement and the employer's group can do this. Financial groups do not have this problem and they get a strong representation of high quality people who are prepared to give their time voluntarily to the IFSC and other statistical matters and they do not receive allowances or so on, unlike appointees to NESC or other boards. We will continue to do that. The recent appointment was an approved position but it is a permanent battle to get the social partners to put forward women.</p>

            <p eId="para_107">This tribunal has dragged on for over eight years at a cost of €22 million. It is absurd that having set up the Moriarty tribunal for a particular purpose this House has never had an opportunity to debate even an interim report from the tribunal nor has it any concept of when it may conclude its deliberations. I understand the date originally envisaged for the application of new fees was 11 January 2006. There were to be reduced fees for legal personnel involved and that was calculated on the basis that the tribunal's programme of work as it stood in mid-2004 would be concluded in or around that date. The tribunal then discussed the matter with the Government and the date was extended to 13 June 2006, an extra five and a half months.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">What is the estimated closure date of the Moriarty tribunal? Does the Taoiseach have a figure for the estimated cost of the extension in respect of the higher legal fees that apply until the new ones kick in? Looking back, in 1997 the cost was €553,000. This rose to €1.6 million in 1998, €2.1 million in 1999, €2.17 million in 2000, €2.24 million in 2001, €2.79 million in 2002, €3.4 million in 2003, €3.6 million in 2004 and €2.7 million up to the end of September 2005. The public is weary of this tribunal and others. While everyone wants to seek the truth, in this case, it has dragged on for eight years with no finding whatsoever brought to bear. Will the Taoiseach indicate when it is expected to conclude so that at least one of these tribunals would present its deliberations and the House can have a debate on its findings, whatever they might be?</p>

            <p eId="para_109">As I understand it, the Moriarty tribunal was due to end its public hearings and the report was to be written and delivered in or around the end of the year. I think that is what I told the House on a previous occasion. I do not have any information other than that. As Deputy Kenny has correctly said, the Moriarty tribunal was given an extension at the higher fee rates up to 30 June next. I do not know if it will finish its public hearings in that period. The previous Minister for Finance had agreed a period, in consultation with the Attorney General and the chairman, after which the new fees were to become applicable. To the best of my knowledge, and I do not have anything telling me otherwise, that remains the position.</p>

We have already had an exchange here with regard to the extension of the higher rate until the end of June. There is obviously an ongoing cost to the Taoiseach's Department relating to the extension, not only of the tribunal sittings but also of the higher fees for the period until the end of June. If the Taoiseach does not have the information to hand to answer the questions before him, will he revert to the Deputies later and advise them of same?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_117">In July 2004 the Government decided to apply a new scale of legal fees payable in respect of any new tribunals and inquiries established on or after 1 September 2004. The effect of the scale was to reduce substantially the costs of legal representation at new tribunals and inquiries. In September of 2004, the Government decided that the new scale would also be applied to existing tribunals and inquiries as and from certain dates which were specified in respect of each tribunal and inquiry. The dates were based in each case on the expected date of conclusion of the work of each tribunal of inquiry and were agreed between the Attorney General and each of the relevant tribunals.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">At the time of the two Government decisions, there was no statutory power to reduce the fees payable to lawyers in the existing tribunals and inquiries. It was envisaged that a short Act to amend the tribunals legislation would be enacted which would confer a specific power to limit the fees payable to existing tribunals and inquiries. A Bill to this end was drafted by the Office of the Attorney General prior to the publication of the Law Reform Commission report on tribunals of inquiry. It was decided to await publication of the commission's recommendations before any legislative proposal would be published. After the publication of the commission's report the earlier draft Bill was subsumed into a much larger and more comprehensive Bill to consolidate and reform all the tribunals legislation. This larger Bill will be published within the next few weeks. Therefore, there is no statutory power to reduce the fees payable to the lawyers in the various tribunals and inquiries and there will not be any such statutory power until the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 is enacted by the Houses.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">The original date envisaged for the application of fees to the Moriarty tribunal was 11 January 2006. This was calculated on the basis that the tribunal's programme of work as it stood at mid-2004 would be concluded on or about that date. Due to unforeseen circumstances that have since arisen, the extensive nature of its terms of reference and ongoing inquiries and litigation by parties involved in the tribunal, the tribunal has requested that it be given an additional amount of time to complete its work. That matter was discussed with the tribunal and, given the relevant imminence of the conclusion of the tribunal's work, it is believed it is was reasonable to facilitate the continuance of work until the end of June. This represents an extension of five and a half months from the previous expected completion date. It must be borne in mind that the tribunal has been in operation for eight years and is nearing completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">It is expected that the new tribunals legislation will be enacted before this summer. Therefore, there should be no obstacle to reducing fees payable to lawyers appearing before the Moriarty tribunal after that date in the event that the tribunal has not completed its work by then.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">Deputy Ó Caoláin's last question was about the procedure for the future. This will come under the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill which is entirely different legislation. The Bill provides that much of the work will be done in private and the entire system of dealing with the tribunal will be very different from that currently in operation. It will be built around the Commissions of Investigation Act. The two forms of investigation are different models of investigation. Each will have a particular purpose depending on the wishes of the Oireachtas. The main distinction between a commission of investigation and a tribunal is that the commission will conduct its investigation in private. The other significant feature is that the witnesses will make their application for fees at the end of the investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">The legislation underpinning commissions of investigation is designed to provide a cost effective and speedy response where situations arise and require detailed and focused investigation. It gives the State and the Oireachtas a much more flexible investigation mechanism which focuses on taking evidence in private and may ultimately lead to the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry. It is believed it will be much quicker, speedier, less cumbersome and less costly on the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_123">It would not be difficult to be quicker in this case. Is it true that the cost so far is more than €22.5 million? For a tribunal that has sat for eight years and five months, that amounts to just under €3 million per year. Has the Taoiseach a firm conviction that this tribunal will definitely not exceed the new extension date of the end of June 2006? Is that a definite date or another target date for the ending of the tribunal? Given that the perception is that the tribunals are insulating the body politic from even discussing, as we have discovered in the House, many of the details or the ramifications or the evidence, is it not the case that the courts should be let deal with issues of misdemeanours and——</p>

            <p eId="para_127">Deputy Sargent stated the total cost amounts to €22.5 million. Does that include all third party costs to date? Am I to understand from what the Taoiseach is saying that the commitment to reduce the fees from 11 January 2006 has not been enforced but that he still anticipates that the tribunal will finish its work by the end of June? Is he saying that if it continues beyond June, the commitment to reduce the fees will still not be enforced?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_59">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_128">The costs to date amount to €22.5 million. The tribunal received an extension, which was deemed reasonable based on work it had to do in addition to that on its existing schedule. A case was made to the relevant Department and the Attorney General in this regard and thus the timeframe was extended to the end of June. If the work is not completed at the end of June, the tribunal legislation must be passed because it gives the State the power to amend the fees schedule. That would have to be done first because we do not have the statutory power.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">I understand the tribunal hopes to be finished in public session by summer, after which its report is to be presented. As I said previously, it was expected that the tribunal would complete its work towards the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">On Deputy Rabbitte's question whether the sum of €22.5 million includes third party costs, he raised that issue previously. To the best of knowledge, when I checked the figure I noted it did not cover any of those costs. The costs are based on the fees to date. I am subject to correction, but I understand the third party decisions have not been made in the case of this tribunal so any costs granted in the case of third parties will be in addition to the figures I have put on the record.</p>

            <p eId="para_137">Forty-five staff currently serving in my Department have applied through the central applications facility to relocate under the decentralisation programme.

These arrangements include the phased redeployment of some of the remaining staff to the areas of the Department most affected by decentralisation and the provision of training and job profiles or work manuals to new staff, as appropriate. That almost 22% of the staff of the Department have opted to relocate outside Dublin shows the underlying decision to initiate a comprehensive decentralisation programme was correct.</p>

            <p eId="para_161">That is what will happen. Officials in the Department of the Taoiseach are transferring to other Departments, in Dublin or elsewhere, which are to be decentralised. They are doing that because it is the only way they can position themselves for decentralisation, and that is fair enough. The percentage of staff at each grade in the Department of the Taoiseach to have applied is as follows. Some 28% of staff at assistant principal level have applied, as have 17% of staff at higher executive officer level, 53% of staff at administrative officer level, 38% of staff at executive officer level, 14% of staff at staff officer level and 19% of staff at clerical officer level. That is happening across Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">While it will take time to go through the system and we will not complete the process in three years, it is patently obvious that there is a demand among people in the Civil Service to move to other locations. It will take time for that to happen because new sites have to be acquired and offices have to be built, and all that is being done. Some 45 officials in the Department of the Taoiseach, or 22% of the total, have put themselves on the list so that they can ultimately be decentralised.</p>

What happens before the next general election is relevant to the decentralisation process. The public service is non-political. I was Minister for Finance in the early 1990s when the Government last implemented a decentralisation programme. It was an ambitious programme involving thousands of people. People claimed that it would never happen and that it would not work, but it worked perfectly, even though it took longer than we thought. Industrial relations must be taken into account and these issues must be negotiated. Everyone knows these offices now work successfully and that the services provided are top class. The same will happen with this programme. It takes time to work and it cannot be done other than by negotiation and preparation. Locating sites and designs will take time. We have the support of the public servants and, in particular, the civil servants on this issue.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
        the assumptions and methodology underpinning his estimate of the increase in revenue from capital taxes in 2006 (details supplied).
        [8219/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_91">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_171">The assumptions underpinning the forecasts for capital taxes are based on the economic growth estimates in the stability programme update, which is published on budget day. These estimates include GNP growth forecasts, projected changes in consumer prices and developments in the construction sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_172">The methodology for forecasting receipts from capital taxes in 2006 first required my Department to estimate the outturns for the base year, in this case 2005. These projected outturns were then adjusted to take account of known once-off factors, both negative and positive, likely to impact on the yield in 2006. An example would be the discontinuance in 2006 of the bank levy, the receipts from which come under stamp duties. The figures were then refined to take account of the impact of budget measures. These various steps provide the base upon which the 2006 forecasts were built.</p>
            <p eId="para_173">The base is then inflated for projected economic developments in 2006. In the case of capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax, estimated growth is driven by the forecast change in nominal GNP and in the consumer price index, CPI, respectively. For stamp duties, since the bulk of the yield is from transactions in residential and non-residential property, the forecast for 2006 is largely based on estimated volume and price growth in the residential and non-residential property sectors. The methodologies used continue to be developed and my Department continually reviews any available international and domestic developments in forecasting methodologies to improve our approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_174">Capital tax receipts are always hard to forecast as they tend to reflect movements in property markets and once-off decisions by buyers and investors. With this in mind, my Department's estimates for revenues in 2006 from capital taxes are as follows: capital gains tax —€2,035 million, capital acquisitions tax —€260 million and stamp duty —€2,685 million. The capital gains tax estimate represents an increase of 3.8% and the capital acquisitions tax estimate an increase of 4.4% on the respective outturns for these taxes in 2005. The stamp duty estimate represents a decrease of 1.5% on the outturn for stamp duties in 2005 but this largely reflects the non-renewal of the bank levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_175">The estimates for all three taxes assume a lower rate of growth in revenues from these sources this year than the significant increases experienced last year. They assume, however, a reasonably buoyant market this year, both residential and commercial.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_92">
            <from>Mr. Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_176">If one looks back over the past three years of the Minister's forecasts in respect of capital taxes, the aggregate increase he forecast in his Budget Statement was €40 million but the actual increase was €2,975 million. He was 7,440% out in his projection of the increase in capital taxes over the three years. That is a truly extraordinary deviation between forecast and actuality. To suggest, as the Minister does, that he is using best international practice to underpin these forecasts reflects poorly on best international practice which, I suspect, was not so far out.</p>
            <p eId="para_177">Almost the entire overrun on tax is from the capital tax area in the past three years. The implication of this wrong estimation is that ordinary taxpayers are paying far more than the Dáil approved under the budget. It also means that the glowing claims the Minister makes at the end of each financial year that his figures have come in ahead of target have largely nothing to do with his management but are due to the people who are stumping up more and more money, particularly in stamp duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_178">Does the Minister believe that the forecasts, which were 7,440% wrong, could conceivably be treated as best practice? Is there not a need for the Department's officials to go back to the various experts and re-examine how these yields are being estimated? It is putting a huge extra burden — a sum of €3,000 million over three years — on ordinary taxpayers.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_93" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_179">It is not putting a burden on ordinary taxpayers but is ensuring that capital taxes, given that there are low rates of income tax, are making a far better contribution than we expected. Sustained buoyancy in the property market in 2005, which is behind the excess yields in stamp duties, and capital gains taxes defied expectations. The Department of Finance, in common with most other commentators, including the Central Bank and the ESRI, had expected a cooling off in the property market in 2005 but it did not occur. In the circumstances, there was no real basis in December 2004 for projecting increases of more than 30% in these taxes, which took place in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">The big four taxes — VAT, income tax, corporation tax and excise duties — represented close to 90% of all targeted tax revenues in 2005 and accounted for 87% of tax revenues collected. Excluding the excess from the Revenue Commissioners' main special investigations, these tax headings together came within less than 1% of target and accounted for approximately 13% of the total excess in tax revenues in 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_182">No. In contrast, the relatively smaller tax headings, which are the subject of the question, that is, capital taxes, stamp duties and customs, represented about 10% of targeted revenues in 2005 and they accounted for 13% of tax revenues collected. The excesses in these tax headings account for 70% of the total excess in tax revenues in 2005, due mainly to the continuing strength of the property market. We expected 90% of our tax revenue from the big four taxes but got 87%.</p>

        <b>Ms Burton</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance,</b>
         further to Exchequer returns for 2005, the reason for the very significant differences between the forecasts given on budget day for public spending and the Exchequer deficit; the way in which the Government apparently underspent in the region of €564 million in the final three weeks of 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
        [8065/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_120" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_208">Estimated end year total gross spending by Departments was approximately €45.1 billion in 2005, an increase of €3.9 billion or 9.5% over 2004. The end year outturn for gross spending by Departments was €225 million less than the original 2005 estimate adjusted to take account of certain Health Service Executive spending.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">The increase in spending in 2005 over 2004 represented the costs of very significant improvements in public expenditure and I will mention just a few of these. The social welfare budget day package I announced in December 2004 cost in excess of €800 million, for instance, old age pensioners got an increase of €12 per week from January 2005. There was additional and better services in the education sector, where spending increased by €570 million or 9%, additional and better services in the health sector where the increase in spending was in excess of €1 billion and additional spending on ODA which went up by 15% over 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_210">These and other significant improvements in public expenditure are pitched across the spectrum of public services. I am satisfied that this was an appropriate increase. Equally, I am satisfied that the additional €1.4 billion being allocated to social welfare spending in 2006, the additional €1.3 billion in health spending and additional spending in many other areas is warranted and that it is appropriate for the Government to share the fruits of growth by reinvesting in the social and economic needs of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_211">As to variations in any given period between spending costs and outturns, these are nothing new. Estimates produced at any time for gross expenditure are dependent on the level of factors, such as take-up on demand-led schemes and the timing of bills received by suppliers and contractors. In addition, the level of receipts, which are reflected in net expenditure, cannot be predicted with certainty as they can be affected by timing of payments submitted by employers for PRSI and health contributions. Similar timing issues affect many other headings, such as European receipts. The simple fact is that if payments are received earlier than expected and if payments are delayed or demand for schemes lower than anticipated or if receipts are higher, this results in lower spending. The relevant Ministers will be able to give the details for each Vote to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_212">Turning to the 2005 Exchequer balance, this showed an outturn deficit of €499 million compared to an original budget day target deficit of €2,988 million. This improved outturn was partly driven by lower than expected expenditure but was primarily due to higher than anticipated tax receipts during the year. Tax revenues for 2005 were €1.75 billion above the level targeted on budget day 2005. The improvement was due to a number of factors, including Revenue Commissioners special investigations, buoyancy in the property market, strong employment growth and the strong performance of the economy in general. I am sure the Deputy would agree that this positive budgetary performance is a welcome development.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_121">
            <from>Ms Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_213">On Estimates day in November the Minister for Finance stated that the targets for spending were broadly on course and on budget day, 7 December, he stated that there would be €92 million in unspent balances on current spending, which is a significant jump on the position in previous years. However, by 31 December that figure of €92 million had jumped to an underspend of €564 million on current spending.</p>
            <p eId="para_214">There are only two possible explanations for this. Either officials in the Department of Finance cannot add, which I refuse to believe, or an election war chest is being built up so the Minister can distribute largesse during the period before the election. As with the actions of the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy, in the run-up to the 2002 general election, that was good for Fianna Fáil but it was not good for our economy. Given the trolley crisis, the lack of nurses and all that we know about underspending and demands for services, the Minister is telling people that he underspent by €564 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_215">I would like the Minister to comment on a further consequence. He stated that the budget increase in spending for this year was approximately 11.9%. Given the adjusted figures which he introduced on 31 December, the estimated increase in spending this year will be approximately 13.8%, which points to a pre-election spending splurge. Will the Minister explain how we makes sense of this chopping and changing with regard to the figures?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_122" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_216">If there is any chopping and changing, I have just heard it from the Deputy. On the one hand she accuses me of underspending in one year and, on the other, she tells me I am spending too much in the next year. The bottom line is that last year the total Exchequer spend was €35.467 billion. There was an underspend of €225 million, when all the headings are taken into account, as well as a €300 million increase in receipts. Therefore, there was not a €564 million underspend.</p>
            <p eId="para_217">The issue with regard to the final Exchequer balance at the end of the year, as I explained in the main body of my reply, is that the variations between spending costs and outturn depend on the final take-up of demand-led schemes, the timing of bills received by suppliers and contractors and the level of receipts, which are reflected in net expenditure and which cannot be predicted with certainty. The basis of the end of October figures for the Estimates requires the following two months data to finalise the figures for any given financial year.</p>
            <p eId="para_218">I emphasise that the level of spend is such, at almost €35.5 billion, that the variation is quite small as a percentage of overall spend. It is based on calculating the balances at the end of the year and depends on what cheques have issued and what bills have been paid before 31 December, all of which must be finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_219">Total gross expenditure by the Department was approximately €45.1 billion last year, which is an increase of 9.5%. The allocations for health and other areas represented record increases, including an increase of 10% for health. All the changes we have seen with regard to the HSE and otherwise have ensured that we are in the business of transforming and transitioning health expenditure from the health boards to the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_220">The total spend is as I have indicated. It is not made on the basis of building up war chests or any other conspiracy theory. It is simply a matter of explaining the spend at the end of the year, as was done in other years, and making sure that we go forward to meet the requirements of the situation and implement the spending we envisage for this year, which will be in the priority areas of health, education and social welfare, which received record increases. I defend that spending. If the Labour Party believes we spent too little last year and are spending too much this year, we will have to wait to hear what the spinning top will say at the end of this year to know what its view is at that time.</p>

I noted when that information emerged that the Opposition found it depressing news.</p>

        <b>Mr. Boyle</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
        his plans to review and amend the Credit Union Act 1997 to lift the current operating restrictions being encountered by the Irish League of Credit Unions.
        [8067/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_128" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_227">The Credit Union Act 1997 provides the legal framework for the regulation of credit unions. The Act was designed to provide the credit union movement with a regulatory structure that reflected and promoted the particular ethos and philosophy of the credit union movement, its strong tradition of volunteer service and the core objective of providing opportunities for saving and lending for members of credit unions. In the context of this legislative framework, the Registrar of Credit Unions, within the Office of the Financial Regulator, is responsible for the operation of the regulatory and supervisory regime for credit unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_228">The Credit Union Act has provided the legal and regulatory framework within which the credit union movement in Ireland has continued to grow and develop over recent years. The assets of credit unions, largely comprising members' savings, have increased to €11.5 billion. This highlights the continued success of credit unions in meeting the financial needs of local communities and occupational groups falling within the common bond.</p>
            <p eId="para_229">The rules-based approach to the regulation embodied in the Credit Union Act has served the credit union movement well by providing clarity and certainty to individual credit unions, their directors and members. It has helped support the continued stability of the credit union movement and safeguard the members' savings during a period of rapid growth. The Act provides some discretion to the Registrar of Credit Unions to issue regulatory directions to individual credit unions in these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">As Minister of Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions in light of the current state of development, capacity and capabilities of credit unions as a whole. A range of issues arising in that context, including savings protection, investment rules and proposed legislative and regulatory changes, is under examination by my Department with the assistance of the Registrar of Credit Unions and is the subject of consultations with the representative bodies for credit unions. I assure the Deputy that these issues will be assessed on their own merits with a view to establishing an appropriate balance in the regulation of credit unions between the need to facilitate credit unions in adapting to the changes taking place in Irish society and ensuring the stability and financial sustainability of credit unions and the safeguarding of the very significant savings entrusted to them by their members.</p>
            <p eId="para_231">My decisions in these matters will be based on the advice and information provided by the Registrar of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Advisory Committee — the statutory advisory body on credit union matters — and the credit union movement itself.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_129">
            <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
            <p eId="para_232">Does the Minister feel that after nine years, the Credit Union Act 1997 is badly in need of reform given that significant problems have arisen particularly regarding the asset to loan ratio of credit unions, which at the time of the introduction of the Act was 2:3 and is now approximately half of the asset base of credit unions? Further difficulties arise in terms of the ability to put money on deposit with credit unions as opposed to holding shares, given that the current limit of €26,000 set by the 1997 Act puts credit unions at a severe disadvantage particularly with the maturation of the special saving investment accounts. A limit of closer to €100,000 would be more appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_233">The restrictions on investments as a result of the Credit Union Act mean that many credit unions now have debt capital and are forced to invest in a very restrained way which yields little return. Would the Minister agree that credit unions should be free to invest in the same way as other financial institutions and in the same way that the National Pension Reserve Fund is allowed to invest particularly regarding equities? Can the Minister confirm that the only legislative proposals on the table at the moment emanate from the Financial Regulator regarding changing the terms of the savings protection scheme for credit unions, which will threaten the ability of credit unions to operate on an all-island basis because of their membership of credit unions in Northern Ireland?</p>
            <p eId="para_234">The Minister for Finance is obliged to make new legislative proposals for credit unions owing to the current fraught relationship between credit unions and the regulator for credit unions because, as many of us feared at the passing of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act, having the regulator for credit unions included within the Office of the Financial Regulator has compromised the ability of credit unions to be treated in a distinct way. This is especially true now, nine years after the introduction of the Credit Union Act.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_130" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_235">A number of general points need to be made in response to the Deputy's questions. Significant funds are held in the credit unions and we all agree that a regulatory framework is required to deal with them. When we consider the investment issues for credit unions and how we can proceed, in the light of the high proportion of credit union assets now invested, the registrar has highlighted that under the current investment rules credit unions are not precluded from taking on inappropriate levels of risk. The registrar made proposals in November 2005 for a new investment framework to protect and safeguard the risk profile for credit unions and ensure that members' savings continue to be safeguarded.</p>
            <p eId="para_236">The registrar is consulting the representative bodies for credit unions with a view to securing an agreed approach to the measures and to the implementation of the proposed new investment framework. Notwithstanding the continuing discussions regarding certain details of the new rules, there is a broad consensus that a tightening up of investment rules is required, taking into account the need for credit unions to generate a reasonable return on their investments. My intention is, therefore, to submit both the registrar's proposals for the new investment framework and the league's proposals for regulatory and legal changes to the Credit Union Advisory Committee, which is the statutory advisory body for credit unions under the Credit Union Act, at an early date for its views in order to inform my decision on the next steps required.</p>
            <p eId="para_237">In addressing these matters my priorities will remain the need to ensure the interests of members of credit unions are protected and that the regulatory system operates effectively. This will underpin the continued stability and financial sustainability of the credit union movement and provide a framework which supports the continued growth and development of the movement.</p>
            <p eId="para_238">The legal framework for credit unions has worked well and has met the needs of the credit union movement to date. This is not to say that the Credit Union Act is perfect and is not in need of some amendment. However, the legislation has enabled the movement to respond to the changing environment and the changing financial needs of its members, by introducing a wider range of savings products, insurance products, foreign exchange etc. The ability of the movement to respond to SSIAs and to take on board a significant chunk of this market is also an indicator that the framework works and is adaptable and reasonably responsive to the movement's needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_239">A discourse is ongoing and we will refer all those matters to the Credit Union Advisory Committee and take our next steps from there.</p>

            <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
            <p eId="para_240">Would the Minister not accept that the tightening of regulations in investment to which he referred is putting credit unions at a competitive disadvantage and if applied directly now credit unions would lose €60 million in a given year? While the Minister might need to reply to this by letter, I ask him to reply on an itemised basis to the concerns I raised in my question.</p>

One must balance the question of what is prudential, what is the right allocation of risk, what is the right risk to take on, given the nature of the institutions concerned and the amounts of money involved while at the same time being as flexible and responsible as one can be with regard to some of their requirements. It is important that balance be achieved. It is not simply a question of whether one accedes to certain requests without taking into account other considerations, nor is it expected that I would do so. However, a process is in place which could involve further future amendments and changes including those the Deputy has specifically mentioned regarding the ILCU submissions that have been made. However, those must be taken in the context of a series of considerations and not taken in isolation.</p>

        <b>Ms Burton</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
        the steps the Revenue Commissioners are taking to deal with the problem of bogus subcontractor and agency worker phenomenon in the construction sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
        [8066/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_136" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_247">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that establishing employee or subcontractor status is one of the areas they specifically concentrate on in their monitoring of tax compliance in the construction sector. On an ongoing basis, Revenue auditors, based on risk assessment, audit the books and records of a considerable number of contractors and subcontractors. The matter of employee to subcontractor status is always examined as a routine part of such audits.</p>
            <p eId="para_248">In this regard, I am informed that Revenue does not accept at face value assertions as to subcontractor or independent agent status. The true nature of the relationship between the parties is looked at having regard to factors such as the degree of control, obligation, integration or exclusivity involved in the relationship. These factors are set out in the code of practice in determining employment status that was published by Revenue with the assistance of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_249">During 2006, Revenue is devoting a quarter of its audit and compliance resource to policing building-related sectors. As part of this national project, the issue of misclassification of building operatives as self-employed will continue to be actively dealt with. Revenue also continues to meet industry representatives and trade unions to ensure compliance in this area and to help the industry get the status of their workers right. Ongoing improvements to Revenue's computer system used to monitor relevant contracts tax will also assist in targeting cases of likely misclassification of employees as subcontractors.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_137">
            <from>Ms Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_250">Is the Minister concerned at the cost to compliant taxpayers including compliant building firms, of using the sub-contracting system? Would he agree that in some years it is possible that up to €400 million of taxation has been underpaid by the construction industry, which includes building, forestry and the meat industry? The Minister knows that for 18 months it was not possible for officers of the Revenue to go on site and I ask him who was responsible. When the health and safety legislation was introduced the tax inspectors did not have the boots or overalls and in particular did not have the training to safe-pass standard, which is required by anyone on a construction site regardless of whether they are construction workers or Revenue workers hoping to make checks.</p>
            <p eId="para_251">Is the Minister concerned about the loss that would arise in relation to young building industry workers who, despite paying tax at 35% and being told they are compliant for tax purposes, have no PRSI cover in the event of an accident and for whom, consequently, if they were to end up badly injured, the cost would fall back on to the State? We have a booming construction industry, but that is no excuse for the Minister's complacency in allowing rogue players in the industry to get away with significant financial scams to avoid the payment of their proper tax.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_138" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_252">There is no complacency on my part or on the part of the Revenue Commissioners. The Finance Bill 2006 proposes a number of changes in relation to the legislation governing the administration of relevant contracts tax aimed at tightening control and discouraging fraud. First, the Bill provides a statutory basis for the limit that the Revenue currently applies administratively on the amount of gross payments that a principal contractor can pay to a subcontractor on foot of a relevant payments card. Second, the Bill contains provision to allow Revenue to refuse a certificate of authorisation to an applicant where a person connected to the applicant does not meet the compliance requirements of RCT legislation as regards payment of tax, making of returns and keeping of records. Third, the Bill provides for the Revenue to take into account an applicant's likely future tax compliance in determining whether a C2 should be issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_253">Revenue has a continuous history of paying attention to the misclassification of building operatives as self-employed contractors. In 2004 Revenue devoted over 18.5% of audit programme activity to the industry and carried out 3,036 audits across all main programmes, out of a total of 16,321 audits. These audits yielded approximately €57 million which, out of a total audit yield of €549.6 million, amounts to approximately 10% of the total audit yield recovered that year. Approximately 45% of the audits were nil yielding, but that figure is not out of line with the percentage of nil-yielding audits across all programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_254">The focus on construction continued in 2005 with up to 20% of audit and compliance interventions being targeted on the construction sector. Up to the end of October 2005, the more than 4,400 compliance interventions that Revenue carried out in the sector yielded in excess of €73 million. Obviously, that total will rise when the annual figures are available.</p>
            <p eId="para_255">The substantial increase in the level of Revenue's construction industry activities was enhanced in 2005 by a number of new special compliance initiatives. For example, in the east and south-east region significant audit resources were devoted to a special investigation of construction industry projects in the region. As part of this, in the first six months of 2005 the status of 500 subcontractors was examined. It was found that only three subcontractors should properly have been classified as employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_256">As I said, we have undertaken an in-depth review and evaluation of the risks in the sector. A comprehensive action plan has been agreed by Revenue's management advisory committee to implement some technological and administrative changes and legislative proposals. These developments, together with the increased resources targeting the construction industry, will greatly increase tax compliance in the sector. Revenue will continue to refine risk evaluation and further target resources in the light of emerging results and insights from the 2005-06 results.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_140" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_258">As I said, in what I thought was quite an informative reply, audits of the construction sector in 2004 yielded €57 million, or 10% of the total audit yield. Nearly 20% of the audit programme was devoted to the sector. The yield for 2005 up to October was €73 million. An in-depth investigation on projects in the east and south-east region showed three persons out of 500 were misclassified as subcontractors.</p>
            <p eId="para_259">Data from the Central Statistics Office indicate that in the year to the third quarter of 2005 employment in the construction sector increased from an estimated 221,700 to 252,100, while the numbers of self-employed are estimated to have increased from 56,200 to 57,300. In other words, the increase in overall employment in the sector seems to have been in the employee rather than self-employment category.</p>

        if there is an appeal mechanism in place for persons who have a property designated under the town renewal scheme for refurbishment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_141" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_261">The actual selection and designation process for areas to be designated under the town renewal scheme is a matter primarily for local authorities and an independent expert advisory panel set up by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I understand that in accordance with the Town Renewal Act 2000 and the 1999 Guidelines on the Town Renewal Scheme, the designation of sites is decided in the context of town renewal plans. It is for the relevant county council to prepare and submit such plans, including proposals on the designation of specific sites for tax incentives, in accordance with the appropriate criteria as outlined in the scheme guidelines. These plans are assessed by the independent expert advisory panel, which makes recommendations to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the areas to be designated and the appropriateness of the categories of relief that should apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_262">The expert panel is confined by the Town Renewal Act 2000 to examining the specific proposals put forward by local authorities in their town renewal plans. The expert panel on town renewal exercises an independent role in assessing the plans submitted and in making recommendations on the sites to be designated in the context of the plans submitted by the various county councils. The recommendations made by the panel are accepted in full and designations are implemented on that basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_263">Given that the sites selected for designation by county councils, examined by the expert panel and subsequently approved for designation follow a very detailed, structured and well thought out process, it was not seen as necessary to establish an appeal process when the procedural arrangements for designation were put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_264">I have come across a few cases in which, when the final application was being made to have the buildings designated for refurbishment, the architect made a judgment call on behalf of the individual property owner that it was not possible to refurbish the property and that it would have to be demolished. Some of these properties might have had some new build in addition to the refurbishment. Is there any appeal mechanism for such designations? In addition — if the Minister cannot answer this, that is fair enough — will the Minister clarify whether an appeals mechanism existed under the old urban renewal scheme that has been scaled down?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_143" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_265">The only way in which I may be able to help the Deputy is to clarify that section 372AB of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that the Minister for Finance can revoke or amend an order. To date, amendments have been made to three designation orders, two of which were for the town renewal scheme and the third of which was for the urban renewal scheme. All the amendments related to mapping or transposition errors that resulted in the expert panel's recommendations not being fully reflected in the signed orders. The errors did not come to light until after the orders were made. In no case was an amendment made on the basis of a request by developers, local authorities or site owners for changes to a designation because the type of designation did not match their planned project for the site. For example, if part of a site was excluded on a map in the original order, the amendment process could be used. However, if all the technical details were in order but the developer simply preferred to go for new build rather than refurbish the existing property, there is no procedure by which the designation could be appealed. Only if a detail has been excluded in error can an amendment be introduced under this process, as has happened in three cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_267">Under the decentralisation programme announced by Government in December 2003 up to 131 staff of my Department are due to decentralise to Tullamore from July 2006 and 33 staff are due to decentralise to Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_268">The number of staff in my Department who have chosen to move to Tullamore within the decentralising business units is ten. A further nine staff from my Department have chosen to move, six staff have been recruited, ten staff have been appointed on promotion and a further 49 staff have already transferred at their existing grade from other Departments, giving a total of 84 persons in place. In addition, a further 19 people who have accepted offers at their existing grade are in the process of being transferred to my Department in the coming weeks.

            <p eId="para_269">The number of staff in my Department who have chosen to move to Kildare within the decentralising business units is three. A further ten staff have been appointed on promotion. The Deputy should be aware that these figures are subject to change as further assignments are made under the decentralisation programme. My Department will continue to manage staff assignments to support decentralisation with a view to minimising any additional costs which may arise in accordance through our decentralisation implementation plan. The costs associated with the provision of accommodation in Tullamore and Kildare will be met from the Office of Public Works Vote.

            <p eId="para_270">I note that the significant new information in the Minister's reply is that roughly 20% of the posts that he has already filled have been filled through promotion or new recruitment. To what extent does the Minister believe, not only in his Department but in the wider programme, that posts will be filled in that manner? How does that fit in with the statement that decentralisation would occur on a cost-neutral basis, without any new people being engaged or any increase in the numbers of staff in a given position?</p>
            <p eId="para_271">Will the Minister reflect on the previous successful decentralisation exercises we had in the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs? Ultimately, they filled between 20% and 35% of posts on promotion and between 10% and 20% through new recruitment. Even in the case of the Minister's Department, which is at the front of the house and going to a location very near Dublin, we already see a significant level of promotions and new recruitment to facilitate smooth relocation. Has the Minister estimated what it will cost to bring in extra staff and create new positions?</p>
            <p eId="para_272">What is the Government position on confining promotional competitions to those willing to decentralise? We recently saw a court case regarding FÁS in which that practice was found to be entirely in breach of existing agreements. Has the Government cause to reflect on the approach it is taking to confining promotional opportunities to those willing to move?</p>
            <p eId="para_273">What is the position regarding those who have said that they wish to remain in Dublin? As the Minister stated regarding his Department, only ten out of 131 are moving with their post. All the other 121 in his section must be relocated. What offers are being made to those 121, representing more than 90% of employees?</p>

            <p eId="para_287">The idea of decentralisation is to reduce running, property, leasing and rental costs, which are lower in the country than in the cities, particularly in Dublin, which has very high property valuations. We take all that into account, in addition to the cost of moving, to decide the overall cost of the process. There is great complexity in deciding how one transfers the necessary personnel, trains those who wish to go, relocates people, and allows them to cross from one Department to another. That programme is reported on by the implementation committee periodically. All the information in that regard is available in those reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_288">I am satisfied regarding the instances of decentralisation to which the question refers. As far as the Department of Finance is concerned, decentralisation is going very well. We hope to complete the move by July 2006, which is a realistic target. Significant progress is being made on the building. Matters are going well, and the Office of Public Works is very happy. I have outlined the position on Kildare. From the Department's perspective, regarding the issues with which we must deal, we may be the first to decentralise to Tullamore.</p>

The Minister has taken an extra 63 staff into the Department of Finance. Another 20, presumably through promotion, are working their way through. Is the Minister concerned about the loss of the 85% of staff who are not going and who are key when it comes to computers that provide a frontline public service and avoiding a repeat of the PPARS fiasco? What will the Minister do with the 85% who are staying? What will he do when he has a new set-up in Tullamore and only 15% have moved?</p>

It has produced a series of support manuals designed to provide practical advice and guidance to decentralising sections and divisions. In our Department, current indications are that it is likely to be on target at most levels in achieving the required numbers. As I have said, 103 members signed up to decentralise to Tullamore. We will be able to fill remaining posts through a combination of completing trawls from the central applications facility and competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_293">I assure the Deputy that the same level of competence will be available in Tullamore as has been the case in Dublin. I also assure her that all Civil Service staff, in my Department and every other, are equally important. The management team is very enthusiastic regarding the success of the decentralisation process so far. We have provided for retraining in the decentralisation programme, and the level of competence in Tullamore will be what one would expect. Staff have been decentralised in the Department of Education and Science for some years, and that has gone very well.</p>

            <p eId="para_294">In his original answer, the Minister did not supply the ratio of civil servants already relocated to other areas who are to go to the new centre in Tullamore.</p>
            <p eId="para_295">Previous information indicates that as many as 50% of those civil servants who wished to be moved to one or other State agency or Department have already gone to another location outside of Dublin. This appears to undermine the entire basis of the Government's relocation programme. As for the reduction of €50 million in expenditure on the decentralisation programme in this year's Estimates, is this an indication that the Government is slowing down the implementation of its entire programme? Moreover, is it indicative that 31 agencies have now been identified as lacking an end-date by which the decentralisation process should be completed?</p>

            <from>Mr. Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_296">No. The Deputy should study the decentralisation implementation committee's latest report which shows the revised arrangements which it envisages as proceeding in terms of a realistic timeframe, based on the early movers, as identified, as well as those further down the line which, with the agreement of staff, it will seek to decentralise on the basis of the programme in future years. The decentralisation implementation committee's report is probably the best reference point for explanations of the degree of progress being made. I hope by the end of this year, up to 700, 800, or perhaps 900 people will be decentralised, with a further 2,500 in the following year. The report also discusses subsequent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_297">As the Taoiseach noted in a reply during his own Question Time, all decentralisation programmes have ultimately been successfully implemented. There are issues specific to particular agencies, as well as industrial relations problems which must be dealt with in a manner consistent with the voluntary nature of this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_298">The Government is committed to doing all it can to make progress on this as quickly as possible. The allocation to the Office of Public Works this year is based on its realistic assessment of its requirements for this year, given the state of progress in respect of negotiations regarding assets, lands and buildings which it requires. Clearly, it is right and proper that if €150 million is not required this year, some of the money should go to other areas of priority expenditure about which the Opposition continually speaks, including education.</p>

            <p eId="para_299">From the perspective of the Oireachtas's efforts to scrutinise this programme, does the Minister agree that it is highly unsatisfactory that the implementation committee does not answer any questions, except perhaps on rare appearances before a committee; Ministers have not carried out any costings regarding the programme; no one has yet identified any building that will be vacated in Dublin as a result of the programme; and Members know nothing about the use which will be made of the 90% of people who have opted to remain in Dublin and not to move with their posts? Does he not accept there must be some level of political responsibility to this House for this programme and that Members are not receiving anything like a sufficient level of data? If this turns out to be like the PPARs project and we are asked what actions we took when it went wrong, we would not be able to say that we got the information and were able to oversee it. This is not a satisfactory way to run a railway. These are important decisions with major implications for the public service and we need more political accountability within the House for what is happening.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_332">The events of last Saturday in the city of Dublin were unprecedented. The consequences could not have been foreseen and the extent of those consequences would have been difficult to anticipate. I condemn, in the strongest possible fashion, the antics of the thugs, hooligans and neo-nationalists who disrupted life in the city on a normal Saturday. They terrorised citizens and put the lives of members of the Garda Síochána at risk. The violence on Saturday was the action of vicious thugs. It was premeditated and was well planned. It was an attack not only on the police force, but on free speech, on democracy, on society and on the citizens of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">It was not an orchestrated attack by football hooligans alone. They would not be in a position to organise it on such a scale. There is now significant evidence available that this riot was premeditated, was well planned in advance and that information to this effect was creeping into the public domain. I have spoken to witnesses who saw a van with a number of men who were arrested near Fleet Street with baseball bats and hurleys. There have been numerous reports of people in possession of billiard balls, golf balls, lump hammers and petrol bombs. Respected journalists have written about people with mobile telephones who directed incidents and issued instructions within this riot. There have been reports of boxes of glass bottles stashed on streets near O'Connell Street for use during this riot.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">This level of premeditation is in stark contrast to the low key approach the Government and senior Garda management appear to have adopted in respect of this march, which was a freedom of speech category march. The result was that people who went about their business on Saturday afternoon in the city were simply terrorised. Pictures akin to those from Beirut, Belfast or Baghdad flashed around the world and the front-line gardaí, in their ordinary uniforms, were obliged to face down those thugs and hoodlums. They were left unprotected and were clearly in danger of losing their lives. This is not good enough. Their bravery and courage, while being obliged to stand out and while being left out in such a situation must be commended by everyone in this House. Those innocent people and all the gardaí involved deserve a full explanation as to how these series of provocative and aggressive incidents occurred. Does the Taoiseach accept that the action and the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and senior Garda management, in adopting a low key approach to this unprecedented loyalist march on O'Connell Street was flawed? Does the Taoiseach accept there was a level of complacency in assuming that the peace process was accepted by everyone within this State? Obviously, criminality and lawlessness among some in the so-called republican movement have not disappeared for good. Why was only one riot squad, instead of three or four in place? Why did it take so long to deploy the lone Garda helicopter? How can Members be sure this sort of flawed decision making will not happen again?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_197">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_335">As I said outside the House, I wholeheartedly condemn the disgraceful scenes of naked violence visited on the people of Dublin and on the Garda by a very unrepresentative minority last Saturday. It is already clear this was an attempt by a small sectarian minority to deny others the right to express their views freely and in a peaceful manner. Let us be clear, these were the motivations of a group of very vicious people who went out on a Saturday morning, not to watch a football match or do their shopping in town but with serious intent.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I salute the bravery of the men and women of the Garda Síochána. The gardaí were sorely provoked on Saturday and responded professionally to outrageous attacks upon them motivated by unreasoning hatred and malice towards the lawful authority of our democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Later the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will deal comprehensively with all the matters surrounding the violent events. I will confine myself to a few brief comments. The Garda had extensive consultations over the past two months plus with the Northern Ireland based organisation Families Acting for Innocent Relatives, FAIR, who wished to march to highlight the feelings of victims of IRA violence. They contacted the Garda prior to Christmas regarding their intention. When the intentions of FAIR became known a number of dissident republican organisations, particularly Republican Sinn Féin, called for a counter demonstration. All the credible intelligence information available to the Garda indicated that any counter protests on the day would be small and peaceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The Garda held a series of meetings with representatives of FAIR as to the policing of the parade and, arising from those discussions and taking account of the intelligence assessment that the Garda make into all marches and protests, which seem to occur in O'Connell Street every week, a comprehensive policing plan was put in place by the Garda. This involved close liaison with Dublin City Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The purpose of that plan was to permit the parade to go ahead and allow the police to counter any demonstration. The objective was to employ a proportionate police presence that would ensure public safety, and not to over react with too large a force, and at the same time not to create too much tension. As it happened, approximately 350 people wanted to march. There were approximately 350 gardaí, including gardaí on stand-by. They were quickly able to call on approximately another 150. While they thought they were dealing with a crowd of between 50 and 70, it turned out to be several hundred when they appeared out of pubs and lanes at the back of both sides of O'Connell Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Unfortunately, that could not be foreseen. It was, in fact, thuggish behaviour by a relatively small number of persons, some of whom had been drinking in the immediate environs of O'Connell Street. These people engaged in an orgy of violence against gardaí and property, against journalists and against anybody who got in their way. These were not the only targets. There was a very sinister development, with blatant attacks on clearly identifiable members of the media and, as reported today, on shopkeepers and others in the general area of town in the afternoon as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I emphasise that while the Garda was aware of the proposed protest by dissident republican groups, there was no specific information or intelligence available to it to suggest that violence on the scale witnessed was planned. That was a complete surprise. On the day a decision was taken not to let the parade as planned proceed but to allow a demonstration outside of this House, which did take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The Garda investigation into the violence, vandalism and looting is continuing. A preliminary report was presented to Cabinet — the Minister will give that later — and the more detailed report will be compiled over the immediate period as the Garda conduct an assessment by all of those people involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">A decision was made on how to handle the march. It involved a very large number of gardaí. I am familiar with O'Connell Street marches. Normally, one or two dozen people parade. There have been large marches already this year. There have been marches and protests about different issues. There is no need to mention any of those; they are all known and were well made. Some of them were high profile and some of them were very low profile, but 350 gardaí is a large number for these marches.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_344">As I said previously, this was unprecedented. It had not happened before, therefore the consequences were difficult to anticipate. However, it now appears clearly evident that there was a failure to assess properly, a failure to plan properly, a failure to anticipate properly and a failure to be ready for the worst. Nobody wants a perception of our city that on a march, which has been approved, there must be a ring of steel down O'Connell Street but as this was the consequence of a political parade that had never happened before in this country, it should have been perfectly obvious that at least resources and facilities should have been made available and ready quickly to deal with unforeseen or unanticipated consequences. It is in that failure that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, must accept political responsibility for this, as the person in charge of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In that failure to anticipate, to plan and to provide resources, the Minister has failed in his duty as head of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The Taoiseach, in his radio interview on Saturday, stated that the word was out on Friday in his constituency that something like this was going to happen. We had signals from others that this was going to happen as well. On Friday the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in his speech in Waterford, gave a political lecture about the Progressive Democrats being meat in a sandwich. On Saturday, because of the failure to plan properly for this and to be ready for the worst, the front-line gardaí in ordinary uniforms facing bricks, billiard balls, stones and petrol bombs were the meat in the sandwich between democracy and anarchy. Political responsibility for that failure must rest with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">When Ireland held the EU Presidency last year, 5,000 gardaí and Army were deployed. It was a ring of steel. While I agree with the Taoiseach that one does not want pictures of the main street of the capital city every day ringed with Army and Garda, as this never happened before there should have been an anticipation that the worst might happen and that the resources to deal with it would have been readily available. In that sense, does the Taoiseach agree that the handling of this, between senior management and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was flawed? Does he accept that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must accept political responsibility as the head of his Department for this debacle, which could have turned into a conflagration on O'Connell Street in less than ten minutes? Those thugs, hooligans and neo-Nationalists of whatever so-called republican hue——</p>

          <p eId="para_349">There are always lessons learned from everything. The kind of thuggery we saw on Saturday last, and the gathering of what probably were different groups, did us harm and shamed the city and the country. There is no doubt about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">With every march the Garda, when it receives a plan, must look at all the aspects to it and the Minister will point out later the extent to which it did that. The Garda certainly did not take anything lightly. It undertook considerable planning and had many senior people involved. There was an enormous amount of meetings, including with the city council. They were concerned about the site on O'Connell Street. They had six meetings about that issue alone. They had a large number of people in the area. If the Garda and State wanted to have the march and suspected there could be trouble to the extent that occurred, I am sure the march could have taken place because 350 people were available to guard.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">In fairness to the organisation involved — Families Acting for Innocent Relatives, which numbers 350 members — the Garda put a huge number of conditions on the members about what they could do, especially regarding anything that might be seen to be provocative. They complied with the conditions and went along with every arrangement. The Garda had a number of meetings with FAIR representatives last week in Dublin and they went through all this.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The Garda checked its intelligence about what was going on. People were loosely talking about a march on the weekend and whether there would be a problem. Following Saturday's events, it became clear texts had been sent and people had been saying there could be trouble. The Garda authorities were in the best position to arrive at a view. They thought there would be a peaceful protest by a small number of people but that number swelled to hundreds. They did not think they would have to deal with hundreds of people, young, old and middle aged, ripping up pavements, boards, public lighting and everything they could get their hands on and unleashing them on top of gardaí, journalists and everybody else who got in the way. It was not seen as that. Who will ever know why a group went to so much trouble to do that against a small number of people?</p>
          <p eId="para_353">I am well used to watching demonstrations in my constituency. On the day, three superintendents, ten inspectors, 32 sergeants and more than 300 gardaí and uniformed public order personnel were on duty in the background. The Garda mounted, air support and dog units were deployed while 58 detectives were mixing with the crowd. That is not a normal Saturday afternoon in my constituency. A total of 150 additional gardaí were deployed quickly. Regularly, in another part of my constituency, 80,000 people converge and we would not get a force half that size. On Saturday 350 people were being protected against 70.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">Unfortunately, hooligans are hooligans and they did damage. It was organised in some way. We must await the full investigation but the proof it was organised is that people do not move from the Parnell monument to the far side of town in a matter of minutes unless somebody is calling the shots and orders. A small group managed to motivate other misguided hoodlums to participate in their entertainment. Whatever else, my knowledge of inner city life is that 600 or 700 people do not turn up to watch Hearts, a Scottish team, play at 11 in the morning. That was not their motivation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_355">We will have an opportunity to return to this debate in a few minutes following the Order of Business.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">I refer to a different matter that relates to weekend comments about the Omagh bombing, the single worst atrocity in the Northern Ireland Troubles, which cost the lives of 29 men, women and children. The Taoiseach will recall that in the aftermath, his Government appointed an <i>ad hoc </i>non-statutory committee to inquire into allegations that the Garda was in prior possession of information that might have helped in preventing that atrocity.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The Nally committee met and inquired in private and its report was not published. However, a copy was given to Deputy Kenny and me for immediate return. At the time I made it clear I was not convinced that the report had put an end to these allegations. I also made it clear that, whatever the purpose was in giving it to Deputy Kenny and me, I was not being brought into the circle of those who would stand over it as the last word on the matter. I said I was struck by the consistent inability of that committee to query the official Garda version of events where it differed from that of Detective Sergeant White, even where the official version contained contradictions or was unsupported by documentary evidence. I also said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_358">The report was from a committee of insiders about insiders to be read by insiders. It came from within a hermetically sealed environment. The possibility that even some of the allegations it was investigating might be even partially true would represent a collective corporate failure of massive proportions and with devastating consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">Last week the outgoing assistant chief constable of the PSNI, Sam Kincaid, together with his successor and superintendent Baxter, who headed up the inquiry into the Omagh bombings, gave an on the record briefing to the Omagh families on their findings to date. They made clear their view that both MI5 and the Garda had relevant information, which was not passed on to the RUC at the time and which, taken together, would have placed them on a much higher state of alert as far as Omagh was concerned. Their conclusions run entirely counter to the Nally report and its findings.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_361">Both Deputy Kenny and I have expressed our surprise that the Nally committee was unable to reach its findings without interviewing the Garda informant at the heart of the affair. Last week the PSNI made clear again that it still wished to interview this man, a Mr. Dixon, a car thief who stole cars on order for the Real IRA and its bombing campaign. According to <i>The Sunday Times</i>, the PSNI also placed his relationship with the Garda in an entirely different light by revealing that he had permitted gardaí to place bugs in the cars he stole for the Real IRA. I do not recall, subject to correction, that information in the Nally report.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Sir Hugh Orde will report to the British Prime Minister and the Garda Commissioner on his findings. In light of the Taoiseach's commitment, which is entirely genuinely held, that his Government would be helpful in all circumstances to the Omagh families, what is his response to the statement by the retiring assistant chief constable of the PSNI, Mr. Sam Kincaid?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_205">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_363">Deputy Rabbitte has given a factual account of what happened and when the Nally report was published. The Omagh bomb case is before the courts and any new evidence will be examined. However, it has been the view all the way through that any information given to the Garda by the security forces was acted on long before the explosions. I cannot be certain of the facts but the relevant security information was acted on long before 15 August 1998. The bomb that was in preparation at that time was intercepted. I do not say the Deputy is talking about a different issue but the information was passed to the Garda by MI5. The information was acted on and the bomb that was in preparation was intercepted. It has been my understanding that the PSNI and the chief constable do not believe the account given by Sergeant White.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The Government will do everything it can to both help the Omagh victims and to support the ongoing investigation, into which significant resources have been put by the security services, North and South, and in England. We will continue to play our part in trying to get a satisfactory conclusion on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">To be clear on the matter, if Sam Kincaid was talking about the information that was given to the Garda by MI5 — I cannot be certain that is what he was talking about — that information was acted on and the bomb that was in preparation was intercepted and dealt with.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_206">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_366">From my memory of the report, which I read carefully at the time, it is clear that the Nally report regarded Mr. Dixon as an ordinary commercial car thief who would have no intelligence of relevance to pass on. I do not know the truth of the matter. However, from my contacts in Northern Ireland, I know that the former assistant chief constable, Sam Kincaid, was and is very highly regarded and what he said is very clear. He said that his view was that both MI5 and the Garda Síochána had relevant information which was not passed on to the RUC and which, if taken together, would have placed the RUC on a much higher state of alert as far as the Omagh case was concerned. In the light of this statement, does the Taoiseach accept that the Nally report is not the final word on this matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_367">We have, for example, taken up a position across this House on the matter of the Finucane case. In condemning the inadequacy of the Finucane inquiry we have sought for the British authorities to lift the veil of secrecy from their security services intelligence on the Finucane case. In this case, we know that the Omagh families and the PSNI still have questions. The former assistant chief constable said that if he had the information from MI5 and the Garda, which he did not get, that information, taken together, would have put the RUC in a position to be on a much higher state of alert.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">This is an important development as the bomb in Omagh was the single worst atrocity in the history of the Troubles and it obliges us to examine the contention of a respected former senior policeman. If Mr. Hugh Orde is making a report to the British Prime Minister on the matter, the Government should consider and make a public statement on its response to this information.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_207">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_369">The Government will, obviously, consider all these issues. The Deputy is right that we have not got to the end of this matter. The end will come only when we get successful prosecutions against the people who perpetrated the bombing in Omagh and killed, injured and maimed so many people, affecting many families for the rest of their lives. The issue continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I have dealt with this matter over a long period and I remember the events fairly well. I will make a few points. The Nally report asked Mr. Dixon to co-operate with it, but he did not at the time. What he has done since, I cannot recall. I recall that it has been raised in the House a number of times that he tried to contact people here to put his side of the case. My recollection is that at the time the Nally report asked Mr. Dixon for his co-operation but he did not do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I do not think I have ever met Sam Kincaid, but I am sure he is a fine policeman and his record shows that. If his intelligence sources did not tell him something, I have no comment to make on that. If MI5 did not tell the PSNI about the information it had, I have no comment to make on that. Previous to that, however, long before the explosion, MI5 gave information to the Garda Síochána. The Deputy may recall there were a number of interceptions that summer and a number of incidents, including people being arrested leaving Ireland by ferry. The information the Garda got was acted on and a bomb that was in preparation was dealt with. That was hugely significant at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">I am not aware of any information, but I will check again. It appears there are two issues. The Deputy says that Sam Kincaid said his sources did not give him information and my information has always been that the information we got was acted on. I do not believe there was any other information. That was my understanding.</p>

        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_373">I note the Tánaiste apologised to victims at the publication of the Drogheda hospital report and I welcome that. Will the Taoiseach apologise on behalf of the Government to the trauma experienced by victims of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital which has been documented comprehensively through the publication of the Judge Harding Clarke report?</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Does the Taoiseach accept that this report raises fundamental questions for the Government? Is it not shocking and bizarre that 20 times the national average of caesarian peripartum hysterectomies continued to be performed in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda for 25 years before any professional raised a concern? Is it not a terrible reflection on the State that it took a midwife who had been trained outside the State to blow the whistle on this saga of trauma and malpractice? Is there not a grave onus on the Government to quickly make some amends to the victims for years of failure by the State to properly inspect and regulate the medical profession and for the irreversible damage done to dozens of patients who have sought justice for many years?</p>
          <p eId="para_375">I urge the Taoiseach to indicate the Government's willingness to set up a redress board to provide crucial justice to the victims mutilated in that Drogheda hospital. Will he alleviate some of the distress of the 44 or so patients whose files have been stolen by placing the onus on the hospital to say it carried out each operation properly, rather than placing the burden of proof on the distressed patients?</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The report recommends various legislation. It calls for a wide-ranging medical practitioners Bill. This Bill was promised in 2004 and 2005 and it is on the list again for 2006. Will the Taoiseach give the publication date of that legislation? Will he also indicate whether he will take on board the need for legislation for whistleblowers. The scandal of Leas Cross would not have come out but for media reports. It is obvious we need legislation on whistleblowers.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The report makes clear that we need legislation to protect the medical records of patients in these circumstances. That legislation needs to be documented carefully so that the information will not be privy to freedom of information requests and will be kept sacrosanct for any need that may arise in the future. Will the Taoiseach act on the need for the legislation recommended in the report and particularly on the need for a redress board? Anything else will not be adequate.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_209">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_378">I express my deep regret to the women affected by the trauma and suffering as a result of the events of recent years. Since these issues came to light in 1998, they have been acted upon and have been thoroughly investigated and the Cabinet approved publication of the reports of today. I commend the work that has gone into the preparation of this report. It is a good job and an excellent bringing together of an enormous amount of facts and reports. The findings and recommendations will be examined immediately and in great detail by the Department of Health and Children in consultation with the Health Service Executive and the various professional regulatory bodies involved in quality assurance in the hospital service. This affects a range of groups and that will happen. The Tánaiste will meet Patient Focus tomorrow and discuss the other issues mentioned by Deputy Sargent. She will discuss matters with the support groups and many of the former patients who attended at Drogheda hospital. We promised we would do that as soon as the report was published and it is there that those matters should be discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">With regard to legislation, the report's findings and recommendations will be dealt with and will be of considerable benefit in terms of informing the approach being taken in the preparation of the medical practitioners Bill. That Bill is already well advanced but the recommendations of this report will help in its completion and will be very beneficial. It will also be beneficial in the work that is well advanced on the health information equality authority and in the current consultant contracts negotiations. It will feed into all of these issues. I assure the House, now that we have this report, that we will be able to deal with these issues and to move on as quickly as possible.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_380">I hear the Taoiseach expressing regret and I ask him to be quite specific. Does he apologise on behalf of the Government or has the Tánaiste simply apologised on her own behalf? It is very important to clarify that. What does the Taoiseach mean when he says the matter has been dealt with? I understand and appreciate the work that has gone into the investigation but does the Taoiseach accept we still have a culture in this country of consultants being viewed as gods, somewhat like priests in the 1950s? We are still dealing with the legacy of that perception. Does the Taoiseach accept that many nurses are living in deference, if not fear, of consultants and that there is a need to deal with that culture? We have had inspections, based on what is in this report, that did not inspect. The inspections were simply dealing with the training facilities and not with medical performance. We do not just have a scandal——</p>

We have victims who have suffered horrific injustice, who have a deep emotional hurt where they should have a womb. We must act. We must have a redress board and the Taoiseach has not told us if that will happen. We need to put the burden of proof on the hospital concerning the operations carried out and we need legislation. Will the Taoiseach tell us the date for the introduction of the medical practitioners Bill and the legislation dealing with records, risk management and clinical incident report forms, all of which are mentioned in the report? Can we have the dates for the legislation that is recommended and that for whistle blowers? We need an apology and a redress board if we are to have some justice here.</p>

          <p eId="para_384">We have promised throughout, over the last seven or eight years, that as soon as the report was available the Minister of the day, in this case the Tánaiste, would meet the group and discuss the issues with it. We are going to stick to that promise and will do that tomorrow. Deputy Sargent should understand and appreciate that. These matters will be discussed with Patient Focus first.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">On the findings and recommendations, while over the last number of years they have been acted upon and thoroughly investigated, now we have the complete recommendations and findings. They will be of considerable benefit in finalising the medical practitioners Bill, in the work that is well advanced on the health information equality authority Bill and in the discussions that are ongoing on the doctors' contracts and other discussions taking place with medics.

A simple motion would give all parties and individual members an opportunity to subscribe to the terms of that motion and send out a unified message from this House on behalf of the people.</p>

          <p eId="para_396">I certainly share the view that there is a need for some clear objective in terms of a motion that can be resolved by consensus of this House as I understand the issue has been raised in Westminster. It has the major potential to stall and put back much of the progress made in building tolerance and a common understanding of what the peace process needs to achieve. I ask that we focus on that for this debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_398">I have no problem with that. I think we should get a fairly simple motion. There are certain things I would like to see included in it but perhaps it should be simpler. One of the regrets about this is that about three times in my political life when I have endeavoured to deal with marches that took place in my area, the issue of by-laws always surfaced. That is something we can cover. Every time the matter comes up, everyone is against it because they do not want restrictions or regulations. People want to be able to march whenever they like. However, as soon as there is a problem, it is always the opposite. Maybe it would only complicate matters. I would like at least if political groupings would return to Dublin City Council. If we had had the by-laws that were thrown out in 2001, they might have helped. Perhaps we will just have a simple resolution today.</p>

This issue was raised by a matron in the 1980s and while her position was not taken into account, I do not think it was an issue of whistle-blowers. There was a view that the legislation would be taken on a sectoral basis. It was considered that the provision of a statutory protection on a sectoral basis might provide a better and more focused approach to dealing with the issue. It is already provided for in some legislation such as the Protection for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act, the Competition Act, the Garda Síochána Act and in health and safety legislation.

That seemed the best and most sensible approach and I believe everybody agreed with it. What will now happen is that both the HSE and the Department will examine the findings and recommendations of the excellent report and the good work that has been done and will amend, if necessary, the heads and take account of any issues that arise. The heads will then be brought forward and drafting of the legislation will commence.

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_474">Last Saturday, 300 men, women and children, all of them Northern Ireland Protestant, Unionist, people, came to Dublin with five bands to hold a peaceful procession, which was to be followed by a short rally, to express their deeply held convictions about past and present issues in Northern Ireland. This House will note that they held their procession and rally in the immediate environs of Leinster House without creating any difficulty or disorder and peacefully returned to Northern Ireland. In doing so, they exercised what is guaranteed to every citizen of this, the Irish Republic, as a matter of constitutional right under Article 40 of our Constitution, namely, the rights of citizens, subject to public order and morality, to "freely express their convictions and opinions" and to "assemble peaceably and without arms" for that purpose. The Constitution also makes express provision for the limitation of that right in the interests of preserving the public peace, the prevention of danger and nuisance to the public and to safeguard the integrity of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Under our laws, the Garda Síochána is entrusted with the duty of upholding those rights and upholding public order and the law in the manner in which they are exercised. As the House knows, the people who had come from Northern Ireland were prevented by a mob of cowardly thugs, who exhibited cowardice, criminality, viciousness and hatred in equal measure, from walking the route they had chosen.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am addressing the House in an act of political accountability on behalf of the Garda for which I have ministerial responsibility. I am laying before the House the information I have received from the Garda authorities about the preparations which were made by Garda management in advance of last Saturday. I will outline the experience of the Garda in dealing with the events which occurred in O'Connell Street and its environs on the occasion of the Families Acting for Innocent Relatives march. The FAIR organisation represents a group of people from the loyalist community in Northern Ireland, including many families which were bereaved by nationalist violence during the Northern Ireland Troubles.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I have arranged for Members to be given a written summary, prepared by my officials, of the manner in which the force carefully prepared for the demonstration. The summary, based exclusively on the extensive oral and written reports received by the Department from the Garda Commissioner over the past 48 hours, sets out how the Garda authorities managed the situation when, entirely contrary to their expectations and their formal risk assessment, significant scenes of thuggery and public disorder suddenly occurred, forcing the procession to be significantly rerouted and severely curtailed.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">It should not be forgotten that despite the extraordinary disturbances in O'Connell Street last Saturday, the Garda authorities managed to facilitate the holding of a loyalist demonstration outside Leinster House. The courage and professionalism of the Garda ensured that no harm was caused to the participants. It is a challenging task to police a democratic society and, in particular, to maintain public order in a liberal democracy. It is much more difficult to do so than to exercise the same responsibility in a country where the right to freedom of expression, free assembly and public protest is not enshrined in the constitution. In Ireland, as republicans, we extend such liberties and freedoms to allow people of every shade of opinion to express their views in public marches and demonstrations, subject only to the requirements of public order and the common good.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The Garda which is charged with security matters checked with its contacts and sources in the various strands of the Sinn Féin movement to ascertain their intentions in respect of the protest on Saturday. After it assessed the intelligence information that was available to it, it concluded that any counter-demonstration to the loyalist march would come from the Republican Sinn Féin element in the political spectrum. The information gleaned by the Garda was that Provisional Sinn Féin did not intend to mount any protest on the day and that Republican Sinn Féin intended to mount a peaceful sit-down protest involving a relatively small number of its members who would be bearing placards.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">I draw to the attention of the House that Republican Sinn Féin declined to engage in a meaningful manner with the Garda which was preparing to police the demonstration. It did not give any advance information about its intentions in carrying out a counter-protest. Its failure to co-operate was despicable and should be condemned by all shades of opinion represented in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">In light of the information available to the Garda authorities about the scale of the loyalist protest, they decided to deploy 281 members of the force to police the parade in a low-key and relatively unobtrusive fashion. They took the precaution of keeping a 67-member detachment of the public order unit discreetly in reserve in a nearby street in case events took an unexpected turn, which was the case on the day. While lessons will be learned from what subsequently took place, I want to make clear that blame for the events of last Saturday lies squarely with those who indulged in wanton violence and destruction on the streets of our capital city and those who encouraged such behaviour, directly or indirectly. I welcome Deputy Kenny's suggestion that the House should adopt a motion in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">It is to my great regret and disappointment that those who travelled from the North were not extended their rights. A small and wholly unrepresentative group of cowardly thugs did their utmost to debase this State because they could not stomach another viewpoint or bring themselves to acknowledge the existence of an alternative tradition on this island. As the Taoiseach has said, they engaged in an orgy of violence that was directed against the Garda, in direct contravention of the will of the people of this island, North and South, as endorsed overwhelmingly in the referenda on the Good Friday Agreement. Those responsible should hang their heads in shame. I hope they will be brought to book for what they have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Those who pervertedly and falsely describe themselves as republicans have once again acted contrary to the aspiration of Irish unity. We must wonder whether such people will ever comprehend the stupidity and futility of action of this nature. They unleashed hate-filled and provocative sectarian abuse on the Garda. They insulted members of the force such as the late detective garda Jerry McCabe, who died at the hands of cowardly and sectarian terrorists as he was helping to uphold our democracy. They waved the tricoloured national flag which represents peace between orange and green. What kind of Ireland do these people desire? I particularly want to record my shock and anger that the thugs attacked and injured members of the Garda who were doing their duty with courage and forbearance. On behalf of the Government, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to convey to the injured gardaí and their families my wishes for a speedy recovery and my gratitude for their courage.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">I was in regular touch with the Commissioner and his senior officers throughout the weekend, after the events under discussion transpired. I received a preliminary report on the matter yesterday, on which I briefed my Government colleagues this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I would like to make a few points before I go into further detail about the contents of the report. Most importantly, I wish to place on the record of the House the appreciation of Deputies of the work done by the Garda Síochána, which dealt in a professional manner with the difficult situation which arose contrary to its expectations and professional judgments of the risk. Its response was measured, proportionate and effective. It is easy with hindsight to suggest what might or might not have been done to avoid what transpired. The duty of the Garda was to devise and implement a careful and professional policing plan based on the information available to it, as well as on its experience and judgment. While people might say the kind of trouble that occurred was predictable or inevitable, the simple fact is that the Garda authorities thought otherwise. If they did not have that viewpoint, they would have acted differently.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The document I have made available to Members makes it clear that there was no carelessness on the part of the Garda. There is no truth in the suggestion that the force's planning was hampered by a lack of resources. That suggestion has been made recently, but it is wholly and completely untrue. The Garda authorities have told me that no credible information was available to them to suggest that trouble in the form of public disorder on a grand scale would arise on Saturday. In their professional judgment, it was neither necessary nor appropriate to create a ring of steel around the marchers. They thought such an approach would have been over-the-top, counter-productive and possibly create an atmosphere of fear and trouble. If they had considered it necessary to put a ring of steel in place, they would have advised the organisers of that. In such circumstances, the venue of the march would have been altered or the event would have been cancelled, as appropriate. Many people have been quick to criticise the Garda for a lack of preparedness. Some of them have reminded us of the old Latin saying, <i>si vis pacem, para bellum</i>, if you want peace, prepare for war.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">I do not suggest that lessons cannot be learned from what happened, because they will be learned. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, however. I can imagine the complaints which would have been made by some people if the Garda had closed down the city centre, including the shops and pubs on O'Connell Street, by sealing off the side streets, erecting barriers and making O'Connell Street a no-go zone in which the representatives of FAIR could march in isolation behind serried ranks of gardaí. That was not the intention of the event and it was not the strategy the Garda had in mind. I am satisfied that an enormous amount of preparation was made by the Garda ahead of last Saturday's demonstration. It is to be regretted that vicious opposition was encountered in the face of a reasonable and low-key law enforcement approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">As I indicated earlier, yesterday evening I met the Garda Commissioner, who was able to furnish me with a preliminary report into Saturday's events. I emphasise that it is a preliminary report. As the ramifications of the events are considered, I hope the extent to which it was organised will be determined and those responsible and their networks will be the subject of rigorous pursuit. I hope the prosecution of those involved will follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">I propose to set out some of the preliminary report's main points. I wish to make it perfectly clear that a comprehensive operational policing plan was in place prior to the weekend. The determination of subversive and thuggish elements to cause disruption should not be allowed to detract from the fact that the plan was far from being a seat-of-the-pants exercise. In advance of the day, a series of meetings was held between the relevant branches of the Garda Síochána, the parade organisers, Dublin City Council, the Health Service Executive and with various city centre trader organisations such as the Dublin City Business Association, which backed the Garda strategy. Officers were briefed in detail on how to respond to protestors and how to protect members of the public. Parnell Square and the parade route were searched in advance of the march, while arrangements were made with Dublin City Council for bins to be emptied and sealed. Six meetings were held to ensure the building works on O'Connell Street would be secured.</p>

          <p eId="para_490">In the course of the planning, all available policing methods were considered, including the use of water cannon. However, its deployment was ruled out on the basis of the information available. The PSNI possesses six water cannons which can be made available to the Garda if requested. The decision was made not to deploy them as they were not considered suitable for the occasion. I spoke to the Commissioner and he acknowledges the resources are there if he considers it a wise expenditure of money to purchase water cannons and have them on stand-by. His judgment is preferable to the judgment of most of us, and he takes the view that it would not be appropriate to use resources on such expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">A total of 348 members of an Garda Síochána were on duty in the city centre last Saturday, dedicated exclusively to the task of policing the demonstration. That is a significantly higher number than would normally be deployed for an ordinary demonstration on O'Connell Street.</p>

Plain clothes officers were involved, along with 39 members of the special detective unit. Surveillance of the scene from the air was provided by the Garda air support unit. The Garda helicopter was functioning that day, but it unfortunately developed a problem which required its withdrawal before the events on O'Connell Street took place.</p>

          <p eId="para_495">Emergency medical personnel from the ambulance service were also deployed as part of the public order unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">A threat assessment was made based on the available intelligence, including information sought from the PSNI and the long experience of Garda officers based in city centre stations in dealing with protest marches over their careers. As anticipated, around 50 Republican Sinn Féin protestors congregated at the top of O'Connell Street to protest and attempt to disrupt the march. However — this was the really unexpected element — around 200 to 300 other people suddenly massed, many from streets and public houses close by, and began to attack Garda officers with a range of missiles, including billiard balls, fireworks and smoke bombs. In the course of the rioting that followed, two petrol bombs were hurled at the gardaí. As the situation developed, a further 138 Garda officers arrived to assist, including a group of 47 members drawn from the public order unit. The decision was taken by senior gardaí on the ground that the march down O'Connell Street to Dáil Éireann would not go ahead. I commend without hesitation what was clearly the correct decision, quickly taken in difficult circumstances by senior gardaí on the spot. Arrangements were made to move the loyalist demonstrators to the environs of Leinster House. Buses transported them here without incident where they had their march with their bands and they made their speeches. They caused offence to nobody.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">I have shared with the House the gist of the Commissioner's report on the outrageous behaviour of last Saturday. Given the gravity of this situation and in order to be as expansive as possible, I have taken the unusual step of providing a synopsis of that report to Members. The Garda authorities are conducting a complete, painstaking and forensic analysis of all the evidence and material available to them. The evidence will be assembled and those responsible for the appalling behaviour on Dublin's streets last weekend will be pursued. They will face the full rigours of the law. I appeal to eyewitnesses to come forward to the Garda Síochána and to anyone with evidence, photographs or video material of the disturbances to hand it over to the Garda for examination. It is the constitutional duty of all citizens to co-operate with the Garda in its efforts to bring the perpetrators to book. I am confident the ordinary decent citizens of Dublin, who are angered by the activities of a small few, will co-operate fully with this investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">This was an attack on civil society, on civil liberty and on the very nature of a republic. Those who engaged in the wanton and mindless violence last weekend carry no mandate and their actions cannot be justified. There was no provocation. There was no behaviour by the organisers of the march to warrant what developed. The civil authorities were prepared to allow protestors stage a counter demonstration, as was their entitlement in a free society. No difficulty would have arisen from that counter demonstration on the scale anticipated by the Garda. I am sure that arising from the Garda experience, valuable lessons will be learned about the capacity of people to come from nowhere, as it were, to set upon innocent people. If the Garda had waited for the parade to start, a much more serious situation might easily have occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The authorities will cooperate with the Health and Safety Authority in any follow up appropriate to that organisation's role and competence, as is the norm in such situations. However, it must be recognised that policing decisions must be taken by Garda management in the context of the best information available and the evolving situation. Deputy Kenny made the point, in his remarks to the Taoiseach earlier, that I am politically accountable for this. I accept my political accountability, but I ask the Deputy to accept that I had no hand, act or part in the arrangements that were made for that day.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_502">It would be unusual for a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take a hands on role, or to determine the amount of resources that should be available. The question of resources was completely irrelevant to the decisions that were made on the day. The Garda Síochána had the resources of the whole force available, but made a well thought through decision that this was to be a low key demonstration, that it was not to be surrounded by a ring of steel and it was not to be conducted in a sealed off fashion, as has happened in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">There are other public events which will take place in our capital city, many of them celebratory, that may now have to be considered in the context of the experiences of the past weekend. The events themselves may be different in nature, but the Garda will not be able to ignore what transpired. It will be our priority to take whatever steps are practicable to ensure no drunken rabble ever again besmirches the good name of our capital city as it did in recent days. Once again, I condemn the wanton, mindless violence that a small few visited upon the streets of Dublin last Saturday. I want to send out a message to all those who took part in the violence. The Garda Síochána is determined that they will be pursued and brought to justice. I also want to send a message to those so-called republicans who deny the wishes of the Irish people for a lasting settlement in Northern Ireland, or who at best adopt an <i>à la carte</i> approach to constitutional rights and the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Their actions and example provide the fuel that helped to ignite naked sectarianism on the streets of Dublin for the first time in a long time. Their actions expose them and their political associates — elected and unelected — for what they are. They remind us of the danger these people constitute and strengthen our determination to consign their methods and standards to the dustbin of history. Democracy will be the winner and the people of Dublin and Ireland will not be confused about the main issue by finger-pointing in this House. They know who were to blame and that the hand of history lies on their shoulders.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">I intend to share time with Deputy Crawford.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">I am sure I speak for all Members of the House when I express my disgust at the disgraceful scenes that took place on the streets of Dublin last Saturday. This appalling behaviour on the part of a tiny but well managed gang of so-called republicans and thugs has no place in a republic. Those who believe that this parade should not be allowed to proceed are the people with the real partitionist mentality.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">I am glad this debate is being held today and that Deputy Kenny's proposal that a suitable motion is passed — I hope unanimously — by the House has been accepted by the Government. It is important that Members of the House condemn this violence, unanimously if possible. We must make it clear that those involved do not represent the Irish people and that our commitment to the reconciliation and mutual respect enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement is sincerely held.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Last Saturday's planned parade by the victims of IRA violence was a political event, one which had the approval of the Government — I approved of it too. However, the political significance of the event made it more important to ensure that it went off peacefully. This was the first loyalist parade in Dublin in living memory and the obvious implication was that there was a responsibility on the part of the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and senior Garda management to ensure that the event was adequately policed so the participants, the public and the gardaí were not put in danger. I am glad the Minister accepted his political accountability and responsibility in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Saturday's Love Ulster rally was an unprecedented event. The idea that Unionists, loyalists or Orangemen would want to parade in Dublin would not have been thought of until recently. Last Saturday, they came to Dublin and intended to march past the GPO. This was an historic occasion, without precedent in the history of the State. Obviously, the consequences of that unprecedented proposal could not be fully anticipated. This is the crucial issue. The Government and senior gardaí had to ensure the safety and security of the marchers and onlookers, and that required exceptional precautions, security measures and contingency plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">The Minister used the phrase <i>si vis pacem, para bellum</i>— if one wants peace, one prepares for war. However, the Minister’s responsibility is in the phrase <i>salus populis suprema est lex</i>— the safety of the people is the first law. That must be the central approach of a Minister with responsibility for justice. The Government and senior gardaí were tested on a number of fronts and they failed. Indeed, the only redeeming feature of last Saturday was the courage and bravery of the gardaí. In uniform on the front line, many of them young recruits, they opposed with courage and bravery the thugs and hoodlums and ensured our visitors were fully protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">The failure occurred because of a broader issue. We were claiming to be a fully mature democracy, capable of hosting such a march in our capital city. Clearly, we are not yet mature even though, after 85 years, Ireland is the third oldest continuous democracy in Europe. We will not be fully mature until such marches can take place unmolested and without exceptional security and protection measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">Our failure allowed a bunch of neo-nationalist fascist thugs from the so-called republican movement to organise a riot with the assistance of gurriers and bums gathered from the streets and pubs of Dublin. The so-called republican element threatened to disrupt the march and it succeeded. Saturday, therefore, was a day of shame for this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">What we must do now is draw conclusions from what happened. Obviously, there must be unreserved and unanimous condemnation of the so-called republican elements who organised the riot. They must be pursued, identified, charged and brought to justice. We must be proud of the gardaí who were in the front line. Most of them were in ordinary uniform, without even the protection of helmets. They were a target for those hurtling bricks and stones. The Minister has outlined why there were only 250 gardaí with a back-up of 40 or 50 members of the riot squad. This contrasts with the 5,000 who were deployed in the city for the European Council meeting in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Another issue is why the gardaí were so ill-equipped. Why was there no personal protection? Why were gardaí wearing soft hats in the front line? Why were helmets not available, as they were when the European Council met? The Minister referred to the water cannon. It was not borrowed from the PSNI but we should have one available. While I understand the desire not to have a big show of force on the front line, back-up should be readily available for such situations. That includes a water cannon. Another chapter of misfortune was what happened to the helicopter which, apparently, did not take to the air until nearly 4 p.m. because of technical hitches.</p>

          <p eId="para_515">According to the report, it was not in the air at the relevant time. With all due respect, it was not much use early in the morning or late in the evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">The issue of what prior knowledge existed is also relevant. According to the Taoiseach the dogs in the street in his constituency knew that a riot was being prepared. There is ample evidence available of an organised effort. There must be a stringent analysis of what took place and why it took place. While it is helpful to have the report from senior management of the Garda Síochána, it is not sufficient. We must learn lessons from what happened. We must learn what steps were taken and if they were adequate. What was the situation with intelligence? What risk assessment was made of that intelligence? We must plan for the future and, with parades scheduled for St. Patrick's Day, May day and on other occasions, we must ensure these events will not be open to being hijacked by subversive and criminal elements.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">I have a proposal which the Minister might consider. If we take the view that we must learn from what happened and try to prevent it happening again, the right approach is to establish a small independent group to examine what occurred last Saturday. I do not intend that this group should assign blame to anybody, even the Minister — I am not trying to make politics of this matter. I would like a small independent group to examine the matter to isolate problems and suggest solutions which would be useful for the future. The group I have in mind would be composed of three persons, perhaps the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, some senior political figure who is not now involved in the political arena, such as Alan Dukes or Nora Owen, who have past experience in the Department of Justice——</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_522">What happened on Saturday is unforgivable and unacceptable. It is not long ago — I think it was last Easter — when the group that sits beside me in the House organised a march down the same street with balaclavas and all sorts of regalia showing what it stood for. Nobody passed any remarks and that march was allowed to take place. Despite all the sentiment questioning which route should have been used, it was the route that all of us have used, I perhaps more often than anyone else in the House, as farm organisations and Monaghan hospital groups have often walked that route in protest. It is the accepted route.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">My worry, above all, concerns the damage this has done to the peace process. It is clear it did not happen by accident and was not spontaneous. The bottles were in the bins from the night before and the petrol bombs were prepared. People brought what weapons they had with them — they were not all from the building sites. Questions must be asked. The most important issue is to check the identities of the perpetrators who show up on video or in photographs and discover whom they are associated with.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">This did not happen by accident. We all knew the dissidents — the Real IRA and whatever the other group is called — intended to have a sit-down protest but nobody expected the hundreds or perhaps thousands of people who took part in the way they did to totally destroy the name of our capital city and our nation across the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">At the time a group of people was doing that in Dublin, others in the peace process were trying to break down barriers between the different organisations in Northern Ireland. This work cannot be forgotten. It is the quiet, useful work that is done on a weekly and monthly basis without any show, pomp or ceremony. While I was not involved, I know others who were involved in such work in Belfast on the same day the other group was in Dublin trying to do as much damage as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">It is important the marchers who came to Dublin were protected. I give credit to the gardaí involved for ensuring the marchers got to Leinster House for a short period and returned to Belfast, Antrim, Down and elsewhere in safety. At least their spokespersons could see they got the protection of the Garda, which was important.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">We must learn from this experience, which cannot happen again. Whether it be the Easter commemorations this year or a possible visit by the Queen, which is on the cards, we must make absolutely certain that whatever information is needed is obtained in time and utilised, and that the necessary action is taken to ensure people do not get away with what they to some degree got away with on Saturday.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">I congratulate the members of the Garda Síochána at every level for the tremendous efforts they have made. It was an unforeseen circumstance to some degree but it is vital that they survived. It is vital the media were seen to be independent and that they, or anyone else who has video evidence, provide information to ensure the criminals who carried out this act are brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">It must be made clear that this is a republic and the people are entitled to free speech. Whoever wants to march has the right to march and this right does not just belong to a small few. As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe noted, this was the first occasion on which this group asked to come to Dublin, although marches have taken place in the Border area. Deputy McGinley will know of the marches that take place in County Donegal every July, which pass off peacefully and during which local people make the marchers welcome. Unfortunately, some people decided this should not happen in Dublin. They are the ones in the wrong. They must be brought to justice and we depend on the Minister to ensure that happens.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_533">For those of us who served on that side of the House, memories are long enough to recall the mischief that would be made by Fianna Fáil if the office of Minister for Justice was held by a Fine Gael or Labour Party Deputy. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has also absented himself. He made a career from indicting the Minister for Justice of the day if a letter went missing. Now, we have had mayhem on the streets of the capital city and only one single Government backbencher considers it necessary to present in the House for the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Responsibility for public safety and maintenance of public order rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. Was there misjudgment on his part? Were gardaí ill-prepared or inadequately resourced and protected? Has the Government grown so complacent in the thicket of rhetoric about the peace process that it was caught off guard? These are some of the questions this debate must answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">It is hard to overstate the seriousness of what happened on the streets of our capital city last Saturday and there is a number of aspects to this affair that require to be considered. A group of people from Northern Ireland who wanted to hold a peaceful march through Dublin to highlight a particular viewpoint, and who co-operated fully with the Garda in terms of all organisational details, were denied the opportunity to do so by the thuggish behaviour of a violent minority. That is a poor day for our democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Gardaí were subjected to attacks of shocking savagery, with men and women of the force subjected to a hail of petrol bombs and missiles. Some were injured and others were exposed to injury. We saw unleashed a strain of venomous sectarianism that most people hoped had begun to disappear from our society. We saw the wanton destruction of property, the terrorising of people about their lawful business on a Saturday afternoon, and attacks on journalists and photographers. We saw the Garda struggle to contain the situation and regain control of the streets. It is important that there be a full review of the Garda operation if we are to ensure that such a situation is never again repeated and that gardaí and citizens are not again placed at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">An essential component of any democratic society is the right to dissent, the right to hold and promote views that are not the views of the majority. That right must be upheld peacefully and in accordance with the law. The Love Ulster organisation is a group whose views would probably not be shared by the majority of society in this jurisdiction. FAIR, Families Acting for Innocent Relatives, is an organisation made up primarily of those whose relatives were murdered by republican paramilitary organisations. Like many others who lost relatives in the violence in Northern Ireland, they believe that their murdered loved ones have become forgotten victims. They believe, probably with some validity, that Protestant victims of republican violence have not received the attention they should have south of the Border. They were entitled to come to Dublin to seek to highlight this particular grievance. I am amazed at the quarters from which one has heard criticism of the march being allowed to take place. Not everyone was going to like the message they were putting forward, but they were entitled to put it forward. Under the Constitution, they have an automatic right to citizenship of this State and are just as entitled to walk our streets as any other political organisation or lobby group.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">By all accounts, the organisers of the planned parade acted responsibly. They made contact at every stage with the Garda. As I understand it, they took the advice of the Garda on all organisational matters. The organisers of the aborted demonstration cannot in any way be blamed for the violence that broke out in Dublin on Saturday. Those who set out to ensure that this parade did not take place were directing their hostility not just towards those who planned to march but also towards the values that all democrats hold dear — tolerance, non-sectarianism and respecting the views of others — which are values that should be the norm for anyone who considers him or herself to be a republican. The real test of our tolerance is not accepting those marches with which we agree, but accepting the right of those with whom we might disagree to parade peacefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">While I regard the failure of the march to take place to be a defeat for democracy, I also acknowledge that had the marchers insisted on exercising their right to parade and had the Garda taken the decision to try to force the parade through, the result might have been much worse. It seems evident that those who wanted this parade stopped were prepared to unleash any level of violence to ensure that this happened. It seems quite likely that had the parade been forced down O'Connell Street, people may well have died or at least been seriously maimed. Events as they were on Saturday will have set back North-South relations. Death or serious injury to the marchers would have done irreparable damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">One of the things that shocked me most about Saturday's events was the venomous sectarian abuse unleashed against those who wanted to march. While we might like to see ourselves as a modern, tolerant, pluralist society, what was revealed on Saturday was a vile sectarianism that is not far below the surface in some sections of society in this country. Sectarianism is not simply confined to the Orange Order or the DUP. We need to confront and challenge sectarianism in all its forms. We need to recognise that many of those who attempt to pass themselves off as republicans have little to offer other than a form sectarian bigotry. Indeed, when one scratches the surface of the principal republican organisations, ranging from the Provisional IRA to the Continuity IRA, one will find a significant underbelly of sectarianism that is counter to everything for which Wolfe Tone stood.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">In recent years and especially since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, we have seen a subtle attempt to rewrite the history of Northern Ireland and, in particular, the role of the IRA. The campaign of the IRA was never about civil rights or democracy, nor was it the glorious, noble war of liberation that some would have us believe. The reality is that it was a sordid, seedy, brutish terrorist campaign that was directed in the main against the Unionist community in Northern Ireland. The IRA was responsible for the deaths of more than 850 Protestants during 30 years of mayhem. We must not forget this. Having said that, there is no evidence, as seems to have been confirmed by the Minister's earlier contribution, that Sinn Féin was involved in Saturday's disorder. If that is the case, then the House should note it.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">We also need to exercise caution in the way in which we plan to commemorate key events in Irish history, such as the 1916 Rising. Nothing should be done that would deepen divisions, further inflame passions or give those who caused such mayhem in Dublin further excuse to vent their sectarian hatred. We need to look at practices that may promote sectarian attitudes, even unconsciously, in our society. We need to look at new models that could facilitate the greater integration of children from different religions. We need to do more for groups like Educate Together that promote multi-denominational or non-denominational education.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">Crude tribalism can manifest itself in several ways. For example, it can contaminate sport. There has been much comment, including in the Taoiseach's contribution, on the presence of so many young men in Glasgow Celtic football shirts on Saturday. The presence of young men in Glasgow Rangers shirts has been a similar feature of much anti-Catholic rioting in Northern Ireland. There has been a tendency in this country to treat the rivalry between Celtic and Rangers as a bit of harmless fun. However, it is nothing of the sort. While both clubs have made some efforts to counter the tribalism associated with their teams, both sets of supporters include in their ranks those whose principal preoccupation is not football but sectarian hatred of the other side. Of additional concern is that some attempts appear to have been made by a minority of soccer supporters in this country to graft that sectarian element onto Irish soccer.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Different elements appear to have been involved in the violence on Saturday. It seems beyond dispute that a significant degree of planning and preparation was put into the counter-demonstration. It was clear that those involved were determined to stop the march and were prepared to inflict serious injury and even death on marchers, gardaí and bystanders to ensure this happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Petrol bombs do not spontaneously appear. People do not walk around town on Saturday mornings with golf balls, snooker balls and other convenient missiles in their pocket. All the available evidence points to a significant level of co-ordination through the use of mobile phones and text messaging to get people to the top of O'Connell Street and then to move them to other locations as the violence spread. Clearly an element also turned up in the hope of trouble and availed of the opportunity to riot, attack gardaí with particular viciousness, loot and destroy. I hope that no effort will be spared to bring to justice those described by the Dublin city manager, Mr. John Fitzgerald, as "a lethal cocktail of extreme republicans and a rag bag of hangers on". While the primary target of the Garda investigation should be the planners and the organisers, those opportunists who also took advantage of the violence must also be brought to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">A huge amount of photographic evidence already published should assist the Garda investigation. I hope the courts will deal firmly with those who are charged and convicted. It is also appropriate that we should look at the adequacy of the planning and preparation of the Garda operation to seek to learn the appropriate lessons so that similar scenes might be avoided in the future. I was shocked by the level of violence and abuse directed at the Garda Síochána. On behalf of the Labour Party, I express my sympathy to members of the force — men and women — who were injured. I praise the courage shown by gardaí and acknowledge that without their efforts we might now well be dealing with the aftermath of an even more disastrous set of events.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Representative organisations of the Garda rank and file have expressed concern about the level of planning and preparation for the policing operation and raised questions that must be answered. Why was there apparently no warning about the violence, which clearly required a significant level of preparation? Despite the ceasefires and the huge reduction in the threat from paramilitary organisations, we still have a very significant Garda special branch and intelligence section. Why did it pick up nothing?</p>
          <p eId="para_548">According to the Taoiseach, "on the lanes at the back of O'Connell St. they had bins of bottles which had obviously been stored there overnight. So it had been organised." The thought occurs that, if the situation was as the Taoiseach has said, why was it not picked up by, or passed on to, the Garda? It was interesting to hear the Minister go out of his way to tell us how the gardaí secured the bins. The Minister stated in his speech that "arrangements were made with Dublin City Council for bins to be emptied and sealed". According to the Taoiseach, the bins were neither emptied nor sealed. One wonders why, given all this information buzzing around his constituency, the Taoiseach did not pass it on to the Minister or at least to the Garda. In addition, RTE news bulletins on Saturday night quoted the Taoiseach as saying that there had been word in his constituency on Friday night that trouble was likely. It is not clear whether the Taoiseach heard these reports on Friday night, but if that was the case he must say what, if anything, he did about them.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Were the Garda numbers sufficient to cope with the threat? According to the secretary of the Garda Representative Association, Mr. Stone, the Garda authorities decided to police the protest on the cheap, with the result that at 2 p.m. Garda chiefs were ringing Kells and Tullamore in the search for reinforcements. For example, I am informed that the superintendent at Store Street made a plea in advance of the demonstration for extra manpower, but the plea was refused. How was it that gardaí in ordinary uniforms and without protective gear of any description found themselves at the front line — especially in the early part of the proceedings — and defenceless against the hail of missiles to which they were subjected? How was it that greater efforts were not made to secure what amounts to a massive building site on the upper part of O'Connell Street? This was surely one of the most serious errors made, as it provided virtually an arsenal of additional weapons for those involved?</p>
          <p eId="para_550">Were the tactics used by the Garda the most effective for containing the violence once it started? Was it wise, as appears to have happened, to try simply to push the rioters down O'Connell Street, where they were able to terrorise shoppers and inflict vast damage? I heard the Minister praise the fact that the protesters were transported from Parnell Square to outside Leinster House, but I wonder whether that was the correct thing to do. Ought they not to have been secured and safely sent on their way home? Bringing the demonstrators to Leinster House was the cause of what subsequently happened in Nassau Street and South Frederick Street, where the Minister's party's headquarters were subjected to a disgraceful attack.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">All these questions and others must be answered comprehensively by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform — if not today as a matter of urgency — if we are not to be confronted with another potentially violent situation in our capital city. In a different context, the Minister stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_552">As Minister I have overall responsibility for the operation of the Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system and it is a responsibility that I take seriously. While it is correct to say that I have no direct role in investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, I certainly do have a role in oversight and political accountability in relation to the policing of the Irish State.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The Minister cannot, therefore, dodge behind any distinction between policy and operations. He cannot seek to delimit his responsibilities for what must be admitted was a debacle in security, intelligence and policing that can only inflict further damage on an increasingly fragile peace process. I hope the Minister will deal with the questions I have outlined when he responds. If he cannot deal with them today, the House must be prepared to come back to the subject when comprehensive answers are available.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_314">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_554">I intend to share my time with Deputies Crowe, Joe Higgins and Gregory.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">I compliment members of an Garda Síochána on their courage in the front line on Saturday and applaud the work they carried out. However, it must be asked whether the organisers of the Love Ulster parade really believed that marching through the streets of Dublin would further the peace process on this island. On a practical level, there were significant difficulties with the resources and intelligence that were brought to bear on Saturday's events. The Minister said that if we want peace we should prepare for war, but I believe we should hope for the best while preparing for the worst. I do not think such preparations were made on Saturday, given that gardaí on the front line were left without the right clothing for a long period to battle missiles that ranged from rocks to wheelbarrows. With proper policing, gardaí who were not properly equipped would have been removed from the front line very quickly, but that did not happen on Saturday.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">I do not know what the Garda knew in advance of Saturday's march, but I know that I was worried beforehand. Republican Sinn Féin had warned of violence and the word on the Internet was that violence could occur. The dogs on the street and the dogs in the blogs knew that there might be violence. Mobile phone text messages seem to have played their part in the rapid escalation on Saturday. Indymedia suggests that a "flashmob" was in operation on Saturday, but modern technology certainly seems to have allowed things to escalate very quickly. I am not convinced that the Garda Síochána is on top of the kind of technology that was being used in the days, hours and minutes prior to the violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Dublin City Council does not seem to have been on top of things either. It is regrettable that missile material was available behind a fence that could simply be lifted up and pushed over by a couple of people. Failure to control the building site meant that material that could be used as missiles was not cleared away from the street.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The protesters seem to have been a mixture of Republican Sinn Féin supporters, a small group of self-styled anarchists and a fairly significant group of the disaffected in Irish society. I do not for a second defend the violence that occurred, but I believe the Minister must answer questions on why these young people were so disaffected that they turned away from society. As a right-wing Minister, Deputy McDowell has lauded policies that reduce the State's involvement in communities. Saturday's events clearly show that the State must be involved in building up communities not through tax breaks but in social programmes. Instead of the tax breaks the Government has provided for superpubs and car parks, we need more investment in communities through FÁS, RAPID areas, education and housing. We need investment in sports facilities, parks and playgrounds rather than in horses and greyhounds. We need a change in the Government's priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The social exclusion and poverty that led to the Gregory deal some 20 years ago have not gone away. The violence and riots that took place in Paris last summer resonate with what we saw on the streets of Dublin last Saturday.</p>

          <p eId="para_564">The events in Dublin last Saturday were an absolute disgrace. Those who took part misused the name of Irish republicanism and nationalism, but they were anything but Irish republicans or nationalists in the real sense. They were a tiny and unrepresentative minority, a mixture of people on the fringes of micro-political groups, football hooligans and drink-fuelled opportunists, a ragbag who saw the chance to create havoc and took it.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Sinn Féin has been consistent on this issue since Willie Frazer and his so-called Love Ulster and FAIR groups first emerged. While we profoundly disagree with Mr. Frazer, we chose not to oppose his group's march down O'Connell Street, notwithstanding the fact that we believe it was deliberately provocative and insensitively organised. It is the right of all citizens of this island to march down the capital's main thoroughfare, no matter what part of that island they live on. We also believe in people's right to hold peaceful counter-demonstrations. However, both those rights come with responsibilities. Marchers must not engage in sectarian or abusive behaviour, and counter-demonstrators must refrain from physically engaging with them. Proper stewarding by those participating in demonstrations and by the Garda is crucial in that respect, and neither was in evidence last Saturday.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Sinn Féin made clear that we wanted people to try to ignore that march. We instructed our membership not to go anywhere near it. Martin McGuinness made that very point at the Dublin Sinn Féin annual general meeting only two weeks ago. Deputy Ó Caoláin gave the Sinn Féin position on a recent episode of "Questions and Answers". I made several statements before the march, up to the point of calling on people to desist while the rioting was in progress. Saturday's thuggery also served to obscure debate on the real nature of Mr. Frazer's group. Those who engaged in the violence and destruction gave them exactly what they wanted, playing into Mr. Frazer's hands and allowing him to claim moral high ground to which he is not entitled. He has gloried in the actions of loyalist death squads and today is trying to blame the President for Saturday's trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">I would like to use this opportunity to defend the role of Dublin City Council which bears no responsibility for the riot. Its workers acted quickly to make the streets safe and rubble free again. It is important to point out that Saturday's riots have no implications for the peace process. We are determined to see progress made in the coming weeks and months. For Sinn Féin, that includes reaching out to the Unionist community. Unlike those who misused our national flag last weekend, I take the tricolour's message very seriously: unity, peace and equality between orange and green.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_568">There is a temptation to offer expert opinion regarding what should have been done last Saturday. That is always very easy in hindsight. However, I will resist that temptation other than to state as a local representative, O'Connell Street being in the very centre of my constituency, that it is now self-evident that the most obvious error of judgment must have been the decision to allow it to be used by the marchers, given the road works, the fencing, the maze of side streets, the stockpile of ammunition and the pre-announced determination by certain elements that the loyalists should not pass certain sensitive locations. All that presented the Garda with an exceptionally difficult task. There was clearly a breakdown in intelligence gathering. I do not know who decided on the route, but I assume that the buck stops with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. As usual, he has managed to divert attention from that fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">I strongly oppose any suggestion that this be used as an excuse to restrict in any way people's right to protest on O'Connell Street or elsewhere in the city centre by way of by-laws, as the Taoiseach seemed to suggest.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_571">I am glad to see that the motion before us reaffirms the right to peaceful protest and demonstration. I hope it means what it says. As an elected representative for the O'Connell Street area, I refer to allegations that local people were heavily involved on Saturday. Of those charged whose addresses were listed, not one was from the constituency. If that changes when others are arrested, so be it. However, at the moment, any suggestion that the north inner city was somehow partly to blame is not based on the available evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">As my time is limited, I will briefly address the loyalist organisation FAIR. I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday that Mr. Frazer, the leader of the group, is quite happy to justify loyalist sectarian murderers and that he had “a lot of time” for Billy Wright, the serial sectarian murderer and psychopath. While it may not be politically correct to say it, the individual in question appears to be far from fair.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">The families of the innocent victims must have a right to protest and highlight their sense of loss, from whatever part of this island they hail. I only wish that those families from across the North's divide — there were many innocent victims on both sides — and people such as the relatives of the Dublin and Monaghan bombing victims in the South might march together some day to highlight the futility of sectarian violence from whatever source.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_576">The Socialist Party condemns those who orchestrated Saturday's violence. It was a sectarian riot to prevent the Love Ulster group marching through Dublin. My party believes that the Love Ulster campaign is based on sectarianism and that its activities heighten sectarian divisions and encourage disunity among working class people, especially in Northern Ireland. We strongly oppose the political agenda and the activities of Love Ulster, but we recognise its right to march and protest in the centre of Dublin. The Socialist Party equally recognises the rights of others to indicate peaceful opposition to Love Ulster through disciplined protest, but they have no right to stop others marching as happened on Saturday in Dublin. My party strongly opposes the political agenda of both orange and green sectarians, whether in the North or on the streets of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Let us contrast Saturday's disgusting scenes with those of a few weeks ago, when striking postal workers in Belfast, Protestant and Catholic, marched together up the Shankill Road and down the Falls Road in a united working class demonstration. With the many groups and individuals subjected to disgraceful violence on Saturday, I highlight violent assaults against workers, including migrant workers, in their workplaces, particularly shops, by the thugs who participated. Clearly, the Good Friday Agreement is not providing a solution. It could not do so, since it is the institutionalisation of sectarian division. Therefore, I register my dissent and formally oppose that section of the motion before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The key task remaining is forging unity among working class people within Northern Ireland and North and South and, in so doing, ensuring all communities and individuals can live free from sectarian conflict. However, the British and Irish Governments which push neo liberal and right-wing economic agendas at the expense of those working class communities are not the ones to show the way forward in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I wish to issue a strong, loud and clear warning to senior Dublin City Council officials and anyone in the Government who echoes the call made yesterday by the Dublin city manager. Effectively, he called for the right to democratically organise, protest and march in Dublin city centre to be curbed and restricted. Disgracefully, the Taoiseach echoed that call today. It is disgraceful that the hooliganism of a tiny few, who sought to curb the freedom to march on Saturday, should be seized on by city council bureaucrats to curb our freedom to march peacefully and express ourselves on a whole range of issues that concern ordinary people, workers and working class communities. All, whether it be the farming community, trade unions, community organisations or political organisations, have the democratic right to come to the centre of their capital city and show their cause. Just as working class people of Dublin, with one of their great leaders, Jim Larkin, exerted their right to bring their movement, grievances and cause on to O'Connell Street in the time leading up to and during the monumental events and struggle for justice by workers in 1913, we will not tolerate any attempts by bureaucrats or anyone else to prevent our right to demonstrate peacefully and democratically in the centre of this city of Dublin.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_327">
          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_580">I wish to share my time with Deputy Kehoe.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Like other Members, I condemn those responsible for turning the heart of our capital city into a riot zone last Saturday. It is unfortunate that some Members have chosen to try to switch the blame to the Garda, to politicians, to local authorities or anyone apart from the actual culprits who started the riots. I condemn those who are so bigoted and narrow-minded in their thinking that they would prevent free speech and a peaceful march by victims of IRA violence in Northern Ireland. While many may not share the political views of those in the Love Ulster movement, I had thought that Irish society was sufficiently mature to facilitate a march in our capital city of the type proposed on Saturday, along with a counter-protest — if people felt it to be necessary — but without resorting to the kind of vicious violence and brutality which we saw. It seems there was a small group of people who planned and organised affairs to ensure that the carnage was sparked off and that it continued. Thugs, fuelled with drink and easily-led disaffected youths joined in to promote havoc which caused disbelief and terror amongst onlookers going about their business in Dublin city centre, on the Saturday afternoon of a rugby international weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The images transmitted around the European Union and further afield bring shame on Ireland. In many ways, we have been a model of economic growth and prosperity. We have been a real success story, a maturing small democracy which many others want to copy and use as a model within the European Union. However, Saturday's scenes sent out an awful message of intolerance and hatred. They reinforced the view among some, who do not understand the complicated nature of our peace process, that we still have far to go. Those who organised Saturday's events have no right to call themselves republicans or Nationalists and I was glad to hear so many Members repeat that sentiment today. They brought shame on those terms. While they preach that they are fighting for a united Ireland, all they create is division and further hatred. Such people will never unite Ireland. That will only be achieved by those who can accept and promote tolerance of all strands and backgrounds on our island.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">I am encouraged by the isolation, since Saturday's riots, of those responsible. Clearly they are a small and withering minority in Irish society. However, Members should be in no doubt that they are still there. We must learn some lessons from Saturday's events. A silver lining can emerge from this dark cloud by ensuring such events will never be repeated. We must examine why so many young gardaí found themselves exposed in an unacceptable manner. There appear to have been e-mails, texts and telephone calls circulating before Saturday that warned people not to be in the city centre. We must establish why the Garda felt it was not necessary to take such warnings more seriously. Where was Garda intelligence in this respect? Members must ensure they receive a detailed report from the Garda which is not afraid to be critical. This is why I support my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's call for an independent assessment of the events. It should be blunt and to the point to acquire the desired constructive criticism to ensure the events of Saturday are not repeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">A balance must be struck between over-policing, or having a police state. People may well have accused us of having such a state had we overdone it on Saturday. At the same time, we must ensure people can go about their business safely and that their constitutional rights are protected, as the Minister noted in his opening statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Lessons must also be learned from a political perspective. Those who organised this disgraceful event probably call themselves republicans of sorts. Their actions on Saturday were completely counterproductive and have handed a political victory to those they claim to oppose in Northern Ireland, by causing further division and by reinforcing a mind set among some north of the Border to the effect that Unionists and loyalists are not welcome in Dublin, the Republic's capital city. I was glad to hear Deputy Crowe's comments in the debate today and I hope Members will hear more comments of that nature from Sinn Féin in the future. I hope its members mean them.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">Members should not begin to change the nature of this debate into one on social deprivation or a lack of community or social policies on the Government's part. This was naked and blatant sectarianism on the streets of Dublin from the Celtic jersey brigade who unfortunately also bring shame to football and to that football club. We must prepare better for such events and must ensure that we do not provide a platform for similar people to inflict the kind of damage wrought in so many areas last Saturday, or to allow it to happen again.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_328">
          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_587">First and foremost, I congratulate gardaí for their bravery and professionalism in dealing with this situation on Saturday. They found themselves in an extremely difficult situation on Saturday afternoon. Although lacking resources, a small number of gardaí put their lives at risk to protect the citizens of this State. Their actions are highly commendable and Members should consider themselves lucky to have people of such calibre in the force. However, it is unfortunate that the same level of commitment in dealing with this demonstration did not come from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. As the political head of the Garda Síochána, the Minister must be held accountable for what happened on the streets of Dublin on Saturday afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I was attending the Young Fine Gael conference when I heard and saw the live images from the streets of Dublin. It was absolutely horrific and I could not believe it could happen in my own country, especially within the centre of Dublin city. Images were broadcast across the world of a violent riot in our capital which should not have been permitted to happen. It should have been a weekend of celebration as an international rugby match was to be played and many tourists were in the city. They were frightened to witness what took place. Hopefully this will not turn them away and was a once-off event.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The first issue that must be examined is the preparation and planning of such an event or march. As we have never experienced any demonstration of this kind in Dublin, surely common sense would dictate that being over-prepared, rather than under-prepared, would have been the best course of action. On Friday evening, as the Taoiseach acknowledged, the word on the street was that there would be trouble on Saturday and citizens, not belonging to any political organisation or to any republican organisation, were receiving e-mails to be off the streets in Dublin on Saturday afternoon because trouble was expected.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The word even reached some taxi-drivers. A taxi-driver to whom I spoke on Thursday told me that trouble was expected on Saturday. The e-mail circulating widely was brought to the attention of the Garda by one Fine Gael councillor, which is reported in <i>The Star</i> newspaper today. Even at that stage, the Minister did not put any additional manpower or any necessary procedures in place to make our streets safe on Saturday afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">What happened on Saturday also draws attention to the under resourcing of the Garda Síochána, not only in terms of manpower. We are still waiting for the extra thousands of gardaí the Minister promised during the last general election campaign. The Garda is totally under resourced.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I ask the Minister to refer in his concluding remarks to the water-cannon borrowed from the RUC in 1994 and used effectively by the Garda Síochána at the time.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">Has the Garda such equipment? The Minister has some serious questions to answer. What did he anticipate on Saturday afternoon? Did he expect trouble? Did he speak to senior Garda management, prior to Thursday, Friday or Saturday, about the demonstration that was about to take place? Does he have plans to review procedures to deal with such demonstrations? Like my colleague, I too want to see an independent review of what happened on Saturday. I also support the motion that will come before the House this evening.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_331">
          <from>Mr. O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_595">I wish to share my brief time with my colleague, Deputy Mulcahy.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Dublin can be heaven, as they say, but it certainly was not last Saturday. We all have been appalled by the scenes we saw in our city last Saturday. I speak as a native Dubliner, born and reared in this parish. I was not in the city on Saturday, but the images I saw were horrendous.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I welcome the presence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. It is good that he has remained in the House and listened to what we are saying, and I expect that he will be able to respond.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The acts of thuggery and brutality have no place in a modern democracy or on the streets of this capital city. Clearly the small minority behind the riots were intent on causing the maximum amount of destruction and if it were not for the brave actions of the men and women of the Garda Síochána, the damage and injuries inflicted on innocent Dubliners would have been even more serious. Those who resort to such acts have no place in our city and must be brought to justice. Their actions threatened people as they went about their everyday business. We have heard all those stories, read the newspapers, listened to Mr. Joe Duffy's radio show, etc. The thugs showed complete contempt for the Garda and for anyone who happened to get in their way. It is clear there was a small minority who travelled to the city centre last Saturday with only one intention, to create mayhem.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The 350 gardaí who policed last Saturday's demonstration came under a hail of bricks, bottles, petrol bombs and other missiles, while members of the media were also subject to attacks, as were innocent shoppers and passersby. An attack on the Garda is an attack on us all and that is completely unacceptable. I wish all those injured a speedy recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The full resources of the law must now be used to bring those responsible to justice. There can be no excuse for what happened. Thugs have no place in our communities and I, like all Dubliners, want to see them removed from our streets. Gardaí have already started bringing those responsible to justice. I understand that almost 40 arrests were made on Saturday. I have every confidence that in the days ahead those who managed to escape will be brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">I also welcome the fact that the Government has received a preliminary report, through the Minister, Deputy McDowell, on the issues arising from Saturday and will get a more detailed report in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">It is also important to make absolutely clear that those who went on the rampage do not represent republicans or republican values. It is our duty to ensure this small violent minority does not tar our tolerant republican ideals. Those who rioted have nothing in common with the heroes of 1916. They instead share a bigoted bond with the likes of the British National Party or Combat 18.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Many of my constituents were caught in the middle of this violence. Thankfully, they did not suffer injuries but it is the Garda they have to thank for this. In the days and weeks ahead, the gardaí investigating the crimes of last Saturday deserve every possible support. There can be no excuse for thuggery and no hiding place for thugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">As a Dublin based Deputy, I have every confidence in the professionalism, effectiveness and bravery of gardaí. They have, once again, placed themselves in the front-line to protect us all. This is not a time for giving in to thugs. Already there are those who want to put a question mark over our 1916 commemorations and even St. Patrick's Day celebrations. It is clear that we must not let this minority run Dublin city. The best answer to thuggery is to continue with our plans and ensure full participation in the national events planned for the coming weeks in the heart of Dublin city.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMulcahyFF" eId="spk_332">
          <from>Mr. Mulcahy</from>
          <p eId="para_605">I also agree with those speakers who stated Saturday was a sad day for Ireland and for Dublin. The experience of watching that was not new to me because in June 2001, when I was elected Lord Mayor, on the way to the Mansion House I was assaulted by a similar crowd protesting against water charges. On that day, despite the fact that it had been widely circulated that there would be a protest march that night, there were only one or two gardaí present. That raises the issue of the policy of the Garda on these events. To put it bluntly, I disagree with one of the phrases the Minister used in his speech, most of which I agree with. I do not believe the Garda were firm enough on Saturday but I pay tribute to all of the brave gardaí, male and female, who stood in that line and who obeyed instructions while missiles were being thrown at them and they were being abused and assaulted in the most cowardly and despicable fashion. My abiding image, and that of many Members of this House and members of the public, is of ordinary members of the Garda Síochána, not in protective clothing, standing there in line, being assaulted and being helpless in that assault. I found that galling. I found it unacceptable. Most right-thinking people in Ireland found that equally galling and unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">I pay tribute to the Garda for some of its operational decisions. The decision, as the Minister stated, to stop the parade at Parnell Square was correct. To allow them to protest outside Leinster House was also a correct decision, but to lose control of O'Connell Street amounts to a failure and we must face up to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">The Minister has stated the Garda response was measured, proportionate and effective. I respectfully disagree. It was not proportionate and it certainly was not effective. It is unacceptable that any group such as this can take control of O'Connell Street, even for a short period. While I also thank the Minister, Deputy McDowell, for coming into the House and accepting full political responsibility, it is unacceptable that we, the democratically elected representatives, and the people should lose control of their premier street, even for a short time. In his policy instructions to the Garda in future, there should be a clear instruction that people should be able to go about their lawful business on O'Connell Street at all times. A number of Opposition Members have made totally contradictory statements in that regard. On the one hand, Deputy Gregory stated this group should not have paraded down O'Connell Street but, on the other, that by-laws should not be in place regarding marches down the street, which is a totally contradictory position. Deputy Cuffe advanced a complete apologia for civil disobedience. He listed a series of items which amount to a justification for civil disobedience-violence, although I accept he condemned the violence.</p>

          <from>Mr. Mulcahy</from>
          <p eId="para_611">Saturday's events were most serious and it would be regrettable if they were to happen again. However, they require further examination. I am not sure whether Fine Gael's proposal is a good one. I do not approve of its proposed list of members of such a group, although I would not oppose referral of this matter to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights which should inquire into whether proper operational plans were in place, whether the riot police should have intervened sooner and the other questions that remain unanswered. This is not first time this has happened. There was a riot in the 1990s during a football match between the Republic of Ireland and England at Lansdowne Road. Riots will always happen. We will never have seen the last one.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">It is a question of policy on the extent to which the Garda should intervene. Despite the best efforts of brave gardaí, they soft pedalled a little too much on Saturday. For the forces of law and order in the State to cede control, even for a short period, on O'Connell Street is unacceptable to most Members. It is a matter of the utmost seriousness.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive and informative contribution, including the annex he circulated on the security procedures. I also thank him for taking political responsibility but a serious question must be asked regarding what will be our policy on such events in future.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_616">On reading the preliminary Garda report, it is clear the Garda did not have a clue about what was going to happen and it was totally in the dark. The only person who had prior knowledge was the Taoiseach on Friday night but, according to the report, he did not transmit the information to the Garda. More gardaí will be bussed to Shannon Airport to protect President George Bush when his aeroplane lands, even though he will not set foot on Irish soil, than were on duty on O'Connell Street last Saturday.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">We must ask ourselves a number of questions. Whose reckless actions endangered the lives of the citizens of Dublin and gardaí; caused millions of euro worth of damage to property in central Dublin; damaged the reputation of the capital city in the eyes of the world; and damaged the peace process?</p>
          <p eId="para_618">The television shots of Dublin burning, rampaging youths with scarves hiding their faces, and stones, bricks, poles and even wheelbarrows flying through the air in the direction of gardaí tell a tale of organised confrontation, violence and mayhem. Thugs of a Nationalist hue, sundry hangers-on and local opportunists brought terror and destruction to the heart of Dublin on Saturday. Dubliners witnessed something they had scarcely witnessed even at the height of the conflict in Northern Ireland. As the bulletins were broadcast throughout the afternoon and ambulance and police sirens screamed ferrying the injured to hospital and those arrested to custody, a nation was shocked and stunned that this sustained violence could erupt without warning and, like a tsunami, engulf the city for more than three hours. If it were not for the courage of the thin blue line of gardaí who stood their ground, though completely taken by surprise and shell shocked by the ferocity and viciousness of the attackers, more damage to life and limb would have ensued. I was present for a good part of the afternoon and witnessed how ill-equipped and ill-prepared they were for what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The dust has settled and the endless road works continue into yet another year on O'Connell Street but now that the Garda report has been submitted on the proximate causes of the riotous behaviour and the Garda state of preparedness, it is time to identify the mistakes made and learn lessons for the future. A decision was made to route the first Northern Unionist march to be held in Dublin from Parnell Square to Leinster House via O'Connell Street. The marchers assembled at the Garden of Remembrance, a potent symbol of republicanism, even more so in this the 90th anniversary of 1916. The offices of Sinn Féin are located on the other side of the square, while the offices of Republican Sinn Féin are a couple of hundred yards down Parnell Street. Passing the statue of Parnell at the junction of Parnell Square and O'Connell Street, the Love Ulster marchers would have been able to read the bold legend, "No man has a right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation", on the Parnell monument. They would then have been on the main thoroughfare of the city, on which is located the iconic republican symbol of 1916 — the GPO.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Careful organisers would have seen the potential for conflict and confrontation in the route chosen but nobody apparently did. Careful organisers would have seen the potential for missiles in the stones, bricks and poles of the construction site that littered virtually the entirety of O'Connell Street. Blaming Dublin City Council for not securing these works is wide of the mark because they could not be secured. Careful organisers would have gratefully accepted the marchers' stated willingness to take whatever safe marching route to Leinster House was presented to them by their hosts. Alas, there were no careful organisers of the march.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">Careful managers of the march would have seen the potential for confrontation; obtained extensive intelligence of subversive plans for disruption; ensured their police forces were sufficient for every threat to life, limb and property; ensured their forces were furnished with the necessary equipment to control rioting thugs and to protect themselves against injury; ensured traders were warned of the threat of impending danger to their customers and property; and taken all steps to ensure their marching guests were not exposed to danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">Was the political planning poor? Was the route wrong? Was the intelligence non-existent? Was the Garda unprepared? It is difficult to avoid an affirmative answer to all these key questions. The Garda report results from an internal Garda examination. It can only ask the questions and seek the answers arising from Garda management's perception of its role, actions and effectiveness. It cannot cover all the ground or ask all the questions. It certainly cannot give all the answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">In Northern Ireland, arising from the crises at Drumcree and the Garvaghy Road, the Parades Commission was established to make recommendations and to take measures to avoid occasions of confrontation, provocation and conflict. None of the wisdom accumulated by the Parades Commission has found its way to the corridors of power in Leinster House or Garda headquarters in the Phoenix Park.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The ball is firmly in the Minister's court; the buck stops with him. He has a duty to ensure the appropriate inquisitorial structures are put in place. It seems that an independent inquiry, a call echoed by the Garda Representative Association, into all the circumstances surrounding the ill-fated march in my constituency in Dublin is the only way to get to the heart of the matter and to ensure the hard lessons will be learned.</p>

          <p eId="para_628">It was with profound sadness that I heard on Saturday about the appalling hatred shown and the vitriolic attacks on marchers from Northern Ireland who came to demonstrate in peace in Dublin. It is ironic that the demonstration took place less than one month before a festive march where Irish people will celebrate their identity will take place in London as part of the St. Patrick's Day celebrations. That will be, as in the past, a joyous and tolerant occasion. One does not expect in a civilised city to witness the level of violence and intolerance against marchers that we saw on Saturday. Certainly, we do not expect to witness the appalling and shameful levels of violence shown against the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">It is clear there was a level of ill-preparedness for this violence. The lack of participation in this debate by Government Deputies is also worrying. I am concerned that this demonstrates a level of disinterest or a lack of confidence in the Minister. The Minister needs to reflect seriously on the issue to learn lessons for the future from this debacle.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The march was not provocative to most of our people and was welcomed by the Dublin City Business Association. The Garda, because it did not have intelligence on the issue, was lured into a false sense of security. I acknowledge it bent over backwards to protect the marchers when things turned ugly. There were some appalling injuries, but the situation could have been much worse. I offer my sympathy and that of the Green Party to members of the force who were injured or endangered and my admiration for their bravery in the course of duty in holding the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">As a Protestant in the South, I say to Northern Protestants who hear how these visitors to Dublin were greeted that sectarianism is not a feature of this State. It is important we send that message. However, there is a difference between an absence of sectarianism and a proactive inclusiveness and this State has more to do in this regard. We have a ceasefire and a peace process, but we have not moved on sufficiently nor quickly enough. Saturday was a clear demonstration of how far we still have to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Educate Together schools, ecumenical acts of worship at particular historic junctures and gestures such that in my parish where the use of the Church of Ireland church is given to the Roman Catholic community while repairs are taking place on its church or that in Inisbiggle in Mayo, where there is a similar situation are important gestures that build confidence and cross-community understanding. The Government has not moved sufficiently far towards developing a civic forum following on the Good Friday Agreement. This is something we need and Saturday's events demonstrate how urgent the need is.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I urge the Minister to take account of the fact that gardaí feel under-resourced. As a result, there is low morale among many of the gardaí I know and this is reflected in the smaller numbers of gardaí in my area than in 1998. I hope the Minister takes this on board and does not sweep it under the carpet.</p>

          <p eId="para_634">Those who acted disgracefully on the streets of our capital city on Saturday were not republicans. They were, in the main, a crowd of thugs, many of them fuelled with drink. Those among them who claimed to be political simply dismissed the national flag and ran riot with criminal elements. Sinn Féin clearly and repeatedly called on people to ignore Saturday's march. Our members and supporters did so.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">I do not know to what march in O'Connell Street Deputy Crawford referred, but it was not a Sinn Féin Easter commemoration. Article 40 of the 1937 Constitution enshrines the right of citizens to assemble and to freely express their opinion as fundamental personal rights. There is now a real danger that the events of last Saturday may be used to curtail this right to protest.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">The right to march down O'Connell Street is of special significance to Irish political activists. Last Saturday must be seen in perspective. The protest in support of Irish Ferries workers last December and Sinn Féin's rally for Irish unity demonstration in November saw up to 100,000 and 20,000 people, respectively, march peacefully down O'Connell Street. Those who rioted and those who would exploit the events of riots to serve their own interest must not be allowed to undermine the fundamental right of democrats. It is, therefore, correct that the motion to be put before the House reaffirms the right to peaceful protests and demonstrations.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">There are questions to be answered by the Minister and Garda management. Was there a request from the officer in charge for additional gardaí to be made available to the area for Saturday's march and was this request turned down? Make no mistake about it, full responsibility lies with those who engaged in violent actions in our capital city.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">On behalf of Sinn Féin and all Dubliners, I express my appreciation to Dublin City Council workers who impressively cleaned up the affected streets in a matter of hours. I record Sinn Féin's support for the agreed motion before us.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_343">
          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_639">I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on the issue of the riots in Dublin last Saturday. Like most people, I watched the television images with a mixture of utter disbelief and increasing anger. I was angry when I saw rioters and thugs hurl missiles at gardaí and bystanders, while some of those same thugs were wrapped in our national flag. I thought: how dare they abuse our national flag? How dare they flaunt the tricolour while, at the same time, attacking the institutions and citizens of the State?</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Those who wrapped themselves in the flag last Saturday do not represent the vast majority of Irish people. Some Irish people supported the march, some did not, while others were indifferent but they were prepared to live and let live. It was almost unreal to see the television images of burning cars, looters and rioters throwing slabs of concrete at gardaí. While I fully applaud the many gardaí who put themselves in the line of fire without proper safety equipment and thought for themselves, who safely shepherded the marchers and many onlookers out of danger, the question must be answered as to whether the people of Dublin and Ireland can be reasonably sure this will not happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">The Minister has said he is not personally responsible for decisions taken on a day-to-day basis by the policing authority. I accept this. Nonetheless, he is politically responsible and must bear responsibility for the fact that last Saturday Dublin burned.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">Perhaps there is one small positive to be taken from all of this. The massive level of condemnation heard is already robbing the thugs of their power. Most significantly, many in the Republic have contacted ordinary people in the North to express their anger and outrage. In the final analysis, what ordinary people say to one another is just as important as, if not more important, than what politicians say.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_344">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_643">Any right-minded person would have no hesitation in condemning outright the thuggery that took place in Dublin on Saturday. As someone who has organised a number of marches in recent times, I have nothing but respect and admiration for gardaí and how they conducted themselves. The viciousness and mindless violence directed against reporters, including Mr. Charlie Bird, and gardaí shocked everybody. I am sure that in time the identity of those involved in organising this shameful episode will become clear. I wish the Garda Síochána every success in its investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">I was sorry to see so many gardaí injured. I am sure some may be entitled to compensation because of the severity of the injuries they received on this black Saturday. How would the Minister's proposed Garda reserve force have coped in this situation? How would people who have just spent a wet week training be able to cope with such violence and thuggery? I do not think they would have coped very well and I am sure the psychological scars that would have been left on those reserves, not to mention physical scars, would have been monstrous compared to the greater resilience of the highly trained and experienced gardaí who coped very well while under savage attack. The reserves would have been forced to retreat.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">It is always difficult to predict when an event such as last Saturday's will turn nasty. We must remember the thousands of peaceful marches that have taken place and been managed effectively and well by the Garda Síochána. We cannot allow one black Saturday to force the Garda Síochána to arm itself to such a degree that it becomes intimidating to peaceful protestors. Nor can we allow the State to interfere with the right of people to protest peacefully because of the behaviour of a couple of thugs. Whatever they were trying to do and whoever they were, they brought nothing but disgrace to themselves and their cause.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">The Love Ulster campaign had every right to protest peacefully and no one who is reasonable would dispute that right. What happened last Saturday was in total contrast to how peaceful protests should be conducted such as those by the Rossport Five and the Shell to Sea Campaign. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, made comments in the Dáil recently about intimidation and bullying but the only bullying taking place is by Shell and the Government in trying to force through a unique and dangerous pipeline carrying raw gas at unacceptably high pressure.</p>

          <p eId="para_649">Does the Minister agree the arrangements put in place last Saturday were inadequate for such a highly political event, given that it has now emerged that we had a helicopter that did not fly between the relevant times of 11 a.m. and 4 p.m., a water cannon that was across the Border and unavailable and an inadequate number of gardaí who were put in the front line without adequate personal protection or backup? In such a situation the inevitable consequence was that gardaí were exposed to injury or worse. A number were injured, as were some citizens and members of the media. There was also a lot of damage done to businesses. In that situation would the Minister agree that, from the point of view of the Garda report, it is hardly fair to the Garda Síochána to expect it to produce an independent analysis, particularly bearing in mind the need to plan for the future? Does he agree there is merit in the proposal made by Fine Gael, that we have a small independent group — not necessarily the names I mentioned, whom I merely put forward as examples — to analyse the situation, quickly produce a report and allow us to learn lessons from what happened last Saturday and try to ensure we never see its like again?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_348">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_650">I have total confidence in the leadership of the Garda Síochána. They made decisions on the basis of their professional experience. They have reported to me and I have reported to the House that they did not anticipate that a group of 200 or 300 people would come to disrupt the event in the way they did. Garda management made a decision about the nature of policing. It decided that it should be a soft cap event and that it would keep the public order unit, colloquially known as the riot squad, in reserve. These were decisions made in good faith and on the basis of many years' experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">People are saying that somehow the buck stops with me. I am politically accountable for the policing function in this State but in saying that, if we had accepted the alternative view, proposed by some in Opposition, that we should have a police authority, I would be sitting here with my arms folded saying, "I have no response to make to any of you. Go and ask the chairman of the police authority what happened." However, since I am Minister, responsible in a democratic assembly, I attest that we entrust to the Garda Síochána professional judgement, expertise and give it discretion as to how it conducts such an event. I stand by it and do not dump on it in public just because something unexpected happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">I ask the House to accept that there is no suggestion whatsoever that the Garda Síochána did not put time into preparing for this event, was careless, sent out young men and women as canon fodder for people whom it expected to turn up or in any way acted carelessly. The record which I put before the House shows that the Garda Síochána spent weeks preparing for the event and took a view on the matter. I do not dump on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">It should be said on the floor of the House that when the Commissioner and deputy commissioner went to visit Garda stations afterwards to thank the gardaí who had been involved in these events, they were cheered to the echo and received a standing ovation for their on the ground, hands-on approach to what had happened on that day. There are people here who are saying gardaí on the street were let down by management but that most certainly was not the view on Saturday evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">Deputy Cowley came up with what I consider to be a very inane point, namely, how reservists would have coped. Perhaps he would put his thinking cap on for once in his life and ask whether it would be sensible to bring gardaí from Blackrock, Kill o' the Grange and Cabinteely into Dublin to reinforce their colleagues in the city centre and for a reservist in the local area, a skilled and trained person, to stand in for them for the afternoon behind the station counter. Perhaps he would think about this before he speaks in future. While he is on the subject, perhaps he would consider how it is that in Britain its police forces have to deal with riots and nobody at that stage says it should not have a reserve. One can make good points and bad points in the House but that is one of the worst points I have heard.</p>

          <p eId="para_657">Deputy Kehoe said this was a matter of resources. It most certainly was not a matter of resources. There was no question of any downward pressure on the officers who made the decision in this case not to deploy resources. In the course of consultations I asked about helicopters and water cannons. I am satisfied they were all considered carefully by the gardaí who made the decisions. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I do not micromanage the way in which the Garda carries out its affairs. I had no hand, act or part in its preparation for this event. I am not saying that to wash my hands of it. I am saying it would be improper if I, from the vastness of St. Stephen's Green, was to say this should be a hard hat helmet event not a soft cap event or <i>vice versa</i>. If I had got it wrong and had intervened in those circumstances the Deputies opposite would ask what I was doing by intervening in this way and they would ask me to take personal responsibility for the error of my ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">It is not my function and I have never once offered advice to the Garda Commissioner or the regional commissioners as to how they should discharge their functions. I do not do that. It is foolish, in this House, to claim that the Minister sits there working out the response or what preparations should be made for President Bush's visit to Ireland, the May Day events, the St. Patrick's Day events or the Easter parade. I do not do those kind of things. We have a Garda Síochána which has a Commissioner, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners. Members have a clear record of who did what and why they did it, what they knew and what they did not know. It is time we resisted the temptation to dump on them and that we remember who were the people who caused the mayhem. It was not the Garda or its management but the perpetrators.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_661">——it appears the Garda had no knowledge in regard to the matter. It seems strange, as the Minister said, that the top brass was praised to the rafters and the representative body for the rank and file was straight into the breach to condemn what had taken place. Presumably there is some contact between the rank and file and their leaders. Will the Minister clarify how the initial request for the march took place? Was it that William Frazer, as the background document report states, contacted Pearse Street Garda station on 8 December 2005? That is the contact with the Garda, but what political contact was made? To whom was contact made and why did he go to Pearse Street Garda station rather than any other Garda station to contact the Garda? Why was the particular route chosen considering its potential for serious conflict and the absolute impossibility of maintaining a secure route there? Why was the particular date and time chosen, a busy Saturday afternoon on a match day? Having been present for a period I was there when the helicopter flew over at approximately 4.15 p.m. after more than three hours of rampaging through the streets. Can the Minister say where the helicopter was and where it experienced the difficulties? Did it experience difficulties in taking off to come to Dublin? I had thought the helicopter was located in the vicinity of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I will not dwell on the equipment except to say I saw a large number of young female gardaí totally unprotected with any form of headgear on the street for up to three hours. Questions have to be asked about that type of policing. It certainly appeared to be ill-prepared and ill-equipped. Will the Minister agree there is a need for a broader investigation than an internal Garda investigation? The Minister set up the Ombudsman Commission for the purpose of looking into matters where there were serious questions arising in regard to Garda activities. Given that there was so much danger to life and limb of the marchers and of the citizenry and much property damaged, which has done irreparable damage to our reputation abroad, it is time to put in place an independent investigation that will look at the broader circumstances of what happened, how it happened and why we ended up with a debacle in O'Connell Street.</p>

          <p eId="para_672">As to the route chosen, as the Deputy will see from the report from the Garda Síochána, the original application of the FAIR group was to assemble in O'Connell Street and march to the Dáil. They were told by the Garda Síochána that it was customary when having a political demonstration in Dublin to use Parnell Square as the assembly point and to move from there to the Dáil. That is the only significant input the Garda had in regard to the projected route of the march.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">On the Deputy's point about gardaí not having helmets and the like available to them, a decision was made which is clearly documented in the material I provided for the House that the public order unit would be kept in reserve and that the ordinary uniform would be worn by gardaí escorting the parade. That is the explanation as I understand it.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_676">No decision was made to withdraw gardaí from the front line, if that is what is being suggested. Rather, the public order unit was brought in.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">The decisions made are fully documented in the material I have supplied to the House and I will not dump on the competence of those who made them. They were made in good faith and those concerned have handled many demonstrations in their time. I adopt fully the words of the agreed motion to the effect that gardaí behaved in a fair and proportionate way. One Member has stated that perhaps gardaí should have used more force. However, if they had baton charged much more extensively than they did and if they had done so earlier, perhaps many would be complaining that they were collateral innocent victims who were just present to see what was happening and that gardaí assaulted them as part of a security sweep to deal with those causing trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Let us remember that, as far as I know, there has not been one single story or complaint to the effect that gardaí over-reacted, assaulted a single individual or went for one journalist or bystander. They acted with remarkable restraint, discipline and professionalism. Let us stand up and say this is good rather than bad.</p>

        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_367">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_679">The questions I want to ask are designed to elicit facts. The Garda is to be commended for preventing the circumstances from becoming even worse. This must be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">Bearing in mind that the Minister mentioned Cabinteely Garda station and other stations far from the city centre, is it not the case that gardaí were drafted in at very short notice from Carlow, for example? Within what radius did the authorities search for available gardaí? I met some of the walking wounded near their stations in Santry on Saturday night and suggested to them Santry was far from the city centre, but they stated gardaí had to be drafted in from as far away as Carlow.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The Minister has mentioned there was no prior notice in the Garda reports of a riot being in preparation. This is somewhat contradictory, given that litter bins in the city centre were sealed at the weekend, presumably to prevent the placement of litter bin bombs, for example. I appreciate the benefit of hindsight in stating various building materials in the city centre should really have been removed and that the city council had a job to do in that regard. Was there a breakdown in this matter or was the information available only partial? If sealing litter bins was considered wise, why was the ammunition on the building site not removed?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_368">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_682">That is a good question. The Deputy will note from the material supplied that the question of the building materials on the works on O'Connell Street had been the subject of six separate meetings between the Garda and city council officials. The Garda stressed throughout those meetings that the building materials were to be made secure. Given that the materials were made secure behind relatively light barriers, I admit it might have been an idea to deploy gardaí in or around the compound so as to prevent access thereto. However, the way in which the disorder developed was such that, at a critical moment, gardaí did not have access to the area. The time for the decision had elapsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">We can all be wise after the event. The Garda officers, sergeants, inspectors, superintendents and regional assistant commissioner are all strongly on the side of their members and do not send them into danger willingly. They prepared carefully for the event and believed they had made adequate preparation. There would never be a riot in the city of Dublin if intelligence was perfect and if the Garda response was always 100% adequate. It simply could not occur in such circumstances but we live in a world in which there are riots.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Let us not get carried away and say the whole world is looking at Ireland and asking what kind of society there is there and in its capital. There are equivalent disturbances in Paris virtually every day of the week and I do not hear people say they will not visit that city. There are disturbances in London and other places but the world does not decide their societies are in failure. The grotesque thuggery was engaged in by a small group and I believe the majority abroad will understand this.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The Ceann Comhairle, being from a Border constituency, will understand that a number of the people who came down to Dublin in buses had intended to go shopping before going home. It is sad that many of them, owing to their political persuasion, had never put a foot into this State before Saturday, although they live in Border regions. This makes me feel very sorry about the outcome of the march and their experience. I reiterate, however, that they did have their parade; they did have their meeting and their bands did play. They did so outside Leinster House. Therefore, the thugs who tried to frustrate them were not entirely successful. They got back to Northern Ireland safely.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">Does the Minister find it ironic that the sectarian hooligan element deployed to prevent a demonstration by persons who had a democratic right to demonstrate should now be cited as an argument to curb the right to peaceful assembly in Dublin city centre? Does he realise that when officialdom in Dublin City Council previously attempted to curb seriously the right to protest freely and demonstrate peacefully, there was great opposition from civil groups, trade union groups and people in general? Does he recognise that the right to stage a democratic peaceful protest is not contingent on the mandarins in Dublin City Council but is a right to be enjoyed by all citizens?</p>

          <p eId="para_691">I welcome the opportunity to question the Minister further. I reject totally his dismissal of my asking how the proposed Garda reserve force would function in circumstances such as those in question. Will members of the reserve force not have to deal with them? The Minister promised 2,000 extra gardaí, yet, to deal with such circumstances, we are to have 900 reserve gardaí. I have praised gardaí because of their training in Templemore, etc. Will the Minister assure the House that the reserve gardaí will have the same capabilities and resilience as gardaí who have been fully trained? Will he confirm that they will receive just a week or two of training, which contrasts with the great length of time mainstream gardaí spend training in Templemore? How can he reject my criticism of this plan, when it is clear that the proposed reserve gardaí will encounter unexpected situations such as that in Dublin last Saturday?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_374">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_692">I will respond to Deputy Cowley's first point by reminding him that the Garda is being expanded by more than 1,000 members per annum. That has been the case for the last year and will continue to be the case for the next two years. The force will reach a total strength, of gardaí in training and fully qualified gardaí, of 14,000 by December this year. All 14,000 members will be fully attested and trained by late 2007 or early 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">All the points made by Deputy Cowley about the proposed Garda reserve apply equally to Britain where such arguments have been found to be entirely shallow and meaningless. I have not heard anyone suggest I should telephone my opposite number in Britain, the Home Secretary, Mr. Charles Clarke MP, to tell him that we have a brilliant new insight in Ireland and that he should disband his reserve force immediately because reservists are a danger to the proper and professional policing of society. Although I have listened carefully, I have not heard anyone come up with a single convincing argument against the establishment of a Garda reserve. My door remains open to any new arguments in that regard. I remind Deputy Cowley that the House voted by an overwhelming majority to support the creation of a Garda reserve. The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights would be a good forum in which to test these arguments. The Deputy can attend the committee's meetings and participate in its proceedings if he likes.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Deputy Joe Higgins spoke about the right to congregate. I am aware that the majority of the members of Dublin City Council are against by-laws. I am not a member of the body, but I tend to agree with its members in this regard. I think the majority are correct because I do not know which officials at city management level — I presume the councillors would not be given the right to start handing out permits — would be deemed to be the competent deciders of who could or could not protest in the city. This proposal raises as many problems at it would address. I do not see how determining that the Rathmines and Rathgar plant breeders' association cannot parade, but the Socialist Workers' Party can could be deemed to be a management function. I do not understand the basis on which such a decision could be made. Under common law, the Garda Síochána which carries out this function is entitled to uphold the law, maintain the peace and ensure traffic continues to move. It does a good job of upholding people's constitutional right to freedom of assembly and expression, in general terms. I am not aware of the adoption by the Garda in this city of a heavy-handed policy on the right of assembly and protest. I would like to see the details of a scheme that would improve the situation by giving unelected officials the right to authorise one demonstration, rather than another.</p>

          <p eId="para_696">Perhaps Deputy Higgins will be pleased to note that there is a point of difference on these benches in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">I assure Deputy Ó Snodaigh that I am wholly unaware that anyone in Store Street Garda station asked anyone in authority for additional resources. The assistant commissioner for the Dublin area was responsible for deciding what the level of resources would be. I am not aware of the discussions he had with the station management in any area. The decision was entirely made by the Garda Síochána; it was not made by reference to whether resources were available. The Garda has been given unprecedented resources. I ask the House to remember that the force's budget increased by 13% this year, following a considerable increase last year. The Garda's overtime budget has increased substantially this year. The decision was not made by reference to a directive from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about how money should or should not be spent. In any particular case such a decision is based on the professional judgment of senior Garda management.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_699">I thank Deputies for the support they have expressed for the motion which I hope will be adopted by the House without debate at the end of this discussion. It is right that there is accountability in Parliament for what happens on our streets. It is right that a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be politically accountable to his or her colleagues in Dáil Éireann because that is what the Constitution envisages. If something goes wrong, it is right that the Minister should accept or reject this as he or she sees fit. It is not right, however, to say the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day makes hands-on decisions, or decisions in principle, on issues on which the professional judgment of policemen is surely preferable in most cases to the political judgment of elected Ministers. Such a suggestion is factually groundless. Under our system, the Garda Síochána is given operational independence, subject under the new Act to the capacity of the Minister to make directions which are matters of public record in any particular case. The Garda Commissioner will this summer become the force's Accounting Officer and the financial controller of its annual voted resources. It is correct, when decisions are being taken on the manner in which a particular demonstration, march, parade or assembly should be policed, that the Garda should be given the discretion that reflects the professional judgment of its members.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">I do not doubt that lessons will be learned from what happened last Saturday. I do not suggest everything was perfect. As I said, if there is a riot, it is obviously due in one sense to an absence of knowledge or sufficient numbers on the ground to deal with it. That is true, by definition. That is the view in retrospect, but the view in prospect relates to what it was reasonable to do on the day in question. That is the view we have to take in respect of all these matters. We need to consider what it was reasonable for gardaí to do. For example, did they depart from a reasonable standard in the circumstances? On the basis of the material provided in the preliminary report — it is not a final report — I have made available to Members, the Garda acted carefully and with a good deal of forethought. It did not believe violence of the kind that took place was a realistic possibility. Anyone who doubts this is suggesting the Garda took a chance — that it carelessly exposed its members to dangers in a manner that was unprofessional and did not benefit from advance thought.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">I ask Deputies to examine the material I have furnished to them. We need to consider the plans put in place. I was asked whether St. John's Ambulance was involved in the preparations for the demonstration. An elaborate hospital plan was put together in case anything went wrong. A representative of the Health Service Executive was present in the control room. Health authorities and local authorities were consulted about anything that could go wrong. Talks were held with all political parties which, in the opinion of the Garda, were likely to mount any kind of counter-demonstration. As Deputy Joe Higgins said, people have the right to hold counter-demonstrations as long as they do so peacefully. The Garda received full co-operation from the parties with which it engaged prior to the demonstration, with the exception of Republican Sinn Féin which I have condemned for its failure to co-operate. It is regrettable that it decided, on the basis of its contempt for the State and its institutions, including the Garda, that it would not indicate the nature of the protest it was planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">I would like to return to a fundamental point. What happened outside Leinster House on Saturday was an exercise of the constitutional rights and liberties which the State guarantees to all. We might not like the message of those who were demonstrating on Saturday — some of us may be very strongly opposed to it. Some of us may be very strongly of the view that there was an absence of good faith on the part of some of them in respect of what they had to say or how they had to say it. However, that is not the test that applies in a constitutional liberal republic to whether someone should or should not be allowed to protest on our streets. We must be willing to listen to voices and allow parades by people with whom we radically disagree. Those who assaulted gardaí never got to assault the objects of their hatred and sectarian bitterness. They only came across the gardaí in front of them. That they never laid a finger on the demonstrators is due to the professionalism and courage of the Garda Síochána and the wise decisions made by Garda management on the day. In defending the rights of the persons concerned to come to Dublin the Garda Síochána was upholding the Constitution. What was done was not republican in any shape or form. I was interested to hear this point echoed by Deputies Crowe and Ó Snodaigh. What was done attacked the very basis of republicanism. To carry a tricolour and, at the same time, attack a garda defending the right of fellow citizens to express their point of view is despicable, cowardly and yellow. It turns the stomach of every person who rightly claims to be a republican.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to be accountable this evening. Lessons will be learned by the Garda Síochána. The proposal was made that I should establish an independent group to look into the events, but Garda management has plenty of material to make its own inquiries and learn the lessons involved. We do not need an outside agency to do this, but will soon have an inspectorate. It will be open to the Minister of the day to ask it to look at whether professional standards were or were not maintained by the Garda in specific cases. In the meantime, having spoken to the Commissioner and the assistant commissioners responsible, I am sure they acted in good faith with the interests of the Constitution at heart. We should not judge them harshly with the aid of retrospection. On the day they did their duty in unexpectedly violent circumstances and upheld the best traditions of the Garda Síochána. Everyone from the assistant commissioner to trainee gardaí with blue bands on their epaulettes — I noticed a few of them in the photographs — did the State proud last Saturday.</p>

          <p eId="para_718">—immediately publish the final report of the task force on student behaviour, under the chairmanship of Maeve Martin;</p>
          <p eId="para_719">—outline its legislative response to tackling school discipline problems, in particular, its response to the difficulties posed by section 29 of the Education Act 1998; and</p>
          <p eId="para_720">—put in place specific measures to make schools good places to teach, and to learn, including the implementation of a national anti-bullying strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">When Ireland banned school corporal punishment in 1982, it was clearly the right thing to do. At the time we recognised that physical forms of punishment were totally inappropriate in an educational context. It was a good day for our education system and the children of the State. A regulation was circulated to all schools by the then Minister for Education, John Boland. It stated teachers should have a lively regard for the improvement and general welfare of their pupils, treat them with kindness combined with firmness and should aim at governing them through their affections and reason, not by harshness and severity. Ridicule, sarcasm or remarks likely to undermine a pupil's self-confidence should not be used in any circumstances. It further stated the use of corporal punishment was forbidden and that any teacher who contravened either section of the rule would be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and would be subject to severe disciplinary action.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The regulations were very clear. The use of corporal punishment was expressly forbidden. However, all of the focus was placed on the behaviour of the teacher. The responsibilities of our young people, including how they should interact with their peers and teachers, were not detailed. This is an imbalance we must redress today. Alongside the right to free education, there is a dual responsibility that our young people engage in their schooling in a way that does not undermine or harass their teachers, or disrupt the learning of others. It seems that while the right decision was made more than 20 years ago, we have not yet put in place a proper alternative that every student can understand and respect. To ensure our classrooms are the best possible places in which to learn and teach, this issue must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">Poor student behaviour and lack of discipline damage the educational prospects of all children at school. The negative impact of disruption in the classroom includes wasting the teacher's time in sorting out disruptions and tying up processing issues due to classroom disruption; students becoming disheartened or intimidated by the behaviour of some of their peers; teacher morale being compromised; the standing of the school in the community being diminished; the educational attainment of students being lowered; and a disproportionate amount of time being allocated to the disruptive students at the expense of those more compliant children and young people. I am deeply concerned at the long-term damage done to individual young people and society as a whole, if we allow some to believe mistakenly that schools are places where anything goes when it comes to unacceptable behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">To address the growing problems in our schools, the task force on student behaviour was set up by the Minister for Education and Science under the chairmanship of Dr. Maeve Martin and began its work a little over a year ago. The task force was asked to consider and report on the issue of student behaviour in second level schools. It produced an interim report in July 2005 which made for chilling reading in parts.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">In undertaking its work the task force encountered examples of seriously disruptive behaviour in schools, including threats against teachers and their property, fighting, assault and the carrying of dangerous weapons on school property. Some examples of student behaviour were of such a serious nature that they were considered criminal behaviour. Such activity has no place in our schools. When we focus on unacceptable behaviour in our schools, we should be clear that it is this type of behaviour to which we are referring. Students and young people should be energetic, inquisitive, resourceful, questioning and active, as these are all good traits that should be encouraged by our education system. In addressing student indiscipline we are not seeking to curb young people's individuality, creativity or energy. Instead, we are focusing on the type of behaviour identified by the task force which is clearly unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The task force's interim report noted that the perpetrators of disruption represented 5% to 10% of the school population, with those involved in extreme behaviour representing a smaller proportion of this number. However, studies by the centre for education services at Marino Institute of Education found that over 80% of respondents were of the view that the incidence of disruptive behaviour had increased during the years. This is a tide that must be turned. Otherwise, we will lose good teachers from our schools, disruptive students will find that their unacceptable behaviour goes unchallenged, and their peers will have their educational prospects squandered.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The findings of the interim report highlight the challenges that we face in making the school environment a good place to be for both students and teachers. The task force also stressed the negative effect that disruptive behaviour could have on the educational attainment of all students in the classroom. Today, we must accept that disruptive students do not have the right to undermine other young people's educational opportunities or achievements. Some teachers' representatives have questioned the findings of the interim report, stating they do not adequately reflect the realities that they face each and every day in the classroom. Certainly, the task force has encountered examples of student behaviour which could easily have been reported to the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">When it comes to student behaviour and discipline, our schools are not receiving the backup they need from the Department of Education and Science and other bodies. The Department guidelines entitled, Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline, were published in circular M33/91 in 1991. It is time to revisit the guidelines and make changes where necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, school boards of management are obliged to draw up codes of behaviour for students. The National Educational Welfare Board is drafting guidelines for schools on how to address this code. I hope they will be available soon. In recent years there have been considerable developments and changes in Irish society. Many students have mobile phones and access to the Internet at home and school, leading to the emergence of new forms of bullying and bad behaviour. These developments need to be reflected in up-to-date guidelines that take account of technological and other developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">The Minister should without further delay publish the final report of the task force which has been with her since January. I note from the Government's amendment that the report will be published in March. I look forward to this but it is a pity it will not be published earlier. To expedite the recommendations of the task force, the publication of this report is clearly necessary. Teachers and educators are waiting to assess the recommendations of the report and see what action will be taken by the Minister to implement new proposals. Obviously, the action taken on foot of the report is a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">In its interim report the task force noted that many schools were deeply frustrated with section 29 of the Education Act 1998. In the majority of cases, section 29 is used to undermine the authority of schools in expelling seriously disruptive students. This can lead to schools being forced to accept as students young people previously expelled for seriously disruptive behaviour. In such cases, the students return to the school secure in the knowledge that there is no real action the authorities can take against their unacceptable behaviour. This is unacceptable. The Irish Vocational Education Association has estimated that of the 34 student appeals against expulsions in the vocational education sector in the past three years, only seven pupils had subsequently been expelled. Its general secretary commented: "In a number of cases, our schools report to us that they are under particular pressure to reintegrate the pupil, who then often returns with a swagger, having achieved a victory against the school authorities".</p>
          <p eId="para_732">In the last school year alone the Department of Education and Science overturned at least eight school expulsions, returning to these schools students who had been deemed to be seriously and continuously in breach of the school code of behaviour. What message does this send, both to the individuals concerned and the school? Surely this system undermines the ethos of discipline and acceptable behaviour in our education system. In addition, the time it takes to process appeals is onerous, removing the school principal from the day-to-day tasks that demand his or her full attention. While individual rights must be respected, we must also have the utmost regard for the rights of the school community. One individual does not have the right to disrupt the education of every other child in the class.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">School codes of behaviour must be very clear as to what behaviour will result in suspension or expulsion. Students and their parents must be left in no doubt as to the seriousness of certain types of behaviour. In addition, the school code of behaviour must outline clearly the process which must be followed in the case of a school making the decision to expel a pupil. If these matters are made crystal clear for all students, appeals against the decision to expel should only consider whether the correct process had been followed by the school in question. If the school has followed a fair process and documented each step of the way leading to the expulsion of the student, the Department should recognise and vindicate the actions of the school and not overturn the decision to expel. We must have greater trust in our schools and teachers and respect the fact that the decision to expel a student is never taken lightly. Appeals to the Department under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 should be amended to take account of this fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">Schools also come under pressure to accept disruptive students once again into their ranks because the Minister has failed to provide real educational alternatives for young people displaying challenging behaviour. While we must support the right of schools to expel in certain situations, we must also address the needs of those students who do not fit into the school system. A more dramatic response is required. We should examine the establishment of a small network of new schools which would be designed for students with very challenging behaviour, who have been expelled or dropped out from mainstream second level schools.</p>

          <p eId="para_740">A small network of separate schools would not only help expelled students to reach their individual educational targets, they would also target resources towards young people in difficulty. The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, has stated her support for Youthreach time and again but these programmes are still on a pilot basis. Youthreach should be put on a statutory basis so it can be rolled out nationally, helping in the recruitment of the most dynamic teachers committed to this programme. When young people leave school early, it can be monumentally difficult to get them to re-engage with the education system and this can be addressed through the Youthreach programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">As part of a new, innovative approach to behaviour issues, schools should enter into behaviour contracts with their students. This would involve the school organising a meeting for all parents and students, or individual students and parents if necessary, at which the school code of behaviour would be explained in detail. Parents and students would be informed of the warnings that would be given and actions taken in cases of poor behaviour. In this way, every student and their parents would know exactly where they stand if, for example, the student disrupted his or her class, was found to be bullying another student or was guilty of causing damage to school or teachers' property. Every second level student in the State would have a copy of their school's code of behaviour. Indeed, this process could be considered to some extent for primary schools as well. As part of this process, students and their parents would be asked to confirm that they fully understand the code of behaviour and the actions the school can take to enforce it.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">In her submission to the task force on student behaviour, the Ombudsman for Children noted that there seemed to be a lack of awareness of the code of behaviour and discipline procedures in schools. This must be addressed. Parents, too, have a clear responsibility with regard to the education of their children in what is, and is not, appropriate behaviour. Parents must be fully engaged with schools in tackling discipline problems and in ensuring that their children act towards their teachers and peers in a way that is acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">We must honestly engage with the huge resourcing problems that face our schools on a daily basis. For example, I recently uncovered from replies to parliamentary questions that half of all primary schools have no access to the national educational psychological service, NEPS. Many young children who need extra assistance from the early days of their education are being left behind by the Government. By the time they reach second level school, they are growing increasingly frustrated with the system and this contributes to disruptive classroom behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Access to these types of services is, undoubtedly, important from an educational point of view. However, these services also contribute to children and young people settling into school properly and combat early school leaving. Meeting the needs of all our children, without the excessive delays that characterise our education system, and listening to and engaging with young people openly will go a long way to improving the classroom and school environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">Trainee teachers must be given all the necessary assistance in dealing with disruptive behaviour in the best possible and most up-to-date manner. Some inexperienced teachers, when presented with a case of serious indiscipline, may simply not know the best way in which it can be handled. Unwittingly, a discipline problem might be exacerbated by inappropriate action from an inexperienced teacher. All possible assistance should be given to new teachers to ensure that this does not happen and enhanced in-service training should be given to all teachers, new and existing.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">An expansion of the home-school liaison service should be prioritised so that problems in the home environment, which may contribute to indiscipline in the classroom, can be properly assessed and assisted. There should also be greater co-operation between the Department of Education and Science and the HSE as some children fall between the remits of these two bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">Guidance services in place in schools are poor at best. Schools with an enrolment of fewer than 200 pupils receive only eight hours of career guidance counselling per week. Guidance counsellors could play an important role in improving the school environment through one-to-one and group involvement with students, but at present they are snowed under due to a lack of adequate resources. Serious breaches of school discipline or threatening behaviour against teachers should be reported immediately to the Department of Education and Science, which should know which schools face the greatest discipline challenges when allocating resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">The involvement of students in discipline structures in our schools should be examined. Peer pressure can be a strong motivator for behavioural change. As well as involving student councils in the drafting of school codes of behaviour, there is room to go much further. A pilot project should be undertaken with a number of volunteer schools where students are involved in every aspect of the school's approach to discipline. This would mean that students would agree the text of the school discipline policy and would have a decision-making role with regard to the penalties that their peers face if guilty of breaking this policy. This would also mean that students are involved not only when problems occur but also at an earlier stage in managing and preventing lapses in discipline. As well as tackling school discipline problems, my concerns in this area also extend to the pressing need to introduce a national anti-bullying strategy in all primary and secondary schools. We need to explode the myth that bullying is a normal part of growing up for many children. Bullying is a deeply destructive behaviour that can have long-term negative consequences for individuals. In some extreme cases, it can lead and sadly has led to suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">Tackling student discipline problems and bullying behaviour at school would have a longer-term positive effect throughout society. Young people must be given clearer guidance and direction when their behaviour is unacceptable. To take a longer-term view, workplace bullying costs Irish business up to €3 billion per annum through poor productivity and absenteeism, children and young people of today will be the workers of tomorrow. They must learn that unacceptable behaviour at school, whether it is directed at teachers or other students, will be tackled when and where it occurs. This would also have a positive effect on tackling workplace bullying in later life.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">An anti-bullying project, undertaken in Donegal with Trinity College, Dublin and based on a Norwegian model, resulted in a reduction of more than 60% in frequent bullying. The Norwegian Government was so impressed with the success of this project that it has adopted this model for its national anti-bullying programme. It is a shame the Minister for Education and Science does not share its commitment to tackling this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">The rise in anti-social behaviour in society can be tackled by challenging bullying and violent behaviour in our schools. Tackling school bullying in an effective way would therefore bring important long-term benefits to the country as a whole. Bullying is a vicious and destructive behaviour that must be addressed. Children who are bullied cannot be left without support and help, and the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, needs to introduce a national anti-bullying strategy in all schools immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_752">I compliment Deputy Enright on her excellent contribution to the debate. I commend her for putting forward the motion, in which, as a former teacher, I have particular interest. A minority of students should not be allowed to detract from the education of the majority but, unfortunately, this is happening in many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">I am sure the Minister will agree that society has changed in the past 20 years and respect for teachers it not as it once was. Students from all socioeconomic backgrounds manifest behaviour and disciplinary problems. However, teachers in schools located in disadvantaged areas seem to encounter more difficulties and experience more disruptive behaviour, which includes threats against teachers and their property, assault and the carrying of dangerous weapons including knives, as highlighted in the interim report of the task force on student behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">Teachers need more support. They need further training to cope with the changing behaviour of their students. Only €2 million was allocated for teacher support in 2006, which can be compared to the position in Scotland, where considerable resources are made available for teacher support.</p>

          <p eId="para_770">The Minister knows everything. I suggest she considers the Scottish model to ascertain how well the Scots cope with this problem and applies that model here in Ireland as far as is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">As Deputy Enright stated, teachers' lives and careers have been ruined by the behaviour of disruptive students — I have experienced this at first hand. They have suffered loss of self-esteem and confidence and some have given up teaching because of the manner of their treatment in the classroom. They are isolated and the level of depression and mental illness is becoming increasingly prevalent among the teaching profession. However, despite the support from their own colleagues, they are given little support from the system. Many supports are available for students, rightly so, but little consideration is given to teacher supports, including psychological support services and so on. Students and their parents are increasingly litigious. Even putting a student outside a classroom door can result in a court case for a teacher. In Scotland, on-site and off-site centres are provided where educational psychologists and sociologists attempt to deal with such problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">Deputy Enright suggested that section 29 of the Education Act 1998 should be reconsidered as it is very much weighted in favour of the student. As the Minister knows, students can appeal a suspension or an expulsion. A recent newspaper article referred to a student in Cork who threatened a fellow student with a knife. He was suspended but won his appeal and when he returned to the school, he threatened the same individual again. The system is not working. Section 29 should be re-balanced and I ask the Minister to reconsider this.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">The report has been with the Minister since last January. She should publish it as soon as possible but there is no point doing so without making funds available to implement its recommendations, as was the case with many other reports. As the problem is particularly accentuated in disadvantaged areas, more support must be directed at schools located in such areas. I am sure the Minister will agree it will be difficult to get teachers to teach in such schools unless supports are provided, the pupil-teacher ratio improves and psychological services are made available to make life for the teacher easier.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">I welcome this important discussion. From my contacts with colleagues, I know discipline is a major problem and one that is becoming more serious. Society is breaking down in various ways, family life is changing and support and discipline are not available within the family as they were in the past. Unless intervention is made by the Department and the Minister, teachers will be affected, cases of burnout will increase and the noble profession of teaching will not be as attractive and will not attract those the Minister wants to attract. Assurances must be provided with regard to behavioural problems.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_404">
          <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_775">I commend Deputy Enright for putting the motion before the House. It gives us a great opportunity to speak on the important issue of discipline in the classroom, which is a vitally important aspect of the education process. Many working within the education system, particularly teachers at the coalface, feel strongly that student behaviour has deteriorated significantly in recent years. The concerns of the education partners are clearly laid out in Dr. Maeve Martin's task force report on student discipline, which makes damning reading. I urge the Minister to publish the report as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">In recent years an important array of legislative measures have underpinned the rights of young people in the education setting, notably the Education Act 1998. However, teachers have often been overlooked during this reform process.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">The importance of the role of the teacher in society cannot be underestimated. Education has proven to be the single most important component in creating Ireland's current economic success. However, while our economy has grown, our teachers have come under increased pressure in a variety of areas. Pressure is coming from the so-called points race that characterises our education system. Pressure is coming from the fact that what was once a well paid job has fallen behind in recent times and teachers are no longer adequately paid for their Trojan work. Pressure comes from vast legislative changes. The Education Act 1998, the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001 and a host of other new laws have made school life infinitely more complicated, particularly for school principals. Added to all these pressures are the problems created by indiscipline in the classroom.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">A changing society means that simply being an adult or a person in authority no longer guarantees respect from young people. While I do not categorise all young people as disrespectful, we must acknowledge that Ireland is experiencing serious social problems regarding the behaviour of some young people. Ten years ago we rarely heard the term "anti-social behaviour" in Ireland. These days we hear it every time we turn on the news and see it referred to every time we open a newspaper. In some areas people feel afraid to leave their houses because of anti-social behaviour. In today's Ireland the classroom is also affected by this disgraceful social phenomenon.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Indiscipline in the classrooms runs from using foul language to threats to teachers, damaging their property or even carrying dangerous weapons in the school environment. These are not problems that can be ignored, as they will only get worse. Indiscipline in schools has many serious consequences. It reduces the performances of students as a whole, thus preventing students from achieving their academic potential, which has consequences for the students personally and is bad for society.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The stress brought about by severe or prolonged student indiscipline forces many fine teachers out of the classroom. Many teachers leaving the profession early cite stress as the reason for early retirement. This also represents a social brain drain of the people who have given a lifetime of work and the country has invested hugely in the education of those teachers. Many potentially excellent teachers do not enter the profession as they have heard too many horror stories about good teachers having a miserable and stressful existence because of indiscipline and being powerless to do anything about it. These factors highlight why it is so important for the Government to demonstrate its commitment to social discipline. If the Government does not publish the final report of the task force on student behaviour and outline its legislative response to tackling school discipline problems, it is showing that it is not concerned with the serious consequences of disruptive behaviour in our schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">I join my colleagues on this side of the House in calling on the Government to publish the final report of the task force on student behaviour immediately and to outline its legislative response to tackling school discipline problems, paying particular attention to section 29 of the Education Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_782">I thank Deputy Enright for raising this important issue. I note that even at this early stage the Minister obviously has issues, as she disagrees with it. However, that is what politics is about. The purpose of the motion is to highlight some of the issues we need to rectify. I support the call for the Government to publish immediately the final report of the task force on student behaviour, which was chaired by Dr. Maeve Martin. In its legislative response to tackling school discipline problems, the Government must give its response to the difficulties posed in section 29 of the Education Act, a point to which I shall return later. It also needs to put in place measures to turn schools into suitable places to teach and to learn and ensure that the national anti-bullying strategy is implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">I have spoken to young teachers, often young female secondary school teachers, who have just got their first jobs. Those teaching in schools in areas of high-density population find it intolerable. They wonder what they have got themselves into. If nothing is done, we will lose some of them and in the longer term we will lose more of them. In a school with discipline problems it is impossible to get proper educational performance from students.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">The interim report of the task force on student behaviour clearly points out the disruptive behaviour in our schools, including threats against teachers and their property. It also goes on to highlight fighting, assault and the carrying of dangerous weapons on school property. Even some examples of school behaviour notified to the task force were of such a serious nature as to be considered to be criminal behaviour. Those are the task force's comments and not mine.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_790">Has she ever visited a unit in Castleblaney that courts insisted on building because there were no places for these sorts of children who were ending up in court? The cost per child is enormous. We need to consider some kind of interim structure such as that suggested by Deputy Enright and not rule it out of order. Going from one extreme to the other where students cannot stay in an ordinary school and must be placed in what is effectively a jail where they also cause difficulty and create major scenes is not in anybody's best interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Parents must also play a major role, as mentioned by previous speakers. Although many children come from single parent families or families divided by marriage break-up, much of the onus must be placed on the parents to try to ensure that children are disciplined in the home. If they are, they have a better chance in the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The lack of psychological services also creates a problem. I have discussed the matter regarding one small school where it is difficult to get children evaluated. If they are not evaluated at the right time, which should obviously be in primary school, they can often go through to secondary school still creating problems which could have been dealt with at a more appropriate level for a lower cost. The school I have in mind has an above average number of difficult students with educational or other disabilities. It has found it impossible to deal with the Department and get the services the students deserve. The minority of students must not be allowed to dictate how other students receive their education.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">Today teachers are under enormous pressure. I have come across one teacher who was literally in a state of mental health breakdown because the teacher is just not allowed to deal with the situation. Under the laws the Oireachtas has introduced, teachers are not allowed to do this, that or the next thing whereas some students are extremely aware of their rights and are willing to use them to the last when they play them up against the teacher. On the other hand, conscientious school students who want to achieve the points they need are also worried about the situation because of the lack of education they receive and their need for points if they are to continue in education.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">Deputy Deenihan mentioned anti-social behaviour. Although the anti-social behaviour situation is extremely serious, what worries me is that students who are subjected to such behaviour can sometimes be led to suicide. Where there is a lack of understanding about the bullying and pressure to which young people can be subjected, some young people simply lose the will to live. There is nothing as frightening as attending the funeral of such a teenager.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">I am not sure how speedily the Education Act 1998 was passed, but it is clear from the interim task force report that section 29 of the Act is causing problems. The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_796">it should be stated definitively that respondents and submissions argued that schools are keen to work within a framework of inclusion. They recognise that all students who form the school cohort have a right to education and ideally they would like this education to be offered within the mainstream setting. However, the perception is that when a student's behaviour is such that it is resistant to all efforts to bring it within acceptable limits and is of a nature that it interferes with the learning opportunities of peers, school authorities are powerless to remove the student from the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">That is a major indictment on us as legislators.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">The interim report continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_799">They are frequently at their most pastoral and supportive in dealing with these students and their parents/guardians, but still there remains a minority of students whose persistent challenging behaviour is beyond the scope of their interventions. The processing of a Section 29 appeal places heavy demands on a school in terms of time and with regard to expenditure in accessing legal advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">That situation was recently brought to my attention by a school principal. The issue was not just the problem itself but the fact the principal had to spend so much time away from the school ensuring the legal personnel did a proper job on his behalf. He wanted to ensure the issue was carried through because he could not bear the idea of the school losing the section 29 appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">The section 29 mechanism brings pressure on everybody, as the interim report confirms:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_802">Where an appeal is upheld the resultant lowering of morale and sense of helplessness experienced by a school staff are considerable. The Task Force acknowledges that the process surrounding a Section 29 appeal is conducted with the utmost care and meticulous attention to ensure that justice is done to all. However, whatever the hard data in statistical terms regarding Section 29 outcomes, schools consistently report frustration with the experience. The final report from this Task Force will make considered recommendations in line with the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">We must give serious consideration to the task force's final recommendations on how to get us out of that bind. The interim report concludes:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_804">The issue of student discipline has so many facets to it that, as suggested earlier, it will require a response not just from individual sectors of the school community, but, also from the total spectrum of players working in harmony towards a common goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">We must all work together. Not everyone will agree with all the task force's proposals but they should at least be used as a basis for producing constructive alternatives.</p>

          <p eId="para_811">—notes the fact that a Task Force established by the Minister has now completed its work;</p>
          <p eId="para_812">—commends the fact that funding has been provided in 2006 to commence the implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force; and</p>
          <p eId="para_813">—notes further the Minister's intention to publish the Report and set out her intended approach to implementation in March 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">I am glad to have the opportunity to outline to the House the manner in which I have approached the issue of student behaviour in our second level schools. As Deputies will be aware, on becoming Minister for Education and Science I said that my overriding priority would be to ensure our education system enabled every child to reach his or her full potential. Of course, in order to achieve this we need the right learning environment in our schools. We need to ensure local schools have a positive atmosphere that supports learning and promotes a sense of community among students, teachers and parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">One thing I have stressed from the start is that securing a positive learning environment in all our schools requires a multifaceted approach, as a whole range of factors influence a school's success in this regard. Effective teaching styles, strong school leadership and a fair procedure for dealing with disruption are vital. Access to good professional supports for teachers is also vital, as are opportunities for students to have a role in decision-making in their schools and for parents to build positive relationships with their child's teachers. The extent to which the curriculum is relevant to the needs of the individual student is also extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">It is my belief that student behaviour is determined by a range of factors, all of which we must address. That belief has underpinned my approach to this issue and is reflected in the terms of reference I gave the task force on student behaviour when I established it this time last year. However, the Opposition motion before us and the extremely alarmist press release issued over the weekend show no grasp of the complexities of the issue. I regret that some parties are more interested in headline grabbing than in approaching the issue in a responsible and well considered way.</p>

          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_824">While it is clear that no level of such behaviour is acceptable, it is irresponsible in the extreme to suggest this type of behaviour is a generalised problem across our education system that all schools are required to grapple with. The reality is that the vast majority of students in our schools are well-behaved. Schools that have effective codes of behaviour in place find that these are generally sufficient to deal with disruption when it occurs. These codes of behaviour should be drawn up by every school in conjunction with students and parents who sign up to them. Generally, schools that have effective procedures are in a position to deal with such behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">The reason I established a task force on student behaviour was not because student disruption is at crisis level in our schools but because I want to ensure we spread examples of best practice more widely and that my Department has the right policies and supports in place to enable schools to provide a positive learning environment for all their students. I also wanted to ensure the group benefited from a wide range of expertise and experience. Therefore, the 12-member task force included teachers from both mainstream schools and alternative school provision, school principals, and a parent who was a solicitor. The task force was chaired by Dr. Maeve Martin, a psychologist working in teacher education. I am grateful to the task force and its chair for the detailed consideration that they gave to such a broad area in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">When I announced the establishment of the task force, I stated I wanted the group to consult widely and to engage with all partners so every view could be heard. The task force began its work by inviting, by public advertisement, submissions from interested individuals and groups. More than 150 submissions were received from agencies, advocacy groups, subject associations, targeted initiative personnel, school groups — comprising teachers, parents and students — and, of course, individuals. Some of the submissions are posted on the link to the task force, which is accessible through the Department of Education and Science home page, <i>www.education.ie</i>. The submissions provide a wide spectrum of views on the issues pertaining to student behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">At an early stage, the task force prioritised collaboration with the partners in education as a guiding feature of its work. The task force held 19 plenary sessions in 2005 at which each of the partners in education, including parents, students and teachers, was invited to make an oral submission. A plenary session with all the partners was held on 12 October 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Time spent with the partners, both at meetings and in analysing their written submissions, provided the task force not only with insights into issues of concern for their various constituencies, but with a deep appreciation of the complexity of student behaviour. That process of consultation with the partners in education has provided an opportunity for all the major stakeholders in our education system to be intimately involved in the work of the task force and to inform its final report and recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">In recognition that school is only one facet of a young person's life and the realisation that some students come into contact with a variety of agencies other than the school, the task force also identified and consulted several agencies and advocacy groups with high levels of expertise and relevance in the area of youth and schooling.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">Ten consultative fora were held around the country at several second level schools, as well as centres of alternative provision such as Youthreach centres and Youth Encounter programmes. Those fora allowed the task force to flesh out in a very real way many of the written submissions that came to it from a variety of sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">The task force delivered its interim report in June 2005. Although that report refrained from making recommendations, it provided the framework for subsequent discussions with the partners in education that have informed the recommendations contained in the final report.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The interim report concentrated on an analysis of the nature of the issue and a refining of the emerging areas likely to require recommendations in its final report. In line with the terms of reference given to the task force, the interim report examined the nature, scale and impact of disruptive behaviour, the effectiveness of strategies employed at present to address disruptions and best practice nationally and internationally in promoting positive behaviour. Following that, the report set out areas that it would examine in making recommendations in the final report.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Regarding the nature, scale and impact of disruptive behaviour, the report found that breaches of school discipline are on a continuum ranging from relatively minor infringements to gross misbehaviour. At the less serious end, the report contains a range of frequently cited examples, which include non-stop talking, coming late for class, failure to bring relevant class materials, constantly challenging the teacher's authority and using mobile telephones in ways and times that are inappropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">At the other end of the continuum are issues of gross indiscipline posing severe risks to the safety and well-being of teachers and peers. Those incidences, while very limited, can be extremely serious. The impact of misbehaviour is varied, but it includes a lowering of morale in the school community, inroads into valuable teaching and learning time and cumulative stress for teachers in the performance of their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">The data reported give a flavour of the kinds of disruption that schools are encountering. In scale, the data suggest that the perpetrators represent about 5% to 10% of the school population, of which those engaged in extreme behaviour represent a very small proportion of students. There is also evidence to suggest that the challenging behaviour documented may not be found in some schools and, where it occurs, may be more manifest in some schools than in others. It would be wrong to give the impression that this crisis is general and affects every school in the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_837">The reason that I set up the task force in the first instance was that I recognised that this had the potential to become a very serious problem. Having been asked by the ASTI and the TUI to do so, I was very swift in obliging and asking the commission to report speedily.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">Regarding the effectiveness of strategies currently employed to address disruption, the report documents a range of measures or variables that enable schools to promote a positive school environment. Those include the building of healthy relationships within the school; a school culture that is pastoral, effective leadership and skilled, dedicated staff, active teaching methodologies that involve differentiated teaching, meaningful parental involvement, giving students a voice, a broad curriculum that meets the needs of all learners; access to a range of extracurricular activities, a positive behaviour policy that is owned and consistently implemented and good structures and supports operating effectively in the school. On the matter of best practice nationally and internationally, the interim report found that international research tended to stress the same broad range of success factors as I have outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">As I said, having examined the nature, scale and impact of disruptive behaviour, the effectiveness of strategies currently employed to address disruption and best practice nationally and internationally, the interim report set out a framework in which the task force would consider recommendations for the final report. Its final report was delivered to me in late January and will be published in March. At that point, I will set out the steps that will be taken to respond to its recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Tonight, however, I would like to highlight some of the steps that I have taken in the past year to deal with the types of issues that I identified earlier as crucial to ensuring a positive learning environment. While the task force has been working on making specific recommendations for future action in this area, I have at the same time prioritised improvements in training and support services for teachers, greater access to leadership development for school principals and the provision of more guidance counsellors.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Regarding teacher training, it is vital that we prioritise continuous professional development for teachers if we are to help them stay at the top of their game. In the current context, we all know that the standard of teaching can have a major motivating, or demotivating, impact on student behaviour. My commitment to this area is clear from the fact that this year my Department's provision for in-service training is nearly €27 million. That represents an increase of 15% on the figure for 2005. There was also a similar increase in the preceding year.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">Apart from providing improved training opportunities for teachers, I have also focused on improving the training that we give to school principals through a major expansion of the leadership development for schools service. The LDS programme recognises the beneficial impact that leadership can have in promoting a positive school climate conducive to learning and teaching. LDS programmes cover areas such as strategies to promote positive behaviour in the school, human resource management skills to empower teachers and help those who might be disaffected, ways of involving students in school decision-making and the importance of good communication between the whole school community. The LDS programme has expanded in the past two years from a focus on new school principals to working with established principals and is an initiative that I intend to develop further in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">Over the past year, I have stressed to teachers' groups the need for all schools to have a student council. Deputy Enright said that there should be a group of schools where students have a voice and are strongly involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_849">Of course it is not happening in every school, but I stress that we will not do this only on a pilot basis as I want every school to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">I strongly believe that one cannot simply teach students about rights and responsibilities in the CSPE class, one must also give them actual responsibilities in the place where they spend much of their day. Many schools have found that giving students a say in school decision-making has helped create a sense of partnership between students and staff and contributed to developing a positive environment in the school. A working group on student councils has recently completed very valuable work in this area and produced much material, including a website, to support schools in the establishment and operation of effective student councils.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">The other group that must have a voice in the school is parents. They are partners in education and must be genuinely involved in the education of young people. It is not sufficient simply to have two parents on the board of management or involved in fundraising. Their active involvement can ensure that aside from issues like behaviour, all other good practices in schools can also be far more effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">In the past year, I have also stressed my commitment to supporting educational pathways outside the school system which may be better suited to the needs of some students than is the formal school system. This is not, as Deputy Enright suggested, a permanent separate parallel school system for those students who do not fit. While some Members have sought to focus solely on leaving certificate results and entry to third level education as a measurement of our young people's educational attainment, I have criticised this attitude at every opportunity. I am committed to reform our school curriculum, where necessary, to make it more relevant and to ensure that it meets the needs of today's students.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">I also strongly believe that those young people who decide that an apprenticeship or other training opportunity outside school better meets their needs should be supported in that decision, so they are genuinely given an opportunity to reach their full potential as individuals. However, I reject outright the determination of Fine Gael——</p>

          <p eId="para_865">In respect of supporting individual students to make the correct decisions, I have also prioritised the provision of extra guidance teachers for our second level schools. All second level schools receive ex-quota hours from the Department to provide guidance and counselling to their students. Recognised guidance counsellors are qualified to identify difficulties which students may be experiencing or to provide counselling support, on an individual or group basis. Counselling can assist students to address behavioural issues, develop coping strategies or resolve personal difficulties. The importance I attach to the guidance function in schools is evidenced by my announcement last April of an extra 100 guidance teachers for the current school year. Under the new action plan for disadvantaged schools, DEIS, this week 200 second level schools were invited to participate in the process. They will be given enhanced——</p>

          <p eId="para_867">I have allocated funds to 200 schools, when initially I announced that I would only cater for 150. Hence, the Department has invited 200 schools to participate in the process. They will receive enhanced guidance and supports. In addition, they will be provided with home-school community liaison which I accept to be extremely important for such schools by linking the students with parents and the wider community. Other supports include the junior certificate support programme, the leaving certificate applied, the school completion programme and other initiatives. As Deputy Crawford rightly noted we must try to use the carrot rather than the stick. The provision of these extra supports to 200 schools can help where there are particular difficulties and particular disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">Hence, in the past year I have taken a variety of actions in a range of areas which I believe will help to improve the learning environment in our schools. These will be supplemented by specific actions to be taken in response to the recommendations of the final report of the task force on student behaviour. As I stated earlier, I will set out the steps which I will take after the launch of the report in a few weeks' time. I have indicated my clear intention of acting on this issue in a measured and effective manner. To this end, I have secured the provision of €2 million in my Department's Estimates for 2006 to enable me to begin acting on the recommendations of the task force's final report immediately. I am unaware of any other situation in which money will be provided to implement recommendations of a report before it has been received, let alone published.</p>

However, in more recent years, where schools have proper policies and procedures in place, they have won appeals against the students at a rate of three or four to one. It comes down to having the proper procedures in place. This is an issue which teachers have suggested should be examined.

          <p eId="para_883">I am glad to share time with the Minister in respect of this serious issue. I must declare my interest as a former teacher although in the main I taught not in the Irish system but in other jurisdictions where one encountered other issues pertaining to disruptive pupils and approaches to dealing with them. I spent the afternoon in the company of a secondary school principal and when I mentioned the possibility that I might speak on this issue he replied that it is extremely important to realise that most pupils are not disruptive. It is disingenuous for people to give the impression that the majority of pupils are disruptive. While a small number of people can cause much trouble in a class, the vast majority of pupils attend for the right reasons and want to be there. However, the minority can take up much time.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">I wish to compliment the Minister regarding her stance on these issues. I will discuss the task force later. As for considering what is useful when a child is disruptive, it is clear that schools must have a policy on most issues. A school which is clear, sure and confident about itself will put together such policies, which must be of a high standard. I have had my own arguments with the Minister regarding some schools which, possibly because they are new, do not have a reputation for early school leaving on the part of pupils or have not had problems which would prove they are prone to early school leaving. The Minister's argument has been that she does not wish to create an assumption that people would be negatively disposed simply because they come from backgrounds which historically would have predisposed them to be early school leavers, or otherwise. While I argue and debate the issue with the Minister, I commend the idea that she does not label children as being disruptive, as early school leavers, or anything else. She takes the facts and addresses them.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">If a school has considered its children's needs and if its board of management has sufficient respect for its students and its partners in education to put together policies of sufficiently high standard on the many issues which must be addressed, the vast majority of students in the school will aspire to the highest standard. This is not stated often enough. We always focus on the negative rather than on the positive. Having discussed this issue with many teachers, children want to know what are the rules and what is expected of them. The higher the bar presented to them, the more they will aspire to that bar. This does not take away from the fact that some people can, for various reasons, cause disruption in a class. Some of those people are causing a disruption in the class on the basis that we accept that all-inclusive education is the right way forward in most situations. There are people coming into the schools with physical or other difficulties and we are embracing many backgrounds and many different difficulties, which are seen by many as challenges but by many schools as opportunities for integration. No matter how one goes about that, it will ultimately cause an issue of difference which must be dealt with. While some would call it a disruption, congratulations are due in this regard to the Minister and to her predecessors in the Department over the past few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">One of my first debates in this House was ten years ago, bar a couple of months, when I was in Opposition. There was a special school in Buncrana, Scoil Íosagáin, which had a special class for students with moderate difficulties. It was an Adjournment debate and Deputy Allen was the Minister of State in the Department at the time.</p>

          <p eId="para_888">I wanted to raise the issue that the special assistant in that class for moderately handicapped students was to be removed when the class for severely handicapped students was formed. It was deemed unnecessary to have a special assistant in a class of moderately handicapped children and they were to be moved to the class for severely handicapped students. I was eager to present my case. As I recall, it was my first Adjournment debate matter. Unfortunately, Deputy Allen was given the wrong school and came in with the wrong information about the school. As Deputies are aware, the Adjournment debate can be frustrating when a new Deputy finds he or she is not even getting the answer on the real issue.</p>

          <from>Cecilia Keaveney</from>
          <p eId="para_890">It is not as frustrating for me because that school went from that position to having a number of special classes where there is one-to-one tuition for the students, there are special needs assistants, the staff complement has expanded beyond all recognition and this year they have been included in the school building programme. Considering what has happened since the year I came in here fighting the case for their special needs assistant in the class for moderately handicapped children to be retained rather than taken away for the class for severely handicapped students and the personnel currently in their classroom, I can stand over and be proud of the massive supports that have gone into the classroom to provide that extra pair of hands where they are needed. Such extra staff are needed if the child has a special need. There has been constant review and monitoring of who is in the class and who needs that support. I agree people will argue their child is not being accommodated but there is a mechanism in place to ensure those who need it most get the support.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">The record shows clearly that the position is improving. There are more teachers in the classroom. There are smaller class sizes. School buildings are improving. Where in the past the special needs assistant would have taken out what might have been considered either a person who needed more support or a disruptive child into dusty windy cloakrooms, they now are taking them into rooms within the building and there has been massive support in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">There are still issues that need to be addressed in the case of apprenticeships, future opportunities and early school leaving. For the person who is not particularly academic, I accept there are other avenues of approach. It would be remiss of me to use the short time available and not plug the issue of early intervention, particularly at pre-school and at early primary school, in the arts sector. Usually the reasons pupils are disruptive stem from something outside the classroom environment, such as a social problem at home, a psychological problem or an academic problem resulting in the pupil falling far behind. An arts-based or a less academic intervention at an earlier age might mean the student is more able at second level to participate fully in the academic field.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">I have not seen the report of the task force set up by the Minister. This debate might have been more appropriate at a time when we have seen that and can debate the issues involved. The setting up of the task force was important. The Minister mentioned there is funding to deal with the recommendations of the task force. It is one of the most important issues. I commend the Minister for the serious advantage she is helping create for children. She comes from a teaching background. She has been in the school. She understands the issues and she is trying to address them in a coherent and structured fashion. It is not appropriate to jump up and down about an issue. One must examine and deal in a concerted and significant way with the issues. This Minister has proven in her approach that she is taking it in a measured fashion, which is the right way to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_898">I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue. I want to approach it a little differently in so far as I want to concentrate as much as I can on the children who may be described as the problem or part of the problem and on the need to give children the opportunity to succeed rather than fail. I like to think we could intervene with many of these young people before they get to the point where they are causing serious disruption for other children in whatever school they attend and before we get to the point where we see measures like section 29 of the Education Act being brought into the picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">I was interested in the interim report of the task force because much of its emphasis was on trying to create a school culture which is inclusive and which tries to address the issues caused by the big changes in the past 20 or more years. We have moved from a situation where there was a highly authoritarian regime, where the teacher could give the child a clip on the ear and where the child was afraid of the teacher. All of that sort of behaviour is completely gone. There now is a totally different situation in schools. We need to concentrate on how we can make school a positive experience for all children rather than on simply seeing them as a problem. That is why if there were any teachers listening tonight — I suppose there will be some reading this report — I hope they will forgive me for spending no time at all speaking about the problem as it is perceived by teachers but instead speaking about how the child experiences school at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">One of the measures we must take if we are to prevent this kind of disruption is intervention at an earlier stage with children who have problems in school. Those problems are usually identified at an early stage in school, if not even before they go to school. One sees many of these problems arising at primary school level. For example, the recent literacy figures, both in the study from St. Patrick's College and in the Minister's educational disadvantage group, show that there is clearly a serious literacy problem evident in many children, and in up to 50% of children in a small number of schools, coming out of the primary school system. Those children inevitably will cause disruption at second level because they will not be able to participate. The ones with the serious difficulties are the small percentage who are supposed to be addressed in this task force but there are many other children who have difficulties, although perhaps not at the extreme end. If we do not intervene, we will set ourselves all sorts of recipes for the future and this task force report will not make a scrap of difference because there will continue to be children who cause disruption. The way to address it is not to police them and kick them out of schools but to ensure there is a positive system.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">The Minister is planning to introduce standardised testing at two stages in the primary school system. No child should have to leave primary school without being literate and numerate and, therefore, when these tests come on stream, the children who need additional support at primary level should be identifiable. Such support should be given to them so that when they enter second level, they can have a positive experience at school. The State has the capacity to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">I take issue with the Minister regarding the introduction of the weighted system for resource teaching because many children who need support attend schools in which other children need support but do not receive it. The Minister has deprived a number of inner city schools in Dublin and other disadvantaged schools of resource support they seriously need.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_904">Many of teachers are in schools that do not need them and not enough of them are in schools where they are needed. That is an important issue. Support should be provided where it is needed. When standardised testing is introduced, the Department will be in a better position to determine that. However, no child should leave school without being literate.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">The provision of special needs support at second level is also problematic, which Deputy Keaveney touched on in her contribution. Second level schools do not have the supports many children with learning difficulties such as dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder need. Improved supports need to be given to these children. Many of them who received support at primary level lose it when they transfer to second level and it takes a while for the second level schools to secure the support they need subsequently. This issue also needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">The interim task force report may well result in good, positive proposals regarding support for schools in the provision of quality leadership and so on and in addressing their ethos and culture. In particular, I am concerned about students buying into the system provided by the school and knowing what is expected of them, while at the same time the school should only expect what the child can give. Many schools have pupils who are aiming to score 500 points or more but who, at their absolute best, might only be capable of achieving 300 points. A culture must be developed in schools whereby young people are rewarded for achieving their best performance. They need to be encouraged much more to achieve their best rather than setting other——</p>

A significant number of schools do not have such councils and I suspect they do not always have an effective role and voice in the schools in which they have been established. I am sorry the Minister did not appoint a student to the task force. It comprises adults, all of whom are education practitioners.</p>

          <p eId="para_915">Young people who may be better off in a different environment should be identified at an earlier stage so that hey can have a positive experience. That is what schools such as St. Augustine's provide. The XLC project in Waterford also takes in children who have been removed from other schools. I do not know whether the Minister is familiar with Nuala Jackson's XLC project but she works with young people who were considered not to be capable by other schools of passing the junior certificate, for example, but who are capable of achieving good results. The project uses a pedagogue, which is inclusive of the young people. The project leaders sit down with the young people and agree with them what they might be able to achieve by setting targets, into which the young people buy. It is a different approach which is used in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The Marino Institute of Education published a report in October 2001 entitled, Addressing the Needs of Under 15s: A Study of Alternative Educational Provision in Selected Countries. It suggests that in many countries alternative provision similar to the XLC project provides an opportunity for young people who work better outside the education system. Ideally, that system should be provided in schools but, given the large class sizes in Ireland, it is much more difficult to develop that. The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_917">The Department of Education and Science has to recognise that the educational system cannot cater for the needs of all young people to whom it has a legal obligation. Therefore, alternative programmes are necessary and are needed. The educational system in Ireland has and continues to serve many young people well but it should not be expected to serve adequately all young people since certain needs and demands will exceed what the system can address.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">An alternative is suggested. The Minister should consider alternative provision because I would much prefer if young people who could prosper in such a system were identified earlier and given the opportunity to succeed rather than drop out, as they would under the current system.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">The latest ESRI statistics on early school leaving highlight that 18% of pupils leave school without the leaving certificate but, more disturbingly, 21% of them were still unemployed one year after leaving school compared with 11% of a similar cohort in 1999. Despite Ireland having what economists often describe as full employment, the percentage of early school leavers who end up unemployed is increasing rather than reducing. It must be recognised that the school system is not serving a significant proportion of young people. Many of them can be catered for within the system if it is amended and, for example, respect is afforded to the leaving certificate applied and it is given value by providing for points to be scored. The culture within schools should be improved so that children capable of attaining 300 points are treated the same as those capable of attaining 500 points.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">It must also be recognised that an alternative system would be better for some children. Such a system should be provided and resourced. St. Augustine's in Limerick has a waiting list and people cannot get into the school, even though it is badly resourced. The XLC project in Waterford was set up privately and it is only becoming part of mainstream education now as part of the school completion programme in conjunction with schools in Waterford. Many of the alternatives had to be set up by committed people, not by the system. We need to be more holistic about this issue and to address it in a child and student-centred manner rather than make it an issue about children who cause trouble for everyone. They too have a right to education and we must balance their rights with those of others. I accept what Deputy Enright and her colleagues have said about the rights of the other children in a school. However, we will never solve the problem unless we also address the rights and needs of children who do not fit into school. That is the reason I wanted to focus on this area which often gets little attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">I am glad to see that people like Nuala Jackson in Waterford are finally being heard. I hope we will hear John Hanna's voice in the final report of the task force, which we have not got yet. I have heard him speak many times about how these young people begin to blossom when they realise they can be a success and are not constantly described as not being able to fit into the system. There was a time when if children did not behave they were put in the corner. Whatever happens as a result of the task force report, I would not like to think that we will simply send these children to the corner. We must address their needs or — I do not like saying this following what happened on Saturday — many of them will end up breaking blocks and throwing stones, or in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's new fancy prison in north Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">We must intervene at an early stage where we identify problems and the education system is the best tool we have to do this. We must give children with learning difficulties or disinterested home backgrounds the support they need in school. We must also provide for the needs of these children at second level.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">This debate has been useful, but I am sorry it is not taking place in the context of having the full report.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_10">Question again proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_486">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_935">Previously I spoke about what might be the framing philosophy of a social welfare system. I drew attention to the great choices there were in the founding of the welfare state in Britain and the argument that followed it several decades later. The welfare state in Britain came into existence for a specific set of historical purposes, but I drew the Minister's attention to the main principles of the confrontation of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. I did that not in a divisive way but in terms of the choices that were available as policy platforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">Those issues still remain and are sharpened by the particular circumstances of the Irish economy which, to some extent, provide us with an even deeper version of a paradox that was there before, which is of high rates of economic growth and obdurate levels of poverty that are enclaved within the social system, and of gaps that are opening up even further between the perception of poverty and participation levels at different levels of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">In summary, I suggested to the Minister that a good positive approach is one based on citizenship that moves through a screen of values that accept the principle of universalism. I offered him support in that and for such changes as he had made already in the legislation that were going in that direction. This is the way we must go.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">To make a connection with what I said previously, I would like to give some suggestions of a more practical kind. It is crucial that the assumptions guiding welfare policy be articulated and defended. It is also crucial that they be recognised for what they are. They are the principles upon which the whole policy and set of measures are eventually structured. For example, one may make an assumption that it is the purpose of the State to defend itself against a kind of predatory mob that continually comes at it for everything it can get, whether qualified or not. This is the exact opposite of a model which suggests that citizens are entitled on a universal basis to security from poverty and many other things that flow from it, including fear, from childhood to old age. The assumptions being articulated are the honest statement of the policy. However, it is not just the policy that will be affected by the basic assumptions, but also the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">We should recognise the important changes that have taken place, but we have still a long way to go before we have what may be regarded as a citizenship model in the intersecting points between the citizen and the State. We have made significant progress with regard to the dilapidated and demeaning buildings to which people had to go, the shutters at which they had to queue and the language to which they had to listen. I am not saying that we have replaced all the housing officers across the country or that we will never again hear the phrase "There is nothing for you".</p>
          <p eId="para_940">We have a significant journey to go yet if we are to have a discourse that is appropriate to an equality of citizenship in which people will get the same standard of treatment in dealing with any aspect of the State as they would if they said they had come to inquire about new investment opportunities in Bulgaria. It is not just the buildings that must change, but also the language and attitudes.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">While I have recorded and paid tribute to progress and to the measures taken by the Minister this year and last year, I must tell him that I have been disturbed by something that relates not just to his Department but to offices across the State and local government, namely, a kind of fraught intolerance of any critical comment. For example, I was trying to talk to someone recently about housing, but before I could even get started I was told "There is no housing crisis." I had not even got as far as suggesting there was a shortage. There is a notion about that everyone must defend himself or herself or that they are being attacked. We must accept that it is of the nature of a citizenship model being worked through, that people must be able to make changes. This will require at a practical level, in our own offices, among our staff and ourselves as public representatives at different levels, the continual encouragement of people to think about the way in which people are spoken to and treated. If this is a very rich economy it should be a society in which a person should grow old with some sense of security and some sense that the common discourtesy which prevails in the streets at the present time is not something that is imported into the offices of the State. Let us put an end to this business about people being threatened if they are asked a question, the poor dears.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">I said in a previous contribution to this debate that I would give some examples of what I referred to as anomalies. The Minister will know I am raising this matter because I have spent a lot of my life with artists. My wife was an actress at one stage and a founding member of the Stanislavsky Theatre. I ask the Minister to seriously examine the question of atypical workers, particularly artists. Over the years I have regularly made this plea, not just to the current Minister. If one is an unemployed artist and is, as artists would say, resting, one does not have to be told about all of the jobs that are available in the local bars, hotels and so forth. One should be able to register as an artist who is not working.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">There is no point in my complaining without making suggestions and there are ways to deal with this. In Scandinavian countries, for example, artists such as writers, performers, musicians and others have, by giving public performances, acquired credits which are used later to guarantee them income and even to set out the basis for an embryonic pension fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">At the present time, there is a particular difficulty on foot of the outrageous action taken by the Competition Authority against artists. The authority has extracted from SIPTU an undertaking that it will not represent musicians, actors doing voice-overs and others in a collective agreement on the basis that such artists have undertakings and, as such, are the equivalent of pharmacies and those with a great deal of resources. The result of that action is in flagrant violation of the International Labour Organisation convention No. 98 and of the various trades union Acts, enacted through the 1990s and up to the present time.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">I am encouraging a High Court challenge to this and have every intention that it will proceed because it is outrageous. The State will not grind to a halt when people's rights are vindicated, no more than it will grind to a halt because somebody should not have been docked income in the summertime, having returned to education, as the High Court has just decided today. That is a very good decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">It is time that the Minister found an alternative to the concept of habitual residence. That concept is stopping him giving proper recognition to people who worked abroad for years, including missionaries in Africa, for example, and to people who have come here from countries that are now in the European Union and who are in carer relationships. I am thinking here of somebody looking after a blind man, known to the Minister and myself, of over 80 years of age. The problem is that the person is assumed to be anxious to go back to Lithuania.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">I welcome many of the changes in the Bill and hope I have given them due recognition. If a sum of €140 million is required to abolish the means test for the carer's allowance, how many miles of road would that cover? It is only a bad weekend's income from some of the tolls, when one thinks of it over a period of time. Why not do it? The Minister would certainly have our support in that. I hope the Minister is going down the road of the positive social philosophy of not regarding welfare as residual but as a building block in citizenship that will eliminate fear and insecurity. If that is the case, he would have my support.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDennehy" eId="spk_489">
          <from>Mr. Dennehy</from>
          <p eId="para_950">I am happy with the current state of much of our social welfare initiatives and with many aspects of this Bill. The Minister, Deputy Brennan, has clearly proven the commentators wrong, who criticised him even before he took up the portfolio. I am happy that he has done such a good job. I am also pleased that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen has agreed to the provision of funding, to the massive sums that we are putting through in this Bill and elsewhere. I welcome the fact that through this Bill, the vast majority of the funding can be targeted at programmes other than unemployment benefit, which was not the case in the past. We are continuing to target the elderly, child care, carers, pensions, widows, widowers and a host of other very deserving causes and situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">None of us should ever be totally satisfied with what is happening and become complacent. In that context, I am unhappy with the fairly rigid way that legislation is framed at times, giving rise to a situation whereby if people do not obtain what, in my opinion, is rightfully theirs it is described as an anomaly. That is a very casual way of describing a situation that can be lifestyle changing for many people. There are unfortunate people who get caught up in a situation whereby the positive effects that were intended in legislation cannot be applied to them. It is often due to the way legislation is drafted. I am aware of at least three such situations, one concerning widow's benefit for those who go abroad, another concerning people who return to education and have their benefits taken away and the third concerning a person who worked for 25 years and then worked as a self-employed person who can get no benefits. However, I do not have time to go into detail on these tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">I will deal with the Bill before us. It is one of the keys to unlocking the record €1.12 billion package of social welfare improvements announced in the budget last December, an investment to better the lives of the country's older and less well off people of which the Government should be proud. The Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Bill aims to ensure that everybody, not just a select few, can share in this country's continued prosperity. Bringing the level of social welfare expenditure to more than €13.5 billion in 2006 is a remarkable achievement by anybody's standards. It underlines the Government's commitment to tackling marginalisation in certain communities. Such an expansive programme is also an immense tribute to the people who are working so hard to keep propelling our economy forward. It is something I am sure politicians from all sides of the House applaud and welcome. On a personal note, I was very pleased to hear the contribution of Deputy Michael D. Higgins both tonight and during the earlier debate and how fairly he judged the Minister and the programmes being put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">Considering that we have record levels of employment, the investment of over €13 billion can be spent on particularly deserving areas and targeted at those most in need of State help. There are people who are not directly benefitting from the spawn of the Celtic tiger and the measured proposals in this Bill will make big improvements in their everyday lives by underpinning the safety net which they require. We often describe social welfare as a safety net, or in other ways, but we are all well aware of what I mean. The substantial funding commitment contained in this social welfare package is crucial in our attempts to make our society fairer. Euro alone will not be enough to solve all our problems and money on the table must be supported by energy in the community. One can certainly do much more if one can match ambition and constructive social plans with sound financial foundations. As the old saying goes, prevention is better than cure. This is why a much more proactive approach is being made across all Departments to tackle the issues that contribute to social exclusion and anti-social behaviour. This is an area in which there needs to be further development of that approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">There should be increased co-operation between the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Arts, Sport and Tourism when it comes to tackling community problems that have knock-on effects. If sport, health and community awareness programmes can be developed in and funded for our schools, particularly those in disadvantaged or RAPID designated areas, such as my own, such strategies cannot but have long-term benefits for the health and outlook of communities and individuals. This will ultimately be reflected in lessening the pressure on our health and criminal justice system and result in a better and fairer country in which we all live.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">Everybody in Ireland today, young and old, has a contribution to make to the enrichment of our society. As Deputy Michael D. Higgins said, this should not be dependent on wealth, class or creed. I join previous speakers, especially my colleagues, and members of all parties in welcoming the Bill. The pensions issue was described for the past 20 or more years as a time-bomb waiting to explode. Nobody did too much about it until this Government got a grip on it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BeverleyCooperFlynn" eId="spk_490">
          <from>Ms Cooper-Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_956">I thank Deputy Dennehy for sharing time. I welcome the Bill. That the Minister has been able to keep the area of social welfare out of the news in recent months and since he came to that portfolio is a good thing. Certainly it was an area of great criticism in the past. There have been many welcome improvements, particularly the many benefits payable to women.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">In regard to the national pensions review, the Minister has highlighted the number of people who have no pension provision. I welcome the move by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, who put the initiative in place for SSIA holders to add a bonus of €1 for every €3 transferred into a pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">I wish to refer to a number of points that have been raised by working mothers and those who decide to stay at home and look after their children. Eventually they may return to the workforce. The number of years they stay at home looking after their children are disregarded for the purposes of calculating their pension and PRSI contributions. Is there any way credits could be given to women who decide to stay at home to look after their children until the children reach a certain age rather than disadvantage those women when they reach pension age? I notice in the Bill that the Minister has taken on board some of the points made by women's groups. This is a welcome development because for many years women's groups have been calling for reforms within the social welfare system and their calls have often fallen on deaf ears.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">Under the social welfare code, payments for a qualified adult are paid to the person who is the principal claimant. I understand there is a system where one can opt for separate payments but one must ask for it. It does not happen as an automatic entitlement. It would be a positive step if as an automatic entitlement the payment for the qualifying individual were paid directly to the individual without the necessity of going to the Department and asking for that separate payment. Believe it or not, even now there are women who find that a difficult issue. It is a topic on which I have spoken in the public domain and the response from women on issues of that nature is amazing.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">That the Minister has increased the respite grant for carers by €200 is welcome. That is an excellent development in section 30. The extension from 15 months to two years of the carer's benefit scheme is welcome. This initiative enables families to look after relatives in their home and it will ease pressure on many other State services that are creaking at the seams. Where there is the facility for people to look after elderly relatives or special needs people within their home, that time extension is valuable. I welcome also the increase from ten to 15 hours for part-time work. People come to my clinics who care for elderly parents not on a nine to five basis but 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That people can take up a part-time job in some cases is a welcome relief and the increase from ten to 15 hours for same is a welcome development.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">The child care package in the budget was generous. At the time I thought the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, was implementing the new early child care supplement for me, given that I had just had a new born baby. My two children are under six years of age. It is a welcome development for mothers in the provision of child care. We could all argue the case that €1,000 per child is only a small element but at the same time it is in addition to the increased child benefit that has been provided in recent years. The increased child benefit has been substantial certainly in my time in this House and it has gone a long way towards helping parents, mothers in particular, to provide child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">I compliment the Minister on taking on board the issue of childminders and the €10,000 disregard for income tax. Given that the PRSI element has been covered, they will have an entitlement to pension and maternity benefits. That is a positive step. With regard to the €100 earnings disregard for those in receipt of pensions, given that we rely on 50,000 immigrants to keep the economy growing, it is important to encourage as many older people as possible back into the workplace. Many people well into their 60s and beyond have much to offer society. That they can play a role and earn an income without affecting their pension entitlements is a welcome recognition of how society is shaping up. Overall, the Minister is implementing many of the changes announced in the budget. He has made great headway in this Bill which I endorse. With regard to the rights of women I ask the Minister to take points on board the points I have made in the future because our social welfare system can be made more friendly in that area.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanWallace" eId="spk_491">
          <from>Mr. D. Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_963">I also congratulate the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, on his performance in that Department since he took over. That we are discussing measures that will give effect to welfare payments and entitlements in excess of €13 billion says much about the rapid change in society during recent years. On the one hand, the country is doing extremely well and the economy can sustain these payments and this is evidence of one side of modern Ireland with businesses and individuals prospering and benefiting from this rising tide. The other side of the coin, however, is that there is a need for such levels of payments with people throughout the country dependent on the State for their very existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">I welcome the fact that as a society we are in a position to make substantial payments to the less well-off but it is equally important that we continue to commit resources to tackling the causes of poverty so that we can impact in a positive way on the quality of life for many individuals who are in constant need of support.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">It has often been said, but it is worth repeating, that the reason we have so much scope to offer meaningful and telling increases in rates of payment is because of the strong performance of the economy. Commitments made by the Government that the gains made by the State would be redistributed, to ensure all sectors of the community could benefit from the growing prosperity of our country, have certainly been delivered on. While some are happy to take these increases for granted and to be dismissive of them, the facts are that 1.5 million people benefit directly from these weekly entitlements and they cater for people in a variety of different circumstances. Adults, children, pensioners, the unemployed and people with disabilities, whether temporary or long-term, will all receive increased payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">Many organisations are consistently articulating the views of the less well-off in society and working to alleviate hardship. The increases announced on budget day are an acknowledgement of the role these groups play in articulating the needs of their clients and in ensuring the need for ongoing increases in the rates of payment so we can further our aim of narrowing the gap between rich and poor in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">It is now time to consider seriously the diminishing role of the volunteer in society. In addition to providing additional resources to individuals, there is a need to encourage voluntary organisations to prosper and expand. A defining feature of life in Ireland for many years has been the ongoing influence of volunteers working in their communities for groups such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Meals on Wheels and Care of the Aged, with the sole aim of helping others. It is fair to say the State could never hope to match the efforts and effectiveness of these people in making a real and positive difference to the lives of others. Unfortunately, in recent times, owing to the improving economy and consequent pressures faced by individuals, we are now seeing a reduction in the number of people prepared to commit to voluntary work. If one speaks to the administrators of voluntary groups, one is very often told that finance is no longer the key problem they face — instead, it is a lack of manpower.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">We have a responsibility to encourage volunteerism and I welcome the fact that the Minister indicated that he intends to commit resources to go behind the payments and tackle the causes that trigger the need for the payments in the first place. A key part of this exercise should be to identify measures to foster the spirit of voluntary effort and encourage people to continue to play a role in their own community. Even limited success in this regard will have an exponential effect on individuals and communities  across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">To further the ongoing and sustained development of the economy and the general spin-off benefit to the country at large, it is vital that we continue to provide a bank of educated and efficient workers for potential employers who continue to be attracted to Ireland as a quality location. The Minister has acknowledged that a wide range of reforms and initiatives are required as part of our overall strategy to ensure Ireland is ready to deal with the challenge of providing for the employment demands of the economy over the next decade. We have now reached full employment and any increase in employment numbers will have to be catered for through immigrant workers, encouraging people on the live register to take up work and, particularly, creating an environment where lone parents and married mothers feel confident that the appropriate structures are in place to allow them to return to work and have their children cared for appropriately in their absence. I am happy the measures the Government is adopting will help in our stated aim of providing opportunities for all sectors of the community and continuing to stimulate the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">The Bill should be acknowledged as one that has as its primary focus a requirement to cater for the needs of those who most in need in society. Its various measures will help to alleviate hardship, offer hope and improve the quality of life for so many people from many different backgrounds. It will do so through the provision of better services and fairer sharing of available resources. Through the pension provisions, it will seek to protect workers and provide for the financial security of citizens in retirement. There is no doubt but that these measures will make a significant impact in addressing poverty and will directly benefit the lives of many. I am pleased to support the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_974">I might be joining that party yet — one never knows. I wish to speak about the back to education scheme. In this regard I welcome today's judgment and hope the Minister will not appeal it. I tabled a priority question in the Dáil on 26 June 2003 and told the former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, that somebody would take a case against the Department and win it. I congratulate the person who has done so. Shame on the Department for taking badly needed money from people who want to re-educate themselves and return to the workplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">Consider the Department's attitude to people seeking unemployment assistance. Even when such people produce a number of letters for the Department officials, they are told they are not actively looking for work. A court case is now taking place in this regard and I support the person involved. I will send the person some funding for the case because the way in which some of our citizens are being treated is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">I am sick and tired of what is happening to my constituents. There was a time when people with very little education could get jobs in restaurants, pubs and hotels, but those days are over. People are now coming from the accession countries and taking these jobs from them. Some of our citizens are being marginalised both by the system and the officials in the Department. I feel so strongly about this that I must ask the Minister to review the manner in which they are being treated. They are being treated badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">Although job hunters produce letters showing they are actively looking for work, they are told by officials they are not doing so. Furthermore, there is no work in their areas and it is time the Minister and his officials did what is necessary to stop the court case from going ahead. How can one prove one is actively looking for work if an official says one is not, even after his being shown three or four letters to the contrary? This is not right and it is time the Minister addressed it.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">I could put something else on the record tonight but I will not. However, the way our citizens are being treated is wrong. They are Irish citizens, born and reared in this State, but they are being turned away by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and have to beg from community welfare officers every week. I will table a parliamentary question on this matter next week and the Minister will find there are many people pushed away by the Department and degraded by the HSE areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">The Minister has been caring and has taken on board many points made in this House and I therefore ask him to sit down with his officials to address this matter. People come to my constituency office crying, upset and disturbed over the way they are being treated. I do not want to say any more tonight on this matter because I spoke to the Minister privately about it, and I do not want these circumstances to persist. If somebody wants a little help and there is work for him, he will accept it. I compliment the judge on the correct judgment he made today.</p>

          <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_982">This time last year, the public in Kildare North and Meath put child care firmly on the national agenda by raising the matter over and again with representatives on the doorsteps. I was reminded of this today when I saw the snow because the weather was similar then and it is well we remember it.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">Child care is now accepted as an issue of national importance and the Bill is the first attempt by the Government to respond. During the budget debate it was made clear that the total child care package will be introduced incrementally. It is essential that the increment announced be the first of the increments and not the last. It is expected that more will be done, and more needs to be done in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">While I welcome the early child care supplement as a centrepiece of the response, the measure must extend to children over six years of age. Many working parents must make arrangements to have their children minded before their children go to school, and after school, before they are collected by their parents. Very often they must be cared for on a full-time basis during school holidays. The expense is also carried by parents with children over six.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">The early child care supplement is very welcome but it must be regarded as a beginning. That it is being made universally and disregards the means by which the household income is derived makes it particularly welcome to low-income families.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">I will be less than complimentary about the section on child minders. The self-employed are liable to pay a social insurance contribution of €253 per annum. This is to be deducted from €10,000, which is the maximum one can earn under the tax exemption. It applies if one cares for up to three children. It brings no pension or social welfare entitlements because those caring for children in their own homes will be regarded as self-employed. Those doing the caring, who are mainly women, will be expected to mind up to three children, which is a fairly onerous task, in their own homes while earning no more than €195 per week, or €5 per hour. That is substantially less than the minimum wage. They will not be allowed to make claims in respect of expenses, such as extra heating costs, which are associated with their work even though it is termed self-employment. There is a view among child minders to whom I have spoken that their work is being grossly undervalued, essentially by the imposition of an annual limit of €10,000. The threshold needs to be reconsidered because if it is allowed to stand people will not be queueing to avail of this measure. I ask the Minister to reconsider the extent of the limit. The Government is considering making it compulsory to participate in a pension programme, even though no pension provisions are being put in place for people in the group I mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">I wish to discuss the new provisions in the Bill relating to maternity leave, many of which are welcome. It is understandable that some people currently on maternity leave are upset because the extended maternity leave system will not apply to them. The Minister for Finance said in his Budget Statement in December that "the Government is particularly conscious of the importance of the first year of life to a child's development". He went on to refer to the long-lasting benefits of making adequate provision during this time. He promised that from March 2006, "mothers of new-born children will have an additional four weeks' paid maternity leave", but that is not the case for pregnant women who start their maternity leave before the date on which this measure will commence. If they start their maternity leave the day before the new provisions come into operation, they will not be able to avail of extended maternity leave. It is something that could be changed without costing a fortune. I am sure it could be dealt with administratively in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I understand the argument that it should not apply to women who are nearing the end of their maternity leave, but it is unfair on women who will commence maternity leave just before the relevant date.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">I wish to mention a provision relating to paternity leave I would have liked to have seen included in this Bill. I describe myself as a feminist who believes that feminism is about seeking equality. That fathers are not generally entitled to paid paternity leave, in this day and age, is a gross inequality that needs to be tackled. A father is entitled to paid leave only if, tragically, the mother of his child dies. An adopting father is only entitled to leave if he is the sole adopter, which is something I cannot recall ever happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">The review of the property-based tax incentive schemes showed us the extent to which the Government has been prepared to subsidise bricks and mortar at the expense of people. This issue was not taken seriously until voters raised it on the doorsteps. I welcome the steps which are being taken. I hope the changes which are being made this year will not be forgotten next year. While I welcome some elements of this Bill, much more needs to be done in respect of some of the matters I have specified.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_499">
          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_990">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak about the Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Bill 2006, which represents a step in the right direction. While the Bill has a number of positive elements, I do not think it is sufficiently radical. In some cases, it tinkers at the edges rather than tackling the problem head-on. There continues to be a number of anomalies in certain sectors and various groups are still losing out. The Government is in a position to make radical changes to our social welfare system, to put adequate and comprehensive child care supports in place, to deal in an equitable way with this country's tens of thousands of carers and to sort out our pensions system. Although the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is in a position to be generous, he has not been generous in some cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">I welcome the provision of an early child care supplement and the increase in child benefit rates, but such allocations will meet just a fraction of the cost of providing child care, which is increasing every day. Excellent child care and pre-school facilities are provided in many European countries, especially the Nordic countries, but that is not the case in Ireland, despite the best efforts of many community groups which are trying to provide child care facilities. I appreciate this digression relates to the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, rather than that of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. Community groups have been struggling for many years to raise funds and draw up plans. They have undertaken needs assessments and demographic profiles in conjunction with county child care committees, planners and officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. They have submitted their plans as advised, ensuring all health and safety requirements are met. They have submitted budgets which have been agreed by everyone. In some cases, they have been turned down or been awarded grants which are €100,000, €200,000 or €300,000 less than what they need. I have seen community groups in Inishcrone and other places in my constituency being put in an impossible situation. It makes no sense to leave groups which have jumped through hoops in their attempts to provide accessible and equitable child care services hundreds of thousands of euro short. If such groups were up and running and providing the services which are needed, the early child care supplement would be more valuable. While it is welcome, it will meet just a fraction of what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">I will deal with two further issues in the short time available to me. If ever there was a case for generosity, the Minister needs to be generous to carers now. He could have achieved an A grade in his treatment of carers, but he has achieved a C grade, at best, to date. We all welcome the extension of carer's benefit to two years and the increase to €1,200 in the respite grant. I am not pleased, however, that the means test, or the "mean test", continues to apply because it results in most carers not being looked after at all. I refer to people who are happy to do important work quietly with patience and concern, day after day, saving the State hundreds of millions of euro each year in the process. Such people are not looking for hundreds of millions of euro, but for a reasonable allowance that will allow them to live in some sort of reasonable dignity while they look after those who need care.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">I would like to raise an issue that relates to the pensions of carers. There is an absolute need to ensure carers who work the required number of hours, whose contributions records have been interrupted, qualify for some type of carer's credit so they are not penalised when they reach pension age. I will speak about the circumstances in which such problems arise. We should ensure people who take time out to look after those who need care are not penalised. Their contributions records should not mean they have reduced pensions because that would add insult to injury. I spoke earlier about this matter, in respect of which the Minister needs to take action.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">I mentioned some of the anomalies in the social welfare system, particularly in the pensions system. I refer to the problems encountered by people who do not have full contributions, for various reasons, and find themselves on reduced pensions. Many women who worked in the public service and paid PRSI when they were young had to give up that work because of the marriage bar that was in place at the time. They did not have a choice — the State forced them to stop working. Many of them went back to work in the 1980s and 1990s and now have reduced pensions, through no fault of their own. Similar problems are faced by people who were forced to emigrate. I refer to people who had no choice but to take the boat and work overseas in difficult circumstances. They were not paying any pension or health care contributions, but instead were sending their savings home. Although the remittances of emigrants paid for the State's entire education budget in the 1960s, when those people come home they are given reduced pensions. We owe such people a debt because the Celtic tiger was built on their shoulders. We could repay that debt if we chose to deal with this issue. I would like to make a short response to Deputy Ring's remarks in this context. I ask him to not to mix up people who are moving from one European country to another, as people from counties Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim and elsewhere did when they went to work abroad. Like many other Irish people, I will attend a demonstration in Washington next week aimed at ensuring that Irish people who went to America can have their affairs regularised. We cannot do that on the one hand, while linking these two issues on the other hand.</p>

Women should have an automatic entitlement as a qualifying individual.</p>

          <p eId="para_998">People with established disabilities have extra costs above and beyond the norm. Not everyone gets a mobility allowance as it is means tested. There are extra costs associated with disability, such as special clothes, aids and appliances, special feeding utensils and so on. Other costs include occupational therapy equipment, which may or may not be available on a medical card. Some people do not have enough free hours provided by their personal assistants and must pay for the extra hours themselves. Sometimes, mobility allowance does not cover the cost of the travel involved, which represents more expense on the disabled person. That may cost an extra €60 per week. Heating costs are not adequately covered. The fuel allowance has increased but it is not enough as a bag of coal costs €11. The community welfare officer may or may not be able to help on such an issue. If a person is living alone, he or she may get allowances which he or she may not get otherwise, such as an electricity allowance. However, a person with a disability cannot do without a mobile phone, which is a further cost. All these costs work out at about €3,000 per annum for the disabled person.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">I welcome the earnings disregard of €100 for widows, widowers, deserted wives and prisoners' wives. I have been calling for this for a while and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it. I also welcome the carer's benefit, but the Minister should look at the plight of elderly carers. Who cares for the carers? I also welcome the even way in which child welfare payments have been increased between those who choose to work and those who choose to be homemakers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">People with illnesses or disabilities, or lone parents, should be encouraged into education and training. People with illnesses and disabilities need the services of a personal assistant, but problems in accessing funding exist. The cuts in VTOS courses in rural areas create a disincentive for those who wish to be trained. Personal assistants are a lifeline to many disabled people and the mainstreaming of FÁS personal assistants is essential to ensure continuity. What is the possibility of extending the early child care supplement of €1,000 per child under six years of age to children up to 14? A reduced amount of €500 could be awarded to parents of children aged six to 14 as it is needed for after school care, school uniforms and so on. The Bill provides that childminders in their own home can earn €10,000 tax free, but if a minder earns €10,500, he or she pays tax on the total amount. That person should only be taxed on the €500 over the threshold so that more people are encouraged to become childminders. The lone parent's income limit has been increased from €293 to €375 and that will encourage more lone parents to look for a job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">I have raised the issue of free travel for our UK emigrants when they are home on their holidays. I know that the Minister is championing that and I hope he puts all his effort into it. It is of great symbolic importance to our emigrants. I have campaigned strongly for it over the years, as have many others. It is a source of great disappointment that we still do not have free travel for our emigrants when they are home on holidays. The Minister was strongly advised by the Attorney General that it is not possible to extend free travel without extending it to all EU citizens. I know he is working to add this provision to the Irish pension, automatically providing it to those in receipt of Irish pensions, which would not constitute discrimination. Travel concessions exist for old age pensioners in both jurisdictions travelling between here and Northern Ireland. The Minister stated that if he granted the concession to one part of the UK, he would have to give it to everyone, but if it already exists between this country and Northern Ireland, it should be allowed between here and Britain. The Minister also mentioned that inter-territorial travel is applied if the land mass is contiguous, as Northern Ireland is with this State. The common travel area between the UK and Ireland predates our entry into the EU and should allow for this concession.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">I welcome this Bill. Like the curate's egg, it is very good in parts, but there is much more to be done. I ask the Minister to consider free travel for emigrants when they are here on holidays.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1003">I thank the Deputies for their consideration of Second Stage of this Bill. I will bring forward a small number of technical amendments on Committee Stage. I would like to deal with many of the items raised during this debate on Committee Stage because they are very detailed. Deputy Connaughton listed four or five cases involving individuals and I would like to deal with those issues in detail on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">I apologise to those Deputies who feel that we are dealing with this Bill too quickly. That was not my intention, but it was just the way it happened on the day. I particularly regret inconveniencing Deputies Stanton and Penrose who had to respond at one day's notice to the legislation. The process has slowed down since then, but I appreciate that it was a bit unfair to them. It was not intentional, but the Bill appeared on the Order Paper rapidly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">Deputy Stanton raised a number of issues to which I would like to respond. The NESC was asked by the Government to examine the amalgamation of the FIS and the CDA. It has produced a draft report, which is being examined. It is complicated because of its interaction with the income tax system. Issues include how to taper it, where the cut-off is made and enuring that we do not introduce another poverty trap in the middle of it all. I am anxious to obtain a solid proposal from the NESC that I can put into action. Child benefit and the CDA are still being paid this year, with the new child care payment so we are now faced with three child related payments. To add a fourth payment in this year would over-complicate the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">The Deputy also made the point that many do not know about the family income supplement so I have decided to start a campaign next week. Simple departmental advertisements will be placed on radio, television and national media, pointing out that a person can get between €20 and €400 per week if he or she has a family on low income, depending on the means and the size of the family. I hope that campaign will attract many people. The number of people on FIS at present is approximately 17,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">The Deputy also spoke about the need for targets when dealing with poverty. The current figure for poverty is 6.6% if one takes the consistent poverty level and 6.8% on another measure. It is 6.6% on a proposed new measure. I presume the target is zero but putting a timeframe on getting it from 6.6% to zero is another day's work. I could not offer one at present. I also take the view that the poverty and deprivation measures are getting mixed up with lifestyle indicators and social exclusion. Some of the items which we would term social exclusion and which apply to lifestyle are being mixed up in many cases with what constitutes poverty. A poor lifestyle is not poverty, it is a poor lifestyle. We must ensure we get the measurements right. I am working with the figures of 6.8% and 6.6% of the adult population. The ESRI will shortly launch a report, at my request, which seeks to find a better way of measuring poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">Deputy Stanton also took me to task about the whereabouts of the famous reforms I regularly mention. In short, the lone parents proposals will be published shortly. I have published the pension reforms. There is a list of activation measures, which I have outlined many times, about increasing disregards and so forth. All this is moving in the direction of reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">Deputy Penrose asked about abolishing the means test for the carer's allowance. I have an open mind about this but, as I have told Deputy Penrose, the cost of that in a full year would be €140 million. If I have that amount of money, do I remove a means test? It is handy and clean to ask that there be no means test for carers but would it not be better to give the €140 million to carers who need it, as opposed to carers who are well off and do not need it? It is a question public representatives must deal with. We can follow the popular line of abolishing the means test and applying the allowance universally, as Deputy Higgins said. I have an open mind on the subject and will listen to further debate on it but if I have €140 million for carers, is that the best use of such resources?</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">My response to the issue of carers was to make the carer's allowance the largest single individual allowance at €200 per week. That demonstrates our commitment to carers. We have also increased the respite grant from €1,000 to €1,200 and increased the disregard for the means test for carer's allowance to €290 for a single person and €580 for a couple. Many Deputies, particularly Deputy Boyle, said more must be done for carers. The respite grant is not means-tested but universal. A total of 34,000 people get it at present and 24,000 people get the allowance. We will keep an open mind about the means test. I accept Deputy Boyle's point that we can never do enough for the people who care for others. It relieves pressure on the hospital and nursing home system so it is a good investment and good use of taxpayers' funds. We have put substantial funds into this area this year and last year and, hopefully, we will continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">Deputy Boyle also asked when we will start to phase out the pre-retirement allowance. I propose to do so from September. There are 11,000 on that scheme. These are people of 55 years of age. The scheme was introduced in the 1980s when unemployment was high. When people reached 55 they effectively went on to a permanent payment, for the rest of their lives, equal to unemployment assistance. Now that there is almost full employment and a strongly growing economy, the scheme is no longer relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">It would not be fair to interfere with the people who are already on the scheme, given that they have made their lifestyle arrangements but it is fair to stop the scheme from September. That will put about 2,000 people onto the live register because that is roughly the number that would start on the scheme from next September. In short, the 11,000 people who are on the allowance will remain on it. Natural wastage will conclude the scheme. From next September there will be no new entrants on that scheme. They will be able to go on disability, unemployment, illness or a plethora of other allowances but not this one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">Deputy Catherine Murphy asked me about child care. I accept the points she made but a child care regime has now been introduced. There is a payment of €1,000 per annum for every child under six years of age. The first payment will be made in August, the second will be paid in September and the third will, I hope, be paid in December. It depends on how the Christmas dates work out but we will try to get three payments out this year. My Department is administering the scheme on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">I am especially pleased that we decided to include childminders in the PRSI system. I am aware that takes €253 per annum out of their €10,000 but it is the right thing to do. I have been calling for more people to be covered by pensions so it would be illogical when I get the first opportunity to include people in a pension scheme to miss it. For that reason I have included them in the PRSI system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">They will pay the €253 as a self-employed person, as it were. That will entitle them in due course, assuming they have the required number of contributions, to maternity benefit and, importantly, a contributory pension. If we did not do this, I will bet they would confront whoever is in this office in five or ten years saying: "We were minding those children for all those years but had no contributions and now we have no pension." We would regret not including them in the scheme so we are right to do it now. I acknowledge the part played by the election in Kildare North on this issue. It would be foolish not to admit that it certainly accelerated matters and got us started on the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">Deputy Cowley has spoken to me many times about free travel. I am strongly committed to this issue and am making good progress with regard to free travel North and South. I have been in contact again in recent days with the Northern Ireland authorities and we are close to an agreement whereby our citizens can have free travel throughout the North and Northern Ireland citizens can do the same in the Republic. I believe we will conclude an agreement quite quickly. It is still complicated but we are nearly at a resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">The east-west dimension is much more difficult. The Deputy asked what was the difference between the two but it is a land mass and common travel area issue. In a range of legislative and administrative matters, Northern Ireland has been distinguished from rest of the United Kingdom for good historical reasons. The two are not quite the same legally although constitutionally it is the same country. I can deal with this more thoroughly on Committee Stage if the Deputy wishes. I have not given up on the east-west arrangement and it is something I would like to do. It is not a matter of money but of law. At present, the only choice facing me appears to be to include everybody over a certain age from all 25 member states of the EU but that is not practical. However, I will continue to work on the issue. I also took note of the Deputy's comments on disability benefits and the cost of disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">Deputy Dan Wallace spoke, quite rightly, about the benefits of volunteering and the need for it to continue. I take this opportunity to thank the many voluntary organisations. My Department now accounts for one third of all Government spending and this year will spend more than €13 billion. Even that, however, is not enough. We could not make the type of inroads we are making on social exclusion if it were not for the large number of voluntary organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, to mention just one although I could name hundreds. I join Deputy Wallace in thanking them and I thank all Deputies for their positive contributions. I will take careful note of what has been said and will try to respond as best I can. I look forward to Committee Stage.</p>

          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_506">
            <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_1021">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for discussion. There are currently serious deficiencies in the services available in the Ballinasloe area for people with developmental and learning disabilities ranging in age from the very young to the over sixties. In many cases their parents and carers are getting older and cannot continue to carry the can on behalf of the State, which has failed in its responsibility to provide much needed services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">In 2005 the Brothers of Charity Galway Services, which provides services in the Ballinasloe area, had a funding deficit of €1.8 million. The deficit was a direct consequence of the need to put in place additional staff to meet emergency situations which arose over the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">One example of the type of emergency case which had to be dealt with is that of Michael, a young man in seven-day, 24-hour residential accommodation which he shares with four young adults, each of whom has a severe intellectual disability. During the past year Michael went through an extremely difficult period of challenging behaviour, with the result that it was necessary for the safety of Michael, the other young adults with whom he shared his accommodation and the staff to move him to accommodation on his own and provide him with 24-hour wraparound staffing. This successfully addressed the issue in Michael's case. However, the full cost to the service was €280,000 per year, a cost which was entered into with the clear understanding of the HSE western region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">While everybody fully expects emergencies to arise in the course of each year and the Brothers of Charity can cope with approximately three or four such emergencies per year, in the past eighteen months they have had to deal with approximately 17 such emergency cases, which has led to a €1.8 million funding deficit. The Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children are fully aware of the situation, yet the Brothers of Charity received additional funding for these emergency cases amounting to only €300,000. This is a full €1.5 million short of the actual cost, which has had a direct impact on day-to-day services for other clients. I call on the Minister for Health and Children to make immediately available the additional resources required for these emergency services, to provide the €1.5 million to cover the 2005 overspend and to address the current service deficits in theBallinasloe area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">These deficiencies are not just confined to one age group or segment but are evident across the board, as is clear from the following examples. In-home support provides a flexible respite service for families within their own homes. A number of families are on a waiting list for this service but at present it does not extend to adults due to the limited budget available. If the budget for the children's respite service based at Ashtree House was increased, it could offer the service to more children within the area who are on a waiting list. There is currently a waiting list tor the adult respite service, which is funded on part-time basis at present. If funding was made available, the half-time posts could be made full-time and it would be possible to offer a more comprehensive service and would ensure that the Brothers of Charity are in a position to respond to crises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">The residential service requires funding to be made available so that the five-day service could be extended to a seven-day residential placement to meet the needs of residential clients. The elderly programme requires extra funding for a full-time care assistant. With regard to the Springfield child development centre, if extra resources were allocated and staffing hours increased, it would be possible to bring additional children into the service and increase the number of days children avail of facilities in the centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">These are basic funding needs in the Ballinasloe area. The services cannot be developed, first, as there is a deficit of €1.5 million from the budget for 2005; second, as the deficit is not being funded in 2006; and third, as additional funds are needed to develop these services into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">The Brothers of Charity provide an excellent service in Ballinasloe. They have traditionally provided that service not only to the children of east County Galway but also to the children of south County Roscommon. I implore the Minister to review this situation and ensure that the basic funding is provided. Elderly parents in these communities have provided the services for their children for many years. They want the State to assume its responsibilities and provide adequate funding for these services.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_1029">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. On behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, I am happy to have the opportunity to address the issue raised by Deputy Naughten as it provides an opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding the additional funding provided for services for children and adults with disabilities in 2006. Under the multi-annual investment programme 2006-09, which is part of the national disability strategy, additional funding amounting to €51.5 million is being provided by the Government in 2006 to meet costs associated with the provision of certain specific high profile disability services. With regard to services to persons with intellectual disability and those with autism, this includes 255 new residential places, 85 new respite places, 535 new day places and the continuation of the implementation of the transfer of persons with intellectual disability and autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">In addition to the services referred to above, further additional funding of €22.5 million is also being provided in 2006. This funding has been allocated to enhance the multi-disciplinary support services for children and adults with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities and those with autism, and to address core underfunding and staffing issues in services for people with disabilities provided by the voluntary sector. Capital funding amounting to €45 million has also been provided in 2006 to put in place the infrastructural supports associated with the above mentioned developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes the responsibility for the funding of new or enhanced levels of health and personal social services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">On the matter raised by the Deputy, the Health Service Executive has informed the Department of Health and Children that it is its policy to provide high quality services to people with disabilities in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner within the resources available. The Health Service Executive further states that the planning and development of services to meet emerging needs is carried out by it at local level in partnership with all stakeholders and within the context of the totality of need in any geographical area. Service requirements in the Ballinasloe area are part of this consultation process and are considered by the Health Service Executive in line with agreed structures and resource allocation mechanisms.</p>

            <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
            <p eId="para_1034">The failure of Government to lead the funding necessary for the scouting project at the Castle Saunderson estate on the Clones to Cavan road along the Border must be explained to this House and to Scouting Ireland. As the letter from the company secretary stated: "While large amounts of funding were secured from donors and commitments received from Government and statutory agencies, the project itself was unable to raise the necessary matching funding within the required timeframe." It is strange that this issue should arise at a time when major questions are being raised by the Government over the Ulster Canal, another truly cross-Border project. The Ballybay Development Association wetlands project was not even viewed by the relevant Government authorities and yet was refused, while at the same time the Minister for Foreign Affairs issued a major statement advising that everybody must get involved and make sure that proper cross-Border projects are included in the national development plan for the next six years, which is now being developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">Is it realistic for the Minister to request such a move when there has been clear Government inaction on the three most relevant cross-Border projects? The Ballybay wetlands project would involve all the schools of the region, North and South. The Ulster Canal would revolutionise tourism and has the backing of all sections of the community. The provision by Scouting Ireland of a jamboree structure at Castle Saunderson for the youth of the 32-county scouting organisation would bring enormous wealth to this hard-pressed Border area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">The Taoiseach visited the site in very difficult weather conditions. American donors and others were totally committed to the project. The cross-Border organisations are committed, yet once again the Government, with the exception of a small start-up grant, does not seem to understand the needs of the area. I realise no horse or greyhound tracks or other such activities are proposed and it is only for young people. However, I remind the Minister that 100% funding was provided for Punchestown without any evaluation. I understand generous grants were given in the Dundalk region for all-weather racing tracks. I urge that our sons and daughters in a truly cross-Border community project be reconsidered and that the necessary funding be provided. Some €3 million to €4 million would suffice and such money spent on encouraging our young people to take part in sport would more than be paid back through savings, not only in our health budget but also in Garda and security since young people would be doing something constructive and positive rather than causing problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">Councillor John Scott, who is the chairman of Belturbet Town Council, like many others has been involved in scouting all his life and he, together with all his fellow town councillors, regardless of politics, wants this project funded and delivered. The intention was to open a peace and reconciliation youth activity centre on the 103-acre estate with lakes, rivers and forestry already on site. The site has an old church, castle and roadways.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">In the past nine years the scouting organisations have come together on an all-Ireland basis. People on their behalf made contacts in the US for donations. They were in discussions with INTERREG, IFI and PEACE, all of which came on board. However, as happened in the Ballybay project, neither Fáilte Ireland nor any other Government body treated the project seriously. The Government must take action on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">I am glad that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is here this evening as he has moneys through various funds to address the issue. I hope the money he spends is spent as well as it would be spent on this project. This is a golden opportunity for peace and reconciliation. It would certainly be a different situation from Dublin on Saturday.</p>

            <p eId="para_1040">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. He also raised a number of other issues. It would be very wrong for me to upstage Deputy Connolly regarding the wetlands. As the Deputy is aware I am working very hard on the issue of the Ulster Canal and would be as committed to it as is Deputy Crawford. I hope all of us working together can progress the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue. The funding available to him is for clearly identifiable programmes relating to sport, arts, culture and tourism. Under the national lottery-funded sports capital programme operated by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, grants are awarded to sporting clubs and organisations and to voluntary and community groups for the development of sporting and recreational facilities. This programme is the primary means of financing the sporting infrastructure of the country and is administered on an annual basis. A total of almost €395 million has been allocated in sports capital grants to over 4,900 sporting projects since 1998. This funding has been of enormous benefit to the development of sport in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">The focus of the programme is the development of sport and recreational sport facilities. I understand the Castle Saunderson project involves the proposed establishment of a permanent national scouting jamboree site and it has a very small sporting element, being primarily a youth facility. An application on behalf of the project was submitted under the 2002 sports capital programme but was unsuccessful because of the minuscule sporting element in a project which at the time was costed at more than €8 million. In 1999 the then Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, met representatives Scouting Ireland, the promoters of this ambitious project, and explained to them that the project was not one suitable for consideration for funding under the sports capital programme. Scouting Ireland has not submitted a subsequent application for the project to the programme since 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">I have been informed by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs, Deputy de Valera, that a memorandum was received earlier this week for the project which states that the project, as originally envisaged, would require funding of approximately €10.7 million in phases 1 and 2. I have been advised that there are no funds available in the Department of Education and Science for funding of capital works of this level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has also contacted the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, regarding possible sources of funding for the project from the Department of Finance and he has advised that the project may be able to apply for funding under the EU-funded PEACE II cross-Border programme. Last year PEACE II was extended for another two years, which means that spending under the programme can now occur until 2008. The Department of Finance stated that a further programme, PEACE III, will cover the 2007 to 2013 programming period. The Castle Saunderson project is advised to contact the special EU programmes body in Belfast for further information on the PEACE programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">Unfortunately, for the reasons outlined in the early part of my response I regret that the Minister is unable to offer any assistance towards the project as it falls outside the nature of projects for which funding is provided by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</p>

            <p eId="para_1049">I believe it is more relevant to tourism. An application was made to Fáilte Ireland on behalf of a voluntary organisation, which in the previous five years spent €500,000 of its money on this eco-tourism project, which complements the school curriculum very well. All schools in the neighbouring counties have expressed a keen interest in the project. There is a demand for such a project with the imminent introduction of the mandatory ecology practical projects for the junior and leaving certificate biology and geography courses. It has the capacity for cross-Border co-operation in attracting school students and other visitors from across the Border.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">The grant aid sought has been fully indemnified enthusiastically by Monaghan County Council for the lifetime of the grant, which cannot be ignored. Private investors are involved and are willing to row in with a companion project to build eight ten-bed hostels there at a cost of €3 million. If the private investor believes a market exists, we cannot ignore it. We need to reconsider the project critically and objectively. The promoters are seeking fair play and due process. I wonder how we can ever develop or increase tourism in County Monaghan without projects to attract people. Tourism is currently worth about €4 billion annually, but County Monaghan gets a mere 0.25% of that. We also know that tourism is a diminishing market that is becoming more short term and tends more towards attracting people to cities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">I wonder what this BMW thing is all about, given that our region never seems to benefit from it. As Deputy Crawford pointed out, often only lip-service is paid to cross-Border projects such as those at Castle Saunderson, the Ulster Canal or the Ballybay wetlands project. The people in Fáilte Ireland seem to be untouchable and unanswerable to the democratic process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1052">I thank the Minister for the opportunity to put on the record of Dáil Éireann issues relating to the Ballybay wetlands project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">The overall context of the motion is that tourism revenues and visitor numbers in counties Monaghan and Cavan are, if not the lowest, certainly among the lowest in the entire country, while there is a serious underspend on tourism projects in the BMW region with much of the funding being diverted elsewhere. It is therefore reasonable to expect that every help and assistance should be given to good and sustainable tourism projects in County Monaghan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">In my opinion, the Ballybay wetlands project is a good development with a hugely committed development association working to ensure its success. Of course my opinion — which is just an opinion — does not count, but perhaps Fáilte Ireland could take into account the opinion of others, such as the International Fund for Ireland, which has offered substantial funding for the project and Area Development Management-Combat Poverty Agency, ADM-CPA, which has provided funding for a worker for two years. It might also take account of the opinions of Monaghan County Council, which has totally indemnified the project, and of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which has approved the legal agreement between Monaghan County Council and Ballybay Development Association. All those experts, groups and organisations have been willing to support the wetlands project, but Fáilte Ireland has not been able to come on board with the final piece of the jigsaw to start this worthwhile and much needed project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">I fail to understand why Fáilte Ireland will not accept the bona fides of Monaghan County Council and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Perhaps the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing or perhaps the left hand is just ignoring the right hand deliberately. Whatever is happening, Ballybay wetlands project is in the middle and the project could be lost just because one agency will not take the word and assurances of another.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">I am not sure what the Minister's role in the situation is, but we cannot continue to allow a community group to find itself in the middle between, on the one hand, a county council and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and, on the other, Fáilte Ireland. The community finds itself with no redress and no way out. That is just not acceptable. I do not know what the Minister can do, but someone must do something to move the situation forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_1057">I thank Deputies Connolly and Harkin for raising the issue. Senator O'Brien brought me one day to see the wetlands, but as someone who lives beside Lough Corrib and Lough Mask I was, I admit, a little bit disparaging about the lake. However, he forgave me because of the good spirit in which I made my remarks. It was a good time for the said Senator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">I have a bit of a problem tonight because the motion before us is "To discuss the funding of the Ballybay Derrvalley Wetlands Centre Project". To be honest, the matter was sent to my Department for answer because we presumed that the motion related to the application made under the Leader programme. I cannot throw any light on the application made to Fáilte Ireland. I suggest that the Deputies table a question to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to ask why the grant has been held up.</p>

            <p eId="para_1060">My problem is that Deputies now have a copy of the speech I was going to read. They will already know the background to the projects, so I will skip the first page.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">As the Deputies will know, when the Leader company in Cavan-Monaghan, the Cavan-Monaghan Rural Development Co-operative Society, evaluated the project in February 2004, it considered the project to be highly innovative and in line with the aims of the Leader programme. Clarification on the sources of the balance of funding was sought before a final recommendation to the board could be made. When the Ballybay Development Association clarified the proposal in August 2004, the amount of Leader funding sought was €65,000, out of a total cost of project of €915,000 excluding the site costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">I understand from the local Leader company that Ballybay Development Association was at the time trying to secure additional funding for the project. The project secured €340,000 from the International Fund for Ireland but other applications for funding to the National Lottery and Fáilte Ireland were unsuccessful. The difficulties in raising additional funding for the project have meant that Cavan-Monaghan Rural Development Co-operative Society has been unable to allocate funding. The society has worked closely with Ballybay Development Association in the past on this and other projects, including the allocation of €20,000 for enhancement work in the Ballybay town environs, and it hopes to do so again.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">It is open to the Leader company, subject to funds being available, to provide additional funding for the project. The development association should be able to go back to the Leader company. However, I cannot in any way influence the decision of a Leader company — the matter is its call — but that option is open to the group.</p>

            <from>Mr. Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_1067">I thank the Ceann-Comhairle for allowing me this opportunity to speak about orthodontic treatment in the Health Service Executive's southern region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">I raise this matter to highlight the plight of the thousands of young people in the southern region who are being denied orthodontic treatment within a reasonable timeframe. In some situations people are waiting up to three years for assessment and a further number of years before they receive treatment. It is wholly unacceptable that parents and young children are required to wait for so long.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">Without a doubt the issue of orthodontic services has been debated <i>ad nauseam</i> in various committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas, including the Joint Committee on Health and Children which heard from experts on the issue in 2002 and 2005. However, we seem to have an unfortunate problem in Cork in that the HSE seems unable to provide to our young people there the services that are provided in the rest of the country. It is time to address the issue in a serious and professional manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">I am not quite sure what the problems in Cork are but Dr. Ian O'Dowling, the consultant orthodontist in St. Finbarr's Hospital, has highlighted on numerous occasions, both privately to political representatives and openly to the public at large, that insufficient resources are being made available. A lack of training facilities has resulted in the region being unable to provide orthodontic services. Given that we have a dental training hospital attached to the Cork University Hospital, I feel we should take the opportunity to explore that as an avenue for addressing the problem. We need to ensure that the university hospital has the resources to provide adequate training and upskilling to ensure we can deliver services to those who most need them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">Dr. O'Dowling told Cork's <i>Evening Echo</i>:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1072">In the past two weeks I received a call from a teenage girl's mother who said her daughter is suffering from depression and is on anti-depressants, as she is being bullied at school over her teeth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">Like Dr. O'Dowling, as a public representative over the past 14 years I have received similar phone calls from parents who, in exasperation, have gone to a private provider simply because their son or daughter has suffered psychologically — either by being bullied and intimidated at school or because they have low self-esteem — because they have been unable to receive proper orthodontic care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">I hope the Minister will convey to the Minister for Health and Children my genuine belief that, rather than engage in finger pointing, we need to resolve the issue. I do not know what the difficulties are in Cork, but there have been difficulties. Dr. O'Dowling has stated his case. Although appointments have been made to the dental hospital, those have been short term and we are still left with only one consultant orthodontist. It is time that we made a serious decision to address the chronic problems of orthodontic care in the former Southern Health Board region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">Some might say orthodontics is unimportant but some people have severe dental problems for which surgery is required, such as disproportionality of the jaw and crowding of teeth. All those issues create great problems for the individual concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">It is not good enough that we have 4,000 people waiting for assessment and another awaiting 3,500 treatment. Particularly when children are vulnerable, forming their identity, or going through their teenage years, this issue is of paramount importance. It affects their mental and physical well-being socially and in school with regard to dental and oral hygiene. I hope the Minister can take back my message that we must address this issue quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">I have already mentioned the fact that we have a dental hospital. Training is very important there. If patients were treated there it would facilitate the upskilling of those providing the treatment. If there is an issue regarding St. Finbarr's — and Dr. Ian O'Dowling says that he is the only consultant orthodontist — an appointment should be made immediately to assist and help him in addressing those problems. He has commented publicly on numerous occasions. I do not know who was right or wrong, but I know that thousands of children in the former Southern Health Board region are suffering because of the lack of orthodontic services. That is wholly unacceptable.</p>

            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_1078">On behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, I am happy to address the issue raised by Deputy Kelleher.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">Under the Health Act 2004, provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in the southern area is the statutory responsibility of the Health Service Executive, HSE. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children is aware of the waiting list for orthodontic treatment in the HSE southern region. It has been noted that some improvement has been made there, with a decrease of 555 in the assessment waiting list and of 1,230 in the treatment waiting list.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">At the end of September 2005 almost 24,000 patients were receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. Over twice as many patients are getting orthodontic treatment as are awaiting treatment. More than 7,000 extra patients are receiving treatment now compared with four years ago. That tangible improvement will be further enhanced as the HSE develops the orthodontic services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">Developing the quality, standards, treatment capacity and outcomes of our orthodontic services in a sustainable way is an objective shared by the Tánaiste, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE. I believe that it will be supported by all clinicians and professionals involved in the public orthodontic services. To ensure best use of resources and develop treatment capacity in a sustainable manner, guidelines were introduced by the Department of Health and Children to enable the HSE to prioritise resources for those with the severest orthodontic conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children carried out a review of orthodontic services that culminated in 2002 in the publication of its report, The Orthodontic Service in Ireland. The Joint Oireachtas Committee also published a follow-up during 2005. The Department, in conjunction with the HSE, is considering each of the recommendations set out in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee. A range of measures to enhance the orthodontic services, both nationally and in the HSE southern region, has already been taken, and further improvements can be anticipated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the HSE's orthodontic service. The creation of that new grade has attracted orthodontists to work in the health service on a long-term basis. Over the last four years, the Department and the HSE have funded 22 dentists from various HSE areas for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. A further four public dentists commence specialist training in October 2006. Those additional trained specialists will play a vital role in increasing the numbers in treatment and reducing waiting times. No one should have to wait any longer than necessary for clinically needed orthodontic treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">The Department's commitment to training development is manifested in the funding provided for the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for Cork Dental School. That appointment at the school is facilitating the development of an approved training programme leading to a specialist qualification in orthodontics.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">In recognition of the importance of that post at Cork Dental School, the Department has provided €2.7 million to the school to make further substantial improvements to training facilities there for orthodontics. That project has seen the construction of a state-of-the-art orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will support an enhanced teaching and treatment service for the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics. Cork Dental School has advised the Department that training will commence at the start of the next academic year, October 2006. As part of the training programme, orthodontic treatments will be provided at the dental school, and it is envisaged that this will have a further positive impact on waiting list numbers in the southern HSE area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">Orthodontics is unique in that the treatment period for a child is between 18 and 24 months, and each year thousands of children with varying degrees of need are placed on assessment waiting lists. That undoubtedly presents challenges for service delivery and will continue to do so. The aim is to continue to make progress to develop a high-quality, reliable and sustainable public orthodontic service.</p>

            <p eId="para_1088">It has been the practice in responding to previous questions of this nature, in the interests of currency and accuracy of information, for individual Ministers to respond in relation to their own areas of responsibility. Accordingly, I will arrange for details of bodies under the aegis of other Ministers to be supplied directly to the Deputy by each Department. The public bodies under my aegis which are not covered by the FOI Act are the Central Bank and Financial Service Authority of Ireland; the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority; the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau; the Financial Services Ombudsman Council; the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal; the National Treasury Management Agency; the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission; the National Development Finance Agency; the State Claims Agency; the Valuation Tribunal; the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal; the Public Service Benchmarking Body; and the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1090">In view of the confidential nature of the work of the Public Service Benchmarking Body and the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, I do not propose to extend the Act to these bodies.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_525">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1094">The aim of the Government's initiative that I announced in my Budget Statement is to give an impetus to the development of social finance in Ireland. I believe the initiative can make a real contribution towards expanding social finance provision in Ireland, thereby complementing the wide range of measures that are currently in place to promote and assist community infrastructure and local development, including the establishment of micro-enterprises. It delivers, in a significant way, on commitments made in Sustaining Progress, the current social partnership agreement, and in our programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">Investment in social and community infrastructure and local development has the potential to yield significant economic and social returns. These types of projects, however, often experience difficulties in accessing finance from mainstream financial institutions. This has led to a recognition both domestically and internationally of the need for new and innovative investment mechanisms such as social finance. The essence of the social finance concept is repayable loan financing provided at affordable terms for community-based projects and local development initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">There are three distinct tiers involved in the delivery of the initiative: first, the creation of a social investment vehicle that will essentially perform the role of a wholesale financial intermediary, specialising in social finance funding, second, the arrangements for the on-lending of the funds for individual projects. The idea here is to use, as far as possible, existing agencies and established networks of social finance providers, third, community and local development organisations developing individual projects for social finance support and applying for social finance loans from the retail lending intermediaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">A practical model for social finance funding is currently being developed. The intention is to keep the administrative structures as light as possible, consistent with meeting the objectives of the initiative, and ensuring that the funds are used effectively on a value-for-money basis. With a view to developing an effective model my Department has, to date, consulted with a number of public, private and voluntary bodies currently involved or with interests in this area, in addition to its discussions with the banking community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">A key priority is early implementation of the initiative. This will provide the opportunity to market test particular options, which can in turn inform the further development of the social finance initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">As far as the potential sources of funding for social finance provision are concerned, there has been a positive reaction from the banking community to my invitation to support the initiative. The banks expressed at budget time a willingness to contribute seed capital funding of €25 million to the initiative. The sum of €100 million referred to by the Deputy in her question may relate to a newspaper report at the beginning of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">I do not at this stage have a view on the eventual scale of funding that may be warranted. It is not clear at this early stage what the level of demand may be. Experience in the UK and Northern Ireland would suggest, however, that some caution is warranted to ensure that the funds available are applied effectively and yield value for money investments. I am satisfied, therefore, that the seed capital from the banks is sufficient to meet initial requirements for the initiative in light of the available capacity and capabilities to develop suitable social finance projects and manage social finance lending. In my Budget Statement, I indicated that I was keeping the door open to other contributors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">Advice has been sought by my Department from the Office of the Attorney General on the appropriate legal framework which would clarify the objectives, roles and functions of the investment vehicle, establish the type of delivery structure judged most suitable to the long-term requirements of social finance, and also deal with such matters as governance and accountability arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1103">In my role as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the legal framework governing financial regulation. In the context of the regulatory system put in place through the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, under the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003, responsibility for the operation of the regulatory regime and the fitness and probity requirements for directors or managers in the financial services sector rests with the Financial Regulator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">The Financial Regulator in February 2005 issued a consultation paper on proposals for a fit and proper test for directors and managers of financial services firms, referred to as "Approved Persons". Taking account of the responses to this consultation, the Financial Regulator in February 2006 published its proposals on fitness and probity, including its proposals for assessment of tax compliance. In opting for a formal commitment to a code of behaviour in the conduct of tax affairs, rather than tax clearance certificates, the regulator took account of responses to the consultation. Some of these questioned the actual value of tax clearance certificates, as the Revenue certification related solely to declared liabilities. The objective in the case of regulation is to assure continued appropriate conduct of tax affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">The Financial Regulator is now proposing that each financial services company seeking approval from the Financial Regulator for directors or managers must have in place a code of ethics including in relation to the conduct of tax affairs. There will be an obligation on all approved persons to sign a written commitment to observe the code. The Financial Regulator will expect all regulated firms to ensure compliance with the code at all times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">Furthermore, the Financial Regulator has made it clear that there is no tolerance for serious and systematic tax evasion. The 2005 Finance Act gives greater powers to the Revenue Commissioners to prosecute institutions or persons who aid tax evasion by others. The Financial Regulator proposes to amend the individual questionnaire to include a specific question in relation to tax, asking applicants whether they have been convicted, on indictment, of tax offences or of aiding and abetting tax evasion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">The Financial Regulator is also proposing that any person convicted of summary tax offences or subject to fines by the Revenue Commissioners will provide that information, together with other information, to the proposing firm and to the Financial Regulator. The Financial Regulator will make a determination on a case by case basis, having examined all of the information provided, in a manner that is proportionate and that fully respects due process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">The consultation on these amended proposals will be completed by end-April 2006 and the Financial Regulator proposes to publish guidelines on the fit and proper test for directors and managers in June 2006.</p>

I envisage that the new plan will address the investment now necessary to maintain national competitiveness within a sustainable economic and budgetary framework. It will also set out a coherent investment strategy at sectoral level with particular reference to the infrastructure investment necessary to meet economic and social challenges. In addition, the plan will address the following horizontal themes: the implementation of the national spatial strategy; the all-island dimension and the potential benefits of cross-Border co-operation; the promotion of social inclusion; and environmental sustainability.</p>

            <p eId="para_1119">I am informed that the Portuguese Government has confirmed that the procedure to ratify the protocol between Ireland and Portugal amending the double taxation convention is under way and, on the assumption that the ratification process is completed this year, the protocol would then take effect from 1 January 2007, which is the earliest possible date from which it can take effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">I would also refer the Deputy to the impact of section 69 of the Finance Act 2003. That section amended our legislation to impose a charge to capital gains tax on an individual in respect of a deemed disposal of certain assets on the last day of the last year of assessment for which the individual is taxable in the State, prior to becoming taxable elsewhere, where the individual disposes of these assets while resident outside the State and returns to the State within five years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1125">The primary mechanism for placing civil servants who are in posts which are due to decentralise but wish to remain in Dublin is by way of bilateral transfer. As staff who have applied to decentralise continue to be transferred into decentralising organisations, the posts they vacate become available to those wishing to remain in Dublin. At end-January 2006 in excess of 1,150 staff have been assigned to decentralising posts of which almost 750 are Dublin based applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">In addition, my Department has been in discussions with the Civil Service unions on further arrangements to facilitate the placement of Dublin based staff. The objective of these arrangements is to provide to the Public Appointments Service details of staff who wish to remain in Dublin at each grade level so that a proportion of vacancies arising in Dublin based posts may be filled by those staff. These arrangements have been recently initiated for general service grades. I will write to the Deputy with details of the number of people who have supplied details to the Public Appointments Service in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127">It is intended that the arrangements will continue over the full transition phase of the decentralisation programme. I would not envisage a process similar to the central applications facility for the placing of staff in Dublin posts, as I would continue to expect that a significant number of staff will be placed through the bilateral arrangements outlined as the programme is rolled out. The central resource managed by the PAS will therefore represent only a proportion of the overall arrangements for placing of staff in Dublin posts. Participation in these arrangements by Departments and offices will be influenced by their timeframe for moving, their success in placing staff through the bilateral arrangements, whether they are relocating in full or in part and the extent to which their staff can be placed elsewhere within the organisation in Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_1129">Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty prohibits, in general terms, the granting of aid by the state which distorts competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods, in so far as the aid is liable to affect trade between member states. There are a number of components to this provision, all of which must be met before a particular type of support can be classified as a state aid. The principal components are that the aid in question is granted by a member state, which includes regional or local authorities or other bodies acting on behalf of the state, or through state resources in any form whatsoever; the aid confers an advantage on the recipient; the aid is selective in its application, inasmuch as it is not afforded to other undertakings in the market in general; and the aid is capable of distorting competition, usually by strengthening the competitive position of the beneficiary relative to other participants in the market, and is thus liable to have an effect on trade between member states. The EC Treaty also provides for circumstances in which state aids may be permissible in light of considerations of public policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">The enforcement of the state aid rules across the member states is primarily a matter for the European Commission. It is not the practice of Ministers to comment on areas where, depending perhaps on interpretation of rules, changing practice or jurisprudence, the Commission might wish to take a view in relation to the Irish tax code. As far as Ireland is concerned, all new proposed tax incentives are examined in light of the state aid rules, and it has been the general practice over recent years to discuss such measures with the European Commission and to notify schemes as appropriate.</p>

        the assumptions and methodology underpinning his estimate of the increase in revenue from capital taxes in 2006 (details supplied).
        [7987/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_532">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1137">The assumptions underpinning the forecasts for capital taxes are based on the economic growth estimates in the stability programme update which is published on budget day. These estimates include GNP growth forecasts, projected changes in consumer prices and developments in the construction sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">The methodology for forecasting receipts from capital taxes in 2006 first required my Department to estimate the outturns for the base year, in this case 2005. These projected outturns were then adjusted to take account of known once-off factors, both negative and positive, likely to impact on the yield in 2006. An example would be the discontinuance in 2006 of the bank levy, the receipts from which come under stamp duties. The figures were then refined to take account of the impact of budget measures. These various steps provide the base upon which the 2006 forecasts were built.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">The base is then inflated for projected economic developments in 2006. In the case of capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax, estimated growth is driven by the forecast change in nominal GNP and in the CPI, respectively. For stamp duties, since the bulk of the yield is from transactions in residential and non-residential property, the forecast for 2006 is largely based on estimated volume and price growth in the residential and non-residential property sectors. The methodologies used continue to be developed and my Department continually reviews any available international and domestic developments in forecasting methodologies in order to improve our approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">Capital tax receipts are always hard to forecast as they tend to reflect movements in property markets and once-off decisions by buyers and investors. With this in mind, my Department's estimates for revenues in 2006 from capital taxes are as follows: capital gains tax, €2,035 million; capital acquisitions tax, €260 million; and stamp duty, €2,685 million. The capital gains tax estimate represents an increase of 3.8% and the capital acquisitions tax estimate an increase of 4.4% on the respective outturns for these taxes in 2005. The stamp duty estimate represents a decrease of 1.5% on the outturn for stamp duties in 2005 but this largely reflects the non-renewal of the bank levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">The estimates for all three taxes assume a lower rate of growth in revenues from these sources this year than the significant increases experienced last year. They still assume, however, a reasonably buoyant property market this year, both residential and commercial.</p>

            <p eId="para_1143">I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 400 cases were selected for random compliance testing as part of their 2005 programme. This includes not just the auditing of returns filed but also the testing of overall compliance with their payment and return filing obligations. To date, random testing has been completed in 327 of those 400 cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">I am informed that Revenue's approach to random compliance testing changed significantly for their 2005 programme, and that any comparisons with previous years would need to bear this in mind. The traditional random audit programme was not carried out in 2004 due to the change in Revenue's approach following a review of the programme. However, 25 cases selected under the programme for previous years were completed in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">I understand that 274 random audits were completed in 2003 and 720 in 2002. However, for these years the selection was not purely random as Revenue districts narrowed down the initial random selection based on risk criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">With regard to 2006, I understand that the random compliance testing programme will commence shortly and that the sample size is again expected to be 400 — the same as for the 2005 programme. The Revenue Commissioners assure me that they are pursuing a programme which is dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion by maximising the impact of their resources through focusing on risk. This is strengthened by their taxpayer compliance testing programme, which ensures that all taxpayers are exposed to the possibility of a compliance check or Revenue audit. This approach is in line with international best practice.</p>

            <p eId="para_1148">Inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index, CPI, rose to 3% in January from 2.5% in December. The main cause of this increase was the recent rise in interest rates by the ECB.

            <p eId="para_1149">In my recent budget, my Department forecast that CPI inflation will average 2.7% in 2006. I made no changes to indirect taxes in the budget and this will help to ensure relatively modest inflation in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">On an EU basis, Ireland's harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, was 2.5% in January, compared to an estimated 2.4% in the euro area. Ireland has been broadly in line with the euro area for some time now.</p>

            <p eId="para_1159">The policy on numbers employed in the public service has succeeded in cutting back on the rapid rise in public service employment in the period 1997 to 2002. From 1997 to 2001 there had been an increase of almost 43,000, or 19%, in the number of public service employees. From the introduction of the policy in December 2002 to the end of 2005, the increase has been of the order of 6,300, or just over 2%. This took place at a time of significant increases both in employment in the economy generally and in the population with the corresponding increased demand for public services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">Numbers employed in the Civil Service, defence, local authority and non-commercial State-sponsored sectors have been reduced by 3,700 and the target for this group has been exceeded. However, original targets in the health and education sectors have not been met because the Government has been prepared to increase numbers to meet priority needs in frontline and essential services, for example, new health units and the disability area in the health sector, special needs teachers in the education system and to increase the number of gardaí; this is in line with the approach stated when the policy was launched.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">Total employment in the public service by the end of 2005 was close to 288,000. The Government has decided to continue to control and regulate numbers in the public service within the following agreed ceilings: Civil Service — non-industrials and industrials, 37,700; non-commercial State-sponsored bodies, 9,600; local authorities, 33,300; Defence Forces, 11,400; and Garda Síochána, 14,000. Given the nature and demands of the health and education sectors, further consultation is taking place between my Department and the relevant Departments before consideration is given to setting appropriate employment level ceilings in these sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">It is important that an appropriate balance is struck between the need on the one hand to provide resources to improve front-line services and the need on the other to control and regulate overall numbers in the context of providing value for money for the public expenditure involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_1166">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they maintain an enforcement presence at all the principal points of entry to the State for the purpose of checking compliance with the limits to these duty-free allowances. Officers perform checks on both accompanied and unaccompanied luggage or baggage on a selective basis using intelligence and risk assessment methods. In performing such tasks, a balance must be struck between the need for enforcing controls and not imposing undue burdens on passengers arriving in this country. In the circumstances, the commissioners do not consider the enforcement of the allowance limits unduly difficult or onerous.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">The Deputy might wish to note that the European Commission has, only in the last week, published a proposal with respect to revising the exemptions from VAT and excise duty applying to goods when imported by persons travelling from non-EU countries. Part of this proposal involves the €175 limit referred to above being increased to €500 in the case of air travellers. While we have yet to fully tease out all the elements contained in this Commission proposal, entitled COM 76 (2006), the proposed increase from €175 to €500 seems reasonable. Discussions on the Commission proposal will in the normal way commence at EU working group level.</p>

        if research has been conducted into the gap between public sector and private sector pay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1199">I assume that the Deputy is referring to the ESRI commentary published about a month ago dealing with public sector and private sector pay. The commentary drew on research carried out in 2004 which compared public and private wage rates, controlling for other factors that impact on wages, such as age, education and gender. The study concluded that in 2001, public sector employees earned 13% more than private sector employees — again, controlling for other characteristics associated with wages.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">The study seems to be based on aggregate data on fairly broadly defined categories, for example, professional, operative. However, it does not make comparisons based on actual job responsibilities and weights. Thus, it does not show conclusively that, on a like for like basis, public servants are paid more than valid comparators in the private sector. The methodology adopted simply does not allow such a conclusion to be drawn. This is not to criticise the research; it is merely to highlight that one must not draw inferences which the study could not sustain.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">The ESRI commentary also mentions a survey carried out among those who had recently graduated from third level colleges in 2004 which found that wages for this group were 20% higher in the public sector but acknowledges that the group was a narrow one. Again, we are dealing with a broad comparison.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">The Government position on public service pay is very clear. The public service must be able to attract and retain a reasonable proportion of good quality staff at all levels. In this respect, it should neither lead the field, nor trail behind. The independent benchmarking process affords a means whereby painstaking comparisons between public service jobs and their counterparts in the private sector can be made and appropriate pay rates for the public service determined. This process looks at qualifications, responsibilities, hours worked and a range of other factors. On the last occasion, the benchmarking process recommended awards across and within areas of the public service of from 4% to 25%, showing clearly that the benchmarking body looked at individual jobs and related them to their comparators in the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">A new benchmarking body has been established recently and is to report in the second half of 2007. I expect that, among the many tasks undertaken by the body, will be consideration of the significance of studies such as those quoted by the ESRI.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">The ESRI commentary represents a useful contribution to the debate on public service pay. It should be understood, however, within its own terms.</p>

            <p eId="para_1206">Lack of financial knowledge, particularly in relation to initiating the transaction, and the need to provide suitable identification documents to open an account, are frequently identified as the main obstacles faced by those on lower incomes when attempting to access financial services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">Financial institutions are obliged under the Criminal Justice Act 1994 to take reasonable measures to identify their customers, with a view to combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Guidelines approved by the money laundering steering committee under the aegis of my Department set out measures that might reasonably be adopted by financial institutions in this regard. These guidelines highlight that any measures adopted should not deny a person access to financial services solely on the grounds that they do not possess certain specified identification documentation. For its part, the Financial Regulator has incorporated this as a requirement in its draft consumer protection code.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">Identification of a customer comprises two elements. These are name verification — typically evidenced by a photograph bearing document such as passport, driving licence or other reputable source document — and address verification. The guidance notes for credit institutions provide for those circumstances where persons cannot reasonably be expected to produce certain forms of identification, such as a passport or driving licence and/or whose name and Irish address does not appear on a utility bill, electoral register or directory.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">As far as improving financial knowledge is concerned, the Financial Regulator within its statutory consumer mandate has developed a number of specific initiatives to help consumers make informed choices in terms of the financial products they choose, the amount of risk they take on and the cost of the financial products. These initiatives have been developed through the framework of the Financial Regulator's consumer awareness campaign and include publication of a fact sheet entitled How to Open a Bank or Building Society Account.</p>

            <p eId="para_1217">As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the legal framework governing financial regulation. In the context of this legislative framework, the Financial Regulator, which was set up in May 2003, has responsibility for consumer protection issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">I am aware that the Financial Regulator has expressed its concerns about payment protection insurance, PPI. The consumer director in the Financial Regulator highlighted her concerns in relation to this financial product in the Financial Regulator's annual report in July 2005. These concerns include how payment protection insurance is sold, how the costs are disclosed to customers and how premiums are handled in the event of early repayment of a loan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">The Financial Regulator has been actively pursuing this matter and, as result, a number of actions are being taken. First, through the new consumer protection code which the Financial Regulator proposes to introduce from July of this year, a suitability test will be applied to this product. In other words, it cannot be sold to the customer unless it is suitable to that customer. Also, when taking out a loan, the loan repayments will be quoted separately to that of PPI, so that the customer will see the true cost of the product.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">Second, the Financial Regulator is also currently consulting on introducing new requirements in relation to the disclosure of commission payments. Third, the Financial Regulator has produced consumer information materials on payment protection insurance, alerting consumers to the various issues they should consider in relation to this product. The fact sheet published earlier this month emphasises: that PPI is not compulsory; the high cost of cover; the very specific nature of the cover provided; and the need to ensure that the cover is in fact required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">Anyone who is concerned that they were mis-sold payment protection insurance can complain to the financial institution concerned or, if the complaint is not resolved, to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">I am satisfied that the active interest which the Financial Regulator is taking, together with the measures outlined above, will ensure that there is a high level of consumer protection and information available in the area of payment protection insurance.</p>

      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_545">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1246">On 13 January 2006 I formally announced the establishment of the Public Service Benchmarking Body as provided for in the second public service agreement under Sustaining Progress to undertake a fundamental examination of the pay of public service employees <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">Agreement was reached with the public service unions on the terms of reference and membership of the benchmarking body. The agreed terms of reference are set out below and its membership is as follows: chairperson, Mr. Dan O'Keeffe SC, BCL, LL.B., A.C.A; members — Mr. Billy Attley, former general secretary of SIPTU; Ms Olive Braiden, chairwoman of the Arts Council, chair of justice sector performance verification group; Mr. John Malone, former secretary general of the Department of Agriculture and Food; Mr. Thomas McKevitt, former deputy general secretary of the Public Service Executive Union; Mr. Willie Slattery, managing director, State Street International (Ireland) Ltd.; and Professor Brendan Walsh, emeritus professor of economics, UCD. The body is being asked to report in the second half of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">Terms of Reference for the Public Service Benchmarking Body</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">Introduction</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">In the second Public Service Pay Agreement under Sustaining Progress the parties agreed that the benchmarking body would carry out a benchmarking review to report in the second half of 2007. The parties have agreed the following terms of reference for the benchmarking body.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251">Timing and scope of the examination</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">The Public Service Benchmarking Body is asked to examine the pay and jobs of specified grades and to produce a report containing recommendations on the pay rates for these grades in the second half of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">As in the previous benchmarking exercise that took place between 2000 and 2002, the exercise should be a coherent and broadly based comparison with jobs and pay rates across the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">As in the previous exercise the Body will examine the roles, duties and responsibilities of jobs in the public service and in the rest of the economy and not just the pay rates applicable to jobs with similar titles, and superficially similar roles, in the private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">Approach</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">The body should conduct in-depth and comprehensive research and analysis of pay levels in the private sector on the following basis: Overall pay levels in the two sectors as well as pay rates for particular groups (such as clerical-administrative staff and technicians) and other identifiable grouping (such as graduate recruits); the overall pattern of pay rates in the private sector and employments across a range of type, size or sector; and the way reward systems are structured in the private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">As previously, the body, in reaching its recommendations should have regard to: the need to recruit, retain and motivate staff with the qualifications, skills and flexibility required to exercise their different responsibilities; the need to support ongoing modernisation of the public service; the need to ensure equity between the employees in both the public and private sectors and; the need to underpin the country's competitiveness and continued economic prosperity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">In this work the body should have regard to the differences between the public service and the private sector and between the various public service groups within its remit in working conditions, the organization of work, perquisites, and conditions of employment and other relevant benefits, including security of tenure and superannuation benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">The body should also consider any issues arising from any third party recommendations concerning benchmarking and any group on List A since the Body's first report, including, specifically, Labour Court Recommendations Nos. 17526 and 17805.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">Relativities</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">As was the case previously, the body should have regard to the agreement made under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and reiterated in Sustaining Progress that cross-sectoral relativities are incompatible with the benchmarking process. Within the sectors internal relativities is a relevant criterion for the body to take into account but the existence of any traditional or historic relativities should not prevent the body from recommending what it considers are the appropriate rates of pay for any particular job.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">Public Service Modernisation</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">Continued co-operation with change and modernisation has been a feature of previous national agreements and, in the context of Sustaining Progress, detailed action plans were agreed in each sector. This reflects the ongoing nature of the work of modernisation of the public service to meet present day needs and future demands. In that context change and modernisation is a continuing requirement of a modern public service. It is, of itself, not a basis for giving an improvement in pay or conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">Procedures</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">Subject to these terms of reference the benchmarking body will determine its own procedures but these should provide for relevant employers and trade unions to have the opportunity to make written and oral submissions to the body.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">The last exercise gathered large quantities of data and developed a job weighting system used by the body. In doing its work the body may draw on the previous work done in this area and use, as it sees fit, the existing database and methodology for comparing jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">The level of detail to be provided by the body in its report is a matter for the body itself taking into account any confidentiality constraints and its own judgement on the level of detail that should be provided. However, the body should seek to ensure the optimum level of transparency consistent with the efficient and effective operation of the benchmarking process, regarding the factors and their import, which the body took into account in determining the appropriate pay levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">Implementation</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">The implementation of the outcome of the benchmarking process is a matter for the parties and will be discussed by them in the context of discussions on whatever arrangements on pay and conditions are put in place on the expiry of the current Sustaining Progress pay agreement.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_546">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1271">As I indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 303 and 304 on 21 February, I wrote to my ministerial colleagues on 20 October last enclosing a copy of my address of the same date to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and requesting them to ensure that their Departments take all necessary steps to implement measures set out in my address.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">My Department has since issued a circular letter to all Departments on 25 January last outlining in detail the requirements to give effect to the measures in my 20 October address as well as decisions made by Government in relation to ICT and consultancy procurement. I have arranged for copies of this circular letter to be placed in the library of the House. The Financial Regulator has already drawn attention to the need for consumers to choose the right type of loan for their needs. The Financial Regulator, with its statutory consumer mandate, has developed a number of specific initiatives to help consumers make informed choices in terms of the financial products they choose, the amount of risk they take on and the cost of financial products. These initiatives have been developed through the framework of the Financial Regulator's "It's Your Money" campaign and have involved publishing consumer guides on credit products, fact sheets, cost surveys on personal loans, all of which are intended to assist borrowers in making the most appropriate credit decisions given their circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1273">While the level of indebtedness of Irish households has been increasing, the Central Bank's most recently published financial stability report concludes that a range of fundamental factors such as growing employment and incomes, falling inflation and low interest rates have supported the pattern of mortgage growth and associated debt levels in the economy. The report does, however, emphasise the importance of responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders to factor into their financial decision-making the prospective impact of potential changes in the future economic environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">I share the Central Bank's assessment of the importance of maintaining financial and economic stability. In that regard, for my part I intend maintaining a responsible approach to maintaining stability in our public finances, which will ensure that the strategic direction of our economy will focus on sustainable real improvements in public services, social provision and infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">As far as overall economic and financial stability is concerned, the relevant measure of credit encompasses both public and private sector credit and debt levels. The Minister for Finance has a key role in this regard in ensuring prudent management of the budget and overall sustainability in the public finances. In this context, Ireland's fiscal performance is among the best in the developed world with government indebtedness the second-lowest in the euro area. Responsible budgetary policy has made a significant contribution to economic performance overall, to the maintenance of low unemployment and to the achievement of record employment levels.</p>

        the anticipated costs, in terms of acquiring and equipping premises and other related costs, at the latest date for which figures are available, of the original decentralisation programme announced in budget 2004 and the slimmed down version announced in December 2004; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_547">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
            <p eId="para_1277">The Government is committed to the full implementation of the decentralisation programme announced in budget 2004, involving some 10,300 civil and public service jobs in more than 56 locations across some 60 Departments-offices and agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278">My office is in the process of procuring appropriate properties in the designated locations for the Departments and agencies involved, with much progress having been made to date. Property acquisition negotiations are completed or are significantly advanced at 23 locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">The prevailing property market conditions in each geographical area have a significant bearing on the cost of acquiring sites. As the acquisition process is still in progress, it is not possible at this stage to provide a precise estimate of the cost of the site acquisition programme. However, and for working purposes only, an indicative figure of €75 million to €100 million, excluding VAT, is being used by the OPW.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">As the Deputy will know, the decentralisation implementation group, DIG, in its report of November 2004, announced the names of the Departments and organisations selected as "early movers" and set out a timetable for provision of accommodation. At the same time the group published a report on the procurement and financial aspects of decentralisation. A further report — June 2005 — updates the timetable announced in November 2004, includes a timetable for the balance of organisations comprehended by the decentralisation programme and sets out commencement and completion dates for accommodation ranging from the final quarter of 2005 to end of 2009. I am confident that this programme will be successfully implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">With regard to the public private partnership approach recommended by the DIG, my office has been developing a comprehensive risk-adjusted costing of project elements to measure the value-for-money of future PPP bids. Expressions of interest will be sought for the first of these major projects early in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">Although property solutions will include leasing and fitting-out of existing buildings, it is anticipated that in the majority of cases, the accommodation facilities will be provided by the construction of new office buildings and cost estimation can be approached on that basis. However, in advance of actual market testing of any procurement methodology, it is possible at this time only to assign the most general measurements of cost to such a large-scale, diverse and complex programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">It is estimated that approximately 210,000 sq. m. of office space will be required to accommodate the total numbers included in the programme. OPW cost norms — April 2005 — in respect of offices would indicate an average build-cost to fit-out standard, in the range of €1,800 to €2,200 per square metre for suburban-rural locations, and €2,500 to €3,000 per square metre in city-town centre locations. Such figures exclude VAT, professional fees and inflation. In addition, the cost of equipping the accommodation to standard office equipment levels could be estimated at approximately €4,000 per person. This would exclude the cost of information and communication technology and specialised equipment requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">Such general measurements of cost do not include specialised facility and equipment requirements and other variables which would arise from the spread of possible procurement methodologies. In addition, general cost indicators of this type show a snapshot in time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">It is self-evident that a firmer scale of costs for the decentralisation programme will only emerge on foot of actual cost proposals being received from the market. It will be some months yet before sufficient data can be extracted from a suitable range of tender competitions to provide a basis on which more robust estimates of the overall cost of the programme can be made. Nevertheless, it can be estimated that, generally-speaking, the cost of providing accommodation in provincial, compared to central Dublin locations, should yield considerable cost savings to the State over time in terms of site costs, capital build costs and indeed maintenance costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1287">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the issue of approximately 2.2 million individual tax credit certificates to PAYE customers has now been completed. Revenue has advised me that each year priority is given initially to the issue of new certificates to employers so that employees get the benefit of changes to tax credits and reliefs announced in the budget in December in their pay packets as quickly as possible. Once the issue to employers is completed the next priority is the issue of certificates to the individual PAYE customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">The number of certificates to issue to both employers and PAYE customers is a major logistical operation and is of necessity spread over a period of several weeks. In addition, the budget changes involve changes to Revenue computer systems and this adds to the overall timeframe for the issuing of certificates. An added dimension for 2006 was the new PAYE computer system put in place by Revenue in October last that forms the foundation for a range of improved services for PAYE customers coming later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">Some situations have been identified where incorrect tax credit certificates have issued for 2006. Most of these have already been corrected and employers notified of the revised credits due. Any adjustments are automatically backdated to 1 January. I am assured that Revenue is working to fix the remaining problem cases as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1293">Inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index, CPI, rose to 3% in January from 2.5% in December. The main cause of this increase was the recent rise in interest rates by the ECB. In addition, the price of oil rose throughout most of last year and this had an input on the annual rate of inflation in January.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">In my recent budget, my Department forecast that CPI inflation will average 2.7% in 2006. I made no changes to indirect taxes in that budget and this will help to ensure relatively modest inflation in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">On an EU basis, Ireland's harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, was 2.5% in January, compared to an estimated 2.4% in the euro area. Ireland has been broadly in line with the euro area for some time now.</p>

In addition, the ceiling on the amount of section 481 funding that can be raised in respect of an individual film production is to be increased from €15 million to €35 million per film.

            <p eId="para_1407">The Credit Union Act 1997 provides the legal framework for the regulation of credit unions. The Act was designed to provide the credit union movement with a regulatory structure that reflected and promoted the particular ethos and philosophy of the credit union movement, its strong tradition of volunteer service and the core objective of providing opportunities for saving and lending for members of credit unions. In the context of this legislative framework, the Registrar of Credit Unions, within the Financial Regulator, is responsible for the operation of the regulatory and supervisory regime for credit unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">The Credit Union Act has provided the legal and regulatory framework within which the credit union movement in Ireland has continued to grow and develop over recent years. The assets of credit unions, largely comprising members' savings, have increased to €11.5 billion. This highlights the continued success of credit unions in meeting the financial needs of local communities and occupational groups falling within the common bond.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">The rules-based approach to the regulation embodied in the Credit Union Act has served the credit union movement well by providing clarity and certainty to individual credit unions, their directors and members. It has helped support the continued stability of the credit union movement and safeguard the members' savings during a period of rapid growth. The Act does provide a significant amount of discretion to the Registrar of Credit Unions in relation to specific regulatory requirements acting either on his own initiative or in the context of regulations made under the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">As Minister of Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions in light of the current state of development, capacity and capabilities of credit unions as a whole. A range of issues now arising in that context, including savings protection, investment rules and proposed legislative and regulatory changes, is currently under examination by my Department with the assistance of the Registrar of Credit Unions and are the subject of consultations with the representative bodies for credit unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">I can assure the Deputy that these issues will be assessed on their own merits with a view to establishing an appropriate balance in the regulation of credit unions between the need to facilitate credit unions in adapting to the changes taking place in Irish society and ensuring the stability and financial sustainability of credit unions and the safeguarding of the very significant savings entrusted to them by their members.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">My decisions in these matters will be based on the advice and information provided by the Registrar of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC — the statutory advisory body on credit union matters — and the credit union movement itself.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1420">I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 114 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">The Deputy's question refers to a projection relating to overall private sector debt. In evaluating the financial position of the private sector, it is too narrow an approach to consider the level of indebtedness in isolation from the asset side of the private sector's balance sheet. A high proportion of household indebtedness in Ireland, which accounts for approximately 45% of private sector indebtedness overall, relates to borrowing for house-purchase which, in turn, creates an asset for the households. In the same way, borrowing by the business sector underpins high investment levels and the creation of business assets yielding future income. It therefore reflects the strong performance of the economy and confidence in Ireland's economic prospects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">The report referred to by the Deputy makes the important point that in assessing household debt, account should be taken of Ireland's demographics, savings ratio and interest rate regime. A comparative household debt index published in the report which takes account of these factors, places Ireland's household indebtedness level at 11th out of 19 developed countries. As the Deputies will be aware, the Government has been actively promoting saving by individuals in the recent past, notably through the SSIA scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">As far as looking after the interests of the individual borrower and the individual investor is concerned, the function of Government is to provide an appropriate legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector, one that is both comprehensive and robust. I am satisfied that on foot of the progress made over recent years, especially in establishing the Financial Regulator with a particular focus on the interests of the consumer, we have such a framework in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">Within the implementation of the overall legislative framework, private sector credit growth and debt levels are, in the first instance, a matter for the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland. This follows from its role as part of the European system of central banks and its functions, as the Financial Regulator, in relation to the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the protection of the consumers of those firms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">The Financial Regulator has already drawn attention to the need for consumers to choose the right type of loan for their needs. The Financial Regulator, with its statutory consumer mandate, has developed a number of specific initiatives to help consumers make informed choices in terms of the financial products they choose, the amount of risk they take on and the cost of financial products. These initiatives have been developed through the framework of the Financial Regulator's "It's Your Money" campaign and have involved publishing consumer guides on credit products, fact sheets, cost surveys on personal loans, all of which are intended to assist borrowers in making the most appropriate credit decisions given their circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">While the level of indebtedness of Irish households has been increasing, the Central Bank's most recently published financial stability report concludes that a range of fundamental factors such as growing employment and incomes, falling inflation and low interest rates have supported the pattern of mortgage growth and associated debt levels in the economy. The report does, however, emphasise the importance of responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders to factor into their financial decision-making the prospective impact of potential changes in the future economic environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">I share the Central Bank's assessment of the importance of maintaining financial and economic stability. In that regard, for my part I intend maintaining a responsible approach to maintaining stability in our public finances, which will ensure that the strategic direction of our economy will focus on sustainable real improvements in public services, social provision and infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">As far as overall economic and financial stability is concerned, the relevant measure of credit encompasses both public and private sector credit and debt levels. The Minister for Finance has a key role in this regard in ensuring prudent management of the budget and overall sustainability in the public finances. In this context, Ireland's fiscal performance is among the best in the developed world with Government indebtedness the second-lowest in the euro area. Responsible budgetary policy has made a significant contribution to economic performance overall, to the maintenance of low unemployment and to the achievement of record employment levels.</p>

The lower rates have applied to the Barr tribunal since June 2005.

            <p eId="para_1485">The ESRI published its most recent Quarterly Economic Commentary in January 2006. The ESRI is forecasting economic growth this year of 4.7% in GDP terms, and 4.8% in GNP terms. It is forecasting employment growth of 3.2% and an unemployment rate of 4.2%. These forecasts are broadly in line with my own Department's forecasts for 2006, which were published at budget time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">On budget day, my Department forecast CPI inflation of 2.7% in 2006, again in line with the ESRI forecast of at 2.6%. I am pleased to see, and obviously agree with, the ESRI assessment that the budget was strongly progressive in terms of the direction of tax and social welfare measures in favour of those on lower incomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">In relation to the research on the partnership process, the ESRI commentary calls for wage restraint in the public sector under any new partnership deal and for flexibility in relation to private sector wages. The Government position on public service pay is very clear. The public service must be able to attract and retain a reasonable proportion of good quality staff at all levels. In this respect, it should neither lead the field, nor trail behind. The independent benchmarking process affords a means whereby sustainable comparisons between public service jobs and their counterparts in the private sector can be made and appropriate pay rates for the public service determined.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">A new benchmarking body has been established recently and is to report in the second half of 2007. I expect that, among the many tasks undertaken by the body, will be consideration of the relevance of studies such as those quoted by the ESRI, which were fairly broad in their scope and were not based on actual job comparisons. Nonetheless, the ESRI commentary makes a useful contribution to the ongoing debate on public sector pay.</p>

            <p eId="para_1490">The Centre for Management and Organisation Development, CMOD, in my Department developed procedures for the peer review process and agreed these in meetings with other Departments and offices late last year. A number of projects were identified for early inclusion in the initiative and the review of two of these is now under way and initial work has commenced in two more.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">The peer review is carried out at key decision points — preliminary business case assessment, detailed assessment, pre-tender, post-tender, and project close-out — by a team of experienced people external to the project board and the organisation. The process will particularly focus on examining the preparation of good business cases; cost benefit analysis; affordability within the approved budget for the organisation; detailed planning; and the governance arrangements, etc. Peer review teams will be selected by the sponsoring Department or office of each project subjected to the process. These selections are subject to agreement with CMOD. It is envisaged that such review teams will include people with relevant experience from both the public and private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">However, while I believe that the peer review process is a very worthwhile initiative and is an additional safeguard in the development and implementation of IT projects, it does not in any way override the accountability arrangement in place within organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">It is envisaged that reviews will be carried out for all projects where the development and roll out costs exceed €5 million or where the project would be likely to stretch the resources of the sponsoring Department or agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">As well as developing and agreeing the process with other Departments and offices, CMOD will co-ordinate, administer and control the peer review process across the whole public service which will include providing a panel of peer reviewers to sponsoring organisations; selecting the number and type of projects to be peer reviewed; agreeing the composition of peer review teams; considering the peer review team's findings and the sponsoring organisation's consideration of these findings for each stage of the peer review process before making and issuing any final decision to proceed or halt; and developing a website in the future where review findings will be placed in the public domain.</p>

            <p eId="para_1498">The first SSIAs commenced in May 2001 and will mature at the end of May 2006. As indicated in replies to previous questions, it is not possible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables including where participants voluntarily withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions over the remaining period of the scheme.

As far as the IFSC is concerned, the Financial Regulator has emphasised that since its inception, the IFSC has been regulated to the highest international standards for all financial activities. Moreover, the regulatory standards applied in the international financial sector are no less stringent than those that apply generally in the industry in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1510">As far as the reinsurance sector in particular is concerned, the Deputy may wish to note that it is only comparatively recently that the international community concluded that reinsurance should be subject to a full regulatory regime. In this context my Department and the Financial Regulator have played a full part and have been actively engaged in the process of developing a reinsurance regulatory regime at EU and international level. The EU reinsurance directive was finally published in December 2005. Ireland will be among the first countries in Europe to implement it with the directive expected to be transposed into Irish law by April 2006 — significantly in advance of the transposition deadline of December 2007. This will result in a full solvency regime for reinsurance companies in Ireland. The Irish regime will go beyond the strict minimum requirements of the directive by requiring adherence to explicit standards of corporate governance and by requiring particular disciplines in relation to finite reinsurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511">The specific issues referred to by the Deputy that have been a subject of indictments in the US were orchestrated in the US in order to overstate the capital position of the firm concerned. The Financial Regulator has worked closely at the highest levels with the regulators from the other jurisdictions involved in these transactions with the objective of ensuring that all the issues are dealt with and all the necessary actions are taken, including ensuring that any involvement in such activity no longer has a place in the industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512">The Financial Regulator is always concerned about, and has always acted to ensure, the good reputation of Ireland as a well-regulated market in view of the importance of that reputation to the success and attraction of Ireland as location for the provision of international financial services.</p>

            <p eId="para_1515">The private use by directors or employees of helicopters or planes supplied by their employer is within the general benefit in kind tax charging provision and the rule in relation to such benefit is that the annual taxable benefit in kind arising is calculated by reference to a sum equal to 5% of the market value of the helicopter or plane at the date it was first provided plus the annual running costs, as apportioned between business use and private use. However, where an employer charters and pays for a plane or helicopter for the private use of the director or employee, the full cost of such charter is treated as part of normal salary and taxable in full in the hands of the director or employee.</p>

            <p eId="para_1519">The Deputy may wish to note that the statutory Financial Services Ombudsman scheme, in place since April 2005, provides a wider coverage in terms of financial services than did its predecessor voluntary schemes. This is reflected in a higher level of complaints. Furthermore, increased awareness of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the reputation and increased effectiveness of a statutory scheme inevitably has the effect of encouraging consumers to avail of the scheme. The fact that people are choosing to use the Ombudsman service demonstrates that the system is working as intended in providing a mechanism within which complaints against financial institutions can be investigated and resolved.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_568">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1521">I cannot agree with the Deputy that north Mayo is being neglected by the Government. However, I do recognise that the area has suffered the closure of a number of key employers over the past 18 months and efforts by the Government to attract new job opportunities have proved difficult. My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Micheál Martin, has already outlined to the House the efforts he, his Department and the development agencies are making to deal with this difficult situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">The latest data reported to my Department indicates that some €750 million has been spent in County Mayo under the NDP since 2000. Expenditure on housing, transport and environmental infrastructure alone has amounted to some €490 million. The Deputy will agree that this is a significant level of investment. Ambitious plans have been set for further investment in transport infrastructure under Transport 21. Transport 21 sets out targeted improvements to be made in a number of national secondary routes including the important N59 costal road which runs from Sligo through north Mayo on through Westport and into Galway city. Recently completed projects in north Mayo include phase 1 of the N26 from Ballina to Bohola with a further 18 km currently being planned by the NRA. Work on the important N5 Charlestown bypass has begun and is due for completion in 2008. Further development of the N5 will see 14 km of roadway being constructed which will bypass the town of Ballaghaderreen. In addition, a further 17 km of the N5 from Westport to Castlebar will be upgraded following completion of planning for the project. When completed, these projects will further complement the 16 km of the N17 between Knock and Claremorris which was completed in 2002 and the plans by the NRA for upgrading a further 25 km of this route from Charlestown to Collooney.</p>
            <p eId="para_1523">The Deputy will be aware that investments under the NDP are delivered through a number of operational programmes which are directly managed and implemented by Departments, the regional assemblies or other agencies. The responsibility of my Department is to ensure that resources are made available to meet the Government's objectives and to secure full drawdown of Ireland's allocation of Structural Funds. Departments have been asked to ensure that the investment objectives for the BMW region are prioritised. I expect that the level of planned Exchequer expenditure under the NDP will be close to target at the end of the programming period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1524">With respect to tax incentive schemes which come under my responsibility, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that Ballina was among the 42 towns and cities that had integrated areas designated for tax relief under the 1999 urban renewal scheme, while Belmullet, Charlestown and Foxford had sub-areas and sites designated for tax relief under the town renewal scheme. Under both of these schemes tax relief is provided for the refurbishment and construction of certain residential, commercial and industrial buildings. In my Budget Statement I announced that arising from a review of the various property and area based tax incentive schemes that the following reliefs either have achieved the objectives set out for them or are no longer considered to be cost effective in terms of the objectives set out for them and are therefore being terminated subject to certain transitional provisions. These are the urban renewal, town renewal and rural renewal schemes, and the special relief for hotels, holiday cottages, student accommodation, multi-storey car parks, third-level educational buildings, sports injuries clinics, developments associated with park and ride facilities and the general rental refurbishment scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1525">This winding down of property based tax reliefs is consistent with the greater capacity of particular economic sectors nowadays to fund such investment from their own resources, and the sizeable capital investment which the Government itself is making through major new investments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1527">I am satisfied that good progress continues to be made on this ambitious programme. I am particularly pleased with the continuing popularity of the programme among public servants. There are about 10,600 applications on the central applications facility to date and new applications are being received each week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">I refer the Deputy to the decentralisation implementation group's July 2005 report which identified progress in relation to property, implementation planning, numbers of applicants and human resources and industrial relations issues. In line with the group's approach to phasing, the report provided indicative construction start and completion dates for the procurement of office accommodation in the new locations. The full contents of this report can be accessed at <i>www.decentralisation.gov.ie</i>. The final construction dates can only be confirmed when the tender process has been completed in respect of each location and are contingent on the level and quality of market interest in respect of sites, successful negotiation of contracts, receipt of acceptable planning permissions, timely completion of briefs and successful acquisition of suitable sites. I understand that the OPW is currently updating the position on the property aspects of the programme in light of experience to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">Discussions have progressed with the Civil Service general service unions on a number of human resource and industrial relations issues. Actual movement of staff within and between Departments and offices is now under way with approximately 1,150 staff already assigned to posts which will decentralise. Discussions are continuing with the professional and technical staff representative in respect of arrangements for staff in those grades.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">With regard to the State agencies, the decentralisation implementation group took the view that it would not seek to dictate every step in the process to the management of the state agencies. Although the group proposed a group of state agencies for early mover status it did not include specific timeframes in recognition of this approach and also of the fact that it is the responsibility of the board and senior management of each agency to implement Government policy. The group stated in its report that each agency included in the programme should have a successful relocation as a high level strategic objective and should prepare the next and deeper iteration of its implementation plan. In the meantime, the OPW is continuing to seek property solutions in respect of any agency that requires it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1534">My Department is continuing to liaise with the Financial Regulator and the banking industry to determine the merits or otherwise of the proposed incorporation of uncashed bank drafts into the dormant accounts scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">The approach currently under consideration relates to the funds held by the banks against presentation of the drafts to avoid any change in the rules or conditions relating to the instruments themselves. However, a number of important legal and technical issues have arisen and are being examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">First, funds representing uncashed bank drafts are held in an account in the name of the bank where it was issued and not an account in the name of the person beneficially entitled to the draft. Such accounts are inherently different to those specified under the dormant accounts legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">Second, bank drafts are payable on demand to the payee but the bank has no knowledge of the current holder of the bank draft and records do not always include the address of either the original purchaser or payee. This presents obvious difficulties in meeting the notification requirements which are a key feature underpinning the current dormant scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">Third, while bank drafts are payable on presentation, reclaims from the dormant accounts fund allow for a delay of up to 56 days. As banks will have to pay out almost immediately on drafts, it may not be feasible to oblige them to fund the payment for such a period. The assessment of these issues is continuing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">Consideration is required of whether the prospective yield from bringing uncashed bank drafts within the scope of the dormant accounts legislation as would outweigh the costs associated, in relation to regulation and compliance, as well as inconvenience to holders of these drafts.</p>

However, the goal set for the national pensions reserve fund, NPRF, from the outset under its establishing legislation, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, has been to secure the optimal return over the long term, having regard to the purpose of the fund as set out in section 18(1) of the Act and the payment requirements of the fund as provided for under section 20 of the Act, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the NPRF commission.

            <p eId="para_1554">Some so-called ethical investment funds have performed well in the past and may continue to do so. The national pensions reserve fund commission has discretion to allow its investment managers to invest in the sectors it sees fit to maximise the return to the fund consistent with prudent risk management.

            <p eId="para_1561">The CSO's most recent employment figures, taken from the quarterly national household survey, show that average employment in 2005 was 1,952,000 people. This was an increase of 87,000 jobs, or 4.7%, on 2004. The sectors making the greatest contribution to this increase were construction, up by 30,900 or 14.4%, financial and other business services, up by 18,500 or 7.7%, wholesale and retail trades, up by 11,700 or 4.4% and health, up by 9,400 or 5.2%. On the other hand, employment in industry fell by 7,600 persons, 2.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">The CSO's most recent estimate shows that GDP in the first three quarters of 2005 was 4% higher than in the same period of 2004. Output in all sectors was up on 2004, with the exception of the agriculture sector. While full year data are not yet available, estimates contained in budget 2006 point to GDP growth of 4.6% for last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">The growth in employment and GDP can be used to calculate a crude indicator of the trend in labour productivity. To do this requires comparing growth in employment and GDP in 2005, which were 4.7% and an estimated 4.6% respectively. This implies that there was little or no increase in aggregate labour productivity in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1564">Care should be taken in interpreting differences between trends in employment and in GDP because timing differences and statistical volatility can affect the results. In particular, estimates of GDP are still subject to revision. However, there is evidence in recent years to suggest that while labour productivity levels continue to increase, the rate of growth is slower than previously.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">A major factor influencing the slowdown in the rate of increase in labour productivity is the change in the sectoral composition of the workforce. Productivity growth rates in Ireland have been exceptionally high compared with other countries because of the large numbers of foreign owned high technology industries that generate very high levels of output or value added. However, much of the strong growth in employment in recent years has been in other sectors such as construction and retail, with the result that the overall productivity levels have not grown as quickly as in the past, although the total numbers employed have increased at a record rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">While employment growth in 2005 has marginally exceeded the estimated growth in output as measured by GDP, it is too early to conclude that there has been an unexplained collapse in labour productivity. The available information is still limited and part of the fall is explained by changes in the composition of employment. However, this is something that needs to be monitored as more information becomes available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1568">The following is the up-to-date position on court prosecutions initiated for tax evasion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">In 1997 there was one prosecution and one conviction. A fine of €635 was imposed with no custodial sentence. In 1998 there were six cases and eight convictions; fines totalling €42,854 were imposed. There were two custodial sentences, one of six months suspended and one of two years suspended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">In 1999 there were two cases and one conviction. In one case a fine of €19,046 was imposed with no custodial sentence. In the other the defendant was acquitted. In 2000 there were three cases and three convictions. Fines totalling €952 were imposed. There were two custodial sentences, one of two years, reduced to 18 months on appeal, and another of 12 months suspended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">In 2001 there were four cases and four convictions. Fines totalling €14,284 were imposed. There were four custodial sentences, one of 12 months, two of six months suspended and another of three months. In 2002 there were three cases and three convictions. Fines totalling €5,540 were imposed and there was one custodial sentence of six months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">In 2003 there were six cases and seven convictions. Fines totalling €29,365 were imposed and there was one custodial sentence of two years suspended. In 2004 there was one case and one conviction. A fine of €5,000 was imposed and 180 hours community service was imposed in lieu of a three months custodial sentence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">In 2005 there were eight cases finalised and ten convictions resulted — a prosecution for tax evasion can involve more than one person, or a case may involve both individual and corporate culpability. There were three custodial sentences, one of two years suspended and two of three months each. In a further two cases 240 hours and 120 hours of community service were imposed in lieu of custodial sentences of six months and three months, respectively. Fines totalling €199,287 were imposed. In another two cases guilty pleas were entered and sentencing was adjourned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1574">In 2006 so far there are 11 cases before the courts and a fine of €2,000 has been imposed in respect of a case adjourned from December 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">The Revenue Commissioners have a clear policy of prosecuting cases of serious tax evasion. This function is tasked to their investigations and prosecutions division. Following the restructuring of Revenue in 2003, all investigation activity was consolidated in this division with a remit to co-ordinate all Revenue prosecution work and, in particular, to increase the number of criminal investigations for serious tax offences and ultimately to increase the number of prosecutions. The number of investigators was also increased for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576">The latest figures indicate that this approach is continuing to bear fruit. There are 58 cases under investigation for potential prosecution, the Director of Public Prosecutions is considering a further nine cases and has given directions to prosecute in another eight. In another case, a bench warrant has been issued for failure to attend court and, as I have stated, 11 cases are in the court process. I am satisfied that the above figures vindicate the decision to concentrate Revenue's prosecution resources in one area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1578">The scheme of capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals was reviewed by Indecon Economic Consultants as part of the overall review of property tax incentives in 2005. Indecon consulted widely in the course of its review, including consultations with the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive. Its report was published on 6 February 2006 and is available on the Department's website. The summary of the main findings from Indecon's analysis is as follows: There has been an overall increase in planning applications and approvals for private hospitals since 2000 but most have not proceeded to date. Most of the extra investment in the sector would either not have been undertaken, or would have taken longer to come online in the absence of the tax incentive scheme. After taking account of the beneficial effects of extra investment as a result of the scheme allowing for opportunity cost and deadweight, Indecon estimates the net cost of the tax incentive to the Irish Exchequer at €23.3 million in terms of tax revenue forgone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1579">While it is too early to provide detailed estimates of the impact of the scheme on the supply and on the costs of hospital beds, Indecon believes the scheme has the potential to address supply shortages in the sector and to reduce costs. The net cost of this measure to date of €23.3 million estimated by Indecon will be spread over a number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">Private health care is a long established feature of the system of health care provision in Ireland and acts as a strong complement to the publicly funded system. Private health care provision spans from general practitioner services through private beds in public hospitals and private hospitals to private nursing homes. The Government is committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity in the health system. The key objective is to provide the required extra capacity, whether this is in the public or private sector. A number of Government policies-initiatives support the coexistence of public and private health care such as the designation of private and semi-private beds in public hospitals; income tax relief on private health insurance premiums; income tax relief on medical-dental expenses; the National Treatment Purchase Fund sources capacity in private hospitals for public patients; and the Tánaiste's policy direction to the Health Service Executive to build private hospitals on public sites, thereby freeing up beds for public patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_1584">Mortgage protection insurance is to provide, in the event of the death of the borrower, for the payment of a sum equal to the outstanding balance of the loan, although some policies may also offer greater life cover or an investment element.</p>
            <p eId="para_1585">Mortgage protection policies are usually put in place at the time of drawdown of a mortgage loan and the annual or monthly premium is calculated on the assumption that the policy will continue in force over the lifetime of the loan. Typically this would be for a period between 20 and possibly 30 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">Switching insurer would involve cancelling the policy in force and taking out a new one. Any change in actuarial factors such as the age and health of the insured person or persons, and the amount of cover and the length for which it is required, together with any commission and other sale costs, will all affect the premium charged in respect of the new policy. Accordingly, while it may be worthwhile to review the level of cover under the policy on a regular basis, switching insurer may not be an advisable course of action.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">In the circumstances, the interests of consumers would be better served by seeking to ensure that they are facilitated in getting value at the time the insurance is put in place rather than seeking to facilitate switching. The Financial Regulator has already taken a number of initiatives in this regard, including its independent consumer guide to mortgages and the independent guide to life insurance, which explains mortgage protection insurance in more detail and encourages consumers to shop around.</p>

In the budget 2006 forecasts the Department forecast that personal consumption will continue to be a major driver of growth over the period 2006-08, supported by strong earnings and employment growth. The maturing of the SSIA accounts is expected to provide some impetus to consumption, particularly in 2007, when the bulk of the proceeds become available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1594">While it is difficult to be certain of the impact of SSIA maturity, economic theory and the experience of other countries suggests that it is unlikely that a once-off factor of this nature will have an undue impact on overall consumption patterns. In 2006 growth in personal consumption is forecast to be 5.8%, accelerating to 6.8% in 2007. A slightly lower growth rate of 4.6% is expected in 2008 as the effect of the SSIA scheme unwinds.</p>

            <p eId="para_1599">In my 2005 Budget Statement I announced that a review of a broad range of tax incentive schemes would be undertaken in 2005. The review process included studies by external consultants Indecon and Goodbody Economic Consultants, as well as internal reviews by officials from the Department of Finance and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, with the involvement of other Departments as appropriate. In the budget 2006 documentation, summaries of the recommendations of the various reviews were published. The full reviews were published by my Department in three volumes on 6 February 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1600">I have outlined in my Budget Statement and, extensively, in discussions on the Finance Bill, a wide range of actions which I am taking arising directly from this review process. For example, arising from the recommendations of the external consultants, a range of property-based tax incentive schemes are being discontinued, subject to transitional measures to avert any undue negative impact on the construction sector. A number of other tax schemes are to be retained or reintroduced, subject to amendments in some cases, and a horizontal measure is to be introduced from 1 January 2007 to limit the extent to which high earning individuals can shelter income from taxation in any one year. I am pleased that the Government's initiative in these reviews has yielded results both in terms of identifying reliefs which are to be phased out as well as those which should be maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_1603">Public procurement guidelines issued by my Department require contracting authorities to ensure that tenderers have regard to minimum pay and other legally binding industrial or sectoral agreements when preparing tenders and that tender documents should have an appropriate reference to this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1604">Regulations transposing recently revised EU directives on public procurement, currently being finalised, will require contracting authorities to indicate to tenderers where information on obligations relating to employment protection and working conditions legally in force in Ireland may be obtained. Tenderers will then be requested to indicate that in drawing up their tenders they have taken these obligations into account. Contracting authorities will be required to disregard any tenderer that fails to indicate compliance with this requirement. New draft forms for construction contracts, which are the subject of consultation with the forum for the construction industry, include provisions that require contractors to ensure that pay and conditions of employment comply with the law and are not less favourable than the terms of the registered employment agreements for those employees to whom the agreements apply. The new draft contracts also include a provision which gives some support to strengthening enforcement arrangements in the construction sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1628">As reported in the most recent annual report of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and in the most recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the total tax debt outstanding at 31 March 2005 was €1.2 billion, not the €2.5 billion quoted by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as with any tax system, there will always be people who pay late, evade payments or are unable to pay. In this context, it is important to note that the debt of €1.2 billion on 31 March 2005 is €146 million or 10.7% less than on 31 March 2004. The figure represents 2.5% of annual gross collection and is one of the lowest percentages of any tax administration internationally. Of this figure, €278 million of the total debt is under appeal with a further €349 million under control or at enforcement. The remainder, €590 million is under active collection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">It is the goal of Revenue, as stated in its statement of strategy for 2005 to 2007, that all debt on record should be less than five years old or the subject of active enforcement or court proceedings. In this context, I am advised by Revenue that it expects the current collectible tax debt and any additional debt that will arise for periods up to 31 December 2004, through assessments made by Revenue or submission of overdue returns by taxpayers, to ultimately be substantially reduced in the next five years. That reduction will be achieved primarily by collection of debts due.</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">Revenue has emphasised the changing composition of the debts and the difficulty this creates in making an estimate of the likely reduction in the debt figure over a five year period. The strategies and methodologies adopted by Revenue to achieve a reduction over a five year period will be subject to an annual review and evaluation carried out within the context of its business planning process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1637">I presume that the Deputy means to refer to an extension of the persons eligible for the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions according to their disability status. The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. A person must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions: be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; be without both hands or without both arms; be without one or both legs; be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; or have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">A special interdepartmental review group reviewed the operation of the disabled drivers scheme. The terms of reference of the group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">The group's report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme. It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries. The report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the possible future development of the scheme. The short-term recommendations in respect of the appeals process have been implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1640">In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, the scale and scope of the scheme means that further changes can only be made after careful consideration. For this reason, the Government decided in June 2004 that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the report of the interdepartmental review group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1641">The Government is committed to supporting and reinforcing equal participation in society by people with disabilities. The best way of addressing the transport needs of people with disabilities of whatever kind and the effectiveness, suitability or otherwise of the disabled drivers scheme in that regard will continue to be considered and progressed in consultation with the other Departments with responsibility in this area. A car tax concession scheme can obviously only play a partial role in dealing with this serious issue and examination of the scheme is taking place in that context.</p>

            <p eId="para_1643">During the course of 2004 and 2005 the tax relief for stallion stud fees as provided for under section 231 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 was the subject of ongoing discussions between the Irish authorities and the European Commission, with particular regard to the State aid aspects of the relief. In that context, the policy background to the tax scheme was considered extensively. No separate review of the tax scheme was in the event compiled by my Department. However, in the context of the consideration of the scheme, regard was given, <i>inter alia</i>, to the review conducted in July 2004 by economic consultants Indecon for the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders’ Association, the European Breeders’ Fund and Horse Racing Ireland. In my 2006 Budget Statement I announced that the tax relief for stallion stud fees would be terminated with effect from 31 July 2008 and that a new regime appropriate to the industry will be discussed with the European Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1644">With regard to the cost of this exemption, section 35 of the Finance Act 2003 provided that details of exempt income from a number of sources, including from stallion stud fees, would be returned to the Revenue Commissioners. With regard to the tax year 2004, this information was included in personal income tax returns filed in October and November 2005 and, in the case of companies, in corporation tax returns filed up to the end of 2005. While a significant proportion of these returns have now been processed, not all have. Therefore, it is not possible at this stage to give an accurate assessment of the level of exempt income in respect of the stallion relief. However, based on the information received and collated to date, a total of €17,140,959 was included in the relevant returns for 2004 as profits or gains that are exempt under section 231 of the Taxes Consolidation Act in terms of stallion stud fees. This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost of the order of €7 million in 2004, in terms of income tax and corporation tax forgone. However, the actual Exchequer cost in terms of the income declared to date would be lower to the extent that the exempt income is subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs, thereby reducing the level of income actually subject to tax.</p>

The 289 cases, taking account of spouses and connected companies, consist of 300 names and are made up of 179 cases listed on the High Court inspectors' report and 110 similar cases discovered by Revenue or listed on the authorised officer's report. The investigation includes an examination of the tax position of disclosed entities and the accumulation and assemblage of information on other connected entities. The number of connected entities in cases under investigation is now nearly 700.</p>
            <p eId="para_1653">Revenue is making extensive use of its legislative powers to seek books, records, documents and information in the cases being investigated. Where appropriate, prosecutions will be considered but these will depend on the level of evidence available. Revenue has made ten successful applications to the High Court for the production by financial institutions and third parties of books, records and other documentation relevant to liabilities of Ansbacher account holders. Some 200,000 documents have been received under the terms of the High Court orders. Advanced investigative computer software is used in controlling and managing the documentation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1654">To date a total of €55.8 million has been received, consisting of settlements and payments on account, in respect of 107 cases. This is made up as follows:</p>

In addition, Revenue made a further application to the High Court for access to the supporting papers to the High Court inspectors' report. The High Court order in the matter was granted in June 2004 and perfected in January 2005 and allows for access to documents relating to clients of Ansbacher named in the High Court inspectors' report and those persons and companies, including members of the board, found by the High Court inspectors to have failed to co-operate with their inquiry. The order also allows for Revenue to make application and grounding affidavit for the obtaining of information and documents relating to any other individual or company. Access to documents is subject to the direction of the High Court. Revenue has applied, on foot of the order, for access to documentation in respect of certain cases named in the High Court inspectors' report. Some documentation has been supplied and further documentation is awaited. Revenue has informed me that the investigations are time consuming and complex and are likely to continue for some time to come.</p>

        [7910/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_595">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1669">I am satisfied that good progress continues to be made on this ambitious programme. I am particularly pleased with the continuing popularity of the programme among public servants. There are about 10,600 applications on the central applications facility to date and new applications are being received each week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1670">I refer the Deputy to the decentralisation implementation group's July 2005 report which identified progress in relation to property, implementation planning, numbers of applicants and human resources and industrial relations issues. In line with the group's approach to phasing, the report provided indicative construction start and completion dates for the procurement of office accommodation in the new locations. The full contents of this report can be accessed at <i>www.decentralisation.gov.ie</i>. The final construction dates can only be confirmed when the tender process has been completed in respect of each location and are contingent on the level and quality of market interest in respect of sites, successful negotiation of contracts, receipt of acceptable planning permissions, timely completion of briefs, etc. I understand that the OPW is updating the position on the property aspects of the programme in light of experience to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671">Discussions have progressed with the Civil Service general service unions on a number of human resource and industrial relations issues. Actual movement of staff within and between Departments and offices is now under way, with approximately 1,150 staff assigned to posts which will decentralise. Discussions are continuing with the professional and technical staff representative in respect of arrangements for staff in those grades.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">The decentralisation implementation group took the view that it would not seek to dictate every step in the process to the management of the State agencies. Although the group proposed a group of State agencies for early mover status, it did not include specific timeframes in recognition of this approach and also of the fact that it is the responsibility of the board and senior management of each agency to implement Government policy. The group stated in its report that each agency included in the programme should have a successful relocation as a high level strategic objective and should prepare the next and deeper iteration of its implementation plan. In the meantime, the OPW is continuing to seek property solutions in respect of any agency that requires it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">When details of the Government's decentralisation programme were first announced in budget 2004, it was stated that the overall objective would be to ensure that property being acquired at a regional level is matched as closely as possible in time and in cost terms by the disposal of property held in the Dublin region, whether held on lease or otherwise. In November 2004 the implementation group submitted a report on the procurement methodology and financial assessment of the property aspects of the programme, including a financial model, based on a property finance study carried out by the Office of Public Works. While the prevailing property market conditions in each area will have a bearing on cost, this model indicates that the break even position for property will be reached in about 20 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">The latest information available from the OPW suggests that the total amount committed in principle to date by the OPW on site acquisition costs, excluding VAT, is approximately €36.3 million. With regard to other non-property aspects of the programme, a report was prepared by Deloitte and Touche at the request of the implementation group. This report provided a model for identifying non-property costs and savings that might arise both during the relocation phase and in the context of a post-decentralised Civil Service. Decentralising organisations have now been asked to use this model to make periodic reports identifying costs incurred and savings made since the programme was announced and going forward. I do not anticipate, however, that these costs will be significant.</p>

            <p eId="para_1676">The national pensions reserve fund commission is independent of Government in the exercise of its functions. Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, it controls and manages the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement the fund's investment strategy. This investment strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return in the long term, subject to prudent risk management.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">The independence of the commission is a cornerstone of the legislation which ensures that it will invest in a manner that maximises returns. Essentially, it is similar to the trustee arrangements that apply to private pension funds and places an obligation on the commission to act commercially and in the best interests of the fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">With regard to commercial investment in public sector projects in this country, the annual report of the national pensions reserve fund commission for 2004 states that the commission has made an initial allocation of €200 million for investment in public private partnerships in Ireland and will increase this allocation should suitable opportunities arise. The report also states that the commission will make equity and-or debt finance available to the winning bidder in the tender process for public-private partnership projects, provided it is satisfied with the prospective rate of return. I understand that, to date, no moneys have been invested by the commission in any such projects. On a more general note, development of the public-private partnership process is not dependent on investment in PPPs by the national pensions reserve fund commission.</p>

            <p eId="para_1682">Lack of financial knowledge, particularly on initiating the transaction, and the need to provide suitable identification documents in order to open an account are frequently identified as the main obstacles faced by those on lower incomes when attempting to access financial services. Financial institutions are obliged under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 to take reasonable measures to identify their customers, with a view to combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Guidelines approved by the money laundering steering committee under the aegis of my Department set out measures that might reasonably be adopted by financial institutions in this regard. These guidelines emphasise that any measures adopted should not deny a person access to financial services solely on the grounds that they do not possess certain specified identification documentation. For its part, the Financial Regulator has incorporated this as a requirement in its draft consumer protection code.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">Identification of a customer comprises two elements. These are name verification, typically evidenced by a photograph-bearing document such as a passport, driving licence or other reputable source document, and address verification. The guidance notes for credit institutions provide for those circumstances where persons cannot reasonably be expected to produce certain forms of identification such as a passport or driving licence and whose name and Irish address does not appear on a utility bill, electoral register or directory.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684">As far as improving financial knowledge is concerned, the Financial Regulator, within its statutory consumer mandate, has developed a number of specific initiatives to help consumers make informed choices in terms of the financial products they choose, the amount of risk they take on and the cost of the financial products. These initiatives have been developed through the framework of the Financial Regulator's consumer awareness campaign and include publication of a fact sheet entitled, How to Open a Bank or Building Society Account.</p>

            <p eId="para_1686">When the decentralisation programme was announced by my predecessor he appointed a decentralisation implementation group to drive the process forward. The group's terms of reference include the examination of how decentralisation might enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">The implementation group asked that all organisations participating in the programme prepare detailed implementation plans, including risk mitigation plans. These plans were prepared and submitted to the group. In its July 2004 report the group noted that the overall quality of the plans was good. In line with a recommendation in the group's November 2004 report, each of the Departments and organisations scheduled as early movers has prepared a revised implementation plan detailing the steps that need to be taken to complete the moves to the new locations successfully. These have been submitted to the group which has been examining them in detail. All other decentralising organisations are preparing revised implementation plans. I understand the implementation group has recently been meeting the Secretaries General of decentralising Departments to discuss the overall planning frameworks and review progress to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">On a more general note, the Deputy will be interested to note that the Committee for Public Management Research, CPMR, has prepared a discussion paper, CPMR Paper No. 30, entitled, A Review of Knowledge Management in the Irish Civil Service.

            <p eId="para_1691">I do not accept the Deputy's view that there has been a poor response to the programme. On the contrary, the Government is very pleased with the numbers who have applied to the central applications facility, CAF. There have been approximately 10,600 applications so far and new applications are being received each week. The CAF remains open and continues to accept further new applications. In addition, there has been considerable movement of staff within and between Departments and offices in preparation for decentralisation, with about 1,150 officers already assigned to posts that will decentralise. Departments are continuing their detailed preparations on all aspects of the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1729">The repayments of corporation tax refer to individual claims made by companies from year to year. VAT repayments are part and parcel of the way the VAT system works with traders charging VAT on their output but reclaiming the VAT paid on their inputs. The figures do not include repayments to non-resident claimants of Irish tax deducted from income arising in Ireland. Neither do they include relevant contracts tax where the normal operation of the system involves the routine claiming of repayments or offset against normal tax liabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">In the case of PAYE, repayments arise as a general rule in response to claims made by taxpayers containing specific information not previously known to Revenue and the level of repayments shows that very many taxpayers are aware of the tax credits and reliefs to which they are entitled and of the necessity to make the claim. The Revenue Commissioners are conscious of their responsibility as contained in their customer service charter to provide taxpayers with the necessary information and all reasonable assistance to enable them to clearly understand and meet their tax and customs obligations and to claim their entitlements and credits. Revenue has always been very proactive in ensuring that PAYE taxpayers, in particular, are made fully aware of their rights and are facilitated in claiming repayments due. For example, the tax credit certificate sent to each PAYE taxpayer at the start of the tax year is accompanied by a detailed leaflet setting out a wide range of information on the main personal tax credits available for the year in question with comparative figures for the preceding year, tax rates and tax bands for the year in question, exemption limits for single, widowed and married persons and how to claim an adjustment to the tax credit certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1731">Revenue's website also provides easy-to-access customer service information on the full range of reliefs available to taxpayers, together with a range of claim forms in downloadable format. The Revenue home page also contains a What's New section where customers are alerted to timely items of interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">As the Deputy will be aware, Revenue has procedures in place for PAYE taxpayers in order that many reliefs need not be claimed at all as they are given at source, for example, mortgage interest, pension contributions, permanent health insurance, medical insurance. Others need only be claimed once and are automatically carried forward from year to year, for example, basic tax credits, PAYE credit, age credit for the over 65s and trade union subscriptions. The only reliefs that need to be claimed on an ongoing basis are those that are expenditure-related such as medical expenses, certain dental expenses, third level tuition fees and rent relief. While a wide range of information channels has been used to put details regarding taxpayer entitlements into the public domain, I emphasise that the primary responsibility for ensuring Revenue has the most up-to-date information on a taxpayer lies with the taxpayer himself or herself.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">Revenue is planning additional on-line services for PAYE customers later in 2006. This will be accompanied by a campaign to publicise the services and notify taxpayers on the options available to claim their entitlements. With these new interactive, on-line, self-service channels, and the existing comprehensive range of information already available, I am satisfied that taxpayers are being made as fully aware as possible of their entitlements to claim credits and allowances.</p>

            <p eId="para_1735">The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available. Statistics on employment and unemployment are compiled, at a regional level, from the quarterly national household survey. The latest statistics show that there were 27,500 people classified as unemployed in the Dublin region, equating to an unemployment rate of 4.5%, in the September-November quarter of 2005. Sub-regional statistics, of the kind requested by the Deputy, are not available from the quarterly national household survey.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">The live register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number claiming unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit, as well as other claimants registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Figures are published for each county and each local social welfare office. A breakdown by postal district is not available. The most recent information available is for January 2006. It should be noted that the live register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers and seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit. Statistics on unemployment are measured at regional level by the quarterly national household survey. It should also be noted that the exact area covered by each local office is not limited to the immediate locality of the particular office and it is possible that persons in particular Dublin postal areas would register in different local offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">The live register figures for all the local or branch offices in County Dublin for 2000 to date are set out in the table below. Also included is a table from the quarterly national household survey displaying ILO economic status data for the Dublin region from 2000 to date.</p>

The total cost of the project will be approximately €5 million, which is comfortably below the initial estimated cost of €6.45 million, at 2001 prices, identified in the feasibility study which was undertaken in advance of the formal decision to commence the project. The peer review process was initiated by the Department of Finance on 20 October 2005. A peer review was not considered necessary for the e-Cabinet project as it was in operation, on schedule and within budget at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_3994">The question of funding for Parents for Justice is a matter for the Health Service Executive. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3995">My Department received a freedom of information request on 10 February 2006 for access to the documents to which the Deputy refers. It will be processed in line with provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts, 1997 and 2003. The documents in question are in the secure custody of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3996">The telephone information and helpline has been in operation since the publication of the Madden report on 18 January and to date has received 72 calls regarding organ retention. Of these, 33 have been referred on to the appropriate hospital for attention. Some callers to the line have complained because they are still dissatisfied with the response from hospitals to their queries. The helpline number is also used as an information line for other HSE services and is, therefore, still in operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3997">Because legal proceedings have been initiated on behalf of Parents for Justice, the subject matter of which is the Madden report, the legal advice was that it was not appropriate for me to attend the meeting which was due to discuss the report at the core of those proceedings. Dr. Madden's report stated that communication and authorisation are vital, and must be enshrined in legislation. My officials, in consultation with key agencies, are examining the gaps and have commenced work on drafting legislation to address these gaps as a priority in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3998">EU Directive 2004/23/EC on standards of quality and safety of tissues and cells for human application must be transposed into Irish law by 7 April 2006. The regulations that will transpose the directive will deal with the donation of tissues and cells to another living person, but not with procurement or donation for research or clinical investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3999">The heads of a Bill for a new coroners Act have been prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is examining the implications, if any, that Dr.  Madden's recommendations will have for this legislation.</p>

        the options a person (details supplied) in Dublin 20, has to access a period of adaptation in midwifery followed by a period of adaptation in general nursing.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_4021">In response to the Deputy's question the only options available to a person wishing to access a period of adaptation in midwifery followed by a period of adaptation in general nursing are those which must be in compliance with the requirements of An Bord Altranais. An Bord Altranais is the regulatory body for the nursing and midwifery profession in Ireland. In order to work as a registered nurse or midwife in Ireland an individual will need to apply to An Bord Altranais for entry to the register of nurses and midwives maintained by the board. Registration with the board is also needed in order to qualify for a working visa or work authorisation or work permit. In certain cases the board may require a nurse or midwife to undertake a period of adaptation in an approved placement site prior to granting that nurse or midwife full registration with the board. It must be emphasised that unless the nurse or midwife meets this requirement they will not obtain full registration with the board and will not be eligible to work as a nurse or midwife in the health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4022">The Nurses Act 1985 together with the European Union directives ensures a fair and transparent processing of applications from candidates holding EU nursing and midwifery qualifications. The assessment of applications for candidates holding non-EU qualifications requires a comprehensive evaluation to ensure the suitability of the applicant to have his or her name registered in a division of the register maintained by An Bord Altranais. An Bord Altranais maintains seven separate divisions of the register as follows: registered general nurse, RGN, registered midwife, RM, registered nurse intellectual disability, RNID, registered nurse tutor, RNT, registered psychiatric nurse, RPN, registered public health nurse, RPHN, and registered children's nurse, RCN.</p>
            <p eId="para_4023">Applicants wishing to have their names entered on two or more divisions of the register are required to have met the education and training requirements and to have completed a post-registration course that meets the requirements for nurse registration education programmes post-registration as set out in An Bord Altranais's "Requirements and Standards for Nurse Registration Education Programmes". The post-basic programme must have a balance of theoretical and clinical instruction commensurate with the requirements of An Bord Altranais.</p>
            <p eId="para_4024">If a second registration is dependent on a primary registration, the applicant must apply for primary registration at the same time as applying for the secondary registration. An applicant may wish to apply to register on a division of the register such as the registered general nurse division, but may have received education and training leading to registration in that speciality secondary to a primary qualification such as a registered midwife qualification. In this case the applicant is required to apply for registration in the division in which the primary registration was obtained, in this case the registered midwife division, as well as the division in which he or she obtained secondary registration such as the registered general nurse division.</p>
            <p eId="para_4025">When An Bord Altranais has received and duly verified all required documents, an officer in the education department of the board undertakes an evaluation of the application for registration. Each application is evaluated on an individual basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4026">Following evaluation of an application for registration an applicant may be required to undertake a period of adaptation. A period of adaptation is a period of supervised practice possibly being accompanied by further education and training. An applicant undergoing a period of adaptation will have his or her name entered on a candidate register maintained by An Bord Altranais. A nurse undergoing a period of adaptation is referred to as a candidate nurse or midwife.</p>
            <p eId="para_4027">A candidate nurse or midwife who has an offer of employment with the Health Service Executive, a voluntary hospital, a private hospital or a private nursing home and is required by An Bord Altranais to undertake a period of adaptation will have his or her placement arranged by the relevant agencies. However, a candidate who is required by the board to undertake a period of adaptation and assessment and who has not been offered a contract of employment in the public, voluntary or private health sector in Ireland, will need to arrange his or her own placement by contacting the directors of nursing or midwifery directly in adaptation placement sites approved by An Bord Altranais. It is important to note that it may be difficult to obtain a placement without an offer of employment as health service providers are obliged in the first instance to provide periods of adaptation to those nurses and midwives they have made offers of employment to and also to other health employers, for example, a private nursing home, in their catchment areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_4033">The annual organ donor awareness campaign, which is organised by the Irish Donor Network and administered by the Irish Kidney Association, highlights the necessity for organ donation generally. The campaign, which is supported by my Department, highlights the need for organ donors by promoting the carrying of an organ donor card. My Department has been providing financial support to the donor awareness campaign for a number of years. The grant in 2005 amounted to €500,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_4034">Two systems can be used to ascertain an individual's wishes on organ donation, namely, the opt-in and opt-out systems. The former system, which operates in this country, requires that the specific consent to donation of each person or their relatives be obtained before organs or tissues are removed. The opt-out system presumes that all citizens consent to donation unless they have specifically expressed a wish to the contrary.</p>
            <p eId="para_4035">The practice here is that even when a person has indicated his or her willingness to donate organs by way of carrying an organ donor card or a driving licence marked accordingly, the consent of the next of kin is always sought. Even where opt-out systems are in operation, the relatives of the deceased are approached as part of the donor screening process to seek a medical history of any high risk behaviour. Thus, relatives will always be aware that a donation is being considered and can register an objection to the donation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4036">The European Commission is considering the question of a directive in respect of organ transplantation, including the issue of consent, and proposes to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the position. It will present a report on its analysis to the Council of the European Union and it is expected that this report will inform decisions regarding the development of a legislative framework in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_4037">In the context of increasing the number of donor organs available for transplant, the Health Service Executive was asked by the Department to undertake a review and analysis of the factors that impact on organ procurement and retrieval rates in hospitals around the country.

            <p eId="para_4045">Thalidomide preparations were marketed in Ireland from May 1959 to January 1962 when they were withdrawn from sale by the manufacturers. In May 1970, following confirmation by the Department of External Affairs that an offer of compensation by the German manufacturers of thalidomide applied to Irish born children with conditions attributed to thalidomide, the Department of Health issued advertisements inviting parents and others involved in the care of such children to furnish particulars which were forwarded to representatives of the manufacturers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4046">In May 1973, the Government decided in principle that it should provide financial assistance in addition to that paid by the German foundation. The then Minister for Health established the Irish Thalidomide Medical Board to identify the number of Irish children affected and report on each individual case. The board concluded that 34 Irish children were affected by the drug — one of whom was the beneficiary of the British compensation scheme as the mother was prescribed the drug while living in the UK. In December 1974 the Government granted each of the remaining 33 children further financial assistance by way of a lump sum and a monthly allowance for life. To date, my Department has not been made aware of the existence of any case as described by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_4054">The motorised transport grant was introduced in 1968 by way of circular 7/68. It is a grant which may be made payable by the Health Service Executive towards the purchase of a car and/or adaptations to a car being purchased by a person with a severe disability who is 17 years or older and up to 65 years of age, where such a car is essential for him or her to obtain or retain employment. Self-employed persons who satisfy the criteria for eligibility may also be considered, subject to the above age limits. The grant may also be considered in exceptional circumstances for a person with a severe disability, subject to the above age limits, who lives in a very remote location and whose disability impedes him or her from using public transport. My Department is currently examining the issues that the Deputy is referring to in the context of my Department's strategic review of services for people with disabilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_4060">The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 are administered by the Health Service Executive. Three rates of subvention are currently payable —€114.30, €152.40 and €190.50 — for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum. There are no plans to increase the subvention rates. The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_4061">The cost of care in a private nursing home is a private matter between the nursing home operators and the patient involved. The nursing home subvention scheme was introduced in 1993 to give some financial assistance towards the cost of private nursing home care. It was never intended that the scheme would subsidise the full costs of private nursing home care.</p>

In this regard I highlighted the need to identify the necessary structures and processes that are required to control the emergence and spread of health care associated infections, including MRSA. In a subsequent letter to Professor Drumm, chief executive of the HSE, I raised the issue about the communication of information to patients infected with MRSA. Hospital staff need to clearly discharge their existing legal and ethical responsibilities in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_4292">For the purposes of the surveillance, prevention and control of MRSA the health protection surveillance centre, HPSC, collects data on MRSA bacteria, also known as bloodstream infection or blood poisoning, as part of the European antimicrobial resistance surveillance system, or EARSS. EARSS collects data on the first episode of blood stream infection per patient per quarter. EARSS was designed to allow comparison of antimicrobial resistance data between countries and possibly regions but not between hospitals. The EARSS data, which is published on a quarterly basis by the HPSC, showed that there were 553 cases of MRSA reported in 2004. The figure for the first nine months of 2005 is 454. According to the HPSC the rate of MRSA observed in Ireland is high and compares with the United Kingdom, France and southern European countries.

            <p eId="para_5628">The report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, was launched on 24 January 2006. The report proposes a holistic view of mental illness and recommends an integrated multidisciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems. It proposes a person-centred treatment approach that addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan reflecting best practice and evolved and agreed with service users and their carers. Special emphasis is given to the need to involve service users and their families and carers at every level of service provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_5629">This policy envisions an active, flexible and community based mental health service where the need for hospital admission will be greatly reduced. It will require substantial funding but there is considerable equity in buildings and lands within the current mental health system that could be realised to fund this plan. Therefore, this report recommends that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and to reinvest the resources released by these closures in the mental health service. The closure of large mental hospitals and the move to modern units attached to general hospitals, together with the expansion of community services, has been Government policy since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984.</p>
            <p eId="para_5630">The Health Service Executive, which has primary responsibility for implementing the recommendations of the expert report, has stated the national mental health directorate within the HSE will immediately establish an implementation group to ensure the recommendations are realised in a timely and co-ordinated manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_5635">This Government is committed to developing the various community and home support schemes that are vital to maintain older people in their own homes for as long as possible. As the Deputy will be aware, an investment package of an additional €150 million has been put in place for services for older people and palliative care for 2006 and 2007. Reflecting the new emphasis on home and day care, almost three quarters, or €109 million, of the full year costs are being committed to community care supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_5636">Home care packages deliver a wide range of services and have been piloted successfully in several regions in recent years. They include various disciplines and will vary according to the care needs of the person so that, for example, there might be a greater emphasis in some packages on home care assistants while other packages may require a greater level of therapy and nursing. Approximately 1,100 home care packages are provided to people at present. Of the budget investment package an additional €55 million has been allocated to this initiative, €30 million of which relates to 2006, so that by the end of 2006 a total of 2,000 additional home care packages will have been provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_5637">As the Deputy will be aware, home helps are also an essential part of supporting older people at home and thereby delaying or preventing admission to long-stay residential care. They also help the early discharge of older people from hospitals and can form part of home care packages. There is a continuing demand for home helps due to the increased number of older people. An additional €33 million full year cost is now being allocated for this programme, €30 million in 2006 and €3 million in 2007. The additional funding of €30 million will provide 1.75 million additional home help hours. I wish to advise the Deputy that additional funding of €20 million was provided for the administration of the nursing home subvention scheme in 2006, bringing the total available budget to €160 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_5638">In relation to the standard and quality of services and facilities in nursing homes, the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993, made under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, set out the standards to which private nursing homes must adhere. The Health Service Executive currently carries out inspections in private nursing homes. In the context of the Health Bill 2006, the process has begun to review the current system with a view to strengthening the powers available to those involved in inspecting facilities and to extend a strengthened inspection system to public facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5639">It is also intended that the Bill will provide for the setting and monitoring of standards for residential facilities for older people. In addition, the Department has commenced a review of the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993 and is working in conjunction with the HSE, the SSI and the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board with the intention of developing standards that will apply to all residential services for older people. The National Economic and Social Forum report on care for older people was launched on 29 January 2006. I and officials in my Department will study this report and discuss it with the HSE in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_5640">As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, established a working group to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, including improvements in community care and home care packages. The report of the working group on the future financing of long-term care has been presented to Government and is currently being considered by Cabinet.</p>

            <p eId="para_5643">The FSAI has confirmed that the Health Service Executive, HSE, brought the audit findings to the attention of relevant food business proprietors either verbally or in writing and follow-up inspections have taken place to monitor progress with a view to ensuring compliance. In addition, labelling and traceability inspections were later incorporated into routine programmed and surveillance inspections of premises as part of the HSE food monitoring programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5644">With regard to the responses received by the FSAI from the other official agencies, the following is the position. The Department of Agriculture and Food has advised that the issues identified in relation to the plants within its remit have been rectified. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has confirmed that all non-compliance issues have been addressed through a combination of follow-up audits, inspections and voluntary closure of premises. The local authorities conducted subsequent audits on the premises in question to ensure that the issues raised had been addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5645">The Deputy may also wish to note that since the audit, traceability and labelling matters have, where appropriate, been included in improvements notices, prohibition or closure orders issued under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act 1998 and served on the proprietors of food businesses by the official agencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_5656">The Civil Service code of standards and behaviour was drawn up and promulgated in September 2004 pursuant to section 10(11) of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001. It applies only to civil servants and forms part of their terms of employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5657">Before the promulgation of this code the Civil Service was governed by a set of principles and standards known as the personnel code. The personnel code consists of a corpus of Civil Service circulars that together set out the standards governing the conduct and behaviour of all civil servants. While not superseding the personnel code, the Civil Service code of standards and behaviour sets out in a single, consolidated document the main principles that must govern the behaviour of civil servants. The code restates and promotes the core public service values and provides a clear framework within which civil servants must work.</p>
            <p eId="para_5658">The Civil Service code of standards and behaviour does not apply in the commercial semi-State sector. However, the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, which was endorsed by Government in October 2001, requires that all State bodies, including the subsidiaries of such bodies, should have written codes of business conduct for directors and employees.</p>

            <p eId="para_5662">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners the number of income earners expected to be on the income tax records in 2006 with gross incomes in excess of €200,000 is projected at 17,800.</p>
            <p eId="para_5663">It is assumed the Deputy wishes to ascertain the amount of income tax directly attributable to the top rate of income tax, which is currently set at 42%. As the application of the tax rates in a tax computation occurs before tax credits are applied, the credits are not apportioned between the tax charged at the different tax rates and it is not possible to quantify the tax charged at the different rates on a post-tax credit basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5664">However, I would refer the Deputy to page B.23 of the budget 2006 booklet, which contains a table detailing where all tax reliefs go. He will see that, of the €10.8 billion in relief for the tax year 2002, €5.6 billion or 52% went on personal tax credits and reliefs, €3.4 billion or 31% to help fund pensions and savings and over €1 billion or 10% on capital allowances for traders, including farmers, to ensure their viability and job creation capacity. The vast bulk of tax relief each year thus goes to ordinary taxpayers at all income levels and to sustain business investment and jobs. In addition, the 17,800 income earners earning over €200,000 in 2006 represent approximately 0.9% of all income earners. It is estimated that the top 0.9% of income earners will account for approximately 20% of total income tax receipts in 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_5685">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners they became aware in 2005 that VAT was being inconsistently applied in the private waste management sector. Indeed, compliant members of the trade wanted the Revenue Commissioners to ensure consistency of treatment across the industry. There was a lack of clarity on the part of some private operators about the application of VAT to the landfill levy. The legal position in relation to the VAT treatment is clear. In the case of privately operated landfill facilities, VAT is chargeable at 13.5% on the total consideration that the operator is entitled to receive, inclusive of the levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5686">In June 2005, the Revenue Commissioners issued instructions to their staff confirming the legal position on the application of VAT in the private waste management sector and the necessity for consistency of treatment across the sector. The Commissioners subsequently published an article in their <i>Tax Briefing</i> publication, which explained the correct VAT treatment. Revenue officials also recently met with representatives from the Irish Waste Management Association to confirm the correct VAT treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5687">In so far as the application of VAT to local authorities engaged in the collection and disposal of waste is concerned, the legal position is that such authorities are exempt from VAT. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide nor can they claim VAT back on any of the inputs that go towards providing a service. Essentially, only VAT registered businesses that charge VAT can recover VAT. It is not possible for me to change the VAT treatment of waste disposal as this is dictated by EU law.</p>

            <p eId="para_5689">The Office of Public Works is responsible for both property procurement and disposal. The overall objective is to ensure property being acquired at a regional level is matched as closely as possible both in time and in cost terms by the disposal of property currently held in the Dublin region, whether held on lease or otherwise.</p>
            <p eId="para_5690">No decisions have been made yet on the disposal, retention or reallocation of office buildings in Dublin post decentralisation. The Office of Public Works will bear in mind the particular requirements of Departments remaining in Dublin and the need to ensure that all office space remaining in Dublin is utilised in the most cost effective manner possible. Civil and public servants who do not wish to transfer to a decentralised location will be assigned to an alternative public service post in Dublin. Each individual will be able to indicate via his or her personnel section the organisations remaining in Dublin which would interest them.</p>
            <p eId="para_5691">As information becomes available from the central applications facility, CAF, it will be possible to identify vacancies that will arise in organisations remaining in Dublin as a result of individuals in those organisations applying to transfer to decentralised posts. Consultations will be held with the public service unions on an ongoing basis to address the concerns of all staff affected by the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_5695">There have been two PEACE programmes, PEACE I from 1994-99 and PEACE II from 2000-06. The value of the PEACE I programme to the Border region was €100 million. Of this, 3% or €3 million, was spent on technical assistance — monitoring and evaluation — of the programme. A total of 75% of funds allocated to technical assistance came from the EU while the remaining 25% was funded from the Exchequer. None of this was spent in the past three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_5696">The value of the PEACE II programme is €868 million. Of this, 9.5% or €83 million is provided as technical assistance to monitor and evaluate projects since 2000. This is an EU requirement and is necessary to ensure that projects are of a high standard and provide value for money. To ensure equity and transparency in both the PEACE and INTERREG Ireland-Northern Ireland programmes, projects valued over €367,000 must be assessed by independent economic consultants. Between 2003 and 2006 approximately €40 million or 4% of the total value of the programme has been spent on monitoring and evaluation North and South.</p>
            <p eId="para_5697">The INTERREG IIIA Ireland-Northern Ireland programme aims to address the economic and social disadvantage that can result from the existence of a border. The total value of the programme is €182 million in the 2000-06 period. A sum of €11 million or 6% of this is provided in technical assistance in the 2000-06 period. The EU requires that this proportion of funds is used to assess and monitor the standard of projects. Approximately €4.2 million has been spent in the past three years, which is 2.3% of the total programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5698">Ireland also participates in four other INTERREG III programmes. The INTERREG IIIA Ireland-Wales cross-Border programme is worth €70 million. The share of total payments for the programme that was spent on technical assistance during this period was 1.6%. The INTERREG IIIB north-west Europe transnational programme includes Ireland, the UK, Belgium, Luxembourg, northern France, parts of Germany and the Netherlands and some Swiss cantons. The programme is worth €656 million in total. Details relating to payments to Irish projects are currently being compiled and will be passed on to the Deputy as soon as this work has been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5699">The INTERREG IIIB Atlantic area transnational programme comprises Ireland, Portugal, the western half of the UK and France and large areas of Spain. The programme is worth €204 million. The share of total payments for the programme that was spent on technical assistance during this period was 4.8%. The INTERREG IIIC inter-regional programme covers the whole EU territory over four geographic zones, namely, north, south, east and west. The share of total payments for the programme that was spent on technical assistance during this period was 18%.</p>

            <p eId="para_5749">Firms that offer spread-betting services, whether in respect of sports events or financial services, are required to possess a bookmaker's licence, which is issued by the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_5750">To obtain a bookmaker's licence a person must publish a notice in the press of his or her intention to carry on the business of bookmaking at a particular premises and apply to the local superintendent of the Garda Síochána for a certificate of personal fitness. The application must be signed by two Peace Commissioners. The superintendent either issues a certificate or refuses the application, in which latter case the applicant can appeal to the District Court. Having obtained a certificate of personal fitness, the person then applies to the Revenue Commissioners for a licence. From then on the primary focus of Revenue Commissioners' enforcement action in relation to bookmaking is to counteract evasion of betting duty.</p>
            <p eId="para_5751">As regards spread betting on financial markets, the markets in financial instruments directive, Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and the Council, is due to be transposed into the national laws of each member state by 31 January 2007. Essentially, the directive relates to how financial instruments are traded and sets out what constitutes a financial instrument. Among the items listed as financial instruments are financial contracts for differences, which relate to spread-betting on financial markets only, for example, stock or indices movements, but does not include spread betting on sporting events. Trading in financial contracts for differences will be a regulated activity once the new directive takes effect and the Financial Regulator will be the competent authority.</p>

The SSIA holder's gross income before all deductions in the year preceding the year of maturity of the SSIA cannot exceed €50,000 and none of that income can be chargeable to tax at the higher rate of 42%. A social welfare recipient, therefore, may qualify assuming that his or her social welfare income is his or her main income source.</p>

This information is gradually coming on stream and will over time provide better data in this area and enable fuller estimates of tax foregone.</p>
            <p eId="para_5815">In my recent Budget Statement I explained the consultancy reviews of the various tax incentive schemes included a recommendation that any new reliefs should be time limited and should, where relevant, be subject to an assessment of costs and benefits prior to their introduction. They also proposed that recipients of these kinds of tax reliefs be required to supply full data to Revenue to assist in the costing and assessment of reliefs.

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_692">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_5845">I propose to take Questions Nos. 239 and 240 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5846">The Credit Union Act 1997 provides the legal framework for the regulation of credit unions. The Act was designed to provide the credit union movement with a regulatory structure that reflected and promoted the particular ethos and philosophy of the credit union movement, its strong tradition of volunteer service and the core objective of providing opportunities for saving and lending for members of credit unions. In the context of that legislative framework, the Registrar of Credit Unions, in the Financial Regulator's office, is responsible for the operation of the regulatory and supervisory regime for credit unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5847">The Credit Union Act has provided the legal and regulatory framework within which the credit union movement in Ireland has continued to grow and develop over recent years. The assets of credit unions, largely comprising members' savings, have increased to €11.5 billion. That highlights the continued success of credit unions in meeting the financial needs of local communities and occupational groups falling within the common bond.</p>
            <p eId="para_5848">The rules-based approach to the regulation embodied in the Credit Union Act has served the credit union movement well by providing clarity and certainty to individual credit unions, their directors and members. It has helped support the continued stability of the credit union movement and safeguard members' savings during a period of rapid growth. The Act does provide a significant amount of discretion to the Registrar of Credit Unions regarding specific regulatory requirements, acting either on his own initiative or in the context of regulations made under the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_5849">As Minister of Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions in light of the current state of development, capacity and capabilities of credit unions as a whole. A range of issues now arising in that context, including savings protection, investment rules and proposed legislative and regulatory changes, is currently under examination by my Department with the assistance of the Registrar of Credit Unions and the subject of consultations with the representative bodies for credit unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5850">I can assure the Deputy that these issues will be assessed on their own merits with a view to establishing an appropriate balance in the regulation of credit unions between the need to facilitate credit unions in adapting to the changes taking place in Irish society and ensuring the stability and financial sustainability of credit unions and the safeguarding of the very significant savings entrusted to them by their members.</p>
            <p eId="para_5851">My decisions in these matters will be based on the advice and information provided by the Registrar of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC — the statutory advisory body on credit union matters — and, of course, the credit union movement itself.</p>

The relief from excise duty on fuel is granted once the individual has been authorised under the scheme. In this regard claims for repayment should be made every four months; claim form DD3 is automatically forwarded by the central repayments office in Monaghan to the authorised individual; receipts for fuel purchased must be submitted; and the percentage of fuel used in the transport of the person with the disability should be estimated.</p>

A vehicle, which has been subject to this relief, may not be disposed of for at least two years. Vehicles approved under the scheme are also exempt from road tax.

            <p eId="para_5891">The climate change strategy says that from 2002 onwards, taxes will begin to take into account the amounts of greenhouse gases produced in any activity. It is indeed Government policy to take greenhouse gas emission into account when formulating or developing tax policy in any particular area.</p>
            <p eId="para_5892">In September 2004, the Government decided not to introduce a specific carbon tax, following a thorough examination of the issues involved, including how a carbon tax would be implemented and the associated environmental, economic and social impacts. In addition, my Department carried out an extensive consultation process in which 117 written submissions were received. Following this examination, the Government decided that a carbon tax was not an appropriate policy option and that, instead, it would intensify action on the other measures under the national climate change strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5893">The Government concluded that the environmental benefits of a carbon tax would not justify the difficulties that would arise, particularly for households, from the introduction of such a tax. In this respect, the carbon energy tax would have imposed price increases on many products already suffering sharp increases, particularly as a result of increases in international oil prices. While a carbon tax would have involved a range of compensatory measures, these would not fully address the adverse economic and social effects arising. Moreover a carbon tax would apply to products which are in the main already subject to excise duties and where a new tax is not specifically necessary to increase tax rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_5894">The carbon energy tax was just one possible element of the Government's approach to meeting Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to which the Government remains fully committed. Taxation can play a part in attaining environment objectives. However, as Minister for Finance, I am concerned to ensure that in developing policy on tax measures we take into account any effects on Ireland's international competitiveness, particularly in relation to non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have low taxes on energy. I am also concerned in framing policy about the effect that the imposition of such taxes may have on the consumer price index and how they could impact on the less well off members of our community.</p>
            <p eId="para_5895">Apart from the carbon tax, the national climate change strategy does envisage other initiatives in the tax area with one such example being tax reliefs for "green initiatives". Essentially this approach uses the tax system to provide incentives for certain behaviour. Such incentives include capital allowances for corporate investment in renewable energy projects which have been available since 1998, and the significant biofuels excise relief scheme which I announced in the budget and for which provision has been made in the Finance Bill 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_5910">Irish legislation on money laundering is set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1994, as amended. Primary responsibility for legislation in this area rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This legislation and relevant regulations made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform implemented the EU money laundering directives of 1991 and 2001 in Ireland. The procedures for the prevention of money laundering in the financial system primarily involve the requirement on financial institutions — and other designated bodies — to identify their customers, to have adequate anti-money laundering procedures in place, including staff training, to keep records and to report suspicions of a money laundering offence to the Garda Síochána and to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_5911">The Financial Regulator requires all institutions which it supervises to comply with the anti-money laundering legislation and relevant sectoral guidance notes, and to have in place the necessary procedures and controls to ensure such compliance. The adequacy of such systems is reviewed by the Financial Regulator in the course of its ongoing supervision of institutions and requirements for improvement are advised to institutions as necessary. Furthermore, in accordance with its legal obligation under section 57(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the Financial Regulator is obliged to make reports to the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners where in the course of its supervision it suspects that an institution has breached the relevant money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.</p>
            <p eId="para_5912">The Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners regularly receive reports from financial institutions and other designated bodies where they suspect that a money laundering offence is being or has been committed. All such reports are investigated and progressed as appropriate by the relevant authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5913">The Deputy will also be aware that a third Money Laundering Directive has recently been adopted within the EU. This directive and other international anti-money laundering instruments are being examined to assess what legislative measures are required to give effect to them in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_5914">Ireland's systems to combat money laundering and terrorist funding were reviewed by an evaluation team from the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, FATF, the international standard setting body in this area, last June and July. The outcome of this evaluation will also be taken into account in the transposition into Irish law of the third directive.</p>

            <p eId="para_5922">To date, more than 1,150 civil servants have been assigned to decentralising posts. This represents 16% of the overall number of approximately 7,200 Civil Service posts earmarked for decentralisation. Many of them are located in Dublin for a transition period to enable effective transfer of skills and knowledge and to ensure quality customer service continues to be delivered as decentralisation is rolled out. A small number of advance moves have taken place to decentralised locations, including Sligo, Portlaoise, Athlone, Thurles, Tipperary town and na Forbacha in Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_5923">The target timescales set for the programme when it was first announced were very ambitious. That approach has been very helpful as a catalyst for progress and has been instrumental in delivering the progress evident to date. I refer the Deputy to the decentralisation implementation group's July 2005 report, which identified progress relating to property, implementation planning, numbers of applicants and human resources and industrial relations issues. In line with the group's approach to phasing, the report provided indicative construction start and completion dates for the procurement of office accommodation in the new locations. The full contents of this report can be accessed at <i>www.decentralisation.gov.ie</i>. The final construction dates can only be confirmed when the tender process has been completed in respect of each location and they are contingent on the level and quality of market interest in respect of sites, successful negotiation of contracts, receipt of acceptable planning permissions, timely completion of briefs and successful acquisition of suitable sites. The OPW is updating the position on the property aspects of the programme in light of experience to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_5924">When details of the Government's decentralisation programme were first announced in budget 2004, it was stated the overall objective would be to ensure property acquired at regional level would be matched as closely as possible, both in time and in cost terms, by the disposal of property held in the Dublin region, whether on lease or otherwise. In November 2004, the implementation group submitted a report on the procurement methodology and financial assessment of the property aspects of the programme, including a financial model, based on a property finance study carried out by the OPW. While the prevailing property market conditions in each area will have a bearing on cost, this model indicates that the break even position on property will be reached in approximately 20 years. The latest information available from the OPW suggests that the total amount committed in principle to date by the OPW on site acquisition costs, excluding VAT, is approximately €36.3 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_5925">With regard to other non-property aspects of the programme, a report was prepared by Deloitte &amp; Touche at the request of the implementation group. This report provided a model for identifying non-property costs and savings that might arise both during the relocation phase and in the context of a post-decentralised civil service. Decentralising organisations have been asked to use this model to make periodic reports identifying costs incurred and savings made since the programme was announced and going forward. I do not anticipate, however, at this stage that these costs will be significant.</p>

            <p eId="para_5927">A special interdepartmental review group reviewed the operation of the disabled drivers scheme. The terms of reference of the group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme. The group's report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme. It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries. The report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the possible future development of the scheme. The short-term recommendations in respect of the appeals process have been implemented. In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration. For this reason, the Government decided in June 2004 that the Minister for Finance should consider the recommendations contained in the report in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5928">The best way of addressing the transport needs of people with disabilities of whatever kind, and the effectiveness, suitability or otherwise of the disabled drivers scheme in that regard will be considered and progressed in consultation with the other Departments that have responsibility in this area. A car tax concession scheme can only play a partial role in dealing with this serious issue and examination of the scheme is taking place in that context. Changes to this scheme will be considered in the context of the overall development of policy in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_5934">I am aware of the concerns of the person referred to by the Deputy and have received representations from others regarding the inclusion of the donations scheme in the list of specified reliefs to be covered by the new restriction on the use of tax reliefs, which is due to come into effect on 1 January 2007. The issue was also raised during Committee Stage of the Finance Bill last week and there were differing views within the committee on the question. The most recent Revenue Commissioners report on the effective tax rates for those on high incomes for the tax year 2001 revealed that the donations scheme is one of the schemes being availed of by such taxpayers to reduce their effective tax rates to very low levels. Omitting the scheme from the specified reliefs list, as has been suggested, would reduce the effectiveness of the restriction, the aim of which is to increase the effective tax rate of those on high incomes towards 20%. Given the concerns that have been raised, I have undertaken to consider the matter further between now and Report Stage of the Finance Bill. Given the proportion, even of high earners, who will be affected by the relief restriction is relatively small, the effectiveness of the tax relief incentive for charitable donations will be unaffected in most cases.</p>

The applicable procedure is that at the end of each allocation period, quota uptake is assessed for that period and further allocations are then made in respect of the updated quota availability in accordance with the established ratios. The aggregate allocations made in 2005 to the various participant vessels in the north-west herring fishery are outlined in the following table.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</from>
            <p eId="para_6057">Under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, the functions of sea-fishing boat licensing and registration were transferred from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the licensing authority for sea-fishing boats which operates on an independent basis subject to criteria set out in that Act. All applications for sea-fishing boat licences are considered by the licensing authority for sea-fishing boats. The head of the licensing authority is the registrar general of fishing boats, a senior official in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6058">The licensing authority has informed me that the individual concerned applied for a sea-fishing boat licence for the vessel on 19 December 2005. A letter of licence offer, subject to a number of conditions, was issued to him on 11 January 2006. One of the conditions concerning replacement capacity remains to be complied with. The individual concerned must provide the required replacement capacity in terms of gross tonnage and engine power. I understand that the individual concerned is in the process of purchasing the required replacement capacity from a vessel that is currently on the fishing boat register. This vessel must first be deregistered before its capacity can be assigned to another vessel. I understand that the relevant paperwork to deregister the vessel and reassign the capacity has been submitted to the licensing authority and is currently being processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6059">When the required replacement capacity has been assigned to the applicant's vessel, the licensing authority will issue a non-operative licence. The non-operative licence will allow the vessel owner to have the boat registered, following which the licensing authority can issue an operative sea-fishing boat licence.</p>

            <p eId="para_6090">The establishment by King Mohammed VI in January 2004 of the Commission of Justice and Reconciliation was a courageous initiative, unprecedented in the region, to investigate human rights abuses in the period from 1956 to 1999. The commission successfully initiated a vigorous public debate in Morocco on the difficult legacy of that era. It presented a very substantial report to the King in December 2005, detailing extensive human rights abuses and making specific recommendations to the Government on compensation for victims and their families, and on further legal steps to strengthen the rule of law.</p>
            <p eId="para_6091">The determination with which the Commission of Justice and Reconciliation undertook its difficult task has been impressive. I am particularly encouraged by the positive reaction of the King and of the Government of Morocco to its report and recommendations. The process of reconciliation following decades of human rights abuses is a difficult and a painful one for any country. The Government and our partners in the EU will support the Moroccan authorities as they work to follow up and implement the recommendations of the commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_6092">More broadly, the Government and our EU partners are strongly committed to the strengthening of relations with Morocco, which plays an important and constructive role in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. Under the European neighbourhood policy, the relationship between the EU and Morocco is firmly based on respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms. Considerable progress has been made in the political reform process in recent years. I warmly welcome the important steps which have been taken by the Government of Morocco to put in place the legislative structure for the protection and the promotion of human rights, including the adoption of an updated law against the use of torture, in compliance with UN definitions. The EU has welcomed the review undertaken by the Government of reservations to several human rights conventions, and has encouraged it to pursue this work as a matter of priority. The EU has also welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty, and the important national debate launched by the Moroccan authorities on its abolition.</p>

            <p eId="para_6096">There is a range of non-immigrant visa categories under which eligible foreign nationals can apply for permission to work in the United States. In 2004, for example, over 18,000 Irish citizens obtained temporary working visas. Many of these were sponsored by their employers. Young people availing of the J1 visa programme are also included in this number. In addition to these general visa categories, there are a very limited number of bilateral visa arrangements between the US and other countries. These tend to be restrictive in their scope and applicability.</p>
            <p eId="para_6097">The US has bilateral visa arrangements with Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico and Singapore which were negotiated as part of trade agreements with those countries. Undocumented citizens of these countries are not eligible to participate in these programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6098">The US also has a bilateral visa arrangement with Ireland, that is, the Walsh visa programme. This programme, also known as the Irish peace process visa, permits young people from the North and Border counties to work in the US for two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_6099">US immigration law contains a provision that authorises the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant what is known as temporary protected status, TPS, to foreign nationals in the US, including undocumented persons, who are nationals of countries that are suffering the effects of ongoing armed conflict, environmental disaster, or other extraordinary and temporary conditions. There is also a specific arrangement in place regarding Cuban nationals.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_6106">The Pan-African Parliament, PAP, was established under Article 5 of the Constitutive Act of the African Union as one of the key organs of the union. It was inaugurated in Addis Ababa on 18 March 2004. It will initially function as a consultative and advisory body with the eventual aim of exercising full legislative powers. Promotion of good governance and the principles of human rights and democracy in member states are specified functions of the PAP. Furthermore, the PAP is charged with the publicity function of familiarising the peoples of Africa with the policies and objectives of the African Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_6107">The PAP is composed of 230 members from 46 of the 53 member states of the African Union. It is stipulated that at least one woman should be included in each delegation and that appointments should reflect national diversity. The President of the Parliament, Mrs. Gertrude Mongela MP of Tanzania, is assisted by four Vice-Presidents who represent south, north, central and west Africa. In July 2004, it was agreed that South Africa would host the PAP on a permanent basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_6108">In November 2005, the PAP agreed a strategic plan for 2006-10. This project was supported by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, UNDESA, and a member of the European Parliament participated in the drafting. The purpose of this document is to provide a framework for the PAP's work in the coming period. Strengthening the funding of PAP is identified in this document as a key institutional objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_6109">The PAP has established working relationships with organisations of parliamentarians in Europe — Association of Western European Parliamentarians for Africa and the Council of the European Parliament — Canada and India. A number of other such organisations as well as specialised agencies have been identified by the PAP as potential future partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_6110">The PAP is funded by the AU Commission and by South Africa as host country. It has also been agreed that member states will bear the costs of preparation and attendance at the PAP by national delegates for the first five years of its existence. In April 2005, during its third ordinary session, the PAP established a trust fund as an alternative source of funding. The trust fund concept includes financial resources but also provision of expertise, technology and outsourcing facilities as well as the transfer of knowledge and skills from other parliamentary institutions. Development of the trust fund is still, I understand, at an early stage. However, provision is being made by the European Commission for funding under the EU-Africa strategy with discussions on modalities due to begin in the next weeks. Ireland has not to date been approached in regard to the trust fund. If the issue arises, we will consider it carefully.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_6147">The Council of Europe's standard reporting procedures in respect of the revised Social Charter apply to all the contracting parties, which are the member states which have signed and ratified the charter. Ireland signed and ratified the revised Social Charter, which has 31 articles, on 4 November 2000. In preparing its reports, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has to consult internally and with most other Departments before it updates material on relevant legislative or administrative changes which impact on Ireland's implementation of the revised charter. Given the range of issues to be covered and the number of Departments to be consulted, it can be quite demanding to gather and clarify up-to-date responses on a wide range of topics with regard to the steady growth in other reporting obligations on all Departments. In light of the substantially increased reporting requirements under the revised Social Charter — 31 articles compared with 19 in the original 1961 charter — the Department undertook to review criticisms of the Irish response made by the European Committee of Social Rights, which examines in detail individual member states' reports on the implementation of the revised charter, and to consider how implementation might be made more effective.</p>
            <p eId="para_6148">As part of this process, officials from the Department met a delegation from the Council of Europe, including its secretariat and members of the European Committee of Social Rights, in Dublin on 4 October 2005. The delays in the submission of Ireland's second and third reports on its implementation of the revised Social Charter were discussed at the meeting. The Council of Europe delegation acknowledged that three of the articles in Ireland's second report had already been submitted to Strasbourg. As it had done some work on its third report, which updates Ireland's reporting on the nine core articles for the period ending 31 December 2004, the Department agreed with the representatives of the European Council to prioritise the completion of the third report before reverting to the completion of the second report. The reason for this approach is that the third report can be completed quickly because it is, in effect, an update of the first report on the nine core articles, which was submitted in May 2004. The Department expects to submit the third report within the next few weeks. It will complete the second report on the outstanding 21 articles as the relevant material is received from Departments and agencies and edited by the Department. Having due regard to other pressing demands, I expect that this process should be completed by the beginning of June. Accordingly, there is no question of information being withheld from the Council of Europe. The Department is determined to eliminate backlogs in reporting developments as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_6149">I consider that the revised Social Charter is being properly implemented by Ireland, having regard to its national legislation and administrative practices. Queries raised by the European Committee of Social Rights are being and will continue to be addressed as part of the reporting procedures laid down by the Council of Europe.</p>

            <p eId="para_6151">I am concerned that the company in question is closing with the loss of 350 jobs. The decision to cease production at Ballivor, which was taken by the parent company, was announced on 21 February 2006. I met representatives of Meath County Council and the State development agencies the following day to discuss the follow-up to the closure announcement. The priority of the State development agencies is to find alternative employment for the workers. IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and FÁS will play their part in developing a way forward for the workers. The role of the State training agency, FÁS, will be particularly important in assisting those who are to lose their jobs. The agency has contacted the company. An action plan will be generated following a period of consultation and planning with the company and employee representatives. The agency will make its full range of services available to the workers if they wish to avail of them. The workforce in Ballivor is highly skilled. The loss of the 350 jobs will be a severe blow to the area. The industrial development agencies will strengthen their marketing efforts in County Meath, in partnership with the county council and other key players, to increase the flow of potential investors to the county. The bodies in question will try to convert those efforts into investment and job opportunities for Ballivor and the surrounding area.</p>

To ensure that all those who participate in this scheme are afforded the opportunity to build up a social insurance record which can have important advantages for benefits such as pensions and maternity benefit, provisions in the Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Bill 2006 will require that an annual PRSI contribution, at a rate of €253, is made in respect of this child minding income.

            <p eId="para_6161">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. The purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. Neither I nor my Department has any function in decisions on individual claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_6162">Rent supplements are paid subject to a means test. Rent supplements are ordinarily calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of €13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. However, people who take up opportunities, such as a place in the "moving on" programme, are treated more favourably and may retain up to €75 per week of any additional income they receive. A lone parent with one child living in Carlow with a rent of €150 per week, whose sole income is a one-parent family payment of €185.10 per week, would ordinarily receive rent supplement of €134.50 per week, resulting in a net income after paying rent of €169.60 week. If she takes up a place in the "moving on" programme, her total income before rent supplement and before paying rent would rise to €280.10 per week. In these circumstances, she would be entitled to €114.50 in rent supplement and her income after paying rent would total €244.60 per week. She would be €75 better off for having participated in the "moving on" programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6163">Until September 2005, the Health Service Executive was not applying the rules of the scheme correctly in some instances and this was the case with previous "moving on" programmes in Carlow. However, participants in the "moving on" programme now have their income assessed correctly under the rules that apply to rent supplement in the same manner as any other participant on a FÁS training course. Improvements in the means assessment from January 2006 now mean that a weekly disregard of up to €60 per week is allowed and half of any additional income between €60 and €90 is also disregarded. This type of additional income disregard was first introduced in the budget in 2000 and has been increased over the years to its current level.</p>

My Department spent €176,228 on advertising in the national newspapers in 2005.

When placing advertisements in the national newspapers, my Department uses the services of an advertising agency that currently holds a contract for the placement of State advertising in the print media.

The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition. The electricity allowance covers normal standing charges and up to 1,800 units of electricity each year. In February 2002, the number of units covered by the allowance increased by 20%, from 1,500 units to 1,800 units. VAT due on this standard allowance is also covered. An advantage of the allowance is that it is based on a unit allowance and therefore keeps pace with electricity price increases. Proposals to increase the value of the electricity allowance would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</p>

            <p eId="para_6170">Special arrangements for volunteer development workers have provided since 1983 for the award of credited social insurance contributions up to an aggregate of five years while they are outside the country on development activities. These credited contributions enable the workers to qualify for short-term benefits on their return from their overseas development work and it supports their accrued entitlement towards long-term benefits. In order to qualify for the credited contributions, a volunteer development worker must satisfy the following general and social insurance contribution criteria. He or she must be over 16 years of age. He or she must be resident in the State immediately prior to taking up the employment overseas, and must be employed under conditions of remuneration similar to those applied in the developing country.</p>
            <p eId="para_6171">In cases where the development worker has no previous PRSI contributions or no contributions paid or credited in the previous two years, arrangements have been put in place whereby Development Cooperation Ireland pay PRSI for the required number of contributions, up to a maximum of 52, to establish entitlement to short-term benefits for the volunteer workers. The credited contributions awarded to volunteer development workers are reckonable towards establishing entitlement to unemployment benefit, maternity benefit, disability benefit, health and safety benefit and treatment benefit. With regard to entitlement to old age pension, the credited contributions are counted towards calculating the yearly average that determines the rate at which the pension is paid. Given the nature of overseas work, provisions are in place to relax certain qualifying conditions normally required for entitlement to these benefits. This includes entitlement to the maximum full rate of unemployment or disability benefit where otherwise a reduced rate would apply for a period and special arrangements in relation to certification normally required of maternity benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_6172">These arrangements can apply to the missionaries who are engaged in development work abroad, but in line with social insurance provisions, generally does not extend to their pastoral work. The habitual residence condition applies to means tested assistance payments and child benefit only. The condition tests the centre of interest of a person, the extent to which that person can be considered to be permanently resident in this State and his or her intention into the foreseeable future. The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status, occupation, or any other factor. In the absence of entitlement to a social insurance based payment, people may qualify for an assistance based payment once they meet the standard habitual residence criteria. The habitual residence condition would not normally be expected to affect missionaries or volunteer development workers who are returning to Ireland on a permanent basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_6173">Officials of my Department made a presentation to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs in November 2005 on the issue of pensions for missionaries. Following the presentation, a working group, which includes my Department, was established to examine issues relating to social protection coverage for missionaries, notably in regard to pension coverage.</p>

            <p eId="para_6181">On budget day, I was pleased to announce that I proposed to establish, in September 2006, a standardised State non-contributory pension, replacing the old age pension and, for recipients aged 66 years and over, blind pension, widow/widower's pension, one-parent family payment, deserted wife's allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_6182">In addition to the simplification and rationalisation of pension provision for non-contributory pensioners, the State pension, non-contributory, will contain two key features. The general means disregard will be €20 per week, an increase of €12.40 per week over and above that currently applying to the schemes the new pension will replace. This disregard will apply to means from whatever source, including income from self-employment. Over 30,000 pensioners who are currently in receipt of a reduced rate of payment will gain from this change. The increase in the personal rate of payment will be up by €12.50 per week while the qualified adult rate, where applicable, will increase by up to €8.30 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_6183">A specific additional disregard of €100 per week will apply where the pensioner is in employment. This new disregard relating to earnings from employment is intended as an initial incentive to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to continue working or to re-enter the workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_6184">The budget did not provide for the proposed disregard to apply to income from self-employment or to any other forms of income other than earnings. In general, income disregards normally apply to income from employment only. Apart from providing an incentive to take up employment, this approach recognises that persons in employment incur additional expenses such as travelling expenses, clothing and so forth consequent on the employment. In contrast, all expenses necessarily incurred in carrying out any form of self-employment are always disregarded when calculating means from self-employment. This means that such earnings are assessed net of expenses incurred by the person in the course of their work, for example, on petrol/diesel, purchase of equipment and raw materials and so forth.</p>
            <p eId="para_6185">By any standards, the levels of increases announced in the budget are exceptional. The proposed modernisation of the current arrangements is also a further demonstration of our commitment to all those who are elderly.</p>

            <p eId="para_6190">The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit. The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual. Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</p>
            <p eId="para_6191">From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full-time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income. Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding unemployment assistance and benefit, are entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full-time care condition. This arrangement was introduced to acknowledge the needs of carers especially for respite. In budget 2006, provision was made to increase the amount of the respite care grant from €1,000 to €1,200 from June 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_6192">In addition to the increase in the level of the respite care grant, I also announced a significant increase in the rate of carer's allowance. From January, the rate of carer's allowance increased to €200 per week for carers age 66 years and over. This rate of payment may be higher in many instances than the rate of old age pension or widow/er's pension payable to a person. Such a person who is providing full-time care and attention to a person who requires such care may be entitled to receive this higher rate of carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_6193">I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_6195">The risk of poverty, especially child poverty, tends to be higher among one-parent families, larger families and those faced by long-term unemployment, due mainly to the direct costs of rearing children, including child care costs, and the opportunity costs related to the reduced earning capacity of parents arising from their care responsibilities. This applies particularly to one-parent families as the lone parent has to be the main breadwinner and carer at the same time.</p>
            <p eId="para_6196">However, it is generally accepted that for all people in working age households, the main route out of poverty is through employment. Employment participation among lone parents in this country is among the lowest in the OECD. This is despite the huge employment growth in recent years, increased female participation in the workforce and the income disregards afforded to lone parents who take up employment under my Department's one-parent family payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6197">I believe that every support should be given to lone parents to give them an opportunity to continue to increase their earnings in their efforts to improve their own lives and those of their children. In recognition of this, I was pleased to significantly increase the upper income limit for the one-parent family payment by €82 per week to €375 per week in the recent budget. This measure will come into effect in July of this year. In addition, as a result of taxation measures introduced in the budget, lone parents will not now become eligible for tax until they earn in excess of €23,000 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_6198">One of the key tasks in the "Ending Child Poverty" initiative under Sustaining Progress is to address obstacles to employment for lone parents. The senior officials group on social inclusion was mandated late in 2004 to examine this issue and report back to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion with specific proposals. A sub-group of the senior officials group has been examining obstacles to employment for lone parent families, with particular emphasis on income supports, employment, education, child care and support programmes and information. We must also look closely at income supports and at how we can adjust those supports to better address the social problems that can arise for those who receive these payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_6199">In this regard, a working group established in my Department to review the income support arrangements for lone parents has looked at issues, including the contingency basis of the one parent family payment, cohabitation and the fact that the payment can act as a disincentive to the formation of partnerships and discourage joint parenting, maintenance and secondary benefits. A consultation process with social partners and other interested parties was also undertaken to inform the work of the group. I intend to make the findings of both working groups public in the near future and to engage in a consultation process with interested parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_6200">It is my intention that the outcome of these reviews, together with initiatives already in place in my Department, will contribute to the ongoing development of proposals designed to better support and encourage both lone parents and those seeking work in achieving a better standard of living, employment and education opportunities, a better future for themselves and their children and a more appropriate social policy in the future.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_6202">I understand that the Deputy is concerned, in particular, about the current arrangements applying in the case of old age pensions and other social assistance pensions where the claimant is in possession of a farm. In assessing means for social assistance purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, including income from farming, together with the value of capital and property, except the home.</p>
            <p eId="para_6203">When assessing means derived from farming, a person is assessed with the prospective income from the farm in the next 12 months. In most cases, the figures for the last 12 months are used for this purpose. However, regard will be taken of any major changes in stock levels or in method of farming or in the prices of farm products. The yearly value or net profit is calculated by deducting all necessary expenses from the gross income. Where land is let on short-term lettings, such as the 11 month system, the income from such lettings is calculated as cash income for the purpose of the means assessment. Again, all necessary expenses incurred by the owner, such as auctioneer fees, fencing or fertilising between lettings are deducted from the gross letting income.</p>
            <p eId="para_6204">Where land is lying fallow or idle, there are two methods, depending on the circumstances of the individual case, for the assessment of means. If the Department is satisfied that the pension claimant is depriving himself or herself of an income in order to qualify for a pension or a pension at a higher rate than would otherwise be the case, the relevant assessment is the income which would be received, if the land were let. Where the Department is satisfied that this is not the case, the value of the land is obtained from the Valuation Office and is assessed as capital for means purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6205">The recent budget contained a number of important measures which are designed to target resources at particular groups of older people, including the farmers in question. In considering these measures I was anxious to target resources at those who are at the greatest risk of poverty, to encourage saving, and to simplify the system of income support for older people who do not receive contributory pensions, including farmers. Budget 2006 provides for an increase of €16 per week or 9.6% for all non-contributory pensioners, bringing the weekly rate of pension to €182 per week with effect from January. This means that significant progress has been made towards the achievement of the Government's commitment to bring the basic State pension to over €200 per week by 2007. In addition, I increased the fuel allowance by €5 per week, from €9 to €14, and the over 80 allowance by €3.60 to €10. These measures will be of considerable benefit to many thousands of non-contributory pensioners, including many farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6206">On budget day, I was also pleased to announce that I proposed to establish, in September 2006, a standardised State non-contributory pension, replacing the old age pension and, for recipients aged 66 years and over, blind pension, widow/er's pension, one-parent family payment, deserted wife's allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance. All the schemes in question feature a common means disregard of €7.60 per week, which has not increased since the 1970s. The means disregard for the new non-contributory pension will be €20 per week, an increase of €12.40 per week. Over 30,000 pensioners who are currently in receipt of a reduced rate of payment will gain from this change. The increase in the personal rate of payment will be up to €12.50 per week while the qualified adult rate, where applicable, will increase by up to €8.30 per week. This measure, in particular, will benefit all those farmers who are in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_6207">Furthermore, consequent on the increase in the means disregard to €20 per week, a single person with no other means will be able to have up to €35,000 in capital and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. This figure is doubled in the case of a pensioner couple.</p>
            <p eId="para_6208">By any standards, the levels of increases and revised means test arrangements announced in the budget are exceptional. The proposed modernisation of the current arrangements is also a further demonstration of our commitment to all those who are elderly, including those who continue to farm or lease land.</p>

To date, 16 posts have been relocated to Sligo under the decentralisation programme, with two employees of the Department moving directly with their jobs. The remaining posts, with the exception of two employees who transferred from other Departments, were filled by the lateral transfer of employees in the Department who had this location as their first preference on the CAF.</p>
            <p eId="para_6212">To date, four employees have been recruited as new recruits to this Department specifically for decentralised posts. Removal expenses are not payable for relocations associated with decentralisation.

            <p eId="para_6237">It is understood from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the main provisions in Irish law relating to Money Laundering are set out in section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 — as amended by section 21 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 — sections 32 and 57 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and section 23 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_6238">The Act allows for the designation of certain bodies and persons for anti-money laundering purposes and for the prescribing of certain activities for the purposes of anti-money laundering. The Act also requires designated bodies to adopt measures to prevent and detect the commission of a money laundering offence, including the establishment of internal procedures, circulation of instructions to, and appropriate training of employees, directors and officers. A money laundering steering committee established under the chairmanship of the Department of Finance oversees this aspect of the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6239">While taxi dispatch companies are not designated bodies under the 1994 Act, any financial institution offering services to such a company must report to the financial intelligence unit of the Garda Síochána and to the Revenue Commissioners any suspicion of money laundering in the course of a transaction or an attempted transaction.</p>
            <p eId="para_6240">In addition to the powers available in relation to money laundering under the 1994 Act, the Criminal Assets Bureau also has extensive powers under the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 to 2005 to target the proceeds of criminal activity no matter how such proceeds have been used.</p>

            <p eId="para_6248">The protected areas the Deputy refers to, and mentioned in the earlier question in 2004, were put in place by orders made under section 14 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1950. The orders in question were made between 1988 and 1993, and relate to circular protected areas of 300 metres radius from the IAA's DVOR-DME equipment at Rowlestown West, County Dublin, Kilgarriff West, Charlestown, County Mayo and Knockaun, Shannon, County Clare.</p>
            <p eId="para_6249">The responsibility for these orders is now a matter for the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA. The 2005 SI that the Deputy refers to is the Irish Aviation Authority (Protected Area) Order 2005, and was made by the IAA on 5 December 2005. This order puts a similar circular protected area of 300 metres radius from the IAA's DVOR-DME equipment at Ballygarvan and Lehenaghmore in County Cork. The IAA has informed me that it will be happy to deal with any query that the Deputy puts to them in relation to the protected areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_6300">The current number of licence applications on hand in the road transport operator licensing division of the Department of Transport is 92. Once an application is submitted with the necessary supporting documentation in order, it can normally be processed within ten working days.

The processing of amendments to existing applications, with the necessary supporting documentation in order, is currently taking a number of weeks. However, overall this is a speedier process than previously, from a HAULIER'S perspective, as arising from new arrangements introduced last autumn, it is no longer necessary to go to the Garda Síochána to have a plate issued in respect of every vehicle as the Department of Transport is now issuing the transport discs in place of vehicle plates.</p>

The necessary preparations have now been made in that regard and it is my intention to include appropriate provisions in the next road traffic Bill. Assuming the enactment of that legislation by the Oireachtas, it would be the intention to make new regulations, restating the prohibition on the use of a hand-held mobile phone while driving a vehicle at an early date, following enactment of the legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_6338">I understand from the NRA that dealing with water infiltration during the construction phase is part and parcel of the process of building any tunnel that passes below the surrounding ground water level. It is routinely encountered and dealt with on tunnel projects throughout the world and is being similarly dealt with in the Dublin Port tunnel. I am informed that any measures necessary to deal with such groundwater issues will be implemented by the contractors at their own expense.</p>
            <p eId="para_6339">The Dublin Port tunnel passes up to 20 m below the ground water table along the route. At this depth the issue of rainfall over the previous two months has no significance. I understand that the water infiltration is simply groundwater contained within the rock surrounding the tunnel and that no voids can, or could, result from such water movement. I am also informed that there is no possible issue of subsidence associated with such water infiltration.</p>
            <p eId="para_6340">Construction work on the Dublin Port tunnel has been monitored in detail since the project commenced in 2001 by construction supervisors appointed by Dublin City Council. When problems arise, as they inevitably and routinely do with projects of this size, Dublin City Council and its construction supervisors ensure that they are detected and rectified. Contrary to the impression that may have been created, there are no safety implications, either for the workers on the tunnel, for the structural integrity of the project or for the buildings and houses above the tunnel.</p>

            <p eId="para_6387">Under the NDP-Transport 21, Dublin Bus has purchased 530 new buses to date, of which 113 are additional and 417 are replacement buses. Some 268 of these buses were funded, partially and/or fully, by the Exchequer and 262 of these buses were funded from Dublin Bus's own resources.

            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_6391">Under Transport 21, a number of projects are proposed with significant investment, which will benefit the north side of Dublin. New metro and Luas services will provide fast, efficient and modern transport to key residential, educational and business locations. The network will be fully integrated and will stretch from Swords in the north, to Bray in the south and Lucan in the west. This network will allow all Dubliners to easily traverse the city. While the specific alignment has yet to be finalised, it is proposed that metro north will run from St. Stephen's Green to Swords and will service key areas on Dublin's north side, including DCU, Ballymun and Dublin Airport. Metro west will link the Tallaght Luas with the metro north line and will provide services north of the river between Blanchardstown and Ballymun.</p>
            <p eId="para_6392">Under Transport 21, metro north and metro west are scheduled for completion in 2012 and 2014, respectively. The Tallaght Luas line will be extended from Connolly Station to the docklands. The Tallaght and Sandyford lines will be joined in the city centre and extended to Liffey junction.</p>
            <p eId="para_6393">With regard to Irish Rail services, the city centre resignalling project, provided for in Transport 21, and the continued enhancement of the suburban rail rolling stock fleet, will provide for further capacity enhancement for DART and suburban rail services serving both southside and northside locations. The resignalling project will involve upgrading of signalling to accommodate an additional four train paths per direction per hour, up from 12 at present to 16, in the critical city centre area. These additional paths will give Iarnród Éireann much needed flexibility to increase frequencies not only on the DART but also on the northern and Maynooth suburban lines.</p>
            <p eId="para_6394">Transport 21 also provides for electrification of the northern line to Balbriggan and the acquisition of electric railcars for use on the newly electrified lines. This project effectively means that the DART network will be extended to Balbriggan bringing obvious benefits for north Dublin commuters. Transport 21 also provides for a programme of investment to expand the bus network in all areas of the greater Dublin area comprising integrated radial and orbital services.</p>
            <p eId="para_6395">On 20 January 2006, Dublin Bus submitted an application for funding to me for additional fleet requirements in 2006 and 2007 and this is currently being assessed by my Department. I will make a decision on the application when this assessment is completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_6398">I propose to take Questions Nos. 339 and 340 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6399">To use a vehicle in a public place, it must comply with a range of standards in respect of its construction, equipment, use, weight and dimensions. These requirements are set out in the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996, the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002 and the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 to 2004. These regulations apply in the interests of public safety and to protect road infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_6400">Exemptions from certain requirements of the regulations apply in respect of land tractors and trailers. Essentially, these are vehicles that are designed and used primarily for work on the land and are used on a public road only incidental to such work on the land.</p>
            <p eId="para_6401">For safety reasons a vehicle should only be used for a purpose for which it was designed and intended. As agricultural tractors and trailer are designed primarily for use on the land their use in other capacities is questionable on safety grounds. In March 2005, my Department wrote to local authorities concerning the appropriateness of the use, in a local authority context, of agricultural-type tractors and trailers for the carrying of goods or burden of any description and outlining the necessity for hauliers engaged by local authorities to hold a road freight carrier's licence if hauling for hire and reward.</p>
            <p eId="para_6402">The Department's letter to local authorities recognised that there could be exceptional circumstances where the engagement of the services of an agricultural tractor and trailer by a local authority is acceptable. In response to queries from the professional agricultural contractors, PAC, concerning these situations, my Department wrote to the PAC last month amplifying the circumstances. The circumstances envisaged would be on work that is agricultural in nature such as cutting or maintaining inlets in roadside verges and managing the resultant spoil in an environmentally sustainable manner, hedge cutting etc. It was also indicated to the PAC that where a trailer meeting the definition of an agricultural trailer is used in the circumstances outlined above, it would be deemed to be exempt from the requirements to be licensed and tested.</p>

            <p eId="para_6406">EU law on maximum weights and dimensions for vehicles is set out in Directive 96/53/EC. Under that directive, which has been fully implemented by Ireland, a member state may not prohibit the use, in its territory, of vehicles from another member state which comply with the authorised maximum weight and dimension limits set down in the directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_6407">The directive specifies four metres as the limit value for vehicle height. Consequently, provided a vehicle registered in a member state is four metres or less in height, every member state must permit that vehicle to operate on its territory. A member state may, however, prescribe a higher limit on its territory and may also, through its appropriate agencies, prescribe for traffic management purposes the routings which vehicles are required to follow in its territory.</p>
            <p eId="para_6408">Ireland does not impose any height limit on goods vehicles at present but the question of whether to prescribe such a limit is currently being examined in my Department. That examination includes consideration of the submissions received from interested parties in response to public consultation on the subject. I intend to make a decision on the matter shortly. In the event that it is decided to introduce a statutory height restriction for goods vehicles, it will be necessary to submit the draft regulations to the European Commission for consideration and for referral to other member states in accordance with the technical standards and regulations directive, Directive 98/34.</p>
            <p eId="para_6409">The development of a specific strategy for the management of heavy goods vehicles in Dublin city to coincide with the opening of the Dublin Port tunnel is a matter for Dublin City Council. My Department is continuing to liaise with Dublin City Council and with other parties, such as the Garda Síochána, the Dublin Port Company and the NRA, to ensure that the effectiveness of the Dublin Port tunnel is maximised for the Dublin area when the tunnel is opened.</p>

            <p eId="para_6411">The matter raised by the Deputy is the responsibility of Waterways Ireland, a North-South Implementation Body established under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_6412">I have been informed by Waterways Ireland that the maximum period for mooring boats on the Grand Canal is contained in the by-laws for the canal, which provide that, "no person shall moor a boat on the canals or within 500 metres of the same place for more than 5 days without the appropriate permit."</p>
            <p eId="para_6413">I understand from Waterways Ireland that it has no plans at present to increase these limits. However, it is currently reviewing all the by-laws for the waterways within its remit, including the issue of fees, and proposes to go to public consultation on the matter later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6414">With regard to the visitor centre at the Grand Canal Basin, certain refurbishment works are under consideration at present by Waterways Ireland in the context of ongoing discussions with a developer seeking to progress a mixed use development on an adjacent site. I understand that Waterways Ireland is seeking to have the cost of the refurbishment works at the visitor centre included as part of the overall development scheme. Waterways Ireland estimates that the scheme, including the refurbishment works, would be completed within two years of its commencement. Alterations would not be required to the existing mooring facilities in the Grand Canal Basin and alternative public access would be maintained throughout the development period.</p>

        <b>Mr. Ring</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
        the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo has been told they have to cease on the rural social scheme, after a contract of only one year; if this person will be re-employed on the rural social scheme.

            <p eId="para_6416">The conditions of eligibility, which need to be fulfilled to participate in the rural social scheme, RSS, are as follows: applicants must be in receipt of farm assist or have been allocated a valid herd or flock number from the Department of Agriculture and Food and be in receipt of one of the following allowances from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, namely, unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, if previously on CE, or disability allowance; or applicants are self-employed fisherpersons on a fishing boat which has been entered in the register of fishing boats or have been issued with a fishing licence for fishing for salmon at sea, from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and are in receipt of one of the following allowances from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, namely, unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, if previously on CE, or disability allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_6417">The person in question, prior to commencement on the RSS, was signing for credited social insurance contributions — credits — with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Credited contributions are notional social insurance contributions, which are awarded to an insured person without a pay related social insurance, PRSI, payment being received from that person.</p>
            <p eId="para_6418">My Department has established, following legal advice, that a person signing for credits has no underlying entitlement to participate on the scheme. The person concerned spent one year on the scheme but following the legal clarification was informed that he could not continue to participate for a further period on the basis of credited social insurance contributions. To be eligible going forward, the person in question must meet the criteria set out above.</p>

        the number of applicants who have been refused participation on the rural social scheme in each county since the scheme was introduced; the category of their refusal; the number of people who have been refused an extension of their employment contract on the rural social scheme in each county, in each refusal category; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_6421">As I pointed out in my reply to Question No. 378, participants described as "on credits" were signing for credited social welfare insurance contributions with the Department of Social and Family Affairs prior to commencement on the scheme. My Department has established, following legal advice, that a person signing for credits has no underlying entitlement to participate on the scheme, hence the refusal of contract extensions in their cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_6619">My Department has very clear arrangements in place for the reporting, collection and testing of dead wild birds. My Department is responsible for the collection and testing of such birds and last week the avian influenza helpline facility was extended and widely advertised in the national media. As a result there has been a significant increase in the number of wild bird mortalities being reported to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6620">The helpline is part of an early warning system which my Department has operated for several months with the active assistance of the national parks and wildlife service, the National Association of Regional Game Councils and Birdwatch Ireland. This system, which involves the reporting of increased or unusual patterns of wild bird mortality, is part of a more intensified approach to wild bird surveillance and is a critical element in the early detection of the disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_6621">With the extension of the helpline last week, my Department wrote to all county and city councils advising them that all reports of wild bird mortalities should be reported to my Department. The Department has not requested wildlife rangers or local authority staff to recover dead wild birds.</p>
            <p eId="para_6622">My Department records fully all incidents reported, through the early warning system, by any of the agencies involved or by members of the public through the avian influenza helpline. Under the present arrangements, a veterinary officer from my Department recovers the carcases of single dead waterfowl and migratory birds, and multiple dead native birds and delivers them to the reference veterinary laboratory for testing to establish cause of death.</p>

            <p eId="para_6751">The objective of the European Council regulation which governs the early retirement scheme is structural reform, through the provision of a financial incentive to older farmers to retire early in order to facilitate their replacement by younger farmers who are considered more likely to improve the economic viability of the holding. The regulation sets down minimum requirements that must be met, but enables individual member states to set additional conditions considered necessary to meet the objectives of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6752">In designing the scheme, my Department considered that the focus should be on younger farmers and provided for a sliding upper age limit for prospective transferees starting at 45 years and reducing annually to 40 years for applications received in 2006. The representatives of young farmers continue to support this structure. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food, however, recommended, in its 2005 report on the operation of the scheme of early retirement, the restoration of the limit to 45 years and I am considering the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_6765">In this case one application was submitted under the 2004 special beef premium scheme, in respect of six animals. Following the initial processing of the application, one of the animals applied on was not recorded in the herd of the applicants named on the date of application. The animal was, therefore, rejected and a penalty of 9.09% was applied. However, following an appeal submitted to the agricultural appeals office, the decision was overturned and the application is now being processed for payment. Payment will issue shortly.</p>

This requirement was set out clearly in the documentation supplied to farmers on a number of occasions. If the person named declares sufficient land on his 2006 single payment application, he will be in a position to claim full entitlements.

            <p eId="para_6876">The sugar reform package agreed in November provides for compensation to beet growers of up to 64% of the reduction in the minimum price for beet. This compensation, which will be paid as part of the single farm payment, will be worth approximately €123 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years. I announced recently that the reference period for the establishment of the single payment compensation for beet growers was the three-year average of the individual farmers contracted tonnage of beet with Irish Sugar Limited in the years 2001, 2002 and 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_6877">Under the single payment scheme, the compensation for sugar beet growers will be established for farmers who grew sugar beet under contract with Irish Sugar Limited during the 2000, 2001 and 2004 reference period. As the European Commission has not adopted the detailed implementing rules for the incorporation of the sugar beet compensation in the single farm payment, it is not possible at this stage to confirm that similar provisions to those applying under the existing single payment scheme will also apply to the sugar beet compensation.</p>

            <p eId="para_6879">The agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime provides for compensation to growers for the institutional price reductions. In the event of a decision to cease sugar production, the provisions of the temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry also come into play. Under this scheme, an application involving factory closure and renunciation of quota can be made for aid in respect of the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring. The deadline for applications is 31 July 2006 for the first year of the scheme and 31 January for each year thereafter. In Ireland's case, the aid would be worth up to €145 million. At least 10% of the aid is reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery. That proportion may be increased by member states after consultation of interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured. In addition, diversification funds of almost €44 million will also become available for Irish growers in the event that sugar beet production completely ceases in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_6880">A provision which would have limited eligibility for restructuring funds to growers who had delivered beet in the year preceding the year of quota renunciation was dropped at Ireland's request. Until all the relevant EU legal texts have been adopted, it will not be possible to make definitive implementation arrangements for these compensation payments.</p>

            <p eId="para_6888">The British authorities are not refusing to provide police vetting for persons who have worked within that jurisdiction and who are now applying for positions in this jurisdiction. However, last December, the British national central bureau, NCB, of Interpol issued a communiqué to all Interpol member states, including Ireland, signalling changes in British vetting procedures. The nature of these changes would have the potential to create significant difficulties for the Garda Síochána in submitting requests for vetting to the British authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_6889">Accordingly, concerns at the potential implications of these changes have been raised at both ministerial and a high level police-to-police basis, with a view to reaching a satisfactory resolution of the potential difficulties.

            <p eId="para_6900">Peace commissioners are appointed under section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924. The office of peace commissioner is an honorary appointment and peace commissioners receive no remuneration or compensation by way of fees or expenses for their services. An application for appointment may be submitted by a person who is interested in obtaining an appointment, or a third party may submit a nomination in respect of a person considered suitable for appointment. Nominations are generally received from public representatives. A local Garda superintendent sometimes requests an appointment in a particular area in the public interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_6901">There is no qualifying examination involved but appointees are required to be of good character and they are usually well established in the local community. Persons who are members of professions or employed in occupations which engage in legal work or related activities and members of the clergy are, as a matter of practice, not appointed because of their occupation. Civil servants are usually only appointed where the performance of their official duties requires an appointment, that is, <i> ex officio</i>. Persons convicted of serious offences are considered unsuitable for appointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6902">The fact that an applicant or nominee may be suitable for appointment does not in itself provide any entitlement to appointment because appointments are made at the discretion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and having regard to the needs of particular areas. I am reviewing the position regarding the appointment of peace commissioners in certain areas consequent to legal advice and I expect to bring forward legislative proposals to clarify the position in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_7007">Section 122(1)(<i>d</i>) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides that the Minister may, after consulting the Garda Commissioner and with the approval of the Government, make regulations governing the admission, appointment and enrolment of members, including members who have served with other police services and members with different ethnic or national origins or different religious reliefs or backgrounds. While I have no immediate plans to make regulations in this regard, I will keep the need for such regulations under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_7008">The Deputy will be aware, however, of the changes to the criteria for admission as a Garda Síochána trainee for which I secured Government approval. These changes were made under the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) (Amendment) Regulations 2004 and 2005, respectively. In 2004 I increased the maximum age of applicants from 26 to 35 in time for the recruitment competition in November 2004. In 2005, following a period of through consultation with the Commissioner and other stakeholders, I secured Government approval for a number of important changes aimed at facilitating recruitment from different ethnic backgrounds in our society. Key among these was that the requirement to hold a qualification in both Irish and English in the leaving certificate or equivalent was replaced with a requirement to hold such a qualification in two languages, at least one of which must be Irish or English. A new nationality or residency requirement was also introduced. While there was previously no such explicit requirement, the need to have a qualification in Irish had effectively limited entry to the Garda Síochána to Irish citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_7009">Admission as a trainee is now open to nationals of an EU member state, an EEA state or the Swiss Confederation, and nationals of any other state who are lawfully present in Ireland and have five years' lawful residence here. These changes have opened up entry to the Garda Síochána to persons in Ireland from all parts of the community and from all ethnic backgrounds. This is a hugely significant step which will help ensure that future intakes of recruits to the Garda Síochána reflect the composition of society to the benefit of the force and the people it serves.</p>
            <p eId="para_7010">The categories of persons whom the Commissioner may appoint directly to the force without having regard to the age, educational, residency or training requirements under the regulations were widened from persons with "special technical qualifications" to persons with "special aptitudes, knowledge, skills or technical qualifications". The purpose of this is to enable the Commissioner, where he has identified a need that cannot be met from within the force, to recruit new members with specialist skills, for example, in languages, to enhance the capacity of the Garda Síochána to respond to the challenges of modern policing.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_843">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_7012">The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers and has a portfolio of 67 centres throughout the State for this purpose. In March 2005, a total of 8,080 asylum seekers were being accommodated by the RIA. Approximately 3,500 residents applied for leave to remain in the State under the Irish-born children or IBC measures announced on 17 December 2004. Almost all these residents have now left the RIA accommodation and, as of 17 February 2006, 4,917 asylum seekers were resident in accommodation centres. This drastic reduction in a relatively short space of time in the numbers requiring accommodation has led to a temporary over-supply of accommodation. In addition, the numbers and profile of persons seeking asylum has changed dramatically. There is now a larger number of single persons seeking asylum in the State as opposed to families and RIA accommodation must reflect this reality.</p>
            <p eId="para_7013">To address the reduction in numbers and the change in profile, the RIA embarked on a programme of downsizing of its accommodation portfolio. This is intended to bring supply and demand into balance and will include the re-classification of some of the accommodation centres to optimise usage and obtain value for money. This downsizing has seen a number of centre closures during 2005 — 15 centres with a combined capacity of 833 beds. To date in 2006, four centres with a combined capacity of approximately 270 beds have been closed and further closures or re-classifications are planned. Overall, the current downsizing has led to the closure of two accommodation centres in County Mayo. There are now only two centres remaining in the county, one of which is in Kiltimagh.</p>
            <p eId="para_7014">In the case of the centre in Kiltimagh, the RIA considered it to be suitable for possible re-classification from family to single person accommodation. The centre consists of two buildings, the Railway Hotel and an annexe located on the opposite side of the road, and it was intended to place males in one building and females in the other. As part of the reclassification of this centre, the RIA intended to relocate its families to other centres where they could benefit from special facilities for children and young people including pre-school facilities. The decision to re-classify the centre was made in early January 2006 and, following this, a number of support groups contacted the RIA on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_7015">At all times the RIA is concerned to minimise disruption to residents and the local community while maintaining its commitment to efficient and effective use of the overall accommodation portfolio. Following further consideration the RIA has recently agreed that the families residing at the centre will be allowed to remain there at least until the end of the current school year. However, arrangements are also being made to allow for the accommodation of some male asylum seekers at the centre. The RIA will shortly make up to ten placements in the annexe at this location and will monitor the arrangements on an ongoing basis. Discussions have taken place with various groups such as Irish Rural Development, Le Chéile Support Group, Intercultural Ireland (Castlebar) and St. Aidan's national school and we understand that there is now a greater acceptance of the proposed new arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_7016">The RIA has in its accommodation portfolio 17 male-only centres and no significant issues have arisen at these locations. In addition, the RIA has embarked on the re-classification of a portion of some of its larger family centres to accommodate single persons alongside families in Sligo, Meath and Monaghan. Such reclassifications are always carefully undertaken in consultation with relevant parties, especially the operators of the centre concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_7017">Given the population base of the town of Kiltimagh and its environs and based on past experience, it is not considered likely that the re-classification of this centre will pose problems. In the middle of 2005, up to 80 asylum seekers were accommodated at this centre. However, owing to the outflow of asylum seekers from RIA accommodation centres, the numbers accommodated have now fallen to under half the number accommodated in 2005. These levels cannot be sustained in a centre of this size. Unless the RIA can make proper use of the accommodation centre, in line with its requirements, it will not be a viable economic proposition to continue the contract with the possible resultant loss of jobs and an indirect negative impact on the local economy. The RIA therefore intends to place more asylum seekers in the centre in the coming months to raise occupancy levels and ensure that the centre remains viable.</p>

            <p eId="para_7031">Penalty points are assigned to the driving licence record in the national driver file by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government on receipt of information from the Garda Síochána indicating that a fixed charge notice attracting penalty points has been paid or from the Courts Service following the outcome of court proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_7032">Information on the number of penalty points attaching to a driving licence is not available to the Garda Síochána through the PULSE system or on the hand-held units used by gardaí on traffic duty. However, I am advised by the Garda authorities that initial discussions have taken place with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the technical aspects of the Garda Síochána obtaining data electronically on driver disqualifications. Those licence holders reaching 12 penalty points represent a sub-set of this data.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_7034">I am informed by the Garda authorities that in 2004, 5,306 headline offences were committed by persons on bail; the corresponding figure for 2005 was 5,456. The following table shows the number of homicide, rape, other sexual assault and drug offences committed by persons on bail and proceedings commenced in 2004. Other than the number of manslaughters and murders committed by persons on bail, the corresponding figures for 2005 are not available. These figures are being compiled and I will be in touch with the Deputy when they are available. Comparable statistics for the years prior to 2004 are not readily available and would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to compile.</p>
            <p eId="para_7035">The Garda Commissioner for the first time provided statistics on headline offences committed by persons on bail in his 2004 annual report. I welcome the provision of this information as a contribution to public discussion. The statistics in the Commissioner's report classify offences committed while on bail under the ten headline crime groups under which the report's statistics are categorised. It is important to note that all offences in, for example, the homicide group are not the homicide offences of murder and manslaughter. The homicide group of headline offences also includes the offences of attempted murder, murder threats, infanticide, abortion and procuring or assisting in an abortion. The statistics may include persons who have not been convicted of the offences they are alleged to have committed, and this is one of the matters on which I have requested information from the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_7036">Regarding bail in general, during the term of office of the rainbow coalition the number of prisoners on temporary release reached an all-time high of 20% at one stage. As a result of the action of this Government, this so-called revolving door system operated by the rainbow coalition has been stopped and the percentage of the prison population on temporary release now is approximately 2.3%. While it is disturbing that offences are committed by persons on bail, the offence for which the person received bail may be a minor one. Our legislative provisions for the granting of bail are very stringent. The 16th amendment of the Constitution provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. The Bail Act 1997 gave effect to the amendment and tightened up the bail regime generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_7037">The Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed shall be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence. The granting of bail in accordance with the Act, the amount of bail and sentencing are matters for the courts which are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</p>

            <p eId="para_7088">Regulation 5 of the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 1988 (as amended) provides that to qualify for admission as a trainee with the Garda Síochána, prospective applicants must, <i> inter alia</i>, be at least 18 years and under 35 years of age on the first day of the month in which the relevant competition was advertised.</p>
            <p eId="para_7089">In accordance with the regulations, to be eligible for selection as a trainee under the current competition, which was advertised in September 2005, an applicant must have been at least 18 and under 35 years on 1 September 2005. Recruitment to the Garda Síochána is by open competition conducted by the Public Appointments Service, formerly the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners, in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner. Regarding the specific application referred to by the Deputy, the position is that I have no function in recruitment and selection of individual candidates for entry to the Garda Síochána. This is entirely a matter for the Public Appointments Service and the Garda Commissioner.</p>
            <p eId="para_7090">The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in an Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007 by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved. In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the first incremental increase of newly attested gardaí due to the programme of accelerated recruitment into the Garda Síochána will take place on 16 March 2006.</p>

        his views on whether under the proposals of the liquor licensing consolidation Bill, the <i>ad interim</i> transfer system for new owners of pubs will be replaced by a system whereby the new owner or tenant must immediately apply for a new licence to the courts, that they must give 14 days’ notice and produce a tax clearance certificate, that such a transfer could be refused if an objection of an undue risk of either public nuisance or of a threat to public order or safety was upheld, that such a system would have the unintended consequences of severely constraining the freedom of publicans to transfer ownership of licensed premises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_7092">The position is that the temporary or <i>ad interim</i> transfer of a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor for the unexpired period of the licence until the following 30 September is permitted under the Excise Licences Act 1825 and the Public House (Ireland) Act 1855 in certain circumstances, including the sale or assignment of the licensee’s interest in the premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_7093">An application for an <i>ad interim</i> transfer is made to the District Court. The officer in charge of the Garda Síochána and the court clerk must be given notice of the application at least 48 hours before the hearing. Section 21 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 provides that an application to transfer a licence shall be refused unless it is established to the satisfaction of the court that the applicant is a fit person.</p>
            <p eId="para_7094">The arrangements for the <i>ad interim</i> transfer of licences are unsatisfactory because they do not permit sufficient consideration and scrutiny of applications. The 48-hour notice period is inadequate for the Garda to assess whether an applicant is a fit person to hold a licence or, if the applicant is a company, to trace the owners or directors of the company. It would also appear that the system may be open to abuses such as transfers of ownership designed to avoid prosecutions for breaches of the licensing laws.</p>
            <p eId="para_7095">The Government's legislation programme published on 25 January last makes provision for publication of a sale of alcohol Bill in 2006 which will update and streamline the law relating to the sale and consumption of alcohol. The Bill will repeal the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2004 as well as the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2004 and replace them with provisions more suited to modern conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_7096">Arising from last year's consultation process on the draft Bill, I am aware of the concerns of vintners' organisations regarding the grounds of objection to the granting of a certificate for a new licence upon the sale or assignment of licensed premises. I will consider this issue further in the context of the detailed drafting of the Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_7102">The legislation on noise pollution is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government. His Department issued a leaflet entitled A Guide to the Noise Regulations, which outlines the steps which can be taken where a person experiences nuisance caused by noise.</p>
            <p eId="para_7103">This is primarily a civil matter and, as such, is outside the remit of the Garda Síochána. However, when gardaí receive a complaint about neighbours causing noise, they can request them to lower the noise levels. The Garda powers in this regard relate to ensuring that a breach of the peace does not occur. Complainants may also be advised by the Garda of their civil entitlements under section 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.</p>
            <p eId="para_7104">The Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 was enacted to make further and better provision for the protection of the environment and the control of pollution and to establish the Environmental Protection Agency. A local authority, the agency or any person may complain to the District Court regarding any noise which is so loud, continuous, repeated and of such duration or pitch or occurring at such a time, as to give reasonable cause for annoyance. The court may order the person or body making the noise to take the measures necessary to reduce the noise to a specified level or to take measures to limit or prevent the noise.</p>
            <p eId="para_7105">An authorised person shall, for any purpose connected with the Act be entitled, at all reasonable times, to enter any premises and to bring therein such other persons, including members of the Garda Síochána. An offence under the Act may be prosecuted summarily by the Environmental Protection Agency. Section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, which substituted a new section for section 5 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927, provides that the District Court may grant a special exemption order which permits the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor on a specified occasion after normal closing time.</p>
            <p eId="para_7106">Special exemption orders are granted on a case-by-case basis by the District Court and this means that an application must be made to the court by the licensee in respect of each occasion for which such an order is sought. The officer in charge of the Garda Síochána for the relevant licensing area must be given at least 48 hours' notice of an application for a special exemption order. Among the grounds on which objections to the granting of such orders may be made include undue inconvenience or nuisance to persons residing in the locality or an undue risk to public order in the locality.</p>
            <p eId="para_7107">Provision is made for a local authority role in determining the duration of special exemption orders in its administrative area. A local authority may adopt a resolution concerning the expiry times of special exemption orders in respect of the whole or a specified part of its administrative area. The District Court is required to have regard to any such resolution before making a special exemption order on foot of any application by a licensee.</p>

            <p eId="para_7111">I presume that the Deputy is referring to applications for leave to remain made pursuant to section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 as amended. Leave to remain in these circumstances arise where a non-national is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Immigration Act 1999. A person served with such a notice of intent, including persons refused refugee status, is afforded three options: to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of the deportation order or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons a deportation order should not be made and that temporary leave to remain in the State be granted instead.</p>
            <p eId="para_7112">Under section 3(6) of the Act the Minister, in determining whether to make a deportation order, shall have regard to 11 specified considerations, one of which is any representation made by or on behalf of the person. The determination as to whether a deportation order is made or whether leave to remain is granted is not dependent on whether the person has made representations for leave to remain. Thus, statistics are not maintained to distinguish between cases where representations have been made for leave to remain from those where no such representations were made. Similarly, statistics are not maintained to distinguish between categories of persons who have either been refused refugee status or become illegally present in the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_7153">We have already made 159 assignments to decentralising posts and I anticipate that in the coming year, additional progress will be made as the programme gathers momentum. The Garda central vetting unit moved to Thurles last November and as other sections in the Garda area complete their preparations, around 100 posts will have relocated to Thurles by the end of this year. In addition, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is scheduled to move its operations to Portarlington by the autumn and the new headquarters for the Irish Prison Service in Longford will be ready for occupation in early 2007. These two moves involve the relocation of more than 180 posts.</p>

            <p eId="para_7156">The report, Inequality and the Stereotyping of Young People, published on 22 February 2006 by the Equality Authority and the National Youth Council of Ireland, is a valuable piece of research which I welcome. This report provides a valuable insight into how young people see their relationships wit, <i>inter alia</i>, the Garda, teachers, politicians and the media. The research centres on ten focus groups of young people from different parts of the country, including young people with different identities and circumstances, and provides an insight into young people’s views on how they are perceived by adults.</p>
            <p eId="para_7157">The report sets out a number of recommendations which it considers would help to address and reduce these inequalities and stereotypical perceptions. The recommendations include a suggestion that vocational education committees, VECs, should be provided with resources necessary to carry out the functions set out for them in the Youth Work Act 2001. These functions include an assessment of the youth work needs of young people. These recommendations are consistent with my objectives for the youth work sector. In this regard, I am pleased to say that the additional allocation provided in the Revised Estimates published last week will allow for the further progression of the Youth Work Act 2001, including the resourcing of VECs, as well as other priority areas of development.</p>

The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills including self-awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the SPHE curriculum in the strand, Myself and Others, from infant classes onwards. In second level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle in the module, Belonging and Integrating.</p>
            <p eId="para_7177">Each school is required to have in place within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_7178">My Department in its guidelines on countering bullying behaviour in primary and post-primary schools has provided a framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school-based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school and to incorporate, should it so wish, any methodology such as the one referred to by the Deputy.</p>

In these situations, the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable for the duration of the grant holder's study abroad.

            <p eId="para_7220">Catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960s and were determined following consultation with local educational interests. For planning purposes the country was divided into geographic districts each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. The intention was and continues to be that these defined districts facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7221">Reviews of specific catchment boundaries may be carried out where appropriate.

These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools which would include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. The capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €133.58 with effect from 1 January, 2005 and has been further increased by €12 per pupil with effect from 1 January, 2006 bringing the standard rate to €145.58.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_7259">The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance.</p>
            <p eId="para_7260">The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_7261">Up to 2004, Ireland had no national data on the levels of student attendance in our schools. This matter was addressed by the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which requires all schools to submit a report to the NEWB on levels of school attendance. In 2004, the NEWB initiated the collection and analysis of the first set of school attendance data for Ireland, relating to the school year 2003-04.</p>
            <p eId="para_7262">Based on the analysis of data for the 2003-04 report, the findings indicated that absenteeism is higher at primary level than at post-primary level. At primary level, the average number of days missed is 11 out of 183. At post-primary level, the average absence is 15 days out of 167 days. Absenteeism is higher in more disadvantaged areas. In the RAPID city areas, the average absence is 20 days. One in four post-primary students misses 20 days or more of school. In areas outside of RAPID, the average absence at post-primary level is 14 days and almost one in five miss 20 days or more. In RAPID city areas, the average absence at primary level is 17 days, while almost one in four pupils miss 20 days or more. In other areas, the average absence is ten days and one in ten pupils miss 20 days or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_7263">Average attendance in the most disadvantaged post-primary schools is 86.1%, or 23 days absence, and 94.6%, nine days absence, at the least disadvantaged schools, a difference of 8.5%. This difference is also evident in regard to the number of children who miss 20 days or more, 38% of students in the most disadvantaged schools and 8.5% in the least disadvantaged areas, a difference of 29.9%.</p>
            <p eId="para_7264">The Government has put in place a variety of measures to deal with the traditionally high levels of absence from school of children from disadvantaged areas. We set up the National Educational Welfare Board to monitor school attendance, help parents to get a school place for their child and run promotional campaigns on the importance of regular attendance. Working with parents to promote school attendance is also an important part of the work of the home-school-community liaison co-ordinators appointed to schools serving disadvantaged communities. Through the school completion programme we are providing increased resources for schools in disadvantaged areas to improve attendance and school completion rates by offering extra supports for their students. These include extra educational supports and services such as breakfast clubs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7265">Last May, my Department launched a new programme for educational inclusion, the DEIS initiative, under which even greater funding will be given to schools serving the most disadvantaged communities to help young people to do better at school. The process of identifying which schools will benefit from the new programme is now complete and those schools which will be receiving support under DEIS have now been contacted and invited to participate in the initiative.</p>

A large number of applications were received and assessed during the first year of this scheme.

            <p eId="para_7280">An application for additional classroom accommodation from the school referred to by the Deputy has been received in school planning section and is under consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_7281">In addition, the overall accommodation needs of the school are being examined to ensure that any capital funding being provided is appropriate to meet the school's long term accommodation needs. When a decision is made on the appropriate level of accommodation to be provided the application will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2006-10.</p>
            <p eId="para_7282">With regard to the pupil-teacher ratios, major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 5,000 additional primary teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.</p>
            <p eId="para_7283">Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil-teacher ratio in the history of the State. Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. Under the action plan for tackling disadvantage published in 2005, there will be a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. With more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place in this school year, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. It should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_7284">Recently I announced that I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year and the Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year. Accordingly, over the next two years, my Department will put 500 extra teachers into primary schools to reduce class size and to tackle disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_7285">The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_7286">The general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than those with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007-08 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. Officials of my Department are currently drawing up the revised staffing schedule necessary to achieve this. Schools will be asked to use the extra class teachers provided as a result of the revised schedule to provide for smaller classes in the junior grades.</p>
            <p eId="para_7287">In speaking about staffing in our schools, we have consistently said that priority would be given in the first instance to children in disadvantaged schools and those with special needs. We have done this and now, in line with the Government commitment, mainstream class sizes are also being reduced.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Miss de Valera)</from>
            <p eId="para_7289">The needs of the Traveller community are a high priority for my Department. My Department provides additional resources to enhance the education of Traveller children. In 2004-05, my Department spent more than €56 million on Traveller education over and above what is being provided through mainstream education. This expenditure makes special provision to enable members of the Traveller community to successfully access educational services. In summary, this provision includes 45 pre-schools for Travellers, more than 500 resource teachers for Travellers in primary schools, nearly 140 whole-time equivalent posts for Travellers in post primary schools, 40 visiting teachers for Travellers and enhanced capitation grants for Traveller pupils at primary and post primary level. In addition, there are 36 senior Traveller training centres located throughout the country which cater for the needs of Travellers aged 15 years and upwards who have left school early with no qualifications or minimal qualifications. The centres provide a programme of general education, vocational training, work experience as well as guidance, counselling, psychological services and child care services. Approximately 10% of students at these centres are from the settled community. Travellers may chose from mainstream literacy provision or they may attend Traveller specific literacy programmes which nineteen vocational education committees provide.</p>
            <p eId="para_7290">In 2002, the Department published two documents, Guidelines on Traveller Education in Primary Schools and Guidelines on Traveller Education in Second Level Schools. The guidelines highlight the Department's policy on integration, set out information on Traveller culture and provide advice on responding to the educational needs of the Traveller students. In May 2005, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment published the document Guidelines on Intercultural Education in Primary Schools. This publication, along with the guidelines on traveller education in primary and second level schools, provides information and seeks to increase and improve understanding of diversity. The NCCA is due to publish guidelines on intercultural education for post-primary schools this year. The gender equality unit in my Department is supporting Pavee Point with a research project on the development of appropriate mechanisms to monitor educational access, participation and outcomes by gender for Travellers and the further education section is funding Pavee Point, through the education equality initiative, for a project on parents and Traveller education.</p>
            <p eId="para_7291">The National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education, established in 2003, aims to facilitate increasing higher education participation by a number of target groups and the Traveller community is one of its target groups. I await the publication of a report that was prepared by my inspectorate to address the findings of a survey of Traveller education provision. The report is based on an extensive review of the participation and inclusion of Traveller pupils in 30 primary and 6 post-primary schools. The report will provide recommendations which will inform policies and provide strategies to facilitate schools in enhancing the education provision for Travellers at a national level. I expect to receive shortly a report on the recommendations for a five-year Traveller education strategy. The report will span the full spectrum of lifelong learning from pre-school to adult and further education and emphasise the important role that Traveller parents have in their own education and that of their children. The report is in the final stages of preparation and has had as one of the core principles guiding its authors the notion of inclusion. The two reports to which I have referred will provide me with advice and guidance on how best to continue to cater and improve the education provision for the Traveller community.</p>

The block grant includes payments in respect of capitation and these schools also qualify for payment of such grants as the transition year support grant and secretarial and caretaking grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_7296">Fee-charging schools not embraced by the block grant do not qualify for payment of capitation or related supports.

            <p eId="para_7325">In the White Paper on defence, the Government decided that the Naval Service will be developed around the provision of an eight-ship flotilla. In recent years, two new ships have been delivered to the Naval Service and the service is operating with the recommended eight ships. The total cost of the two ships was €50 million. Both ships have proved to be tremendous assets to the Naval Service in carrying out its various day to day roles. There is a continuous process of refurbishment of the current fleet. Through a combination of improved support, operational systems, equipment and ongoing maintenance, the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a very high level.</p>
            <p eId="para_7326">The replacement programme for Naval Service vessels is under continuous review. As a general guide, the objective is to replace vessels after approximately 30 years service. On this basis, two vessels are due for replacement in the period 2007 to 2009. The issue is currently under examination and I expect it to be submitted to me for decision later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_7328">Entry to the Naval Service is either through the cadetship competition, general service enlistment or direct entry competitions which are held form time to time to fill vacancies in specialist appointments. A specified maximum upper age limit applies to each entry stream. For the cadetship competition the upper age limit is under 28 years of age on 1 October in the competition year and for general service enlistment it is under 27 years of age on the date of enlistment. As these age requirements are of general application exceptions cannot be made in individual cases. The cadetship competition 2006 has been advertised and the closing date for receipt of applications in writing or on line is not later than 28 February, 2006. General service enlistment applications are accepted on an ongoing basis for enlistment in the Naval Service. From time to time, direct entry competitions are held to fill vacancies in watchkeeping officer and engineer officer appointments in the Naval Service. Advertisements for such competitions are usually placed in the national press. However, there are no such competitions at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_7395">In December 2005, the Government launched a new Housing Policy Framework: Building Sustainable Communities, which outlines key principles underpinning housing policy and investment over coming years. Substantial increased investment in social and affordable housing is outlined in the framework. This will allow for some 23,000 new social homes to be commenced between 2006 and 2008 and some 15,000 affordable homes to be delivered. In total, some 50,000 households will benefit over the coming three years from an Exchequer capital investment package of close to €4 billion. Allied to this, a package of reforms is proposed to improve equity, efficiency and effectiveness. The focus is on improving community participation, improving services to ensure personal choice, autonomy and responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_7396">Given the substantial funding available, I have urged local authorities, including Sligo Borough Council, to accelerate progress on the implementation of their housing programmes in order to commence construction and secure completion on as many social housing schemes as possible in 2006. In addition, the council has a number of refurbishment projects currently under way or due to commence in estates, including St. Edward's Terrace, Brigid's Terrace-Jinks Avenue, St. Joseph's Terrace, Garravogue Villas and Cranmore.</p>

The action plan on social and affordable housing for 2004-2008 for County Mayo details the numbers, but not the location, of local authority vacant houses in the four authorities in the county. It is the responsibility of the local authorities concerned to ensure that their houses are relet to households on their waiting lists as quickly as possible after they are vacated. Some houses may require refurbishment before they are relet and this is a matter for individual authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_7401">My Department provides capital funding, subject to conditions, to local authorities for the refurbishment of houses that have remained vacant for periods longer than six months and require major refurbishment.

            <p eId="para_7417">The EU Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, WEEE, required each member state to introduce regulations providing for a producer funded take-back scheme for consumers of end-of-life equipment from 13 August 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_7418">To come within the scope of the WEEE directive, items of electrical and electronic equipment must be dependent on electric currents or electromagnetic fields in order to work properly and designed for use with a voltage rating not exceeding 1,000 volts for alternating current, AC, and 1,500 volts for direct current, DC. The WEEE directive specifically excludes equipment which is part of another type of equipment that does not fall within the scope of the directive, e.g., car radios; equipment which is connected with the protection of the essential interests of the security of member states, arms, munitions and war material; luminaires in households, e.g., light stands; filament bulbs; large-scale stationary industrial tools; and all implanted and infected products in medical devices. The EU Commission has published a guidance document on the criteria for determining whether a product falls within the scope of the WEEE directive, a copy of which is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie. There are no exemptions available to small business operators as there are no <i>de minimis</i> provisions in the WEEE directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_7419">The WEEE scheme has now been operating for six months and the real benefits of this new system for consumers and the environment are becoming apparent. WEEE is now being collected from over 180 collection points nationwide. Early indications are that significant quantities of this waste type are being returned for recycling. In the first 12 weeks alone 4,800 tonnes, equivalent to an annual rate of almost 20,000 tonnes, of household WEEE was collected. This points to a fourfold increase in the recycling of household WEEE as 5,510 tonnes of this waste type was recovered in 2004 and indicates widespread public support for the implementation of the directive.</p>

            <p eId="para_7421">I am advised that it has been the practice since 1968 to limit development in areas known as "red zones" around the three State airports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon, for reasons both of air navigation safety and public safety. In 2000, my Department and the Department of Transport jointly commissioned Environment Resource Management to review the specific issue of addressing public safety on the ground around the major airports, based on current scientific practice. In assessing this matter, ERM used recent advances in risk modelling techniques which made it possible to quantify the risks to the public on the ground from aircraft crashes.</p>
            <p eId="para_7422">The recommendations of ERM were that the use of the "red zones" should be discontinued for public safety purposes. Public safety zones should instead be introduced, of a different size and shape to "red zones", and should have varying levels or development restrictions within them, depending on what type of development is proposed at different points. It will be important for example to be able to restrict building heights near runways to ensure that obstacle clearance surfaces for departing and arriving aircraft are maintained, in line with the State's obligations under the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation of 1944. Public safety zones would also be designed to protect the public on the ground from the small but real possibility that an aircraft might crash in a populated area and to ensure, as far as possible, that there are not large concentrations of people continually in the areas most at risk from crashes.</p>
            <p eId="para_7423">In January 2005, the Government approved the drawing up of guidelines by my Department to be issued to planning authorities, based on ERM's report. Draft guidelines are being finalised in my Department and will be issued for public consultation shortly.</p>

Following submission and approval of the contract documents, the council will be in a position to invite tenders for the construction of the scheme.</p>
