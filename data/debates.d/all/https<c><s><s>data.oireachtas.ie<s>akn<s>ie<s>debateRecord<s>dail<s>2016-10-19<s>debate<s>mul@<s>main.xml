          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">Cystic fibrosis, CF, is a very debilitating condition. Ireland has the largest cohort <i>per capita</i> of population of people with CF. Consistent research has helped improve the quality of life and extend the lives of people with CF. Given that we have the largest cohort <i>per capita</i> of population of people with CF, there is an onus on this country to be in the vanguard in terms of research and new technology in respect of extending life and improving the quality of life of people with CF. Orkambi is the first drug to impact on the underlying cause of CF for up to 50% of people with the condition in Ireland. It has been shown to produce both a reduction in the worsening of CF requiring hospital admissions and a sustained increase in lung function and weight, which is an important issue in the context of CF care. Orkambi has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US and could apply to approximately 50% of people with CF in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> A wonderful article written by Orla Tinsley, a CF patient, that appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 2 June 2016 details the new life Orkambi has meant for her and those with compassionate access to the drug via the relevant pharmaceutical company. It is worth reading the article to get a sense from somebody who has lived with this condition all her life and who has fought all her life to try to improve quality of life for people with CF. Orkambi has transformed her existence. Ms Tinsley gave an interview on "Today with Sean O'Rourke" some time back to talk about the impact of the drug on her. People such as Jillian McNulty have testified to the positive impact a drug such as Orkambi can have on CF sufferers. Orla Tinsley made the point in respect of one of her friends who has compassionate access to the drug that "Removal of Orkambi is a catapult towards death for her."</p>
          <p eId="para_3">This is what it is like in the CF community for those who are taking Orkambi. Others have been waiting for approximately two years since the drug was first approved to gain access to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> It is not just a Government issue. It is also an issue for the pharmaceutical companies. The pharmacoeconomic unit rejected it in the context of the cost submitted by the company. Negotiations between Government agencies and the company have been going on for a considerable length of time. Is the Government still committed to giving CF patients access to Orkambi? As I have asked before, is it not time for the Government to establish a separate fund from the health budget in which we could continuously invest to provide for new technologies and drugs such as this so we can be at the vanguard of new developments in medications and drug therapies?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_2">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T12:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_5">The Deputy's point is best addressed by people who have CF and have to contend with it. The situation has improved for a great number of CF sufferers compared to years ago. After many years of tribulation, there have been formal openings of a number of CF units around the country. From talking to patients who have the use of them, I know provisions such as the recirculation of clean air mean so much to their lives. As the Deputy pointed out, it used to be that the Government would accept or reject the prices put forward by pharmaceutical companies. Now, the decision is based on a clinical assessment of the effective outcome of treating a patient with a particular drug. This is based on the assessment of the improved quality of life for the patient, depending on the nature of the treatment they receive. This also applies to other drugs for other ailments. The Government, the Department of Health, the Minister and the HSE are committed to continually improving the situation for CF sufferers and this is evident in the programme for Government. The evidence is there before our eyes in better facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> A process is taking place arising from the clinical assessment of the improved quality of life for CF sufferers who take Orkambi. This means meetings between the HSE, the pharmaceutical company and the clinicians involved. I hope an outcome can be arrived at, as has happened in a number of other cases in which the original price set by pharmaceutical companies was reduced to a level where the clinical assessment was that it was worth the cost in terms of the improved quality of life it could give. These are clinical assessments, as the Deputy is aware. I will have the Minister for Health give me an update on the progress on those meetings on appeal to see if Orkambi can be made available at a price that would justify a clinical assessment of it improving the quality of life for people. It is a very sensitive and important question.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T12:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_7">It is a life and death issue and it is a fundamental imperative that we do everything we possibly can to improve the quality of life and extend the life of those with CF. There is no doubting the health benefits to be derived from Orkambi. In the assessment it was rejected "at submitted cost"; in other words, it was regarded as too expensive. The benefits are well reported not just by those in the clinical trial, but objectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">There is a cost issue and our policy across this area is somewhat flawed. Regardless of whether we like it, the costs keep interrupting our process. There was a cost element with other drugs that have recently been approved. Until recently, new drugs and therapies had to be approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> In the final paragraph of her article in <i>The Irish Times </i>Orla Tinsley wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10">I am so far away from the constant daily struggle I was once confined by that this thought is newly harrowing. [She is in a better space, having had access to the drug in the United States.] Generations need not suffer because a drug company and a government cannot negotiate a real solution. There must be a price reduction. The results of the Orkambi trial were released two years ago this month. [This was last June.] That's two years the 505 Irish people suitable for Orkambi have been waiting to sail on to that new chapter of their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I respectfully suggest that the process has dragged on for far too long. There needs to be a resolution, an impetus and an injection of urgency in order to get this sorted.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_12">I thank the Deputy. Obviously, the situation here, as I said, is not a political decision any more. I recall the interview given on the national news by the specialist involved. On 1 June, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCP, recommended that Orkambi for treating cystic fibrosis should not be reimbursed by the HSE. As to the prices submitted by the pharmaceutical company, the cost was €160,000 per patient per year. The NCP indicated that the price would have to be below €30,000 per patient per year to be cost-effective. That is a clinical assessment, not a political one. As Professor Michael Barry stated in his recent expert opinion on the evidence submitted by the manufacturer, the latter got it wrong when it came to pricing. Deputy Martin and I know that the level of cost submitted by some pharmaceutical companies is quite astronomical in the case of certain drugs. Drugs require a clinical assessment as to whether their use is justified.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> The NCP estimates that the five-year gross budget impact of Orkambi is more than €390 million and notes the significant opportunity cost of reimbursing the drug as being two thirds of the cost of the children's hospital for one drug alone. If the clinical professor says that the pharmaceutical company got it wrong, is it not important that we should follow through with meetings with those representatives to see can that be reduced? It is not the end of the process and I hope that the HSE will continue to work on price negotiations on Orkambi.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> The Deputy made one other point about having a ring-fenced structure for dealing with new drugs that come on the market, which they do every year. That is something that I would be prepared to look at in conjunction with the other parties.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_5">

          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_16">On Sunday, Dr. Fergal Hickey, an emergency consultant at Sligo University Hospital, stated that up to 350 patients are dying each year as a result of hospital overcrowding and that delays in securing intensive care beds for patients are increasing the risk of patient mortality. As winter approaches, the number of patients on emergency department trolleys is increasing once again. I do not have the figures for today but 450 patients were waiting for beds yesterday. Once again, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda had one of the highest numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> This morning, cardiologists at the Mater hospital serving adult patients with congenital heart defects warned that the service was being stretched to a critical point. The two consultants working in the service stated that they were dealing with approximately 4,000 patients and had insufficient resources, staffing and laboratory access. One of the consultants, Professor Kevin Walsh, told "Morning Ireland" that the service's lack of resources was putting lives at risk. He stated that the service should have four full-time consultants and five full-time nurses. However, it has just two part-time consultants and two nurses. That is for almost 4,000 patients, with 400 accessing the service year on year. There is also a shortage of secretarial and administrative support. The Taoiseach will agree that this situation is shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> Last week, Ministers made grand claims about an increase in the budget for the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">The reality is these pronouncements were deceptive and grossly exaggerated. The bulk of the increase in funding is required simply to stand still. It will have little impact on waiting lists, the trolley crisis and inadequately resourced services. The Taoiseach knows that when the money required to cover pay restoration, estimated at €97 million, and demographics, estimated at approximately €119 million, is stripped away, the budget increase for health shrinks to just €147 million. I am sure the Taoiseach will acknowledge this as grossly insufficient. Sinn Féin's alternative budget proposed an additional €465 million investment in health over and above payments for demographics and the Lansdowne Road agreement. Our budget is fully costed.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> Will the Taoiseach commit to going back to the drawing board to ensure services such as the acute cardiology unit in the Mater can be adequately resourced? Will he take on board what hospital consultants like Dr. Hickey and Professor Walsh are saying?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_7">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T12:15:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_21">I thank the Deputy for his questions. I do not propose to go back to the drawing board but I take a genuine interest in the matter raised by the Deputy. The detail available on the Department of Health website gives a clear understanding, the facts and figures for the budget allocation for 2017 as being the highest ever allocated to the health portfolio. It is an increase of over €500 million to the HSE this year. This has been gone through in great detail both by the HSE and by the Department of Health and its Minister. It is there for all to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> I listened this morning with interest to the interview with Professor Walsh, who is clearly a very learned man in his profession. Some €900 million more was provided this year, for 2017, when compared with last year. Professor Walsh spoke very clearly about the situation In the national adult congenital centre at the Mater hospital. It is because of the success of the interventions in paediatric services that the numbers of young people requiring the service is growing. It is a challenge of success. The survival rate for paediatric cases, like young Laura Clifford from Sligo, who spoke so well this morning, was 10% but it has now reached 90%, which is of course something that everybody would support. That means an increase in survivors will require a greater need from adult services.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> The position spoken of is a highly specialist field. That post is to be divided between the children's hospital in Crumlin and the Mater in order to support the transition from paediatric care to adult care. The money is available for the post. This was advertised in terms of an additional cardiologist post in 2012 and again in 2015 but no application was received for the job. I am not sure if that is because of the range of facilities, remuneration, the structure of the job or whatever else. These jobs are advertised on a worldwide basis. Given the success rate increase from 10% to 90%, and given that the money is there to fill the position, there were no applications. In order for the post to be filled, it is being restructured across both the Mater and Crumlin hospitals and it will be readvertised shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> In light of the development of an all-island congenital heart disease network, which the Minister, Deputy Harris, signed recently, children from Northern Ireland will be able to come to Crumlin hospital for very specialist heart surgery. It is expected that a greater pool of potential candidates will now be available for the post and recruitment could well be successful. The money is in place to provide for the cardiologist to be appointed. I hope it happens.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T12:15:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_25">The Taoiseach states he does not intend going back to the drawing board, which is unacceptable. What are the 350 patients dying each year because of overcrowding to do? Are they to just die? What about the 4,000 patients who have two part-time consultants and two nurses? Do they just have to put up with it? Is that the way it is?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_9">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T12:15:00+01:00"/></from>

        <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_27">The Taoiseach cannot pretend that an expenditure of €147 million will solve the crisis in our health service. These words are not coming from me but from the people working in the services, including in one case - and by the Taoiseach's own acknowledgement - a very learned person. The consultants running the health service say they are dealing with an unsustainable burden caused by poor resources. When resources are not provided, services cannot deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> In fairness to the health service, we know that when resources are provided, it does deliver. For the children with congenital heart defects who attend the paediatric unit in Crumlin children's hospital, for example, there is a 95% patient success rate. That particular service is considered to be world class, which is the very least our citizens deserve in all aspects of health care. They do not deserve to have their lives put at risk. They have an entitlement to a wraparound public health services that looks after everyone from cradle to grave. Does the Taoiseach agree that he has failed to provide such a service because his vision is for a privatised, as opposed to a public, health system?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_11">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_29">The Deputy's final comment is completely false and without any foundation. There are now 600 more consultants in the health service than was the case in 2007 and a bed capacity review is being conducted by the Minister for Health. This is not just about acute hospitals, however. It is also about primary care, new GP contracts, home-care services and packages and so on. It is not all about money either, but €14.6 billion is a very substantial budget with which to attempt to deal with the many challenges in the health care area. Of course problems of a cyclical nature of one sort or another will arise, whether weather-related, epidemics or whatever. The Minister for Health has taken responsibility for the Vote. It is a very challenging position but that €14.6 billion is a very substantial allocation to allow us to proceed with the review that is being carried out in terms of output and the development of the delivery of effective services for all patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> I reiterate that the vacancy at the Mater hospital is one that is split between itself and Crumlin. The money is in position for a consultant cardiologist. It is a worldwide position and if anybody out there is interested in applying to the Mater, let he or she do so. There is a vacancy there and money to pay the person who fills it.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_31">Last week, the Government published a budget that includes tax cuts for landlords, an increase in the threshold for the rent a room scheme and the introduction of a first-time buyer's scheme that has been widely criticised for increasing prices and delivering no meaningful benefit for those at whom it is aimed. The Government managed to introduce those measures while doing nothing for those who rent their homes. New figures published yesterday suggest that the cost of renting a home in Ireland will rise by 25% in the next two years. That is a staggering figure. This projection will alarm hundreds of thousands of people who rent their homes and who have already faced enormous increases in the rents demanded of them. At this point, people deserve assurance from Government that it is aware of their predicament and envisages concrete actions to control rents.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> My colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has published our party's Social and Affordable Housing Bill, which contains many measures that will be welcomed by Members on all sides of the House. It includes a proposal for a model of rent control to limit increases to changes in the consumer price index.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">The Taoiseach and I had many conversations when we were in government concerning Fine Gael's decision to block the idea of rent control. In view of the astonishing figures published this morning, I hope the Taoiseach will change his view and accept this is a necessary proposal. The introduction of some model of rent control is now imperative.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">The budget dealt with a number of issues in this element of the housing sector. It is important that landlords who have property to let are in a position to do that. It is also important that we have a comprehensive rental strategy. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is committed to publishing and bringing in such a strategy before the end of this year. I commend Deputy Jan O'Sullivan on producing a Bill in this area. I advise her to talk to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, because some elements of her Bill may be acceptable to him. We want to have a comprehensive rental strategy. It will be produced here before the end of the year. As Deputy Howlin is aware, the Government is focused on supply in its efforts to deal with the question of assistance for first-time buyers of new houses. We have deliberately focused on increasing housing supply over a three-year period. I know there has been some discussion or comment about the headroom given beyond the €400,000 limit, up to €600,000. There can be further discussions on that during the Committee Stage debate on the forthcoming finance Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> The Minister for Finance proposed a number of small changes in this regard when he presented the Bill yesterday. Obviously, he is prepared to discuss those changes. We are focused on increasing supply because the more houses there are, the better the opportunity for people to get affordable houses. The programme being advanced by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, aims to deliver 41,000 social housing units over the period. I welcome the Bill proposed by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and I congratulate her on it. I advise her to sit down with the Minister and his officials because it may well be that the element of rent she has referred to in her Bill can be reflected in some way in the comprehensive strategy being adopted by the Minister. Deputy Howlin is well aware that his colleague, the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, had clear views on rent. I note how the Deputy's language has changed from saying that the Fine Gael Party blocked everything to prevent the Labour Party from getting on with its business or whatever else.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">The Government appears to want people to save up for homes, but they cannot do so if rents are increasing by 25%. There is no point in putting money into the rent supplement or housing assistance payment schemes, as the Government has done, if there are no measures to control the surge in rents. All the Government is doing is putting State money directly into the hands of landlords. The inescapable reality is that people's salaries are not back to 2007 levels, but rents are now surging beyond 2007 levels. The Government must act now. I do not think it can leave it to the marketplace alone. When will the comprehensive strategy that was mentioned by the Taoiseach be published? Can we have a date for that? Will the Government include in the strategy legislation to create rent certainty into the future?</p>

          <p eId="para_42">The previous Government was very clear in its attitude to supporting people who rent. Many thousands of families benefited from the introduction of the housing assistance payment scheme and the increase in rent supplement. I do not have an actual date for the publication of the comprehensive rental strategy that the Minister will produce. I assure Deputy Howlin that he is committed to bringing it in before the end of this session. I am sure he will do that. The Deputy said that the Government needs to act now. That is what the Government is doing with the introduction of the most comprehensive housing programme in the history of the State and the provision of money to back it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_51">Up to yesterday, 148 of our fellow citizens were killed on the roads. That represents an increase of 25 on last year. Of course, the 148 families of these victims are totally devastated. In communities in virtually every constituency, people are being devastated by the ongoing carnage. Since the Taoiseach came to office in March 2011, approximately 1,000 people have died on our roads and perhaps 15,000 have been seriously injured. The chairperson of the Road Safety Authority, our former Dáil colleague, Liz O'Donnell, has drawn attention once again to the fact that under this Taoiseach, successive Administrations have slashed the size of the Garda traffic corps by half, from approximately 1,200 around the time of the crash down to barely 700 now.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> An additional €85 million is included in the budget as part of the Government's plan for the Garda Síochána to have 15,000 members - and 21,000 staff in the service altogether - by 2021. Will the Government bring the strength of the Garda traffic corps back up to what it was in the past? At one stage, we succeeded in halving the number of road traffic deaths from approximately 400 per year to in the region of 200.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> My next question relates to the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Justice and Equality. There are, as two Ministers sitting near the Taoiseach who have had responsibility in this area previously are aware, difficulties with traffic law. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport makes policy but the Department of Justice and Equality has to implement it. We get many gaps and failures in the Courts Service and the Department of Justice and Equality. I wish to draw the attention of the Taoiseach to one or two of these, in particular section 22 of the Road Traffic Act 2002. This provision makes it an offence not to present a licence in court if requested to do so. Yet, questions answered at the instigation of the outstanding PARC Road Safety Group in 2014 and 2015 suggest that up to 70% of people coming to court did not present their licences. The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, undertook to take action on this matter. However, when the first group of 21 such prosecutions were brought forward last November, Judge Marie Keane struck them down. For the past year, the Tánaiste has been in consultation with the Garda Commissioner and there has been consultation between the Departments of Justice and Equality and Transport, Tourism and Sport but nothing has been done. As the two former Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport sitting near the Taoiseach are aware, section 44 of the 2010 Act has not yet been brought into force, although it is six or seven years since the legislation was passed. This section relates to the third payment option.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> There are many anomalies and there has been a failure to co-ordinate between the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Justice and Equality. The Courts Service, in particular, needs to be upgraded. The Government only provided approximately €4 million for the upgrading of the information technology systems of the Courts Service. Yet, there is an extraordinary dearth of information going from the Courts Service to the Road Safety Authority and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">Deputy Broughan referred to traffic accidents and deaths. These are always tragic and so sad. Despite every encouragement we can provide and every incentive or initiative we can put in place, accidents will continue to happen. We regret the loss of life in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> It is a matter for the Commissioner to determine the allocation of gardaí to the various sections of the Garda, including the traffic corps. That is a matter of day-to-day management. It was a matter of public politics for the Government to make a decision to reopen the training college in Templemore and increase the level of induction thereto. A total of 800 gardaí will now be trained per year. It is a matter for the Government to make a political decision to bring the Garda strength to 15,000. An extra 4,000 civilian staff by 2021 and an extra 2,000 in Garda Reserve numbers will bring the force up to that level. Obviously, budgetary requirements are a factor and these are determined by the allocations to the various sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> I am unsure of the position with regard to the issues relating to section 22.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">Technology has advanced to a stage where if an arrest is made or somebody is apprehended, it will indicate whether there is a driving licence or insurance or charges pending or whatever. These matters must be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> I do not know the detailed answer to the two questions the Deputy raised in respect of section 22 and section 44 but I will ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to respond to Deputy Broughan in respect of those. </p>

          <p eId="para_60">I welcome the Taoiseach’s answer. We have heard often from people in the Road Safety Authority, RSA, about the absolute necessity for additional invigilation. The chairperson of the RSA referred to the European driver attitudes survey which showed that people in this country are half as likely to be stopped in a mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, check, now a mandatory intoxicant testing, MIT, check as people in the rest of Europe. This is an operational matter for the Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> I commend the Commissioner on waiving fees for documents for families of victims of road traffic crashes. Those fees were incredibly high. Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner to bring the traffic corps back up to strength? There is a strong case for perhaps making it a distinct unit with a separate command within An Garda Síochána. Will he ask the Department of Justice and Equality, which has been dragging its heels, and the Courts Service, about IT systems and the transfer of information to the RSA and to bring in the legislation we need? The section 44 I referred to is on the clár. It is the Courts Bill and if we wanted to we could have it passed before Christmas. </p>

          <p eId="para_62">Deputy Broughan raises an interesting point. I am quite sure if he spoke to the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister for Justice and Equality would be very happy to attend a meeting of the committee and discuss the issues there. The capital expenditure made available by the Government over recent years has been of great assistance in getting new motorbikes and patrol cars to replace the old vehicles. I also see increased evidence of the speed vans in different locations around the country which are having an impact in making people aware that their speeds are being monitored and there are consequences. The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality would be happy to discuss the allocations to the various sectors of the Garda with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport but it is a decision for the Commissioner. Government will continue to do its best in respect of supplying facilities to the gardaí so that they can carry out their duties in a professional and efficient manner with the best of up to date standards.</p>

At Question Time yesterday, Deputy Brown asked the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for mental health, Deputy MacEntee, about the allocation to mental health for 2017. It is a classic case of the rhetoric being good, of language camouflaging the reality, because to fully implement A Vision for Change would cost €35 million per annum but it has been some time since we have had an update on A Vision for Change. Deputy Brown was told yesterday that only €15 million will be spent in 2017 on A Vision for Change. I put it to the Taoiseach------</p>

          <p eId="para_82"> There is precious little evidence of the Government providing a safe haven in recent years despite the huge crisis for refugees from the Middle East and north Africa fleeing war, famine and poverty. Our Naval Service personnel have done a commendable job. They have saved thousands of lives, but the Government has not matched that. Last year, it committed to accepting 4,000 refugees, which is a very small number relative to the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe that is ongoing, but it failed to reach this number.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">Críochnóidh mé anois, a Cheann Comhairle. Fewer than 1,000 have been resettled. Will the Taoiseach indicate when he expects the 4,000 target to be reached, and has the Government discussed how the process of resettlement can be speeded up and whether additional numbers will be taken in the light of the worsening conflict in Syria?</p>

          <p eId="para_85">The Minister, Deputy Stanton, has made substantial progress in terms of resettlement and relocation. I can give Deputy Adams the exact numbers that have arrived here and that are in transit later today. The Deputy will understand, in terms of the people found in the container in Wexford, which speaks for itself, the lengths to which those who want to send them here will go. Again, I commend the Naval Service personnel for the 13,000 people they have pulled from the Mediterranean Sea. I believe the experiences of some of the naval personnel in terms of injuries, beatings and sad cases are horrific. That is the reason that, while we are not part of the protocol, we send our Naval Service vessels to the region to assist in that humanitarian mission. I will have the exact figures supplied to Deputy Adams. The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, gave them to me yesterday but, unfortunately, I cannot recall them now.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">As my party leader stated in his question, everybody in this House wants to be able to contribute to having their ideas put forward with regard to the crisis in housing supply and also affordability of rents. The housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill is on the list of Bills to be published in this session. It contains a number of measures, although nothing I can see, in the summary anyway, with regard to controlling rents. The provision that has been highlighted is on fast-tracking planning for large developments about which concerns had been raised in terms of bypassing the local voice and also the capacity of An Bord Pleanála to deal with these issues. In fact, with regard to this proposal, it is possible we would have a slowing down rather than a speeding up of the process. What is the timetable with regard to that Bill?</p>

          <p eId="para_88">I clearly recall a commitment in the programme for Government on the introduction of a pilot scheme for the reopening of six Garda stations. The only conversation I have heard was about Stepaside in Dublin, which has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">I certainly hope the Government is not sidestepping this issue because it is a commitment into which it entered. Where does this stand? Do we need to introduce legislation? I spoke to my constituency colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, about one Garda station that was closed some years ago under a different Commissioner. It is on a national primary route - the N5, a seriously busy route - in the village of Tarmonbarry, through which the River Shannon runs and which the Taoiseach travels through on a weekly basis. It is really important that the six Garda stations are reopened under the pilot scheme that was promised in the programme for Government.</p>

Does the Taoiseach intend to stand over and implement the proposed further victimisation of, and discrimination against, young unemployed people, especially those under 25 who, instead of getting the fiver promised to everybody will get, as detailed in the budget documentation, €2.70? They are expected to live on €102.70 per week while the Taoiseach lives on €3,500 per week. This is a driving factor in youth homelessness and 16% of young people currently face unemployment.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">My colleague and Fianna Fáil spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, raised the issue of slurry spreading yesterday morning. The Taoiseach said that individual cases could be looked at and facilitated, particularly in areas where conditions had been very severe. Yesterday, a memo was sent by the Department to all county councils in the country reminding them that the closed season for slurry spreading commenced last Saturday, 15 October, and that, contrary to some localised public commentary, the Minister had not announced any extensions of the spreading period or any individualised exemptions. It said that it had come to the Department's attention that inquiries from farmers in relation to an extension had been received by some district veterinary officers and that, as the responsible authority, any such queries should be forwarded to the relevant local authority for attention. It went on to request that this e-mail be brought to the attention of any staff that might be dealing with this matter.</p>

That was reiterated in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport document.

The reason for the allocation for 2017 is based on what can be spent. We have had a situation where over the past 20 years the Government made allocations every couple of years for sports capital grants, many of which were not drawn down for three or four years after the announcements were made. What the Government is doing here is providing a multi-annual budget envelope where it can make allocations that can and will be drawn down. In other words, the money will be spent and not be lying there for three or four years while applications are objected to or whatever.</p>

According to communication with parents who were on to me this morning, they will not have an assessment until the middle of 2017 at the earliest. It is a disgraceful situation. Is the Government standing over section 8(5) of the 2005 Act or will it deliberately allow the services of the State to flout that Act and not have the assessment for children that is so badly needed, particularly for those on the autism spectrum and in the case of many other disabilities?</p>

I invited representatives of all parties to meet me in recent months to initiate a review. The previous review was carried out two years ago and it ends next September. We have received submissions from representatives of all parties. The review is being collated at present and it will be ready in the next couple of weeks. I will issue the findings of the review to each party, which can come back again to me on the basis of what we discussed. I believe Deputy Nolan was at the meeting where the matter was discussed.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">On Friday we will have the publication of the Finance Bill which will give effect to some of the Government's polices announced on budget day. When will the Government heed expert advice and evidence-based policy? Since budget day we have seen the price of new houses in certain estates soar by €45,000. We are informed by Daft that as a result of the budget announcement on Tuesday, traffic on its website for new homes increased by 130%, yet there are no new homes. What we have now is increased demand as a result of the Government's idiotic policy, which has been taken from Fianna Fáil's proposal for twice the amount of money for new homes. What is happening is a disgrace and the Government needs to stop it now.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is carrying out a review of the motor insurance industry. A very serious matter has come to my attention regarding to a company called Setanta that has gone into liquidation. This company was registered in Malta but never carried out any business there. It came into this country and, under EU regulations, was allowed to trade here. The amount in outstanding claims is almost €90 million and it is being proposed that this should be taken from the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland fund, which was set up to protect those who were injured by people who had no insurance. The raiding of this fund is outrageous. I ask the Taoiseach that before the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, produces his report, the House should engage in a full debate about what is happening in the motor insurance industry.</p>

The latter is a development I support but An Bord Pleanála has put in night-flight and noise-related restrictions. Does the Government plan to simply transpose the regulation by way of statutory instrument or will it bring it forward by primary legislation?

          <p eId="para_145">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_146">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> On behalf of my Labour Party colleagues, I seek leave to introduce the Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill 2016. The Bill has been drafted to bring much-needed regulation to rogue crisis pregnancy agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Some years ago, a young Labour Party activist, Sinead Ahern, was one of a small number of brave women who went undercover to determine the true extent of what is happening in these rogue, so-called counselling agencies. The issue was highlighted once more recently following similar brave undercover work carried out by two young journalists, Ellen Coyne and Catherine Sanz of <i>The Times</i>. In the best tradition of activism and investigative journalism, the work done by these young women has forced all of us to examine an area we have ignored for too long. What their experience has revealed is shocking. While the debate around the repeal of the eighth amendment begins in communities across Ireland, women are currently being lied to in the most grotesque fashion at a time of exceptional vulnerability for them. Women in crisis pregnancy situations are being told, according to the direct evidence of the women who attended these agencies undercover, that abortion increases the risk of breast cancer or that women who have had abortions will later abuse their children. This behaviour is an appalling abuse of a position of trust and power at a time of great vulnerability for women and it must be brought to an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> The right to information is a right Irish people voted on in a referendum on a constitutional amendment. It is now guaranteed in our Constitution. As it happens, I was Minister for Health when drafting of the relevant legislation began and our colleague, Deputy Noonan, was the Minister who brought it to the House. None of us could have imagined that 20 years later there would still be agencies operating in a manner that clearly does not give women the accurate, compassionate and true information they require and to which the law and Constitution of the State have determined they are entitled. Enough is enough. We are introducing this Bill to require that those who provide counselling services to women experiencing crisis pregnancies be registered and regulated. It is no different from people giving advice on a range of other medical issues. We will press this legislation as expeditiously as possible through the House and, hopefully, the Seanad. I seek the support of all parties to achieve that objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> It is no longer tenable to stand over a situation where dieticians or opticians must be regulated but those who counsel women at such vulnerable times are not. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, appears to agree that action is required and I hope the Government will support the legislation. Indeed, I hope all parties will. The Bill simply adds crisis pregnancy counsellors to the list of professions regulated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act. I thank the Irish Family Planning Association for its help in confirming the wording of the Bill. If enacted, this will be a real step forward in ensuring that women have access to true and accurate information. However, legislation will not be the end of the road. We will have to be determined on this issue and continue to press for progress in the months ahead. These agencies are abusing a position of power. It is time we in this House collectively put a stop to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_156">Last July, the Government launched a major initiative for the Dublin north-east inner city with the establishment of a ministerial task force to oversee the long-term social and economic regeneration of the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_157"> To support the work of the ministerial task force, Mr. Kieran Mulvey was appointed to engage with the local community groups, representatives and other interests and to report back by November with specific recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_158"> The terms of reference for this work were also published in July and these include making recommendations on specific measures to support the long-term economic and social regeneration of the area, including in the areas of: community safety and policing; early intervention programmes for children; education and training; employment opportunities; improving the physical environment; housing; tackling the impact of drugs; and community development, including family, youth and recreational activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">Part of the work involves reviewing and making recommendations on structures and procedures to ensure better co-ordination of statutory and non-statutory programmes in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_160"> It will also be important to identify some indicators of economic and social development which can be used to track progress over a ten-year period. A number of short-term measures were also announced to help the community address some of the immediate challenges facing it. The ministerial task force, which I chair, is due to meet again next week and will be briefed by Mr. Mulvey on his work to date. I understand he is concluding his initial phase of work which has involved many meetings with people in the area, including community groups, residents, businesses, public representatives and public agencies. He has invited groups and individuals to make short submissions, which he is now receiving. He remains on track to submit his report by the end of November.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_118">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_161">The Taoiseach will recall that prior to the establishment of the task force, I told him that not only were older people very nervous and frightened about what was happening in the north inner city, many children were very frightened as well and were asking their parents to explain what was going on. The Taoiseach pointed out a number of issues at the heart of the difficulties faced by the community, particularly the development of a strong and localised community police force. In the north inner city, it has become very common to see armed police units carrying out checks on motorists and travellers going up and down the different roads and entrances. The feud between a number of criminal elements is, unfortunately, still ongoing. I am not aware that any people have been apprehended in respect of the four murders that have taken place in the area. I know that families and distant relatives of people on both sides are terrified about what will happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_162"> In the context of the proposed Garda strike, does the Taoiseach have a proposal to ensure people in the north inner city are safe given the extreme breakdown of law and order the feud has involved and the fact that people are very frightened? There were many very good proposals and work was done to strengthen community policing. The Taoiseach might let us know how many additional gardaí have been allocated to the north city centre since the development of the task force. As the Taoiseach noted, there is an ongoing, pervasive and very serious drug problem that is a major contributor to gangland crime and the difficulties in many people's lives. It affects not just users but their families who are also affected by pressure for payments that are alleged to be related to drug debts. In the context of this very vulnerable area and the proposed Garda strike involving the withdrawal of services, what proposals does the Taoiseach have to ensure not just adults but children can feel safe? The Taoiseach has taken on the leadership of this. Has consideration been given to a policing plan for the area? Will the Taoiseach tell us what additional Garda resources have been given to the area? We hope the Garda strike does not happen but if it takes place, which would involve gardaí of different ranks withdrawing their labour, what resourcing is proposed?</p>

            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_163">The creation of this task force was a proposal from Deputy McDonald. When she put the proposal, she was very specific and clued in about the need to involve the local community because the local community is central to this. The job of politicians should be to empower citizens. The weakness in the Government's approach is that the task force is a ministerial one. Those who live and work in the community and who have helped it to survive despite successive Governments neglecting and actively discriminating against them do not have the type of involvement they should have at this time. The North Inner City Community Coalition has produced an excellent report, which I am sure the Taoiseach has read. It is very extensive and thoughtful and reports on all the interventions across a range of issues that it believes are needed. If I may say so, it is the expert. The Taoiseach and I as well as task forces will come and go but if we had a task force with the statutory involvement of local people, that would be a constant. It must be sustainable, properly resourced and involve a long-term intervention, not a quick fix on the back of deplorable murders or other controversies which will spark up every so often. Before those murders, the problems in the inner city, like many other neglected areas, were still there.</p>
            <p eId="para_164"> I understand that Mr. Kieran Mulvey will visit Ballybough House this evening at the invitation of Deputy McDonald. I am sure the local people will tell him what they have told me and the Taoiseach and give detailed propositions for improving their quality of life and opportunities for their children. Those children have the same potential and possibilities and deserve the same rights as anyone else. Will the Taoiseach give a firm commitment to publish the Mulvey report when he receives it and hold a debate in the House as quickly as possible? Will he accept and support the key involvement of local community representatives and stakeholders as of right in this task force because it could be a wasted opportunity?</p>

I sanctioned quite a lot for Sheriff Street in respect of second level schools. What is lacking is consistent application of community resource supports. Certain projects and interventions were discontinued, which was a mistake. This did not just apply to the north inner city but to other areas with significant economic and social disadvantage where many community supports were taken back and models of intervention changed.</p>

            <p eId="para_177">This should be acknowledged, given that many people have been working very hard at the coalface for a long time. We learn that it does not lend itself to simplistic solutions. Deep issues are on the line regarding how people end up in these situations. Simplistic slogans or responses will not work. The communities raised the issue of a mini Criminal Assets Bureau type intervention. It was noticed that many people involved in the drug trade were noticeably demarcated by the trappings of wealth, although some of them were in receipt of social welfare. The Minister indicated that she would respond favourably to the idea. Will the Taoiseach update us on it?</p>
            <p eId="para_178"> Deputy Burton raised the point that young people and children in the community affected by the trauma of all that has happened in recent times need ongoing, consistent counselling. Deputy Thomas Byrne raised this with the Minister for Education and Skills. Whatever interventions have taken place, it is important, in the context of the initiative, that we seek to embed in schools a more permanent resource in this area which could be of benefit and value to school-going children and young people. The trauma that has been visited on them is significant and there is probably a need for a more solid, systemic response to it in through education.</p>

            <p eId="para_181">The terms of reference set out for Kieran Mulvey are very extensive. They specifically include "to engage with and involve local community and public representatives throughout the process; this should include a collaborative review process involving children, young people, parents, professionals and other stakeholders". It is clear that the leadership is within the community. There are fabulous communities in the north inner city. As one person there said to me, less than 1% have given the place a bad name. The purpose of the focus on the north inner city is to create a template that can be transferred to other locations. Chief Superintendent Patrick Leahy runs a great Garda involvement project in the north inner city and I hope the industrial action being mentioned does not take place. I hope the Garda Representative Association, GRA, and Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, will return to conversation with the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality. We do not need it to happen. The GRA said it would request that the gardaí involved in armed Garda units would not participate in any action, and this means the task force established by the Commissioner under the Government's instructions will be able to do its job.</p>
            <p eId="para_182"> The Garda Commissioner is overseeing a new Garda special crime task force. It has been in operation since July 2016 and operates in co-ordination with other agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB. The law is being changed in order that those who have the trappings of wealth from ill-gotten gains from drugs can be apprehended more easily. Operation Hybrid has been in operation and is being reviewed weekly. As of 4 September, more than 40 arrests have been made and five people have been charged in connection with recent shootings. Other deaths have been prevented. There has been an additional €55 million in 2016 for the Garda Síochána to assist in a number of initiatives, including concentrated policing which targets gang crime. There is a dedicated armed unit. Kieran Mulvey's report will be published and he will be in to us next week.</p>

            <p eId="para_184">As Deputies will be aware, the inaugural meeting of the assembly took place last Saturday, 15 October. I attended the meeting to wish the members well in their work. I understand the assembly will meet again on the last weekend in November, at which time it will begin consideration of its first item, the eighth amendment to the Constitution. The website for the assembly is operational and submissions are being invited on its first item, the eighth amendment to the Constitution. A schedule of meetings is also available on the assembly's website, along with a list of the names and county location of the assembly members. The assembly is chaired by a Supreme Court judge, Ms Justice Laffoy. It operates independently of the Government and will report directly to the Houses of the Oireachtas. It decides on all matters relating to its operation, including its rules and procedures, the timing of its meetings and, subject to the resolution passed by the Houses, the prioritisation of its work programme.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_185">At the weekend, I saw the coverage of the opening of the Citizens' Assembly. From a strategic point of view, it seems there are two possible critical outcomes from the work of the assembly. One is that the members of the assembly, who I am told have complete latitude as to what they decide and how they frame their proposals, may propose an amendment to section 8 of the Constitution, which would be put to the people as a fresh amendment. I would like the Taoiseach to indicate whether, in his view, it is within the remit of the Citizens' Assembly to propose a further amendment to the Constitution in respect of the life of the mother and the life of the baby. I would like the Taoiseach to indicate whether this is his view of what may happen. The second recommendation the Citizens' Assembly, in its wisdom, may make is to propose that the eighth amendment should be repealed and that subsequent issues should be dealt with by Dáil Éireann. These are the two critical possibilities arising from the work of the assembly.</p>
            <p eId="para_186"> The Taoiseach will have heard my colleague and party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, raising the issue of rogue pregnancy advice services which are suggesting to women that if they seek a termination, they are at risk of serious illnesses such as breast cancer or that if they have children subsequently, they may abuse them. Most women who read those stories felt very distressed for the women receiving this advice. People are in a difficult situation. It is very personal, emotional and difficult for many people. It is not easy. Nobody would wish it to happen to somebody close to them. The Taoiseach has a political strategy for the Citizens' Assembly. This political strategy is the Taoiseach's prerogative and is understandable. However, this is also about the lives and rights of women and of their partners and families. Are we being led into a cul-de-sac in which we will find a reborn, revised eighth amendment to the Constitution? Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Citizens' Assembly will have the right to propose the repeal of the eighth amendment?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_136">
            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_187">I commend all of those participating at the Citizens' Assembly. I welcome Ms Justice Laffoy's statement that the assembly's work will be open and transparent. The Taoiseach will recall that, when the Constitutional Convention was being put in place, Sinn Féin made a full proposition to the Government that would have reshaped our Constitution for a future Ireland and re-imagined the Ireland of tomorrow. Of course, the Government did not go with it. However, the Constitutional Convention worked. The Government still has to act on some of its recommendations. The Citizens' Assembly is a less effective structure. The Government has insisted on that structure. There is no political representation and there are no voices from the North. There has been no explanation for the latter failure. It is wrong that we should be partitionist in our approach to these issues. I have raised this matter with the Taoiseach previously. It is a serious mistake.</p>
            <p eId="para_188"> There is speculation that the discussion on the eighth amendment could take six months before the matter is returned to an Oireachtas committee and that the report of the assembly might not be with the Oireachtas until next June. If so, a final decision by the Dáil on whether there will be a referendum on repealing the eighth amendment could be a year away. I firmly believe that the Government's approach is one of delaying a referendum and the type of legislation that would be required. Let me be clear in that Sinn Féin will campaign for the repeal of the eighth amendment and for legislation to be enacted in order to allow for terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities, rape and incest. That is what we were sent here, paid and mandated to do. Will the Taoiseach provide greater clarity on the timeframe for the assembly's report on the eighth amendment coming to the Oireachtas?</p>

            <p eId="para_189">Similarly, the Green Party has concerns that a report on this issue arriving in June would constitute a long process. Does the Taoiseach consider that it could be done sooner than the indicative timeline reported at the weekend? Will the Taoiseach outline the mechanism for Oireachtas Members to access some of the information that the Citizens' Assembly is getting while the process is under way so that we do not arrive at the point of having a debate in the Chamber in the absence of our having been informed of the evidence, presentations and submissions? It is important that Members be involved, if not directly in the assembly, and kept up to speed with what is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_190"> Will the same people who have been selected for this part of the assembly be expected to carry on with further aspects of its work or will they be given honourable discharges and a new set of people appointed? What is envisaged will be a difficult task for any citizen to carry out. Is it expected that the same people will continue in the other branches of the assembly's work?</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_138">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_191">First of all, this matter has divided Irish society on many occasions in the past. Nobody under 50 years of age has actually voted on this question. I have no intention of presuming to know what the Citizens' Assembly will recommend or the proposals with which it may come forward. Who are the members of the Citizens' Assembly? They are ordinary men and women from all over the country, chosen at random by a polling company that tendered for the work on the basis of region, gender, age and so on. They are all ordinary people. They are tasked, under the direction of Ms Justice Laffoy, to consider the eighth amendment of the Constitution. They will go through that, I am quite sure, in great detail.</p>
            <p eId="para_192"> Is this process open? Yes. It is all streamed live. Can anybody from around the world make a submission to it? Yes, people can, including those from Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_193"> The work of the assembly will be quite intensive, I would think, over a number of weekends when it starts to discuss the various elements of the eighth amendment. There are more than two possible outcomes, Deputy Burton. There are at least six different options that could be chosen, depending on the Citizens' Assembly and what it wants to do. I want to be clear on this - there is no political direction being given to it and there is no political cul-de-sac being put in place. Nobody under 50 years of age has voted on this issue in Ireland. It is something that obviously will create its own divisions again in our society as these discussions take place, but the Citizens' Assembly will not be making the decision. That will come back to the legislators here.</p>
            <p eId="para_194"> It is not for me to say whether Ms Justice Laffoy and the assembly will finish their work on the eighth amendment inside four months or five months. Ms Justice Laffoy, an esteemed member of the Supreme Court, said that she would hope to report to the Oireachtas. It is to the Oireachtas that the assembly will report, not the Government. The Oireachtas has approved the mandate for the Citizens' Assembly to do its work. I think that is a very valuable thing. The question of the eighth amendment is one that requires rational, commonsensical, comprehensive and sensitive discussion. These ordinary people from all over the country will bring that to bear in their discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_195"> To answer Deputy Eamon Ryan, I do not see any reason at all for the information that is made available to the assembly to be kept from public representatives in any way. It should all be public. Is that not what this is about? It is a Citizens' Assembly and, therefore, the information being made available to it should be available to everybody so that the national conversation about this issue can be held in a proper manner. In that sense, we do not want to have a situation where people feel excluded in any way. The proceedings of the assembly are streamed live. It is wide open and transparent. It is under the command of a very experienced Supreme Court judge. I do not believe, Deputy Adams, that it is in any way less effective than the previous citizens convention, which did include politicians and which ordinary people were a bit shy of in the beginning until they got an understanding of the work that could be involved. Whatever recommendations and whatever proposals come from the Citizens' Assembly will come back to this Legislature because it is to the Oireachtas that the assembly will report. It will not report to me or the Government, it will report to the Oireachtas. This is the people's issue. It is a national issue. As the Deputy knows, not a comma, full stop, word or line of the Constitution can be changed without the people's <i>imprimatur</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_196"> I wished those participating at the assembly the very best in their contributions, thanked them for their commitment and their time in a voluntary capacity, thanked them for their courage and made a specific appeal, given that it is the first time that this issue has been dealt with in the age of digital communication, that those who appear on social media should allow these people the respect and time to give of their views on a sensitive issue in a way that we would all think fitting and to remember that remarks made on social media about comments being made by the Citizens' Assembly can sometimes have a devastating effect on people themselves. These are ordinary citizens chosen at random, willing and wishing to give of their participation in addressing a national issue. I hope that they are given the time and respect to do that in a way that they want to.</p>

            <p eId="para_213">This very important sub-committee has not met since July and there are ongoing controversies and allegations about a concerted campaign within An Garda Síochána to discredit a whistleblower. We have a very senior former head of the Garda press office saying there was an organised campaign in senior Garda management to destroy the reputation of one of these whistleblowers. As I understand it, he is properly admitting his role in this and also implicating other senior managers, including, apparently, the Garda Commissioner. The Garda Commissioner has denied these claims but it is claimed that Superintendent Taylor believes the text messages on his phone will prove the existence of this campaign. That is a big issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_214"> I know Mr. Justice O'Neill has been appointed by the Minister to review all this but are we sure the relevant information relating to this review will be made available? In particular, will there be access to Superintendent Taylor's phone? I am sure the Taoiseach accepts that this comes on the back of ongoing controversies, as many as five reports, the resignation of a Minister and, as the Taoiseach rather eloquently put it, the retirement of a former Garda Commissioner. Does the Taoiseach accept that all of this could deter other potential whistleblowers coming forward, which is not good for Garda morale or public confidence? Will the Taoiseach give us some indication around the terms of reference for Mr. Justice O'Neill and whether he will have this information? Will he give a firm commitment to the Dáil to publish this report immediately and hold a Dáil debate on it?</p>
            <p eId="para_215"> There is also the big issue of the impending strike by An Garda Síochána. I welcome the news that the Minister for Justice and Equality is to fast-track the process for giving the Garda access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. That is good but if I understand it properly, this will require new legislation. If this report is true, when will the Government publish the legislation? Will it be put in place so there is a chance of averting this strike?</p>
            <p eId="para_216"> I raised the following matter consistently. We took issue with the Government retaining the power to appoint the Garda Commissioner and the deputy Garda commissioner. Under the policing Act of 2015 the Policing Authority is supposed to have responsibility for the appointment of assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents, and in May the Government appointed four of the eight vacancies at assistant Garda commissioner level. In July it appointed ten chief superintendents and 18 superintendents. The chair of the Policing Authority has told the Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality of her disappointment at the Government's failure to hand over the powers to appoint senior officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_217"> When were these decisions taken and what role does the Cabinet committee on justice reform have? These are supposed to be issues of reform and yet the Government clings to these powers, contrary to all the high-sounding rhetoric we had in the past. Will the Government pass this over to the Policing Authority and, if so, when will it do so? If not, why not?</p>

            <p eId="para_218">The Cabinet sub-committee discusses a range of issues relating to the Garda, policing and crime in general, making its recommendations or dealing with requests from the Minister for Justice and Equality of the day, who is the Tánaiste in this case. As Deputy Adams is aware, under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, a worker employed in a public body may make a protected disclosure to a Minister in the Government on whom any function relating to that public body is conferred. On 3 October this year, the Tánaiste received correspondence under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 from two members of An Garda Síochána. Under that Act, the Tánaiste may say nothing publicly that might identify the persons making the disclosures. She cannot comment on the accuracy or otherwise of reports appearing in the media about the nature of the disclosures. It is vital that the claims of people making such disclosures are properly addressed. It is also important to ensure the rights of individuals like this to fairness and proper procedures are prepared for. Deputy Adams is aware of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_219"> Having consulted the Attorney General, the Tánaiste asked Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, a former judge of the High Court, having regard to the provisions of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, to review the allegations of wrongdoing that were contained in the disclosures. That included making any inquiries with the persons or bodies that he considers appropriate with respect to the review; reporting to the Tánaiste within six weeks on the conclusions of the review, including any recommendations that he may consider necessary on any further action that may be appropriate and warranted arising from the allegations made; and that on the conclusion of the review, the Tánaiste will consider what further steps may be necessary. That is the process and it relates to a very specific section of a very specific Act for very good reasons. Whistleblowers perform a very important function in the public interest and they must be respected and protected when giving their disclosures. That is why the legislation is the way it is.</p>
            <p eId="para_220"> The Deputy mentioned the Policing Authority and referred to its powers. This brings a dedicated layer of public oversight to the administration of policing services and it also provides a new engine to drive reforms of the policing system and practices in order that the Garda Síochána can be seen to be fit to deal with emerging challenges of policing in the 21st century.</p>
            <p eId="para_221"> There are several important points to note here. The Policing Authority is responsible for approving a three-year strategy statement and the annual policing plan submitted by the Garda Commissioner. The authority must establish and publish within 12 months - that is, by the end of 2016 - a code of ethics that includes standards of conduct and practice for members of An Garda Síochána. The authority will hold at least quarterly meetings in public. As the Deputy knows, a fourth public meeting for 2016 took place on 29 September. The authority is enabled to request the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to investigate any policing matter which gives rise to a concern that a member of the Garda may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings. The authority may, subject to the consent of the Minister, request GSOC to investigate any behaviour of the Garda Commissioner in the context of his or her functions relating to policing matters, examine procedures or practices of the Garda in regard to policing matters in general, and request, as deemed necessary, the Garda Inspectorate to initiate an inspection or inquiry in respect of aspects of the operation or administration of the Garda.</p>
            <p eId="para_222"> The Policing Authority, therefore, has significant powers. It can hold the Garda to account, with senior Garda management reporting to the authority, including via public meetings. It may determine Garda priorities in respect of policing services. It may nominate persons for appointment by the Government to the posts of Garda Commissioner and deputy Garda commissioner. It will appoint persons to the ranks of Garda superintendent, chief superintendent and assistant commissioner, and may remove them for reasons related to policing services. It may appoint persons to senior positions within the Garda civilian staff. The Policing Authority takes up those responsibilities following the last appointments that were made.</p>
            <p eId="para_223"> The Garda Commissioner does not account to the Policing Authority on national security issues, the latter being a function of Government. Under the new oversight arrangements, the Garda Commissioner will report to the Policing Authority in respect of policing matters and to the Minister for Justice and Equality on security matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_224">I am aware of the powers of the Policing Authority. Indeed, Sinn Féin made a detailed submission to the Government at the time of the authority's establishment based on our experience of the Patten commission on police reform in the North. My question in this regard was very specific. The Taoiseach may have given me the answer in the midst of the other verbiage he delivered but, if so, I did not pick up on it. I asked about the situation whereby the Government still retains the authority to appoint senior officers to the Garda Síochána when that power should have passed to the Policing Authority. The chairperson of the authority has expressed her disappointment at the Government's failure to implement that transfer of powers.</p>
            <p eId="para_225"> The other question I asked, which the Taoiseach ignored, concerns media reports that the Minister for Justice and Equality is to fast-track the process for giving members of the Garda access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. If the reports are accurate, they are welcome. I asked when the legislation I presume is required to allow this will be published and if it will be enacted in a timely fashion so that it can be used to avert the threatened strike.</p>

            <p eId="para_230">As I understand it, that function has been transferred but I will clarify it for the Deputy. It is one of the critical functions of the Policing Authority to be independent of anything to do with Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_231"> Regarding threatened strike action by members of the Garda, I have heard claims that the John Horgan report, which is due very shortly, might not be available to the public pay commission, which Government approved yesterday, if the commission decided to have particular expertise made available to it in drafting a report in respect of, for instance, the pay and conditions of gardaí, teachers, nurses and so on. I wish to clarify that Professor Horgan's report will of course be available to the commission. We are waiting to see how the professor might set out what he considers to be the appropriate strategy to adopt to allow for the principle of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court for members of An Garda Síochána. If that is his recommendation and he points out how it should be done, the Minister for Justice and Equality will, I assume, act very quickly on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_232"> Did Deputy Adams's reference to an expression of disappointment by a chairperson refer to the chairperson of the Policing Authority or the chairperson of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission?</p>

            <p eId="para_234">I have dealt with that. In respect of GSOC, I noted the view expressed by its very fine chairperson, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, that some powers were lacking in the ombudsman commission. I have spoken to the Minister for Justice and Equality about this and see no reason we cannot act in this regard. If the chairperson of the commission, who is an eminent member of the Judiciary, says it needs particular powers in a certain area, there is no reason those powers should not be transferred. After all, GSOC is an independent body set up by Government for a specific purpose. As such, it should be given every opportunity to do its work.</p>

        <heading>European Council Meeting: Statements<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T13:50:00+01:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_163">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_235">I welcome this opportunity to address the House in advance of the European Council meeting that begins tomorrow in Brussels. The agenda includes a discussion of the current migration situation, the European Union's trade policy and a number of trade agreements, a range of global and economic issues, and external relations, specifically with Russia and Syria. I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, to address this point of foreign policy in his closing remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> Before I turn to the agenda in more detail, I will refer briefly to the informal summit of 27 EU Heads of State and Government that took place in Bratislava last month. I have already answered questions from Deputies in the House about the summit, but it is worthwhile recalling that its objective was to hold a broad debate on the renewal and future of Europe following the UK vote to leave the Union. The meeting assessed the key challenges and priorities for the EU. Our discussions covered migration, internal security, external security and defence, and economic and social development, including issues affecting youth. I acknowledged the strong concerns our partners have in regard to migration and security and assured them Ireland will continue to contribute to the response to the migration crisis. I also said we would engage in the further development of the Common Security and Defence Policy in support of international peace and security, as provided for in the EU treaties. I highlighted the priority Ireland, together with many of our EU partners, attaches to economic issues, in particular the Single Market, digital single market, jobs, and investment and trade. I argued that we need a balanced approach to the debate on the future of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> There was no discussion of the UK's decision to leave the EU other than a report from President Tusk of his meeting with British Prime Minister, Ms May, and a reaffirmation of the agreed principles that there can be no negotiations before the UK triggers Article 50 and that access to the Single Market requires acceptance of all four freedoms. In my discussions with other leaders, however, I reminded them again of Ireland's specific concerns arising from Brexit, particularly in regard to Northern Ireland, the peace process, North-South relations, citizenship issues, the common travel area, the Border and bilateral trade. I also had the opportunity to elaborate upon these points to the head of the European Commission's negotiating team, Michel Barnier, when I met him in Dublin last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> It was agreed at Bratislava that the process of reflection on the future of Europe should continue at the October and December European Councils. Another meeting of the 27 will take place in Malta in early 2017 before the process concludes in March to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. A declaration to this effect was issued, along with a short work programme or roadmap as set out by President Tusk, President Juncker and the Slovakian Presidency. The October European Council will hear a short update from the Slovakian Prime Minister, Mr. Fico, on that roadmap.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> Returning to the agenda for tomorrow's European Council, Heads of State will begin by once again looking at Europe's work in responding to the migrant and refugee situation, which, quite rightly, remains an issue of the highest priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The Commission is expected to give an update on progress on a range of EU measures, including relocation and resettlement and the European Coast and Border Guard, which has now been established. Many EU measures are having a positive impact. The number of people attempting to cross the Aegean Sea has decreased substantially since the EU-Turkey statement was agreed in March. While this is to be welcomed, far too many people are still risking their lives by travelling the extremely dangerous route from Libya to Italy.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> The European Council will look at protecting external borders, tackling migratory flows along the central Mediterranean route and maintaining control of the eastern Mediterranean route. The EU-Turkey statement and the partnership frameworks, or "migration compacts", with third countries will also be considered under these headings. The migration compacts aim to ensure coherence between the EU's migration policy and its external and development policies. Overall, we welcome their development and their focus on working more closely with countries of origin and transit, as well as countries hosting large numbers of displaced people. We support the intention to build on existing policies in this area. The first countries the compacts are being developed with are in Africa. We support the intention to make swift progress on the external investment plan to boost investment and job creation in African partner countries. Although Ireland is at one remove from the full force of the crisis because of its geographical location and its non-participation in certain justice and home affairs measures under Protocol 21 of the treaties, it is continuing to contribute to the EU response. The Government decided voluntarily to opt in to EU measures and to take up to 4,000 people who need international protection. This commitment is being implemented. There has been good progress with the resettlement of refugees from outside the Union. As of 11 October, some 500 such refugees have arrived in Ireland, mostly from Lebanon. We are on course to meet our target of 520 by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> Progress on relocation, taking migrants that have already arrived in Greece and Italy, has been slow for all partner countries for a variety of reasons that are outside our control. Progress is at last beginning to be made. As of 11 October last, a total of 69 people had come to Ireland from Greece. There are arrangements in place for more people to start coming here. It is expected that by the end of this year, Ireland will have accepted up to 400 people through the relocation pledge. Ireland has provided over €42 million in humanitarian assistance in response to the Syria crisis since 2011 and has pledged a further €20 million in 2016. Over the course of 2015 and 2016, Irish Naval vessels have rescued almost 13,500 migrants in the Mediterranean. <i>LE James Joyce</i> returned to Ireland on 30 September 2016 and has been replaced by <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>, which commenced operations on 2 October 2016. I commend the exemplary service which the members of our Defence Forces are providing and I express the gratitude and admiration of this House and the Irish people for their efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> The European Council will also consider trade policy. The central topics for this debate will be the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA; the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP; other trade negotiations; and the EU's trade defence instruments, which are crucially important in the face of global challenges such as steel over-capacity. As Ireland has one of the most open economies the world, there can be little doubt that we have been beneficiaries of free trade. For this reason, we are strong supporters of the EU’s international trade agenda. I am aware that some Members of the Oireachtas do not share this view. However, the Government is keen to ensure progress in international trade negotiations so that Ireland may benefit further.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> The CETA agreement is of immediate importance. Ireland's exports to Canada are worth approximately €1.87 billion per annum and could increase substantially with the new trade agreement. CETA will create opportunities for Irish companies by opening up public procurement markets in the Canadian provinces, providing unlimited tariff-free access for most of our important food exports and allowing the recognition of product standards and certification, thereby saving on double testing, which is of particular importance to small and medium-sized enterprises. Ireland also successfully campaigned for a low beef import quota from Canada to the EU, thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area. Ireland was among a group of member states that successfully sought the designation of CETA as a mixed agreement. This means that national parliaments, including this House, will be involved in the ratification process. We fully support the provisional application of CETA at the earliest opportunity. When it is signed, there will be an accompanying interpretative declaration clarifying that CETA will not affect public services, labour rights or environmental protection. It is hoped that the agreement will be signed at the EU-Canada summit on 27 October next. The European Parliament is expected to give its approval in December.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> The prospects for finalising TTIP with the US are less positive. Ireland is still aiming for the European Council to send a solid signal of support. We continue to call for as much progress as possible in the negotiations to maintain the momentum towards an ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial agreement. Obviously, TTIP will not now be concluded before the US Presidential election. There are prospects for other trade deals, in particular between the EU and Japan, which together account for more than a third of the world's GDP. Free trade negotiations were launched in 2013 and there is now an ambition, certainly on the part of the Commission, to finalise them before the end of the year. There will also be a discussion on the EU's trade defence instruments, which have come up for consideration due a variety of global trade factors, such as pressure in the steel sector. We recognise that unfair practices need to be tackled efficiently and robustly.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> Many other issues need to be prioritised here. While not everything falls for decision by the Heads of State and Government at this time, there will be a brief discussion on a range of issues like the ratification and entry into force of the Paris agreement on climate change, energy union and the 2030 climate and energy framework, the Single Market, the digital single market, the capital markets union, the reform of the EU telecommunications and copyright rules, the Commission's new proposal for expanding its European fund for strategic investments and fighting youth unemployment. Obviously, we have a number of priority interests across the board. I have spoken many times about the Single Market and the digital market. There will not be any discussion on Brexit other than a brief update from Prime Minister May. We look forward to consulting the House after the summit.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_247">The issues to be discussed at this week’s meeting of the European Council are of fundamental concern to the people of this country.  They address profound economic and humanitarian challenges.  It is clear that the Government needs to play an active and constructive role, but we are seeing, at best, a reserved approach lacking any initiative. The time available for these statements does not allow me to deal with every item on the agenda, let alone the Brexit elephant in the room, which is not down for discussion but overshadows everything.  As such, I would like to address the current state of the Brexit process and the linked issues of migration and Russia’s aggression against democratic forces in both Syria and Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> In the days after the UK referendum in June, there was great fear and uncertainty about what would happen.  Four months later, the situation is much worse. The UK Cabinet has failed to set out even the most basic framework for how it wishes to proceed.  There are many reports of splits between UK Ministers.  At one end, the Brexiteers are continuing with their nonsense argument that everything is okay and it really does not matter what is agreed.  The Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union has said the UK will have no problem quickly negotiating trade deals amounting to ten times the EU's internal market.  Given that the EU accounts for 23% of global income, this forecast does not even fit into the realm of fantasy. On the other hand, the Chancellor of the Exchequer is apparently trying to point out that simply walking away from the EU would be the most damaging thing possible for the UK economy.  His reward for this is to be subject to daily abuse about supposedly trying to sabotage Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> There is an increasingly fevered atmosphere in London, with daily leaks, counter-leaks, policy announcements and U-turns.  Those who sold Brexit based on a sleazy, dark campaign are still pushing their agenda. Their arrogant belief in their own righteousness is growing. A few things are becoming clear in the midst of all of this.  It is highly likely that in the first half of 2019, the UK will cease to be a member of the EU and will not be willing to agree to any of the basic requirements for membership of the Single Market.  There seems to be almost no possibility of a soft Brexit. Prime Minister May has said that the UK's bottom line is that it must be free to exclude EU citizens from an automatic right to live and work in the UK and that Westminster must be able to act without reference to the court which enforces EU rules.  She has said that a great repeal Bill will be introduced next year and will take effect immediately on day one of Brexit.  This stated purpose of this legislation is to end immediately the application of EU law in the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> As freedom of movement and the primacy of EU law are two defining features of membership of the Single Market, the only reasonable conclusion is that a hard Brexit is under way. This is an appalling scenario for Europe as a whole, but for Ireland most of all.  If it is to be mitigated in any way, it will require unique agreements and unprecedented speed.  No modern trade agreement has ever been negotiated in two years, even when the process has started with clear objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> As my party has been saying for some time, Brexit is already hitting Ireland. The collapse of sterling is already damaging businesses and costing jobs. Businesses and communities that are threatened by weak sterling and new trade barriers lack security regarding their future. Before this problem becomes a crisis, we must start acting. My party is calling on the Taoiseach to state clearly to the other governments that the response to Brexit cannot wait for two years and that it needs to start now. There must be agreement on the core principle that the European Union will seek to help member states disproportionately affected by Brexit. It must allow and provide aid to industries that need to diversify and move away from over-reliance on the United Kingdom market and those which need help to maintain markets following the UK leaving the Single Market. We also need an early and formal acknowledgement that Border communities must be supported. They are already feeling the impact of acute sterling volatility and face extraordinary uncertainty about the future. Thus far, there have been many warm words but little substance. We need a concrete recognition from the European Union that Ireland's interests are understood.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> We should formally state to the UK Prime Minister, Ms May, our concern that the unique position of Northern Ireland was not recognised by her in the Brexit cabinet committee established last week. The committee is due to oversee all elements of the Brexit negotiations and has 12 full members. By any measure, this is a large committee. However, the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has no right to attend other than when summoned. The internal fights in the Tory party are enough of a priority for the Tory chairman to be a member but Ireland ranks far lower.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> UK Ministers should cease giving us lectures on the future of Europe. In May and June we heard what they think of us. They should park their arrogance and get on with stating what they want. The statement of the UK Foreign Secretary in Turkey to the effect that he supports that country's application for EU membership is brazen, even for him.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> The summit will also deal with the ongoing humanitarian crisis of migration to Europe and the aligned issue of Russia's escalating aggression towards democratic forces in Europe and elsewhere. I have been saying here for years that the root cause of the mass migration from Syria is a brutal regime seeking to destroy the popular will of a democracy. The refugee crisis is no accident; it has been Syrian state policy for five years. There was a clear opportunity to transition to a government chosen by the Syrian people in 2011 and 2012, but this was rejected by the Assad regime. Syria has been a client state of the former Soviet Union and Russia for over 50 years. This relationship has been toxic for Syrian people in recent years. Russia chose to veto every effort on the part of the United Nations to stop the fighting. Russia vetoed four resolutions at the UN Security Council which had almost universal international support. Russia even vetoed a move to allow the International Criminal Court to investigate the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> There will be a full session tomorrow on the inhumanity of the joint Syrian-Russian bombing of Aleppo where this matter can be addressed more fully. However I wish to make clear that the pathetic and craven attempt to avoid a clear and specific condemnation of Russia's behaviour simply exposes those who adopt this stance. After weeks of being challenged, some of those who claim to be anti-war will hold a demonstration tomorrow, but they are attacking all foreign forces to avoid focusing on Russia's unique role.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">They had no problem focusing on the US and UK when those countries proposed bombing the grotesque and genocidal ISIS movement. Let us be clear: according to independent non-governmental organisations, 80% of Russia's bombs have been directed against democratic forces, including Kurdish forces. They have repeatedly targeted hospitals and used bunker-bursting bombs against civilian areas. That is not by accident; it is a core strategy. To try to equate this with the actions of democratic nations bombing ISIS is perverse. Yet, that is what we will continue to hear from those in this House and outside who love nothing better than to accuse others of hypocrisy.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> We saw the same thing when Russia invaded, partitioned and started a war in a neighbouring country because people in that country wanted to get away from Russian dominance. In this House, Deputies trotted out the most sinister misinformation and moral relativism. In Europe, Sinn Féin even refused to condemn the partition of a sovereign country and repression against a national minority.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> Russia's interference in the democratic politics of various European countries is growing all the time and always involves the support of hard right forces. It has acknowledged allocating funding for the National Front in France and has given, but not acknowledged, funding for a range of other neo-facist groups in Hungary and elsewhere. Russia's transparent support for Donald Trump's campaign and sinister attacks on Hillary Clinton are unprecedented and serve as a warning to us. At this grave moment, with this frantic anti-EU aggression and basic values at stake, those attending this EU summit must not step back. They must not agree with the right-wing politicians demanding an end to Russian sanctions. In fact, they need to wake up and stop acting as if Vladimir Putin will one day become a reliable neighbour. What we need from this summit is more clarity and a determination to get to grips with Brexit. We need a commitment to do whatever it takes to help countries under pressure. We need an unequivocal statement that Europe will not be intimidated by Russia or any groups trying to undermine basic democratic values. Ireland must speak up in this regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_260">This week's meeting in advance of the European Council is a key and important engagement as the British Government Brexit plans have become far clearer in recent weeks. Front and centre of our Government's approach must be an appreciation of the fact that citizens in the North voted to remain in the European Union. That must be advocated, recognised and respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> Yesterday during Leaders' Questions, I noted the remarks of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire. On 9 October, he said there is a "high level of collaboration on a joint programme of work" between this State - that is to say, the Irish State - and Britain. He said, "We have put in place a range of measures to further combat illegal migration working closely with the Irish government". He also stated, "Our focus is to strengthen the external border of the common travel area [CTA], building on the strong collaboration with our Irish partners." Now, the Dáil has not heard a word or a whimper from the Taoiseach on any of this. We get this information from a British Minister. This British Minister was claiming that the British Government is to move the front line of immigration controls to Irish ports and airports to prevent illegal migration into the British state. As I said yesterday, this clearly is not feasible. I also made the point that I am not enamoured of the response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to these claims. I asked the Taoiseach yesterday whether these measures were in place. I am asking the Taoiseach the same question again. Yesterday, I called on the Taoiseach to make a statement on the matter and he refused to do so. The British Government claims that the Irish Government has agreed to move the front line of immigration controls to Irish ports but the Taoiseach has refused to confirm or deny this to the Dáil. That is totally and utterly unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> The Taoiseach also went on a little diversion and referred to his need to know what we are talking about in terms of the Executive in the North. He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_263">...we are not going to get any specific or particular circumstances right unless we know. If there is a division of opinion about what Northern Ireland wants, I cannot sort it out unless there is consensus and agreement on what the horizon or objective is on the part of the Executive in the North. Deputy Adams's party can help to realise that.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Let us be clear. The Taoiseach knows the Northern Ireland Executive position as well as I do. His officials are in contact with all the northern parties. He meets the leaders there regularly and I imagine he reads their public pronouncements or gets briefed on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The DUP and the British Government do not accept the democratic will of the people in the North. Sin é, the Taoiseach knows that. Sinn Féin does and other parties there do as well. It would be better if the Executive was united. That would be the best position. It would be better if the DUP agreed with the rest of us and, more importantly, with the electorate but it does not. We have to deal with that reality and so does the Taoiseach, instead of trying to blame Sinn Féin in some way. We should not, however, give up on the DUP. Many unionists are very concerned about the economic consequences of Brexit. That includes supporters of the DUP. We all need to reach out to them but we cannot ignore the result of the referendum. Sinn Féin is not for turning on this issue and the Taoiseach should not be for turning on it either. I said yesterday - and have said consistently - that Martin McGuinness has held the same position since the referendum, namely, that the Government’s principal objective must be to secure the position of the island of Ireland within the EU in line with the democratically expressed wishes of the people in the North and that there should be no deviation from that. Last week, the deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, travelled to the European Parliament and held a series of meetings with EU leaders and senior MEPs in Brussels where he urged them to support citizens in the North to accept the referendum result and to recognise the unique circumstances here and for the entire island of Ireland. I ask the Taoiseach to relay the same message and to urge his European counterparts to do the same at this week’s Council meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> There does need to be a unified approach to ensuring that we all work together to get the best possible deal for the people of this island, North and South. Sinn Féin is playing its part in this regard. We are standing up for citizens as best we can and it is critical that the Government plays its part and that the Taoiseach takes the lead in this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> It is important that at this meeting the Taoiseach lays out the need to secure the position which I have just outlined and which he previously acknowledged and said he would advocate, that is, to secure the position of the 32 counties and all of our offshore islands within the European Union. The Good Friday Agreement, of which the Taoiseach is a coequal guarantor, must also be protected. The all-island civic dialogue will be a key part of that. I spent a few days in the North and there is a big appetite regarding this issue from disparate people. Thousands of individuals from Derry to north Louth protested against Brexit on 8 October, including members of the Taoiseach’s party. I was very pleased to see them on some of the footage. This demonstration organised by Border Communities against Brexit shows the depth of concern among those communities. However, that is not the only place that will be affected by Brexit. I look forward to seeing how the Taoiseach will be received when he puts this position to the Council and tells it that he wants it to accept that all of the island of Ireland needs to be sustained and retained within the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> Before I give way to Teachta Crowe, the Fianna Fáil Leader is always condemning Sinn Féin for being soft on Russia and Russian behaviour. Let me say, without any equivocation whatsoever, that Sinn Féin has consistently condemned imperialism from all quarters, including Russian imperialism and interference by any state in the affairs of another. I include in that regard the awful military assaults taking place at this time which ought to be - and are by our party - condemned.</p>

          <p eId="para_271">It has been raised with various Ministers at committee meetings but there has been no real debate in the House. Across the EU, this matter was treated secretively at first, as was the case with the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP. It is almost as if a climate of secrecy is being encouraged and informed citizenship about these trade agreements is discouraged. It has potentially massive implications for Irish citizens. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, environmental, health and farming groups have raised concerns about it and we need to address them. There is something wrong and rotten about the fact that a debate has not been allowed in respect of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">I will share time with Deputy Boyd Barrett - five minutes each.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> The free trade agenda of right-wing governments, including this one, and the European Commission, has run into massive public opposition. As a member of the trade committee of the European Parliament for three years, I campaigned against CETA. We employed what we referred to as a Dracula strategy to try to bring what was happening in respect of TTIP and CETA out into the open and allow people to see what was a corporations' charter being written completely undemocratically, which would create a real problem for all the right-wing governments in Europe and for the European Commission. That has worked and TTIP has run into the sand of popular opposition and the complications posed by Brexit. Now the agenda is to get CETA implemented as quickly as possible without a vote in this House. That is contained in the Taoiseach's speech and I will explain that in a moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> CETA is TTIP in Canadian disguise. A total of 81% of the companies that operate in Canada are subsidiaries of US companies. In that context, 24,000 American companies operate in Canada. It is a way for the same interests in terms of major global capital to pursue the race to the bottom in respect of regulation, workers' rights, consumers' rights, and the environment, and to create a parallel supposed court structure to enshrine the rights of corporations to sue states if they interfere with their right to profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> The agreement includes regulatory co-operation, which sounds like a nice thing. It would seem to make sense for countries and trade blocs to co-operate. In reality, however, what is proposed is lowest-common-denominator regulation in respect of a range of different things. First, the establishment of a regulatory co-operation forum under CETA, which will involve experts - people linked to the big businesses responsible for this - who will play a role in drafting regulations in the future will have a chilling effect on countries willing to regulate in the future. Second, the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism is renamed the investment court system. That is just rebranding of ISDS with the same essence, the right of corporations to sue states if they interfere with their investments or their right to profit, and a chilling effect will apply. Third, CETA is a living agreement, which means that it is fundamentally undemocratic. It is not accountable to this Parliament or to the European Parliament. Other bodies instead will hold sway. A range of committees, including at the top, the CETA joint committee - which is completely beyond any democratic control - will be established. Fourth, the threat to public services still exists in the drive towards liberalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> I want to deal with the process because what is contained in CETA is fundamentally undemocratic.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">It is an attack on people's rights in terms of undermining democratic checks and accountabilities. It is very appropriate that the method pursued to implement CETA is just as undemocratic. The Taoiseach said that Ireland sought the designation of CETA as a mixed agreement. That means there will have to be a vote on it in this House but he went on to state: "We also fully support the provisional application of CETA at the earliest opportunity." That means there will be no vote in this House and no vote in the European Parliament before it provisionally comes into force. In terms of what that means, we must read the agreement. Article 30.8.4 states: "If the provisional application of this Agreement is terminated and this Agreement does not enter into force, a claim may be submitted under Section F of Chapter Eight (Investment) within a period no longer than three years following the date of [termination of] the provisional application, regarding any matter arising during the provisional application of this Agreement..." That means that it comes into effect without any democratic decision of this House or anywhere else, and a Canadian company or a US company with a subsidiary in Canada can sue this State if we say we do not want fracking to take place or if we increase labour regulation. It can sue this State despite the fact that no vote has taken place, and it has the right to do that for a period of three years. That is what it states. That is the impact of provisional application, and that is why it is the road that is being taken, because the Government has met opposition in the Seanad, in the Walloon Parliament and in the German constitutional court. The Taoiseach has a real problem in terms of getting this measure through, and so this is the route to go down.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> The other point that I raised with the Taoiseach previously is that it is arguably unconstitutional. Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution states that the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann, but provisional application means there can be a charge on the State because a company can take Ireland to the investor court. It is an issue, therefore, in terms of the constitutionality of this agreement. The Taoiseach has met massive opposition to this agreement. He will continue to meet it. People will not buy the trick of provisional application.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_285">I am a little out of breath because I joined the many thousands of students protesting outside the House. I want to give a shout out to them. They are keen that the Taoiseach hears their opposition to fees and the potential for a student loan scheme. I mention that in passing. I support them 100%, and I hope the Taoiseach does also.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> I will attend another protest this evening, which relates directly to the Taoiseach's position in Europe and the European Council. That protest relates to the appalling atrocities taking place in Syria. The protest will make a specific call on the Taoiseach to speak out and condemn all bombing, military intervention, and support for warring factions in Syria or in other conflict areas in the Middle East, particularly Yemen, and in Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> The need for this issue to become a priority and for the Taoiseach to speak out loudly on the public stage in Europe, and to the United States and Russia, hardly needs to be stated. The estimated number of deaths in Syria is 470,000. Between 7 million and 11 million members of the Syrian population are displaced, out of a population of 22 million. The appalling Russia and Assad assault on Aleppo is an obscene action by any standard that must stop immediately. The need for the Taoiseach to speak out and for Ireland to play a role on the international stage in speaking out against these atrocities is urgent.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> It is very important, and this is the point of the protest, that we are even-handed and consistent in our humanitarianism and our opposition to war. What the Russians and Assad are doing in Aleppo, and what they have done to their own population, which rose up in a peaceful popular revolt against the brutal regime that is the Assad regime, is appalling and beyond words in its horror. Equally, however, other powers have now cynically manipulated the civil war that has erupted in Syria to try to further their own interests. We must be absolutely consistent in opposing their bombing, their manipulation and their actions, which are serving only their strategic and political interests and making an already bad situation worse, effectively pouring petrol on a blazing fire.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> It is noticeable that some people are very one-sided in their condemnation, so I repeat that we must condemn utterly the barbarity of the Russian and Assad intervention with consistency and authenticity. Our opposition to horror and war requires us to equally condemn US bombing, for example, the bombing in Manbij, which claimed the lives of 60 civilians in July and helped scupper a ceasefire. There is no condemnation of that atrocity, for example, in the Fianna Fáil motion that has been submitted. There is no condemnation of the 20 civilians killed in Damascus by US bombing. There is no condemnation of the 43 bombing assaults by the United Kingdom. There is condemnation of the bombing by France, which has killed dozens of civilians. There is no condemnation of the fact that the US, France and Britain continue to sell billions worth of arms to Saudi Arabia, which it is using to support groups like the Al-Nusra Front, which is up to its eyes in the horror going on in Syria, or the appalling Saudi bombing of Yemen, which is creating a humanitarian crisis just as bad as that in Syria and in which the US is directly involved.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_298">I wish to share my time with Deputy Pringle, six minutes and four minutes. The two most urgent issues for the European community are the human tragedy in Syria, with the loss of life, the destruction and the displacement, and what only can be described as a sleepwalking exercised into CETA. I listened to the Taoiseach's speech on CETA and the long list of positive reasons to support it, but there was no mention of the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism, the protection of public services, a Dáil debate or the need to ratify. There are concerns, yet we appear to be pushing ahead for Ireland to sign on 27 October and ratify in December.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> There is disquiet, concern, criticism and outright opposition to this agreement, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and the<b>
						</b>economic partnership agreements, EPAs.<b>
						</b> The critics are not anti-trade, but why is there this rush to sign while the EU is waiting on a decision from the European Court of Justice on the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement? If the ISDS goes through, this State can be sued by corporations and multinationals for loss of profit and the loss of potential profit. While this aspect appears to be removed from the provisional application, we know it is not gone. Do these investor courts have any place in trade deals? Will Ireland seek a ruling from the European Court of Justice on the ISDS? What way will Ireland vote on the ISDS mechanism if there is an option against its inclusion? The recent Seanad motion has to be taken into account, and also the serious aspects in terms of our Constitution and signing the agreement. The advice of the Attorney General should be sought.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> There is another aspect to this and it relates to development aid from Ireland and the EU because it seems that the private sector will be the driver of the new sustainable development goals. There is a real possibility of development aid from Ireland and from the EU being used to underwrite or de-risk private sector investment and loans. There is a particular implication for agriculture. What we are seeing is European food exports and European food companies becoming increasingly dominant across Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">That is contributing to unemployment on African lands, to food security risks, to rural flight and to migration. There is a need for a human rights assessment of the effect of EU and Irish agricultural investments in Africa, as the Danish agricultural group, Arla, has done. In the area of EU and international aid, there is an increasing emphasis on terms like "strategic advantage" and "commercialisation" and it undermines the good reputation we have when it comes to aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> Syria shows how ineffective the EU and the United Nations are. We said "Never again" after Rwanda and after Srebrenica but another such situation arises now in Syria. There is indiscriminate bombing and indeterminate bombing of schools, market places and hospitals. The EU has to use all the influence it has not just on Russia and Iran, but also on the United States and EU member states to stop the bombing. At the very least, the EU has to take a lead in continuing the ceasefire. There has to be a minimum of three days' ceasefire so that there can be medical evacuation and medical supplies can go in. Apart from injuries through war, Médecins sans Frontières has told me of the effect on people with illnesses, such as diabetes or asthma, who have not been able to access the medication they need. We do not have a strong EU voice on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> We are also seeing siege being used as a war tactic in Syria, something we associate with the Middle Ages, but is taking place in a country that is only a four-hour flight from Ireland. The Taoiseach spoke about how we were dealing with refugees but we are extremely slow and need to be more flexible and fairer. We also need a fast-track system to help Syrian refugees.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> I hope Ireland can have a voice at EU level on the Cuban blockade. The Cuban five have eventually been released from their unjust imprisonment in America, due to the campaigns and intervention of people like Pope Francis. With the support of President Obama, there are better diplomatic relations and there has been an easing of some travel restrictions but the blockade continues. It is illegal and immoral and it is having disastrous effects on the people of Cuba. Irish and European banks cannot have any engagement with Cuba so billions in money and resources are being lost to Cuba as a result. Our President is visiting next February and we have good relationships with Cuba. We will be part of the resolution to stop the blockade and will vote against it with other European countries but the blockade continues.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_188">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_305">There are a huge number of issues for the upcoming Council of Europe but, in the limited time available, I will not be able to address all of them. It is vitally important to send out a clear message that we are opposed to all bombing taking place in Syria and all such actions of the international community, whether they are Russian, American, Saudi Arabian, Australian, New Zealanders, British, French, German or from any of the many countries that are bombing in Syria and killing civilians. No matter who makes the bombs, it is wrong and Ireland has to send out a clear message to the European Council to that effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> I congratulate the Walloon Parliament for voting to reject CETA and it is interesting to see the pressure being put on Belgium by the European Commission to reverse the decision by Friday, so that the Council can take a decision to adopt the agreement. I hope the Walloon Parliament stands firm because this is a bad deal for Europe, for Canada and the rest of the world. I pay tribute to the Seanad, which voted against its provisional ratification, and it is disappointing that we have not had an opportunity in this House to debate the motion and have a vote on it because it is vitally important.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> In response to my questions on CETA, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, has been a bit economical with the truth. She said a declaration will be signed to the effect that the investor-state dispute mechanisms and the investor courts will not apply but this will be the case only during the provisional ratification period, which can last up to three years. When every member state has gone through the ratification process, the investor-state mechanism comes into being as part of the overall operation of CETA. It is disingenuous for our Minister for jobs to respond to questions about CETA in this way. It sends out the wrong message but the public, and some parliamentarians across Europe, see that there is something badly wrong with CETA and such international trade agreements. We are rushing into it like headless chickens saying, "It is good for trade and that is all we need to know". That is completely wrong and we need to take a step back. I urge the Taoiseach not to support the provisional ratification on Friday. There is no doubt the European Commission will be busy trying to bribe the Walloon Parliament with offers before Friday but hopefully it will stand firm.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> The Taoiseach said he expected Theresa May to update the Council on the British plan to trigger Article 50 in March next year. In the context of Brexit, something we have not considered is the fact that after Brexit in 2019, or whenever it happens, over 70% of our trade exports and imports will be outside the European Union, and we should then consider our own position within the European Union. We should consider an Irexit in light of the potential impact of Brexit on the common travel area and our international trade, with tariff barriers being increased. We could protect the common travel area and trade and we could do a lot to address the imbalances which currency fluctuations are causing now by leaving the European Union ourselves. We could take back sovereignty and stand on our own two feet rather than kowtowing to the European Commission as we have continually done over the past 40 years. It should be a contingency plan and by putting it forward it we might have a better hand in negotiations.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_309">It is important to have a proper debate on this but I do not believe statements such as these are a worthwhile way of dealing with such huge issues. People across the globe have concerns about trade agreements but the Taoiseach and other Ministers are going over to Europe and will acquiesce in what the Europeans want. There are huge issues and no possibility to opt out. Instead, we are being cajoled and bullied by eurocrats to get back into line. After Brexit we need a serious reassessment - though we needed it anyway and I believe we had the Brexit vote because of the functioning of the European Union. It is too big and, across a whole range of areas, it is out of touch with the feelings of ordinary families in ordinary places.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> The EU was not even consulted on the ceasefire or any other agreements in Syria. Two years ago, I visited Syrian refugee camps in Lebanon and saw the pain and anguish on the faces of the people. I saw only elderly women and small children. They had only hours to leave their home and they had suffered persecution and threats. They had no hope of going back. With the bombing, devastation is being heaped on Syria on a daily basis. I attended an international conference during the summer on the situation in the Middle East and on the persecution of Christians throughout the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">We look back and all the figures and facts are there to prove it. They show clearly that while we had awful dictators in some of those countries, such as Iraq and Syria, Christian communities and minority Muslim communities were allowed to practise and cherish their faith with impunity, and now they are being massacred. We bombed the hell out of the place to get rid of these dictators and the situation of persecution is far, far worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> I commend the Naval Service on the proud work it has done on humanitarian grounds in the Mediterranean and the thousands of lives it has saved over the past two years since it went there. It is heart-rending to see and it must have an awful impact on those Naval Service personnel. I salute and commend them.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> We need to give serious thought to and have a proper debate in this Parliament, which we have not had, about what is happening in the Middle East and about that persecution. In that vein, the rural Independent group has a Private Members' motion coming up in a few weeks time to have some meaningful and insightful debate on what is happening in the Middle East. There is warmongering, terror, destruction and devastation of life and communities. We have Russia, the United States, and many others pulling the strings and interfering. It is not a much better place than it was. It is a far worse place than it was under the dictators, and that is serious. It is food for thought. We should be examining it, and the European Union must take a stance on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> Getting back to the trade agreements, we have not had any meaningful discussion on them and I have little faith in the Taoiseach and whatever other of the Ministers go there because we seem to be the good boys of Europe. We do whatever they ask. Whatever they want, we will merely sign up. We are the good boys in the class. Where is our thanks? I will not use the word, which starts with an "s", that is our thanks, but that is what we get. We saw what we got in the strong talk after Brexit and the threats that were made to the British people on what to do. We need to assert ourselves. We need to be able to be a proud country with a record of neutrality and of standing up for ourselves and our people, which is the Government's duty and the duty of every elected Member of this House. I commend the Seanad on the motion it passed recently, but we must reaffirm that we are a country in our own right and expect to be treated so.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> Moving on to Brexit and the possible implications, which, as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has just arrived, I believe the budget did not address. There was little or no Brexit-proofing in the budget. We had our eye off the ball as far as I am concerned. We remember the hard Border. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, will remember it more than anybody because they travel through that country. We had great freedom in recent years to travel across the Border to anywhere without the long checkpoints, searches and whatever else.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> Only two weeks ago, I travelled from Croatia into Bosnia-Herzegovina on a new motorway, most of which was funded by the EU which was great to see as it was badly needed in that country for access. Going into Bosnia-Herzegovina, we met the hard border with the European flag flying alongside the Croatian flag, and we were an hour on a bus. Every passport was taken off the bus - 52 of them - and brought into the checkpoint and scanned, and there were delays. Can Members imagine that happening again in Newry, Aughnacloy or any of the crossing points? This is what we are faced with and what we are not dealing with. We will be a pressure point for access to Britain.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> We are not dealing with the issue in the south east, the port of Rosslare. Those in the export and haulage sectors are most concerned because much of the produce from Ireland's agricultural sector depends on them as it travels to Rosslare, across to England and from there on. There are good arrangements with hauliers and contractors on both sides such that now not only do lorries with drivers embark but also only trailers and containers which are taken off by a sister company and brought through England and on to France and elsewhere. This is significant. Over 70% of our exports could be to outside of the EU if the British Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, presses that button, engages the treaty article and implements Brexit. It is vital.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> Take the mushroom sector, which is big in my county. It is big in Monaghan, and Tipperary seems to be one of the largest mushroom producing counties. Two or three big businesses involving 30, 40 or 70 jobs have gone in recent weeks. They were struggling anyway with competition from Poland and other countries due to low wage costs there, and now this is a step too far. They just could not keep pumping money into a loss-making situation. I have sympathy for them, many of whom are good friends of mine and who have given good employment. They set up this business, had tough times and worked hard at it. It is nearly like how dairy cows have to be milked regularly in that the mushrooms have to be picked regularly too. They do not wait for a five-day week. The flushes come in and they have to be picked properly and to a high standard. Now the producers are facing a perilous situation. I note the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, is laughing. I do not know whether he is laughing at what I am saying or laughing at something else, but it is no laughing matter. It is very serious. It involved significant employment in Tipperary, significant payment of rates and a significant service sector serving the mushroom plants, with construction, maintenance and delivery to and from the plants and the use and transportation of by-products as well to the highest standards. It has been wiped out before our eyes. The impact on the mushroom sector is merely one salutary lesson that we should take from Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> Every other agriculturally based sector, the haulage sector and all kinds of jobs and exports will be devastated and the Taoiseach will merely go and sign up - "How much, Sir? Three bags full, Sir. I will sign it." - and come home again. That is what we, the yes men of Europe, have been doing and it is time we stood up and asserted ourselves. It is time we had a proper Brexit impact analysis and deal with it at EU level as well. I do not have much faith in the Taoiseach because history has shown us. We were going to burn the bondholders, according to the former Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Eamon Gilmore, and we laid down, tickled their bellies, saluted them and said they were great people. We are still doing the same. We are merely walking blindfolded towards the implementation of Brexit. We will have to consider opposition with the bureaucrats because they are only threatening and intimidating bully boys, and it is time that they learned. They have not learned anything from what happened with Brexit. They should have sat up and paid heed, not threatened an all-out cut-off and serious repercussions and reassessed where Europe is going. The project was a good project when it started out but sadly it has lost its way. It has got too big, a bit carefree and a bit intimidating of the small nations, and we need to re-examine it.</p>

          <p eId="para_323">The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, might confirm whether that is the time it is being considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> The case and argument from my party, in Canada, Brussels and Dublin, is that we should put a stop to this process and that the agreement we are about to sign is not right. It is a fundamental undermining of some of the regulatory provisions that we have been championing for 30 or 40 years, and more than anything else, there is an issue of democratic accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> It is not only that the Upper House, Seanad Éireann, has voted already, with a majority stating we should put it on hold. It is not only that the parliaments in Bulgaria and Romania have real concerns around visa provisions within a trade agreement with Canada, but the decision by a sizeable majority in the Walloon Parliament to put a stop to proceedings has to be respected. There is considerable impetus within the Council, because of Brexit and because we want to be seen as being able to act, to plough ahead regardless, but that would not be the right approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">As an alternative, one of the approaches the Taoiseach might take at the Council on Thursday is to ask that the European Court of Justice give an opinion on whether the really controversial elements within the trade agreement, namely, the investor-state distribution system or the investment courts system that modifies it, are, as many would contend, in breach of fundamental European legal rights and legal structures. If he were to do that, it would do much good in terms of restoring some of the reputation of the State on international trade issues and it would lead to far greater legal clarity prior to any agreement being signed. It would also address one of the main fundamental concerns with the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, which is also the case with the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, that we are creating a mechanism where corporations have excess power over governments in terms of the regulatory systems we are putting in place. That is the reason the Green Party in Canada was the only party that was fundamentally opposed to the agreement and why we have also led the campaign against it in Brussels. We believe the agreement is yet another example in the globalised trade system where we are giving excess power to corporations over states. We are not opposed to international trade. We will need international trade to make the economic transition we need to have a sustainable future. We are not opposed to agreements with Canada or the United States, which set up laws to allow one to monitor them. We do not, however, agree to the existing systems where the powers of corporations are excessive compared to the powers of governments and where we lose control of some of the regulatory systems such as the precautionary principle for which we fought for 30 years on the protection of public services and the principle that our courts are no longer potentially sovereign and that there is a yielding of national sovereignty to international dispute resolution courts where corporations would have real power over this Parliament. As has been mentioned previously, the fact that the Government is seeking to approve this trade agreement in advance of it being approved in the Parliament here only reinforces the concern that we are not recognising the democratic mandate in terms of regulatory systems. This is not just about removing tariffs, it is also about removing regulations, and that is all the more reason we should have had a more open and transparent process in how the yielding of democratic control over regulation has been ceded and why we should approve the agreement here prior to any signature going on any future agreement. There is real confusion in Brussels following the vote in Walloon yesterday. We should help address some of the uncertainty by asking the European Court of Justice to make a quick ruling on whether the new alternative court systems are in compliance with European law. If the Minister of State has time at the end to respond I would like to hear whether the Government would consider making a call, or joining others in doing so, in order that the European Court of Justice would make a ruling in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> My second point is related because in the end Brexit will be an issue about what jurisdiction the UK will recognise in any post-Brexit situation. It was with real shock that we read the speeches made by Theresa May at the Conservative Party conference where she seemed to be slamming doors behind her in terms of not recognising the European Court of Justice in future, and adopting the body of European law but then reserving the right to remove it in the blink of an eye should the UK so wish. This is a connected issue because it would potentially allow the UK to operate as a rogue state in a race to the bottom whereby it would not apply jurisdictional control in terms of whatever trade arrangements are in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> While it is not an immediate item on the agenda, it is very important that we do not just cede the argument in effect to the UK Government and wait until March to see what it does. It is important for us in the interim period that we set out our position. I do not believe our position can be to seek a side deal with the UK Government on which we would then go to the rest of the European Union to say it should be kind to us when dealing with Ireland or border issues because, in effect, that would amount to us acting as a subsidiary of the UK negotiating position. It would be far better for us to take a European position wherein we stand up for the right of the free movement of people, and make it very clear that there will not be a yielding on access to the Single Market without the UK Government yielding in terms of some of the other rights that come with such a benefit. Should the UK take the course of going the hard Brexit route, we should try to retain from the ashes some mechanism whereby we can get agreement with the UK in terms of labour, social, environmental and other standards so that the UK would not be able to play fast and loose with the Single Market. It is in all our interests to have joint accountability and jurisdiction and I would welcome if we could have some mechanism in place in that respect even if the UK opted for a hard Brexit route. It is preferable for us to analyse and investigate such mechanisms before Article 50 is triggered, which we have been told will happen in March, so that we are ahead of the game. That is something on which we must work with our European colleagues, the other 27 remaining members, and not do a side deal with the UK and then seek to get agreement from the other 26 members on whatever deal might be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> Most important, I must say how disheartened I am at the numbers revealed by the Taoiseach today that, to date, we have brought in only 69 refugees from the port of Piraeus and the other transit camps in Greece. I see no reason why that number should be so low or why we should blame other bureaucratic systems such as that of the UN for the failure to act with due haste. It is disgraceful that we are leaving those people languishing in the most horrific basic conditions on a pier and in dusty yards in Thessaloniki and outside Greece. It behoves us as a nation not to seek to bring in 400 refugees by the end of the year but to bring in the bulk of the 4,000 people whom we have committed to bring in. If we lived up to that commitment it would say a lot that is positive and right about this country. It is not acceptable to point to the inefficiencies of the UN or whatever system is being blamed for the delay. There are hundreds of people among those refugees who would give their right arm to come to Ireland tomorrow. I cannot understand or accept that we have managed to bring in only such a small number of refugees to date. That speaks volumes about a lack of care for the issue and a lack of real attention to the detail and urgency that is required for us to act. I ask that the Government change its strategy and reality double quick.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe McHugh)<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_330">Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an gCathaoirleach fá choinne an tseans labhairt le linn na ráiteas faoi chruinniú na Comhairle Eorpaigh a tharlóidh an tseachtain seo chugainn. As the Taoiseach indicated, I will focus my remarks on the external relations item of the European Council meeting. This is to consist of a broad, strategic policy debate on Russia and a likely exchange on Syria. This is a timely and welcome opportunity to review the EU-Russia relationship in all its aspects. The course of European history teaches us the value of stable and strong relationships between Russia and its neighbours to the west. In the long term, it is a strategic goal for Ireland and for the EU to have just such a partnership with Russia. However, notwithstanding that, we must be frank about current realities and the situation as it presents itself today. Unfortunately, there has been a marked deterioration in relations between Russia and the EU in recent years. The conflict in Ukraine has come to be the central defining issue, although there are also grave concerns over Russia's role in the Syrian conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> It must be acknowledged that there has been no major change in policy by Russia or any indication that it is seeking to improve the relationship with the EU. That is regrettable, but it is a reality that we cannot wish away. In March, the EU agreed a set of principles to guide our relations with Russia. Ireland fully supports the way forward that has been outlined. We believe there is merit in seeking a selective engagement with Russia on foreign policy issues and specific sectoral areas of interest to the EU. However, we must be clear that any resumption of selected dialogue should be gradual and that it would be used by the EU to seek a change in Russian behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> As I said, the conflict in eastern Ukraine remains of paramount importance. The fragile security situation in eastern Ukraine is a matter of deep concern. It is difficult to believe that two years on from the signing of the first Minsk agreement, we are still calling for a stable ceasefire. The path for a resolution of the conflict is set out in the Minsk agreements. The EU has been very clear and consistent in linking the economic sanctions imposed in 2014 to the complete implementation of the Minsk accords. The decision to impose such measures on Russia was not taken lightly - far from it - but this is an indication of the seriousness with which the EU regards Russia's actions in destabilising eastern Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The sanctions are intended to encourage Russia to use its influence to help ensure the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. Before this can happen there needs to be an urgent de-escalation of hostilities in the conflict zone. The criteria for amending the sanctions are clear and provide the sole basis upon which future decisions and assessments will be made. We also have repeatedly made clear the EU will never recognise Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, and that has to remain an important principle in our approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> Ireland, together with its EU partners, remains very concerned by the ever worsening situation in Syria, in particular we are all shocked and outraged at the appalling scenes of suffering from Aleppo. The excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate use of military force against the besieged population of Aleppo constitutes a clear violation of international law. Given its role as a key supporter of the Assad regime, our concerns have been directly conveyed in the clearest terms to the Russian authorities at the direction of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I join him in urging Russia to use all its influence in Syria to end these inhumane actions against a defenceless civilian population. </p>
          <p eId="para_335"> Despite these negative elements, the EU still needs to look to its values and to act in accordance with them. It is of great importance that the EU maintains its support for civil society in Russia which continues to be very vulnerable. The shrinking space for independent civil society and the ongoing harassment of human rights defenders, journalists and opponents is deeply troubling. We desire a strong and stable relationship with Russia over the long term, and that goal will guide our thinking, particularly at the European Council discussion this week. We do not expect any significant change in the EU's approach to its relationship with Russia at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> That concludes my wrap-up statement but I will respond to Deputy Ryan's question on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and the summit that will take place on 27 October. There will be an accompanying declaration clarifying that CETA will not affect public services, labour rights or environment protection. To address the issue raised by Deputy Paul Murphy, this House will have a chance to vote on the deal because the Government insists on it. </p>

What exactly has been done to date? How much money has been committed to local authorities and has been drawn down? What is the status of the Department's plans for a relocation scheme and for assistance and insurance for people who want to move away from the distress? There has been a policy change on the dredging of rivers which was announced last night. I want to pursue that with the Minister of State.</p>

							</i>The Deputy deviated a bit from his question so I will begin by answering the question that was submitted by the Deputy. </p>
            <p eId="para_342"> The Office of Public Works, OPW, has a lead co-ordination role in flood risk management generally but it does not play a lead role in responding to flood events, which is the responsibility of the local authorities. The local authorities are required to plan and prepare for such events in accordance with the general arrangements for co-ordination of the front-line emergency services set out in the framework for major emergency management which comes under the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. That Department is the lead Department for co-ordinating the response to severe weather.</p>
            <p eId="para_343"> The response to all emergencies is appropriately locally led in the first instance through the three designated principal response agencies of An Garda Síochána, local authorities and the Health Service Executive which respond to assist citizens in need and manage consequences at local level. Specific guidance for responding to severe weather events is outlined in A Guide to Flood Emergencies 2013 and A Guide to Severe Weather Events 2010. Local authorities have severe weather sub-plans in place based on this guidance material. </p>
            <p eId="para_344"> Met Éireann and the Office of Public Works alert local authorities directly when severe weather, high tides or storm surges are forecast, and such warnings are received by a severe weather assessment team within a local authority. The severe weather assessment team takes the appropriate action to scale a response and to ensure resources are in place to support a response. During last winter’s flooding, this approach helped to anticipate and prepare for the response required by local authorities. </p>
            <p eId="para_345"> The procedures for co-ordination of emergencies at national level, such as flooding events, are set out in the Guidelines for Coordinating a National-Level Emergency/Crisis Response, published by the Office of Emergency Planning in the Department of Defence in 2011. </p>

            <p eId="para_349">I do not want to personalise this because the Minister of State has brought great energy and focus to the issue. His answer goes to the heart of one of the problems here. It is a problem for another Department, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. The purpose of a Minister with responsibility for flooding was to take responsibility for every part of it. Some consideration should be given to the Minister of State getting ministerial responsibility in that Department to lead the focus there.</p>
            <p eId="para_350"> Crossmolina was almost flooded on 11 September when there were extraordinary levels of water three months before such levels were expected, which gives an idea of what the problem will be throughout the country because of the absence of a good summer. If a person's house is going to be flooded this October or November, he or she does not care what Department the Minister of State is in, he or she just wants somebody to do a good job. People want somebody to get on with the job. I am not convinced the OPW understands the pressure households are under. In response to a question from our colleague, Deputy Murphy, recently, the chair of the OPW spoke of a five-year plan and of going further than that. Does the chair of the OPW understand what it is like to have to wake up every morning and listen to the weather forecast to know if one's house will be flooded in the next few hours? That is the experience of communities throughout the country. The Minister of State has experienced it directly.</p>

            <p eId="para_351">I will reiterate a number of things. The chair of the OPW was talking about the five-year investment programme of €430 million by the Government for flood relief. There was another issue of the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, which is a ten-year plan. People have suggested that it means nothing will happen for ten years, which is wrong. Last year we had four flood relief schemes under construction. By the end of this year, there will be 12 relief schemes under construction in the country. There are more than 20 schemes in different stages of planning and design. The minor works, which I explained to the Deputy, have so far delivered protection to 4,500 properties.</p>
            <p eId="para_352"> To return to one other issue that came up, the Office of Emergency Planning will launch its Be Winter Ready campaign on 9 November. The Department is helping with that and is part of that group. The lead is being taken by the Department of Defence. There is no way we are leaving anything for five years. We are doing everything we can at this stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_353">I thank the Minister of State for his clarification on CFRAM because the impression was that it is a five or ten-year process. Will the Minister of State give me an update on the scheme for Crossmolina? A third Department is being introduced into the equation now. We have the OPW, which is under the aegis of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Department of Defence. That is why there is such a lack of an emergency response when an event happens. If a person is in business or living in an area, he or she wants an immediate response. Actually, he or she does not want it to happen at all. Will the Minister of State give me an update on Crossmolina and the status of the insurance scheme for businesses that cannot get insurance?</p>
            <p eId="para_354">I am aware of houses that have schemes in place but they are subject to a 100% increase in their insurance premium, if they can get it. Finally, there is the concept of a relocation scheme for people who wish to move out of flood affected areas into areas that will not be affected by floods.</p>

            <p eId="para_355">Regarding the relocation scheme and the insurance, we have had discussions in the interdepartmental group and we are meeting again next Tuesday. It is to be hoped we will bring an interim report from there to Cabinet with recommendations on those schemes. Also on the subject of insurance, there is a memorandum of understanding in place between the OPW and Insurance Ireland. It is now the case that Insurance Ireland meets with the Office of Public Works on a quarterly basis, rather than once every two years, to try to address issues relating to temporary flood barriers that are put in place and the insurance. We are working closely with Insurance Ireland to get over all the technical questions it has on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_356"> With regard to Crossmolina, works are being carried out on cleaning downstream from the bridge. That was done last week. Approximately €150,000 has been allocated for minor works to improve flood barriers along the river in the town. The pilot scheme for the floodgates for the houses is ongoing and they should be installed in the next month. Finally, the major flood relief scheme is being designed currently. Due to the issue with the bridge, consideration is being given to doing the bypass channel. That scheme will come up for exhibition next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_357">8. <b>Deputy David Cullinane</b> asked the <b>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</b> the way it is possible to justify pay increases for Deputies in April 2017 and again in January 2018 in view of the fact there was a 10 cent increase in the minimum wage and very little of substance in the budget for low and middle income families; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_358">How is it possible to justify pay increases for the Taoiseach, Ministers, Deputies and Senators at a time when public servants are engaging in industrial action due to genuine concerns about their pay? Strike action has been threatened by teachers and members of An Garda Síochána. Whoever came up with the proposed increase arrived at the appropriate date, April Fools' Day, to introduce it. How can the Minister stand over pay increases and pay restoration for Deputies and politicians on 1 April next?</p>

            <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_359">There is always a difficulty in having any group decide their own pay and that is particularly the case for those involved in public life. I remind Deputies that the principle that parliamentarians should be paid is a fundamental part of how we support our democratic process. If we do not pay our parliamentarians a wage to reflect the responsibilities they have, we will confine our pool of potential politicians to those of independent means or, in a worse case scenario, to those who might be beholden to others. We are all aware of the risks that can pose to the proper practice of politics.</p>
            <p eId="para_360"> The question therefore becomes what is a reasonable rate of pay for the responsibilities involved and who should decide this. Some Members will recall the recommendation of the 38th report of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector in 2000 that the pay of Deputies should be linked to the principal officer grade in the Civil Service. That recommendation was based on independent and expert consideration of the level of responsibility and the commensurate level of pay. The review body also recommended that Senators be paid 70% of the Teachta Dála rate. The Government of the day accepted that recommendation and the pay of Deputies has followed this link ever since, including through the pay cuts of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, FEMPI, and now through the pay restoration measures involved in the unwinding of that same legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_361"> The FEMPI legislation provided for pay reductions for all public servants on a progressive basis. Similarly, provision for all public servants was included in the phased unwinding of the FEMPI measures. Of course, notwithstanding the enactment of the FEMPI Act 2015, it remains open to Members of the Oireachtas to forego the restoration of the pay reduction on a voluntary basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_362">The Minister referred to a fair wage for Members of the Oireachtas and said that the wage should reflect the responsibilities we have. We are very well paid, and I am sure the Minister accepts that. We receive two and a half times the average industrial wage. Currently, a public sector worker on an average salary of between €35,000 and €40,000 per annum will receive a €1,000 increase or restoration, yet those who are on over €65,000, including Members of the House, will receive a minimum of 8%, which is a total of €5,400. That is an increase of over €100 per week. I do not believe that is justified. The Minister can talk about linking our pay to that of principal officers, but ultimately the decisions are made by this House. We are the people who amended the FEMPI legislation. The Government of the day introduced the FEMPI Act - we opposed it - which unilaterally took money from public servants. People on salaries below €65,000 are not seeing pay restoration. That is the reason they are threatening strike action. People on more than €65,000, including Members of the House, will get increases, and I do not believe that is fair. This is a matter of fairness.</p>

            <p eId="para_363">The Deputy will be aware, although he did not acknowledge it in the question he put to me, that yesterday the Cabinet made the decision that office holders would forfeit the wage restoration that is due under the lifetime of the Lansdowne Road agreement. That decision by this Government, reaffirming the decision of the last Government, was made precisely in recognition of the challenges our country still faces. We acknowledge that the country is recovering but we have always been clear that it is not yet a recovered country. For that reason, anybody who is privileged to be a member of the Government is deeply aware of the challenges that members of the public services and beyond still face. We made the decision, and it was the right decision, to forfeit that phase of wage restoration. I am being very clear about the Government's policy on politicians' pay. I ask the Deputy to clarify Sinn Féin's policy on this matter. For a period of time I heard the party say that politicians should only be paid the average industrial wage. Will the Deputy clarify if that is still the case and, if it is, what is the amount of money?</p>

            <p eId="para_364">That is the greatest red herring I have encountered in a long time - talk about diversionary tactics. I take the average industrial wage. I employ somebody. I have taken somebody off the live register and I pay them €300 per week, which comes out of my salary. I do that voluntarily, not to get any credit. I do it because I provide an enhanced constituency service.</p>
            <p eId="para_365"> I welcome the fact that office holders, as the Minister put it, have forfeited any increases that may be due to them, but logically it should follow that the same should happen in the case of Deputies. Why should Deputies get pay restoration on 1 April next? When the legislation was first brought to the House we put forward amendments to reduce Deputies' pay to €75,000. We voted against the provisions that allowed this to happen in the first place and in a few weeks we will bring forward a motion that will again seek to stop these unfair payments to Deputies. This is not because I do not believe that people should be paid fairly but because I believe it is unfair that somebody on €30,000 or €40,00 per year, an average wage in the public sector, is getting pay restoration of €1,000 while Deputies are expected to take €5,400. It is simply not fair and the Minister must accept that.</p>

It is vital that we adhere to the principle that politicians do not set other politicians' pay. The benefit of this anchor is that it allows the matter to be dealt with in a clear and unprejudiced fashion. I put a question to the Deputy and he still has not answered it. What amount of money does he draw down as his wages? In light of the fact that his party is tabling a Private Members' motion on this matter, will he sign a waiver form and relinquish his share back to the Exchequer?

            <p eId="para_375">While the final details of the proposed approach are currently being examined, I am happy to set out for the Deputy the main current elements of the proposed review of the capital plan. As is normal in respect of a multi-annual capital programme, a commitment was made to conduct a mid-term review in 2017 in order to take stock of progress and provide the Government with an opportunity to reaffirm priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_376"> As the Deputy will be aware, A Programme for a Partnership Government committed to seeking Oireachtas approval for additional capital investment of €4 billion over the period of the plan. This was further increased to €5.14 billion in the summer economic statement. The priority areas which were identified by Government to benefit from this increased funding included transport, broadband, health, education and flood defences. Due to the obvious need for additional investment in housing, the Government also agreed earlier this year that €2.2 billion of the additional capital should be allocated to the Government's initiatives aimed at tackling the housing crisis while in budget 2017, the Government also allocated additional capital funding for 2017 with further consequences for 2018 and 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_377"> In respect of the process about which the Deputy asked, it is my intention that the outcome of the review will be ready in time for publication as part of the 2017 mid-year expenditure report and be available to Government in time to shape the discussion on final capital allocations for 2018 to 2021 in the context of budget 2018. We are commencing this review by seeking submissions from all Government Departments. I am also considering the possibility of wider consultation but I want to ensure that there is an opportunity to use that consultation to influence this process so we conclude it in a timely fashion.</p>

            <p eId="para_379">As part of this review, work will commence on a much more fundamental review of Ireland's long term infrastructural requirements to include a benchmarking of our existing infrastructure by reference to that of other comparable countries, an assessment of our likely infrastructural needs over a much longer term than the current capital plan and consideration of how best these needs can be met. </p>

            <p eId="para_380">This is the last chance saloon for many capital projects such as those in broadband and roads. When one looks at the 2015 capital plan, one can see that €4.4 billion of the €6 billion envisaged for roads went predominantly towards maintaining the existing network so we are not getting any sense of expanding the existing road network. Will the Minister confine the review to current capital spending envelopes or is he going to look at alternative sources of financing? In September, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, raised the prospect of allowing greater flexibility around rules for capital spending to assist Europe. This is in the context of the challenge this country faces from Brexit. As I said previously, we are on the front line with regard to Brexit and we need to up our game with regard with infrastructure to respond to that. Will the Minister look at increased investment from the European Investment Fund or the European Investment Bank that we can draw down on an "off the books" basis to address our infrastructural issues in a proper and cohesive manner?</p>

            <p eId="para_381">The Deputy asked me whether I would consider alternative capital funding sources for capital projects and within that, the relationship we might have with the European Investment Bank. This is an issue I want to consider in terms of our capital review. It will need to look at not just the capital projects that may or may not be progressed but current sources of capital funding and potential sources of such funding in the future. I agree with the Deputy and I believe our relationship with the European Investment Bank and options this could provide in the future need to be looked at again. For example, Luas cross city would not be within a year of being completed nor would the Alexandra Basin project in Dublin Port be underway without the work of the European Investment Bank. I would like to see further opportunities open to us to deliver further funding for further projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_382">What will be the element in the review in respect of the delivery of projects? The Minister mentioned the Luas cross city and the Alexandra Basin projects. We do not have a good record of delivering large-scale infrastructure projects on time and on budget. In the context of what will be a limited capital plan, what extra elements will the Minister introduce to ensure delivery on time, on budget and on a cross-island basis so that it will not just be here in the city but the regions will get a chance to benefit from an infrastructural investment programme arising from this capital review? What weighting will be given not just to regional plans but to communities within the city that are not getting their fair share? A draft report of the inner city group was leaked to the newspapers today which identifies a shortage of community funding. There are capital needs within this city as well that need to be prioritised within this review.</p>

            <p eId="para_383">The answer to the question of how we can better deal with delivering projects on time and in line with their original expectations is the fact that we have a strengthened public service spending code and an entire Department in the form of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that is focused on this area. The creation of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which merged the Rail Procurement Agency and the National Roads Authority, is a significant development in how we deliver big projects better in the future. Its track record in respect of Luas cross city and the delivery of public private partnerships for new roads is a positive and good one. Regional balance will inform this capital programme, as was the case with the previous one. The country's response to Brexit cannot be a Dublin response. It must be a national response and regional consideration is vital in that.</p>

            <p eId="para_386">The 10% reductions in starting pay for certain new entrants were introduced by the then Government in January 2011 as part of the national recovery plan in order to reduce the public service pay bill. The issue of addressing the difference in incremental salary scales between those public servants who entered public service employment since 2011 and those who entered before that date was addressed with the relevant union interests under the provisions of the Haddington Road agreement, HRA. From 1 November 2013, pre and post-2011 pay scales were merged into a single consolidated scale applicable to each grade. Generally, the third point of 1 November 2013 pay scale is equivalent to the first point of scale of the pre-2011 scale. </p>
            <p eId="para_387"> The Lansdowne Road agreement provides the mechanism through which outstanding issues of concern to new recruits to the public service can be addressed in a negotiated way. This is reflected in the recent agreement between my Department, the Department of Education and Skills, the INTO and the TUI in respect of new entrant teacher pay restoration.  Contingent on the introduction of certain reform measures, a new incremental salary scale will be developed which is designed to address the current difference in pay for teachers recruited since 1 February 2012. The revised salary arrangement will be implemented in two phases on 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018. The effect of this will be to assimilate all post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 new entrants to teaching onto a single new salary scale which will incorporate the honours primary degree allowance. This new arrangement will apply to members of the teachers' unions which have signed up to the Lansdowne Road agreement, namely, the INTO and TUI, which is evidence of how the Lansdowne Road agreement can be used to tackle issues of concern to public servants.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_389"> The Government is wholly committed to the implementation of the Lansdowne Road agreement as the most appropriate way for progress to be made on pay restoration and reform of our public services into the future. This agreement shows how the LRA can resolve issues of concern for our public servants.</p>

            <p eId="para_390">The Lansdowne Road agreement is evidence of how it cannot be used to tackle issues of concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_391">This is why ASTI is right and is to be saluted for the actions it is taking. It is an act of intergenerational solidarity among teachers, almost 80% of whom voted for strike action. The majority of them are not affected by this but they understand that people must stand together if they are to defeat the Government and achieve equal pay for equal work. Among the unions that have signed up to the Lansdowne Road agreement, there is not pay equality. There is still a gap of several thousand euro per year. I have the rates here. Over the course of a career, the gap would result in a pay disparity of over €100,000. Does the Minister admit that there is pay discrimination against new entrants which is not based on any justifiable measure and which relates merely to the fact that they are new entrants? How can the Minister stand over such a situation? It is one of the most shameful acts of the Government. It was also a shameful act on the part of the unions that signed up to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_392">I will examine the facts. Under the agreement I negotiated, along with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, with representatives from the INTO and TUI, significant progress was made in terms of in addressing an issue that mattered to the members of those unions. Let us examine the figures involved, none of which the Deputy acknowledged. The Deputy did not acknowledge that the two unions I mentioned raised the issue with the Government and, as a result of their efforts and negotiations with it, achieved progress for their members. Depending on which point of the scale a teacher is on, the highest increase is €7,700 and the increase at the maximum level is €4,300. Over a teacher's career, these gains will be worth €135,000. This has been achieved through the Lansdowne Road agreement and makes progress towards dealing with the issues the unions identified. In the interests of fairness, the Deputy should acknowledge the progress that is being made.</p>

            <p eId="para_393">I do not call it progress when a person who is on a "deal" salary on the first point of the scale will receive €33,000 per year whereas somebody who qualified pre-2011 will receive €39,000. That is a continuation of pay discrimination and it is why it is right that people are fighting against what is happening. The teachers, the Luas workers and the gardaí are showing that if people want to achieve pay restoration and justice, the best way to do so is to engage in struggle and strike action. The Government is preparing to try to recruit people to break the teachers' strike. However, people have seen the example of other workers and understand that this is how to win victories. I do not understand how the Government intends to recruit 1,000 extra nurses into the public health care system while this ongoing pay inequality exists. What will the Government do about it?</p>

            <p eId="para_394">I would not expect the Deputy to acknowledge the argument I have made and he has not done so. The progress being made is being achieved by a change in our economic fortunes that the Deputy said would never happen. He claimed that the country would not get to the point where we would be able to make progress on these matters. We have made progress. The Deputy claimed we were recruiting people on strike pay. Due to the progress the Irish people have made and changes introduced in the recent budget, we will be able to hire more than 4,000 more front-line staff next year. Due to the change that has happened, we will be able not only to honour the wage commitments we have with public servants but we will also make progress - that is affordable for the country - in areas that are important to them. However, it is part of the Deputy's ideological agenda to never acknowledge progress on any matter, let alone that what I have outlined is happening through constructive and progressive engagement between reasonable leaders in the union movement and a Government that is doing its best to make progress with the resources available to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_397">The establishment of a public service pay commission to examine pay levels across the public service is a commitment in the confidence-and-supply agreement and programme for partnership Government. In July, the Government agreed, in principle, to the establishment of a public service pay commission. In line with this decision, my Department had to conduct a public consultation about the role and methodology of the commission. In the aftermath, I brought proposals to the Government and they were agreed yesterday. I thank the Deputy for acknowledging the role of Mr. Kevin Duffy in chairing the commission. Mr. Duffy, as a former chairman of the Labour Court, will bring a strong understanding of these matters to his work with the commission. He has been acknowledged as an impartial figure with great expertise in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_398"> My plan is to appoint a further six members to the commission in the coming days. The role of the commission will be advisory, particularly as it is not appropriate to outsource to another body negotiations on future pay and conditions of public servants. I expect that the commission will provide an initial report to the Government by the second quarter of next year and the broad terms of reference of the commission, as the Deputy has seen, are to provide input to the Government on how we can deliver the affordable unwinding of the FEMPI legislation. The terms of reference lay out a number of areas in which it can engage regarding: the evolution of pay trends; the comparison of pay trends at home and abroad; and the quality and health of our national finances.</p>

            <p eId="para_399">My colleague, Deputy Paul Murphy, referred to the justified case that is being made by my trade union, ASTI, the Garda Síochána, nurses and doctors and a growing list of public service workers who feel that the Government has been very remiss in not just unwinding but getting rid of FEMPI and the whole approach relating thereto. The Minister will be under significant time pressure when he meets the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which he came before a few weeks ago. He will need to have arrangements in place for both the post-Lansdowne Road agreement era and spending over and above the €300 million he expended this year. There is a time factor. What does the Minister intend to do about pensions? There has been some adverse comment about some of the lump sums in the highly-paid top echelons of the public service and the fact that people in the House have restoration, while the workers to whom I referred, and the other workers, do not have the same restoration.</p>

            <p eId="para_400">I acknowledge that we are dealing with some serious challenges in our public services. We must acknowledge that more than 20 unions have signed up to the Lansdowne Road agreement. As a result of this, more than 200,000 civil and public servants are covered by the agreement. While I understand and respect the Deputy's role in raising the issue of those who are outside the Lansdowne Road agreement, I must, in my efforts to deal with the matter, also respect the large number of people who are covered by it. In the initial guidance I provided to the public pay commission, which I look forward to meeting soon, I referenced pensions and asked that they be taken into account in any input it provides to the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_401">The Minister will appoint the six members. I hope that they will be representatives of the trade union movement, industry and the public service in order to provide the kind of background that is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_402"> What is the Minister's opinion on the cost and continuing work of the body? I referred to the role of IFAC. The Minister is not putting the new body on a statutory basis. Will it continue? It is outside the industrial relations machinery. Has the Minister prioritised for it the aim of getting rid of FEMPI and restoring public service pay, given the fact that our citizens in the public service are generally low paid and bore the brunt of the banking crash? The CPSU trade union has cautiously welcomed the commission's establishment, but it mentioned that we needed to be cognisant of the fact that the cost of living in Ireland was one of the highest in the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_403">Regarding the Deputy's observation on the need for a representative panel on the pay commission, I do not want to put together a group of people whose job it is to represent any individual sector. Were I to do so, I would be undermining the fabric of the organisation. However, I am committed to putting together a panel to assist Mr. Duffy in his work that will be diverse and broadly based. In appointing Mr. Duffy to this body, I hope that I have signalled my intention to put people in place who have a broad-based appreciation of the challenges to which Deputy Broughan referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_404"> As to the question of the body being on an administrative footing, it is my intention that the commission will be non-statutory. I am cognisant of the timeframe that the Deputy outlined and I want to have the body in place as soon as the consultation process is complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_405"> The commission is meant to make an input into the unwinding of FEMPI, but that unwinding must take place in a way that is affordable for everyone.</p>

            <p eId="para_409">I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 23 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_410"> Officials from my Department and the Department of Education and Skills met the ASTI regarding the union's concerns on 7 July, 18 August and 13 September. The issues of new entrant teachers' pay and supervision and substitution payments among other matters were discussed in respect of ASTI members, forming the focus of those meetings. Notwithstanding these engagements between the parties, it has not been possible to date to reach an agreement on issues of direct mutual concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_411"> The inconclusive outcome of the ASTI meetings is in contrast with the agreement reached between the two Departments and the TUI and INTO on new entrant pay. This agreement will result in increases of up to €2,000 per year for new teachers at the start of their careers. The estimated value of these increases over a teacher's career is €135,000. This agreement gives substantial benefits to new teachers and shows what is possible through dialogue and negotiation within the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_412"> I will provide a practical example that highlights the increases over the period 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2018 for new entrants who commenced in 2014 and have signed up to the agreement. The starting point of 31 August 2016 is €33,168. The point on 1 January 2018, including increments, new entrant pay restoration, supervision and substitution, and the Lansdowne Road agreement increase, is €39,482. This is an increase of €6,314 between the end of this summer and the start of 2018, representing a percentage restoration and gain of 19%.</p>

            <p eId="para_413">We discussed some of this issue on the previous question. The fact remains that, even with the agreement of the INTO and TUI, significant pay inequality and discrimination against new entrants persist. This is why the strike is going ahead regardless of whether the Minister likes it, that is, unless there is a resolution and the Government concedes on the key issue of pay equality.</p>
            <p eId="para_414"> Will the Minister comment on the advertisements reported in today's newspapers that offer parents and members of the public the opportunity on a paid basis to supervise in schools where strike action is due to take place? I referenced strike breaking earlier and, to me, this is nothing if not strike breaking. Has the Minister approved the projected expenditure by the Department of Education and Skills that may arise from funding this strike breaking? Does he believe that this is a good approach to take to the dialogue with the ASTI or in terms of setting parents against their children's teachers or parents teaching their children that they should break strikes? It is not.</p>

            <p eId="para_415">My overriding message in light of where we stand with the ASTI and the representative bodies of An Garda Síochána is the need for continued engagement in the coming days and into next week between them and both Departments. It is vital that the Government's proposals and the framework offered by the Lansdowne Road agreement be used to determine whether an affordable agreement can be reached for those organisations, cognisant of the broader needs of the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_416"> Regarding the Deputy's analysis of where we stand and reverting to Deputy Broughan's previous question, the further restoration of pay will be a consequence of the unwinding of FEMPI legislation over time. That unwinding can only happen when the resources and funding are available to the State to do it. I am clear in my commitment to make that happen, but I must also fund new and existing public services and meet the needs of many across society who have a claim on the use of Exchequer resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_417">I return to my question on strike breaking and the attempt to recruit parents into same against striking teachers. If that is what the Government favours and has approved, how does that marry with any idea of being open to negotiation, the importance of dialogue, etc.? It appears to be part of a pattern of behaviour to try to undermine the ASTI because it has stood up in the face of discrimination against new entrants. We have already seen this in the Department's instruction that ASTI members be discriminated against in the allocation of additional hours. It is perverse that the State is offering payment to strike bearers for supervision duties when a part of the ASTI's campaign is the restoration of supervision pay for its members and the refusal to work enforced and unpaid hours.</p>

            <p eId="para_418">I am not aware of the advertisements to which the Deputy referred, but the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, has made it clear that he wants to do everything possible to minimise the disruption caused by the closure of secondary schools across the country, if we get to that point. The Minister is mindful of the difficulties and challenges that will be created within schools, but he is also conscious of the challenges that will be created for families if the schools close.</p>
            <p eId="para_419"> Deputy Paul Murphy called this an attempt at strike breaking, but the alternative way of looking at it is that the Department of Education and Skills is seeking to put in place measures to minimise the disruption to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_420">I have listened with interest to the way in which the Deputy has described unions that have signed up to the Lansdowne Road agreement. The Deputy has described them as acting in a manner that he does not agree with. I am confident that if we get to a point at which we can resolve this with the ASTI, the Deputy will come in and condemn it for doing so as well. Deputy Murphy's interest is not in the welfare of teachers or in dealing with issues in a way that is affordable for all. His interest is in pursuit of a political agenda that will not meet the needs of teachers in a way that our country can afford.</p>

I have made the point about how budget day announcements fail in many cases to meet the need on the ground in various different services such as health, education, local government etc. Are we going to look at that, at how spending gets to services on the ground and at how it makes a difference to people's lives? Will the review be pre-determined or is the Minister going to open up the scope of it for consultation beforehand? I presume the Minister has a savings target in mind. Has he? Is the purpose of the review either to improve and enhance services or to deliver savings? In terms of the spending reviews in Ireland and their lessons for the future, what kind of consultation or involvement will there be within Government and with people who will be affected by this review?</p>

            <p eId="para_426">The main way we will deal with the consultation needs within the Oireachtas that the Deputy outlined will be through engagement with the relevant Oireachtas committee. It would appear to me at this stage that the best committee for engaging with this process would be the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. I am open to feedback from colleagues on that. There will be a savings figure that we will look to establish. At this point, I have not established what that figure will be. I am very open to engaging with groups and stakeholders in conducting this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_427"> On the Deputy's final point about whether it will track the impact on services on the ground, the only way we could do that would be to pick a certain number of particular areas and prioritise those within the approach. If we were to look at the totality of Government spending and its impact on front-line services, we would not complete it inside the time I want. We published some examples on budget day of how this could be done when we looked in particular at the impact of the availability of medical cards and social services to young people to offer a baseline approach as to how this work could be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_431">This is a question on the potential for savings that could be achieved if there was a cap on public service pensions of €50,000 per year.

            <p eId="para_432">Based on data sets that are available to my Department in respect of public service pensioners across all sectors, it is estimated that savings of the order of €85 million per year would be generated for the public finances if pensions were capped at €50,000. I should point out, however, that the payment rates and award levels of higher value public service pensions have been significantly decreased under the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation. These decreases are attributable in particular to the public service pension reduction, PSPR, measure, which is in place since 1 January 2011 and was made more severe for most pensions above €34,000 on 1 July 2013. </p>
            <p eId="para_433"> While FEMPI 2015 amelioration provisions mean that the burden on pensioners is being eased over the 2016 to 2018 period to the particular benefit of those receiving low to middle value affected pensions, higher value pensions and specifically most of those in excess of €50,000 will continue to be paid at a reduced rate following the completion of that amelioration on 1 January 2018.  These phased PSPR changes across the public service will cost an estimated €90 million annually in 2018 and will ensure that the top 20% higher value public service pensions will continue to be impacted by the PSPR.</p>

            <p eId="para_435">The Minister is aware that I am a big fan of community employment schemes, but the success of a community employment scheme is utterly dependent on its supervisor. Since 1998, there has been an issue around pensions for supervisors. In the Labour Court in 2008, it was decided that community employment scheme supervisors should be given a pension. Many of them have worked for decades on community employment schemes and have provided a huge service to their community. The issue was being dealt with by the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, who established a community sector informal forum at Department of Public Expenditure and Reform level. There does not seem to have been much activity in recent months since the Minister came to office. I want to get a sense of where it is at.</p>

            <p eId="para_436">I am aware of the issues being discussed in, and the activities of, the community sector higher level forum, or the working group, which was convened to examine certain issues pertaining to the community employment sector, having regard to the consequences for costs and precedent. This includes community and employment supervisors and assistant supervisors who have been seeking, through their union representatives, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme dating back to 2008, as the Deputy acknowledged.  The forum met on 27 November 2015 and on 11 April 2016.  I plan to appoint a new chair soon and future meetings will be planned once the appointment is made.</p>
            <p eId="para_437">Our position has always been that FÁS or the Department of Social Protection is not the employer and that it is not possible for the State to provide funding for such a scheme to employees of private companies even if those companies are, or were, reliant on State funding.  In considering the matter, I must have regard to costs and the precedent of such an arrangement were one to be created but my plan is, mindful of the fact that this working group has not met for a number of months, to appoint a chairman and restore the process that was under way.</p>

            <p eId="para_438">This goes back to 1998 when the Labour Court linked community employment scheme supervisors with managers in community training workshops. FÁS set aside €2.75 million to pay towards pensions. Most companies that run CE schemes just about have the resources to provide the budgets to run them and, therefore, pension schemes do not happen. I welcome the fact that the Minister is about to re-establish the working group within his Department but given many of the supervisors are approaching retirement age, urgency is needed to address the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_439">I will put in place a chairman to get that work under way again. This relates to the debate I had with Deputies Murphy and Broughan earlier as one of the issues I face is the knock-on effects of such an arrangement across other sectors. For example, there are more than 3,000 section 39 bodies in the health sector. They are in receipt of State funding and they have their own employees. They have the welfare of their employees at heart but I have to consider what precedent would be set were an arrangement put in place for the community sector given the individuals employed in the sector are ultimately not employed by the State, even if many of the services they provide are funded by the State. However, I accept this is a serious matter and I will put a chairman in place and ensure the working group meets soon.</p>

            <p eId="para_442">I am raising an important issue which has implications for public expenditure and education and housing sectors, which is the lack of borrowing power for IOTs. This key issue has been raised with me by sectoral representatives since my appointment as education spokesperson. They cannot borrow to build student accommodation, the result of which is the rental markets in the areas around the institutes is out of sync, even more so than the general market, because they cannot build accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_443">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 30 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_444"> A key consideration in relation to the scope for independent borrowing by institutions in the higher education sector is whether the subsequent expenditure funded by the borrowings is classified as falling inside the general government sector and, therefore, whether it impacts on the general government balance.  A detailed framework is in place under EU law, implemented at national level by the CSO, for classifying what entities in the economy are part of or outside of the general government sector and how their expenditure impacts on the general government balance. It is, therefore, not just a matter for the IOT sector in term of whether institutes can borrow. One of the questions is how that borrowing would be classified on the national balance sheet.</p>
            <p eId="para_445"> Universities have traditionally enjoyed autonomous borrowing powers on account of their classification as outside general government.  Borrowings by universities are off-balance sheet and do not impact on general government debt and this reflects a combination of the autonomy of such institutions and their capacity to generate own income, allowing them to meet the so-called "market test". However, these considerations do not apply to IOTs.  Unlike universities they are classified as inside general government. Consequently, their expenditure impacts on the general government balance and their borrowing contributes to the general government debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_446"> The Deputy referred to the impact on the rental sector and accommodation. I have some appreciation for this matter because of the prominence and scale of DIT within my constituency and I am aware of the accommodation needs of students and the impact that has on the rental sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_447"> The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government recently published the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 which includes an enabling provision that would facilitate higher education institutes to borrow moneys from the Housing Finance Agency for the purpose of financing student accommodation provision. However, we still have to resolve the issue of how that borrowing would be classified and the impact it could have on other expenditure plans by the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_448">Many Members, including myself, have been vocal about the need for a borrowing framework to be put in place for IOTs. DIT is building student accommodation in Grangegorman but the mechanism it is using to finance it is costing more than it would if DIT had the same borrowing power as universities. That will feed into increased rents for students, which means this is a lose-lose scenario.</p>
            <p eId="para_449"> Thankfully, the general government debt is very much on its way down. Surely there is scope to provide for modest borrowing by IOTs. Ten years ago, it was envisaged that they would have the power to borrow but this has not been acted on. This is an urgent issue. Ministers and officials can have all the meetings they want, with the Department of Education and Skills meeting the Minister's Department and the housing Department pushing another provision but action is needed quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_450"> I spoke to one IOT president who had visited America. He met students who wanted to attend his institute but their parents asked him where they would stay and he had nowhere to put them. If he were able to borrow money, he would be able to put them up and it would be a win-win scenario for everybody.</p>

This is the reason an enabling provision has been included in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016.

            <p eId="para_453">The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which has just been published. I will then need to deal with the issue of IOTs being able to access that borrowing because they do not all have the same financial health and cannot borrow in the same way. Great strides have been made in delivering more student accommodation around DIT and elsewhere but in recognition of the challenge this has created, the enabling provision has been included in the Bill. My officials and I are engaging with the Department of Education and Skills on this matter. We will keep the Deputy informed. No doubt he will raise it again in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_455">Others do not have it all. We want a proper student rental sector which has less impact on the general sector and I think the Minister wants that too.

            <p eId="para_458">Brexit represents one of the biggest challenges to the State since 1922. As I said in the first debate we had in the House just after the vote in the UK, there should be a Minister for Brexit here. Fianna Fáil has now taken a similar position. The issue is so important and critical to our future that we should adopt that position. The Minister has allocated certain moneys in the budget to address Brexit, including the farmers' loan and the continuation of the 9% VAT rate, which is very expensive. Tourism from the UK is already down 12% in recent months. However, the actual figure the Minister has allocated for Brexit <i>per se</i> is very small. How does the Minister interact with the Taoiseach's committee and what kind of funding will be needed in the next few years?</p>

            <p eId="para_459">I am a member of the Taoiseach's committee and attended a further meeting of it this morning along with the Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. I anticipate that the committee will meet even more frequently in the coming weeks and months. At meetings of the committee, I am obliged to update the Taoiseach and other Ministers on work I am undertaking in respect of dealing with the consequences of Brexit. Deputy Broughan acknowledged the provisions in the budget to deal with the consequences of Brexit. These include funding we have put in place for the regional development plan, the rural development plan and agriculture. The decision on the 9% VAT rate was taken in the context of Brexit and the effect it might have on our tourism and services sector. I have also provided additional current funding to allow Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to hire more people to work abroad and represent our companies. Those are measures we have put in place to deal with the consequences of Brexit.</p>
            <p eId="para_460"> On the need for a Brexit-focused Minister, I respectfully take a different view to the Deputy. This is a matter of such importance to the State that it is more appropriate that our approach to it be headed up by the Taoiseach. Other countries are taking a different approach and I am keeping on eye on that to see if it is working elsewhere. Mindful, however, of its importance, the only way it can be done is to have it headed up directly by the Department of the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach holds all Ministers to account for action steps to which we have committed in respect of dealing with Brexit.</p>

            <p eId="para_461">It is likely that when Article 50 is triggered next spring, the challenge will intensify and grow deeper. We have a particular responsibility to our own workers, jobs in this country, agriculture and the Common Fisheries Policy, about which hardly anyone has spoken so far. My own constituency has an interest in both fisheries and the fact that there may well be profound changes in that area. Most of all, there is the issue of the future status of Northern Ireland and the fact that we want it to have a special status. Clearly, Brexit has huge implications in that regard. The desire of the House has always been to have a national union of our country. Hopefully, that will happen. The circumstances which are now evolving in the North, however, with the responsibility of the Executive, as well as in Scotland and possibly Wales and England itself, may well accelerate the situation. Have other Departments come to the Minister to ask for additional resources as the Brexit process intensifies next year?</p>

            <p eId="para_462">Yes, they have in the context of discussions we had on the recent budget. In particular, I was approached by the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. There was also a particular focus on Brexit by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton. Much of his focus was on the development of the third-level education sector here in the context of the challenges we face with Brexit and the pressure that will be exerted on our universities and institutes of technology in the coming years. It was a process in which additional spending requests were made to me. I did my best to respond to them and it played a significant role in the decision we made on the allocation of funding for education and in respect of where we ended up with agriculture, in particular, and the funding for State agencies such as IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. Deputy Broughan is correct that when the actual decision to trigger Article 50 is made, this will have further consequences, not least of which should be that in the run-up to this the nature of the Brexit the British Government is looking to achieve will become clear. Fisheries policy was discussed as recently as this morning and it is acknowledged as a significant issue of concern.</p>

We are in constant communication with them on this, in particular as we approach the end of 2016. There is very regular reporting to Government on these matters and information is published monthly and made available to me as part of the Exchequer statement. In terms of where we stand at present, gross voted expenditure of €39.836 billion to the end of September was €439 million below profile. Gross current expenditure of €364 million was 1% below profile and capital expenditure was 3.4% below profile. The matter is checked regularly by my Department and the line Departments. The direct answer to the Deputy's question as to whether I expect Ministers to come in on budget and deliver the services to which they have committed for 2016 is "Yes".</p>

            <p eId="para_469">This is a question we put to the Minister very strongly at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. Projections to 2021 indicate that capital spending is barely keeping pace with depreciation. Professor Tom McDonnell of the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, made that point to us most strongly. In fact, the figures he gave us showed that they are below normal accounting depreciation rates. That is a matter of grave concern. We have talked about our infrastructure, including metro north and having a proper road network for the north west and west as well as all the other capital needs of the country, especially housing.

            <p eId="para_470">As to where we are for this year and next year, following the recent revision to our national income, or GDP, figures, the Department of Finance expects Ireland's nominal gross domestic product for 2017 to be approximately €275 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_471">Therefore, the current State-backed investment plans for next year will stand at 2.5% of nominal gross domestic product and 3.1% of nominal gross national product.</p>
            <p eId="para_472"> The Deputy's question was where they stand versus other countries. I have acknowledged to the Deputy and the budget oversight committee that we need to rebuild our capital expenditure in light of the growth that has occurred in our economy. We can see the pressure that growth has created in existing infrastructure, whether that is in skills, housing or transport. We also need to build it because if we do not, we will not be able to maintain or accelerate current levels of growth. That is the reason we will commence a review of the current capital plan next year and have it complete by the summer. It is also the reason I aim to allocate an additional €5 billion on top of the €27 billion available for capital investment. My expectation is that at the end of that capital plan, we will bring up for the final two years our investment in capital infrastructure as a percentage of our national income into line with countries with which we compete. The real goal in value will be to keep that level of capital investment flat for years afterwards, so it neither peaks nor goes into a trough from that level and it keeps a steady pace of investment in our schools, roads and other forms of infrastructure, such as metro north.</p>

            <p eId="para_473">I mentioned housing and we need to ramp up the construction of social housing by at least 10,000 units per year. In the alternative budget that I submitted, I spoke about having an additional €1 billion for housing this year and every year until 2021 or until we get rid of the horrendous experiences being suffered by people in the city tonight. With regard to transport, we speak of metro north and we were meant to be hopping on metro north in 2026. Perhaps we could do with it in 2021 or 2022, particularly with the expansion of the airport and so on. With education and health, we are just keeping up with demographics, so we need major development.</p>
            <p eId="para_474"> We heard some worrying aspects of this at the budget committee meetings. The rainy day fund is a great idea and we had it before with McCreevy's money but, unfortunately, it went into the banks. It seems we will have a rainy day fund and yet we are skimping on investment. In particular, there is a new debt figure formulated by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, when he said we must hit the 45% debt-to-GDP ratio. Why on earth would we do that when we desperately need housing, transport and so on?</p>

            <p eId="para_475">With regard to current levels of investment, we are looking to do more than just keep up with demographics, particularly in education and health. One of the benefits of the new approach that has been adopted in how we class government expenditure is that we set aside the portion due for demographics. I have always acknowledged that we must hire a certain number of teachers just to maintain class sizes as they are due to the effect of demographics. We recognised that in what we publish, and the same applies in health issues and our social welfare system. We want to increase this in the way I have outlined to the Deputy, although this depends on our economy growing at a moderate rate across the next five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_476"> With regard to the debt figure set by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the objective is to move to that debt figure across the 2020s. I support the objective as it is to precisely create the kind of buffer zone in our national debt so that if we get hit again by external forces, as happened in recent years, we will have health within our national finances to allow us to respond in a way that we have not been able to in recent years.</p>

            <p eId="para_479">This has happened in the past according to submissions that Departments made to my Department. For example, the Department of Education and Skills would highlight what it believes to be the main educational priorities, and the same would happen for other Departments. We are looking to operate differently with this capital review process. My Department will outline our long-term infrastructural advantages and what we believe to be our long-term infrastructural deficiencies. In addition to the feedback I will receive from Departments, my objective is for my Department to centrally generate a more formal view on this matter; we will use both of these to fund choices made on additional capital projects or in pulling forward existing capital commitments. It is important that this is done. Each Minister does a fine job of arguing what he or she believes to be in his or Department's interest but it will be helpful to have a more centrally generated view of how we can best allocate the resources of the taxpayer.</p>

            <p eId="para_481">Yes, I have. In the Estimates process that we went through for the 2017 budget, I asked Departments to specify, where possible, over a three-year timeframe what would be their particular capital needs. Not all Departments were able to do it but most were and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, put forward a view on the capital needs required for the third and fourth level sectors in coming years. My objective is that by putting in place a more formal review of the capital plan, every Department will have the opportunity to do this.</p>
            <p eId="para_482"> As we put together this process, I want a project-based approach to emerge. We should not go back to the point where we say there is a certain amount available to complete a project. The projects chase the money in those cases and the costs would increase. At other points in our history, we spent more on such projects than we should have. That is why I want to use a project-based approach to making decisions on the funding I referred to.</p>

            <p eId="para_483">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. A number of those Departments, such as that dealing with housing, are key to the future economic and social well-being of the country. In the past few days I received a quote from a system builder to the effect that he could build houses for €125,000 per unit. They would be perfectly passable and good houses and they could deal with the emergency that has arisen. Similar emergencies may arise in health or education, and it is in respect of those issues that I am asking the Minister if he is conscious of and generating an urgency and awareness within those Departments through the Ministers of what might have to be done in the not too distant future.</p>

            <p eId="para_484">Yes. In trying to respond to the kind of issues referred to by the Deputy, we have already decided and made it clear to the relevant Minister, Deputy Coveney, that from the additional resources that we believe will be available to the country for the coming years, we will allocate a large portion to the Department dealing with housing. From the €5.3 billion that should be available in the coming years for additional capital funding, we have already allocated €2.2 billion to housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_485">We have done that in recognition of the housing needs to which the Deputy referred. An issue I am very much aware of is the need to ensure developers and local authorities can make use of land they own or planning permissions they already have. A constraint we are seeing of late relates to a failure to ensure roads are built, infrastructure is developed and utilities are put in place, all of which is happening because local authorities do not have sufficient funding. From 1 January, we will have in place a local housing infrastructure fund of €200 million to address that problem. We have already seen a huge amount of interest in that fund.</p>

            <p eId="para_488">No provision was made in budget 2017 for additional pay restoration to public servants, beyond the commitments already entered into under the Lansdowne Road agreement. Budget 2017 allocated €290 million for the implementation of the agreement. An additional €10 million was allocated to the Department of Education and Skills for the implementation of a revised salary scale for new-entrant teachers, as recently agreed with teaching unions through the mechanism of the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_489"> However, the public service pay bill is a function of both pay rates and numbers and, in response to the critical need to support front-line service delivery, the estimate for gross pay in 2017 in the budget is €16.3 billion, which is €660 million more than the 2016 revised allocation of €15.7 billion.

            <p eId="para_491">That was an interesting answer to a question I did not get to introduce. The Minister has had to answer a lot of questions today about the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland and the Garda Síochána unions that are outside the Lansdowne Road agreement. It is my understanding that olive branches are being offered to Garda representatives and some attempts are being made to deal with the concerns of teachers who did not sign up to the agreement. When the Minister says no provision has been made for any extra payment for workers outside the agreement, it begs the question of why he is bothering to talk to them at all. If they agree to come into the tent and say "Yes, Sir; No, Sir; three bags full, Sir", what will happen then? What is the plan if members of ASTI accept all the terms of the Lansdowne Road agreement and agree to continue to do supervisory duties for nothing, as they did until 30 June under the Haddington Road agreement, or if gardaí agree to make some concessions? According to the Minister, there is no extra money to provide for that eventuality.</p>
            <p eId="para_492"> The fundamental point remains that the Government was well aware there were groups of workers who remained outside the Lansdowne Road agreement and it should have made provision to deal with that. Every trade union is entitled to a free vote on provisions under a certain deal. Teachers have given 36 hours of work for free per year as per the Haddington Road arrangements and are now being told by the Government they will be isolated and made an example of. How will the Minister deal with that? Ultimately, he will have to sit down and speak to the teachers.</p>

            <p eId="para_493">Of course I recognise the right of any trade union to form a view on these matters and vote accordingly on any proposal that is put in front of members. However, in the Deputy's analysis she makes no reference to all of those unions that are inside the Lansdowne Road agreement. What about the 20 plus unions that are on side and the more than 250,000 civil and public servants they represent? We must honour our obligations to them, which is what we have done in the budget. While I understand the Deputy's need to focus on people who are outside the agreement, we also must acknowledge those who voted to be inside the agreement. That agreement has demonstrated our capacity to fund and deliver responses to issues raised by members of unions. It enabled us to agree a proposal with the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, the Teachers Union of Ireland and the Irish National Teachers Organisation in regard to new-entrant pay. It helped us to devise a proposal on rent allowance for new entrants to An Garda Síochána.</p>

It was the leadership of those unions which accepted the deal, not the membership. In the case of the workers to whom I am referring, they clearly rejected the constraints of the Lansdowne Road agreement and, as a result, we are facing strikes by teachers and gardaí. The Minister will have to sit down with the unions concerned and resolve the issues at some point. He is saying there is no provision in the budget to do so.

            <p eId="para_505">I will be brief. I hope the Minister of State will be able to answer my questions about the assessment of needs for children with disabilities in the Dublin Mid-West constituency. This is a crisis of our time, in some ways. The position in my locality is mirrored across the State, where there are huge waiting times for children to be assessed. Given that early intervention is of key importance, why are children having to wait so long?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Helen McEntee)<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_506">I thank the Deputy for raising this extremely important issue. The Minister of State with responsibility for this area, Deputy Finian McGrath, sends his apologies. I am pleased to take this opportunity to update Deputy Kenny and the House on the progress that is being made in developing services for children with disabilities and on the current position regarding waiting times for assessments of need.</p>
            <p eId="para_507"> As the Deputy has pointed out, waiting times are far too long in some instances. The HSE recognises that early intervention services and services for school-age children with disabilities need to be improved and organised more effectively. To this end, a major reconfiguration of therapy resources for children with disabilities up to the age of 18 is under way. This national programme, Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People, involves bringing staff from different service providers together into network teams. The aim of the programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery. It provides for a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services regardless of where they live, what school they attend or the nature of their difficulties. It places a stronger emphasis on the health and education sectors working more closely together to support children with special needs to achieve their potential. The implementation of the programme is taking place on a phased basis in consultation with stakeholders, including service users and their families. It is a key priority in the HSE's service plan. It is estimated that by the end of the year, 76 of the 129 teams will be reconfigured. Under the Disability Act 2005, a child can request an assessment of need. Since the Act commenced, the number of requests for assessments appears to vary across the country. The level of requests is higher in areas where the reconfiguration of children's disability services has yet to take place. This would suggest that where a good service is being provided, the need for assessments is reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_508"> The HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in meeting the statutory timeframes that apply to the assessment of need process. It is aware that there is a significant backlog in carrying out assessments of need in Deputy Kenny's constituency of Dublin Mid-West. This is due to a number of vacancies in key roles. I am pleased to report that the recruitment process to fill these posts has been completed and successful candidates will take up these roles in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_509"> The current programme for Government commits the Government to improving services and increasing supports for people with disabilities, particularly for early assessment and intervention for children with special needs. Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in services for children with disabilities over recent years. As the Deputy will be aware, health-related therapy supports and interventions for children are provided through the HSE's primary care services and its specialist disability services, depending on the level of the child's need.</p>
            <p eId="para_510"> In 2013, additional funding of €20 million was allocated to strengthen primary care services and support the recruitment of over 260 prioritised front-line primary care posts, including 52 occupational therapists and 52 speech and language therapists. In 2016, funding of €4 million was provided under the HSE's national service plan to focus specifically on speech and language therapy waiting lists in primary care services and social care for children up to the age of 18. This investment represents a long-term increase in speech and language capacity that will be maintained into next year. Arising from budget 2017, the HSE is looking at how extra funds provided for disability services will be allocated. In particular, it will be asked to build on previous investments in therapeutic supports. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will outline in greater detail how that money will be spent in line with the service plan after that plan has been approved.</p>

            <from>Deputy Gino Kenny<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_511">I think we have a problem because waiting times are so long that they contravene the Disability Act 2005. Essentially, this means children are waiting for services for more than six months. The State is breaking its own law. This has serious implications for the State and for the children who are not being seen. There is a possibility that families will bring the State to court because their children are not being seen on time. The statistics are quite incredible. Many children have been waiting for these services for up to 18 months. Approximately 2,000 children under the age of five are waiting for occupational therapy services. Some 20,000 children are waiting to see speech and language therapists. According to Inclusion Ireland, the speech and language services one receives are greatly influenced by where one lives. There are 162 children for every therapist in Ireland at the moment. It is recommended that there should be a therapist for every 30 to 65 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_512"> Major questions arise when children and their families get assessments of need, but the bigger question is the waiting time for occupational therapy services, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. In this day and age, nobody should be waiting more than six months, but that is happening in Dublin Mid-West and across the country. There are huge waiting times of over 18 months in Cork, for example. It is not acceptable, especially in a year when we are marking the 100th anniversary of 1916. The Proclamation refers to "cherishing all the children of the nation", but at this moment in time the State is not cherishing its children. It is actually failing them. That has serious and profound consequences for families and for the State. I have to say it is a shame that this country cannot provide crucial early intervention services to children in their time of need.</p>

            <p eId="para_513">I agree with the Deputy that we need to focus on the requirements and needs of the child. There has been no clear pathway up until now. We have had a disjointed pathway. I hope we will start to see a new process as part of the reconfiguration of services. These issues will not be resolved without co-operation between the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs. Obviously, resources are being reconfigured.</p>
            <p eId="para_514"> As I have mentioned, we have started to see improvements in the 76 teams, of the total of 129 teams, which have already been reconfigured. That process needs to be hastened so that improvements are made as quickly as possible. We know that the earlier we identify the needs of a child or young person, the easier it is to fulfil that process. That requires staff, teams and the filling of posts. That needs to be a priority. As I have said, vacancies have been filled in Deputy Kenny's area of Dublin Mid-West. However, there are still many such vacancies throughout the country. This needs to be a priority. I will take the Deputy's remarks back to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath. I am sure he will outline in due course where he intends to spend his additional funding within the service plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_515">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter, which deserves attention within the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Health, for discussion. It relates to the proposed Lusk community 2020 sports plan. This is a community-based collaborative effort involving representatives of local sporting groups and the support of local primary and secondary schools in Lusk, north County Dublin, to put in place a long-term plan the objective of which is to improve the health of members of the local community. In essence, this is a local public health strategy focused on sport and physical activity that will benefit everyone in the town and its environs.</p>
            <p eId="para_516"> In coming together, local sports organisations, the community council and schools have worked to develop a strategy by which they can prioritise their needs and pool their resources to ensure the maximum impact and benefit in the community. The initiative is ambitious. The approach examines the demographics of the local community and carries out a sporting needs analysis or assessment. By taking demographics into account on a localised basis, the project allows for a focus to be placed upon increasing participation in sport and physical activity in line with population growth and the demographic characteristics of Lusk and its environs.</p>
            <p eId="para_517"> Fingal is the fastest-growing local community according to the past three censuses and has the youngest age demographic in the State. The approach outlined in the plan could have remarkable benefits for towns and villages throughout the country. It could allow for the identification and prioritisation of sporting infrastructure and investment to meet the needs of residents, while ensuring that resources are provided to allow all age groups to engage in sport and physical activity. In the case of Lusk, the sport needs analysis has allowed for the identification of priority sporting facilities required to serve the needs of the people in the town and surrounding communities. Once developed, these facilities will be available for other local sporting clubs and organisations as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_518"> The project has received a great deal of support from Fingal County Council. The local authority will be transferring land to Lusk 2020 for the development of a sports hub in the community. This will be an important advancement of the overall strategy. While it is positive to see the local authority supporting Lusk 2020, I believe there is also an opportunity for the Government to assist the local community in achieving the goals set out in the plan. I call on the Minister of State to review the documents relating to Lusk 2020. I would be more than happy to supply these to him. Furthermore, I call on the Minister of State to examine the investment opportunities which may be open to Lusk 2020 and how the Government can best assist those involved to realise their objective of promoting the uptake of sport and physical activity as part of a healthy lifestyle for members of the local community of all ages. I imagine that, upon examination, the Minister of State will identify the innovative nature of Lusk 2020 and how it can provide a template upon which similar strategies could be developed for local communities throughout the State. The Lusk 2020 plan is a prime example of people in local communities putting the needs and the health of the entire community to the fore of the agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_519"> I am pleased to support Lusk 2020 and I commend all those involved in bringing the project this far. Most importantly, I am keen to mention by name a former councillor, John Paul Browne, who recently resigned from Fingal County Council to pursue other ventures. In any event, his work on this project, along with that of dozens of other people in my constituency, was excellent. I hope the Minister of State will assess this project with a view to the potential collaboration or use of this programme as a template throughout the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_520">I apologise for being late. I had understood my issue was the third to be taken. I apologise to the Ceann Comhairle for delaying the proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_521"> On my behalf and on that of the officials in my Department, I wish to extend my sympathy to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on the passing of his mother, Ruth Isabel Ross. This is the first opportunity I have had to say as much in the House. As the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, I wish to formally extend my sympathies to the family of Anthony Foley on his passing. Go ndéana Dia trócaire orthu.</p>
            <p eId="para_522"> I welcome the opportunity to respond to Deputy Farrell's topical issue on Lusk 2020. In recent years, there has been a certain level of engagement between sports partnerships, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and local communities. This is something we are trying to continue, build on and develop. I compliment Fingal County Council on the manner in which it has embraced this process in recent years through initiatives undertaken by the council as well as with local sports partnerships throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_523"> There is an important aspect to this from the point of view of the Dáil and the Oireachtas in general. Many Members will be keen to ensure that projects are included in the sports capital programme for 2017 and they have been pressing me on the matter. I will be announcing details shortly in this regard. Deputy Farrell is correct about the importance of the sports capital programme and the investment that can be achieved through working with local initiatives such as the project in Lusk. A bottom-up approach is far more palatable and desirable than asking Sport Ireland or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to do everything. Local initiatives and partnership-based models are the way to go. Only last week I launched a report at the sports campus in Abbotstown on the effectiveness of the sports partnership model. There are opportunities for local communities throughout the country to engage more with their local authorities as well as for local authorities to do more. Some local authorities are exemplary in this regard and really engage with their local communities when it comes to providing a holistic plan and developing a strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_524"> Deputy Farrell asked me to examine documentation for Lusk 2020. I would welcome the opportunity to receive the information in the Department and review it. In recent years, a good deal of money has been allocated to local sports partnerships. In the past year in excess of €5 million was allocated by my Department to sports partnerships. This is not an insignificant amount and we are keen to ensure we get the best result from it. Since 2011 we have had three different allocations of sports capital. This has resulted in significant investments being made outside of the main capital programme, which we also hope to revise in 2017. Using this mechanism, I will be seeking significant investment in major infrastructure of a sporting nature at national and regional level. I agree with the remarks of Deputy Farrell in this regard. There is also an opportunity for organisations to work collaboratively with the local authorities. Local authorities that are reflective of their local communities in developing these projects have been far more successful. I am keen to empower, encourage and stretch sports partnerships to deliver even more in their local areas. An opportunity exists in this regard and this example may well prove to be exemplary to other areas in the country as a model to study and emulate. I am keen to see what Lusk 2020 is proposing and I welcome the opportunity of bringing the documentation before the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_525">I very much welcome what the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, has had to say. I imagine the community-based activists involved in this programme will be thrilled to hear his encouraging remarks. The material was written up and prepared well in advance of the budget and was not contingent on it. Regardless, the sports capital grant announcement from the Minister of State is most welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_526">We are very pleased nationwide, and particularly in some of the clubs in my constituency that might have missed out in the past. This is almost a regional idea because the environs of the community of Lusk are significant, including towns such as Rush and Skerries. A plan to build a soccer stadium in Lusk in the mid-noughties, which would have been of great benefit to the community, unfortunately fell by the wayside. Programmes to encourage young people to involve themselves in sporting activities and keep up reasonable fitness levels are very important at a time when unfortunately young people after college or university tend to drop out of sport at an incredible rate. If a facility or facilities are provided, they encourage people to get involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_527"> Significant sums of money have been allocated by the Department of Education and Skills to a brand new secondary school in Lusk in the past week and a new primary school in the nearby community of Rush. The culmination of the Lusk 2020 scheme and the Minister of State’s proposals to consider this and to roll out funding through the sports capital grants and the regional grants provide great opportunities for us to use this as a template nationwide and I would certainly encourage that. </p>

            <p eId="para_528">In every community there are challenges. The challenges in Lusk might relate to the size of the community but in rural areas very small communities find it difficult to bring forward the amount of assistance required to make up the 15% that is needed in many cases for the grant aid to be drawn down. The Ceann Comhairle and other Deputies are aware that a tightly knit community might have very difficult hurdles to jump in coming up with the initial seed capital whereas the communities Deputy Farrell refers to, the enormous sprawling urban communities, have a different challenge which in the first instance involves building the community and bringing people together. That is where I see the sports partnership as critical. The leadership provided within the local authority and the sports partnerships plays an important role in that because much of the work Deputy Farrell refers to involves building community and the capacity to enable communities to apply for funding, whether through their Leader company or through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the national lottery or whatever.</p>
            <p eId="para_529"> The Deputy is right about participation and I have made clear since my appointment as Minister of State in this Department that my primary concern is not in respect of large edifices or Ceaucescu-like monuments as someone once described them, but facilities to encourage people to participate at whatever level suits them, regardless of their ability and of their stage in life, whether young or not so young. In developing this programme, it is important that I maximise the amount of money we can spend and the impact. I welcome any opportunity to review any documents from any part of the country in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_530">I thank the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for taking the time to come here today. I know he has agreed to meet four Deputies on this issue but I wanted to table this very important issue. The last time we discussed this issue, the Minister said other level V counties have similar numbers of staff and seem to do a better job with the resources given to them. I need to put some matters in context. Very significant progress has been made regarding the financial difficulties in Sligo County Council. There has been a 37% reduction in the number of staff, and the total now stands at 374. Among the other level V counties, Roscommon has 393, Monaghan has 385 and Laois has 384 - all more than Sligo - but none has a port or harbour to deal with, or a regeneration programme. Eight staff are involved in the Cranmore regeneration programme, and two more in the harbours. Sligo has the highest social mix in the country after Cork and Limerick. There are 2.5,000 council houses, well above the other level V counties. That requires additional administration, engineering staff and outdoor maintenance staff. The urban area in Sligo is significantly larger than in the other level V counties. The Minister says the other counties are doing a better job than Sligo despite the fact that Sligo has fewer staff and a much bigger burden of work.</p>
            <p eId="para_531"> The discretionary spend for Sligo County Council is €2.6 million, that is, around 4%, down from some 7% or 8% in 2008 when times were better. The surplus that will be shown this year by Sligo County Council as it strives to recover from past difficulties and its €25 million deficit is €1.6 million. That is a truly remarkable outcome from the efforts of people locally, the new council, elected representatives and the executive, with a cut of 36% in staff to well below other level V counties that do not have the same burdens. The financial plan for next year has been thrown at us in a way that reminds me of the behaviour of the troika, Brussels and the ECB as revealed in the rhetoric of Jean Claude Trichet in the farce where he came to give evidence in Dublin Castle to the banking inquiry. Department officials tell us we agreed with this plan when in reality, in August 2015, the Department prescribed the level of cuts and the surplus of €1.6 million, which is being met. Next year, that is to be €3.6 million. The Department wants Sligo County Council to have a surplus next year of 140% of its discretionary spend.</p>
            <p eId="para_532">Discretionary spend is the meat and potatoes in terms of what people expect from councils. I refer to housing maintenance, local roads lighting and road safety, public conveniences, tourist development contributions, heritage issues, match funding, environmental campaigns, life-saving, beach maintenance, library books, the arts and grants. In terms of what our meeting will be about next week, which I want to put on record here today, the surplus target of €3.6 million, or 140% of the discretionary fund, is unachievable. It cannot and will not be achieved, notwithstanding the six additional staff sanctioned for the library services that were kept open, for which I thank the Minister. There are other measures coming down the track, so we will be continually fighting fires. The reality is that with all the cuts we have already made, we will struggle to meet a surplus target next year of €1.6 million. To put a surplus target of €3.6 million on it is an impossibility.</p>

            <from>Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government (Deputy Simon Coveney)<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_533">I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to respond on this issue again. As he said, we will have an opportunity to discuss it next Thursday when we will meet to discuss these issues. I want to put on record a number of points. Nobody disputes that the financial challenges Sligo County Council faces are significant. That is the reason there is a financial plan in place to help Sligo County Council get back on an even keel from a financial management perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_534"> The current chief executive of the local authority has done a very good job in many ways in terms of trying to achieve many of the targets that have been set. If we consider the improved position in terms of rates collection, for example, what has been done in terms of reducing staff numbers, maintaining output, services and so on. However, it is important to say that Sligo is the only county in the country that has a financial plan of this type whereby there is an agreement by the Department that if certain targets which have been signed up to by the local authority are met, my Department would sanction an extra €1 million to support the council in terms of the financial difficulties it faces. Clearly, that was not enough this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_535"> The chief executive wrote to me and then subsequently met me, along with the cathaoirleach of the council. We went through that letter and as far as I know, everything that was asked for in terms of flexibility, has now been given. That is an extra six staff for library services plus the money to pay them rather than simply sanctioning increased staff numbers as is the case for most other local authorities when they get extra staff, and other considerable flexibilities in terms of meeting some payment schedules next year rather than this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_536"> We continue to work with the chief executive and Sligo County Council on trying to meet and, when necessary, amend the financial management plan that is in place to try to help Sligo County Council get back to a situation where the financial management is sustainable again. What is being asked for here is that we start the process of negotiating a new financial plan when we only signed off on this one less than 12 months ago. What I am saying is that the basis for us will be the current plan but we want to work with management and we have been willing to show flexibility and provide extra supports to help Sligo County Council move through the process of getting back to a sustainable financial position. It is a difficult journey, and I am not pretending it is not.</p>
            <p eId="para_537"> I believe the chief executive has done a good job since he came in. He inherited a very difficult situation and much progress has been made in the first year since that plan was agreed last December. However, while we are making that progress, which has been difficult, I do not believe it is advisable to simply bin it and start again. Instead, we should work with that plan. We have already recalculated and reset some of the targets, given the changes and the accommodation that we have given on request from the management. There is a big onus on the management team to respond. Ultimately, it is their responsibility to manage the finances of the council. We are here to help in that. We are doing that at the moment, and have shown a good deal of flexibility in that endeavour, but the idea that we should simply tear up and start again will create many other problems.</p>

            <from>Deputy Marc MacSharry<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_538">The point being missed is that there is no problem. The council has done an exceptional job in following the plan heretofore to the best of its ability. It is time the Minister was prepared to admit, as assistant secretary Lemass was prepared to admit, that the Department prescribed surpluses of €12. 5 million to be delivered by 2019. I am telling the Minister that that is not possible against the backdrop of all the cuts already done. In terms of what they can do, they are out-performing in many ways. It is not reasonable for the Minister to say, "You agreed this so get on with it, like the ECB did. Live horse and get grass. If you cannot afford the services for the people, that is your problem." No, it is not our problem. The people are sovereign in a republic. The people of Cork and the people of Sligo are no different, and we have a responsibility to provide for them. A surplus target of €12.2 million is too much. A surplus target of €3.6 million next year is too much. It cannot and will not be achieved. The Department prescribed those savings, albeit that Sligo County Council ultimately agreed to them under duress, and when it does not meet that €3.6 million surplus target next year the Department will pull that €1 million back because that is what the Minister said he will do.</p>
            <p eId="para_539"> In addition to that, since this plan was agreed we have had Brexit, which is already having a significant impact on the retail community in a Border county like Sligo. Foreign direct investment jobs in that area are down 300. We have the highest commercial vacancy rate in Ireland at 16.8%. We have population decline. Those are CSO figures, not Marc MacSharry having a rant. We can skirt around the bush here and the Minister can say we want to tear up the plan. I do not want to tear up any plan. I am saying we should put realistic surplus targets in place. The €1.6 million this year was a phenomenal achievement, considering how low the discretionary fund is at 4%; it is significantly higher in the Minister's county.</p>

            <p eId="para_542">We have already reviewed them in the context of the flexibility we have shown, but it is important to put on the record that Sligo County Council had been incurring revenue deficits for the years 2008 to 2014 resulting in a situation where the cumulative deficit now stands at just under €26 million, and long-term debt is in excess of €103 million.

The 2012 report, Future Dementia Care in Ireland, published by academics in TCD and NUIG, states in its introduction that, "Since the turn of the millennium, dementia has not simply stepped onto the national stage, it has, metaphorically speaking, put on its running shoes and sprinted into the very centre of the policy, service and research arena, taking every opportunity along the route for its messages to seep into the public consciousness."</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> As the motion points out, the World Health Organization has described dementia as one of the most serious social challenges facing the world today. Dementia is a life-changing condition both for the person and for his or her family. This motion will rightly put the spotlight on what supports are needed for people living with dementia and where we feel the Government must step up its service to ensure that every person living with dementia has the best possible quality of care and, above all, quality of life. Age is the main risk factor for dementia and, as a result, the population of those living with dementia will grow over the coming years as our population ages. Approximately 55,000 people in Ireland are currently living with dementia and for every one person with dementia three others are directly affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> Dementia can be extremely challenging for family care givers and the helplessness associated by many with advanced dementia brings with it a fear and a stigma which make living with dementia even worse. It is essential that people living with dementia remain connected with their family, friends and local communities to reduce social isolation and loneliness. Dementia should not mean people stop doing the things they love, but as times go by they might need support to do so. One in three people aged over 65 will develop dementia and it is estimated that the number of people with dementia will double in the next 20 years and treble in the next 35 years. The majority of people living with dementia are women, although of the some 4,000 people with an early onset diagnosis, most are men. Those with younger onset dementia quite simply feel that there is nothing out there for them and there needs to be more appropriate supports put in place for people under 65.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> These figures do not include an additional approximately 700 people who have Alzheimer's type dementia associated with Down's syndrome. Approximately 4,000 new cases of dementia arise in Ireland every year and there is significant regional variation in estimated prevalence rates. It has been estimated that the overall cost of dementia in Ireland is just over €1.69 billion per annum, with 48% of these costs attributable to the opportunity cost of informal, mostly family, care to those living with dementia in the community. A further 43% of costs are accounted for by residential long-stay care while formal health and social care services contribute to only 9% of the total costs of dementia. It is also estimated that half of those with dementia never receive a diagnosis. Diagnosis is still a major issue and people are either not getting diagnosed or it is delayed, which impacts on treatment and services.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> Under the current national dementia strategy there are new GP training and HSE awareness programmes, but more could and should be done. Dementia awareness and education is a key intervention. It is only through greater awareness about the impact of the condition that people can live well in their communities and the stigma of dementia can be broken down. Nearly two thirds of people with dementia live at home in the community and that is where they and their families would prefer them to be. People with dementia have a preference to remain living at home for as long as possible and, with the right support, this is possible for the majority. The current national dementia strategy commits to providing 500 home-care packages. However, only 72 people are in receipt of home-care packages under that strategy. The question is when this will be rolled out in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> People with dementia are high users of health and social care services. They also have the same human rights as every other citizen, but in addition to the impact of the condition, they face cultural, social and economic barriers to fulfilling these rights. Insufficient provision for home help and home-care packages is effectively channelling people to long-term care, causing the institutionalisation of people with dementia. Some 25% of people in acute hospitals are living with dementia and it is estimated that 89% of people in long-term residential care have dementia. Hospitalisation is associated with functional decline among people with dementia. Keeping people out of hospital and at home is cost effective and a clear preference for people so it must be prioritised.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> There are also a number of obstacles that prevent people with dementia from accessing general home-care services. One of these obstacles is the inappropriate care needs assessment which fails to capture the needs of people with dementia, such as the story of the woman who can cook for herself but who forgets to eat and needs to be reminded, or the person who goes wandering and just needs someone to sit with them. There needs to be standardised needs assessment nationwide, backed up by dementia-specific training for staff. There are also inconsistencies across the country in the types of home-care services provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> Our motion calls for progressive increases in investment towards home-care supports for people with dementia in forthcoming budgets, so as to meet the needs of people currently living with dementia in the community and provide flexible, individual needs-led health and social care services. We also want to see aspects of the nursing home support scheme examined with a view to applying them to home care, such as the standardised process for assessment, certainty of entitlement and centralised, multi-annual, ring-fenced funding. Strategic and long-term planning for investment in dementia, including ring-fenced funding for dementia, should be allied to adequate resources to ensure full implementation of the national dementia strategy. It is also timely now to prepare for the development of a revised and reformed dementia strategy that prioritises dementia care support in communities and within the home. The national dementia strategy ends in 2017, so the planning of the new strategy should get under way immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> Dementia costs more than cancer, heart disease and stroke combined and yet, as an illness, it fails to attract commensurate political and budgetary attention. We must also remember the carers. As the World Health Organization rightly says, "dementia is overwhelming for the caregivers". As one family carer told the Alzheimer Society of Ireland for its Impact of Caring booklet last year:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_611">Early Onset Dementia is not an illness that you contemplate in your 50s and the role of a carer isn’t straightforward or easy. Keeping life normal is the ultimate struggle. The Government needs to do more to enable people to keep living in their homes and to resource their caregivers to provide much needed care. Caring for Mam has taught me how to find my voice as a carer and to use it to fight for what she needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">This Dáil should vote to give both the carer and her mother what she needs. I hope we will have cross-party support for this motion.</p>

        <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_329">
          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_613">This is a long and detailed motion but it is also non-contentious and I compliment Deputy Mary Butler for her work in researching and formulating it. Many organisations advocate on behalf of people with dementia, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological illnesses. We are tabling the motion to give everybody the chance to plan ahead for what is going to be an avalanche of challenges for the State, society and many individuals. As Deputy Butler said, within 30 years 150,000 or 160,000 people will have dementia, Alzheimer's or other neurological diseases.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">That poses significant challenges and we will fail future generations of people suffering with dementia if we do not accept that we have to start planning now, not only in the context of what we say but in what we do in terms of infrastructure, support and training services, and training professionals to enhance the capacity of the State and society to deal with something we know will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> The statistics and empirical evidence are available. Let us be honest. We have 55,000 people with dementia and we do not have the supports and services in place nor the infrastructure, both built and personnel, to support that. If we continue as we are, we certainly will be denying many any opportunity to live with dignity as independently as is practical with their conditions and allow them remain in their home or community for as long as possible. It is the right thing to do for many reasons. It is right because it is proven, medically and clinically, that home is the best place for a person with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. If we do not put these supports in place now, we simply will not be able to cater for them in the community and we will have a situation where we will be denying them their rights and entitlements, herding them into nursing homes and acute hospital settings, and not allowing them to live with dignity and to fulfil their opportunities. In that context, the motion is non-contentious but lays out the obligations we have and the services we must put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> There are areas where we have failed dramatically in terms of how we deal with community services. Obviously, we have the HSE and the statutory community services that are part of that and underpin it, but there is also a significant cohort of people and goodwill in the voluntary organisations. As I drive past the closed doors of the fine wheelchair accessible facilities of a GAA, rugby or soccer club or other community organisation that has been funded by the State, I wonder why we are not more imaginative in how we use these facilities to ensure people have a place to go where the HSE would provide services and supports in communities. If we accept that we will have significant challenges, we must be creative in how we confront them and in how we come up with solutions to address them. In the context of primary care teams and community care settings, although we do not have the physical infrastructure in place in many communities, we have a lot of goodwill with communities and voluntary organisations. It would be beneficial if one could underpin that goodwill with statutory supports and using those types of facilities which exist throughout the country. We all talk about the primary care centres, and if we are honest, the roll-out of those has been quite slow. We have facilities available and we should be imaginative. It would allow people to interact within their community and seek the supports and services required within their community and as near as practical to the home setting. It is something we are not harnessing beneficially for the community and the individuals who would avail of that service.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> Given where we have come from as a people in recent years and the changing demographics, not only in terms of neurological diseases and illnesses but also in terms of age profiling, we are brought back to a number of issues. While we wait for the Committee on the Future of Healthcare to come up with a strategy to develop our health care system, there are some knowns we can address. Training programmes should be put in place to ensure we have the professionals and the capacity to deal with what happens next year, in four years' time, eight years' time, 12 years' time and right up to 2046 when we will have 150,000 people with Alzheimer's disease, according to the World Health Organization, the HSE and the Department of Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> We have certain information we have not looked at. We should conduct the assessments. There is no need to have a grand plan for this. We know there will be considerable demands in certain areas, such as community services, care for the elderly and supporting the elderly in the home care setting and all that requires. What we have in terms of personnel, training programmes and professional enhancement programmes is limited in turning out the necessary number of staff in the form of quality graduates, professionals and clinicians, ancillary staff and allied health professionals. It has to be asked if one of the reasons we slow down this enhancing of capacity is because we do not want to recruit them when they graduate or qualify. We must look beyond that and not merely make the effort to ensure we have sufficient capacity or else we will repeatedly have shortages of nurses, allied health professionals, nurse specialists, consultants and GPs.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> The national dementia strategy is a new strategy. It is short term in that it is only for three years and then we will have to look at the process again. My experience is that we are fairly good at drawing up strategies. Professor Tom Keane, who implemented the cancer care strategy, was before the Committee on the Future of Healthcare today. He was presented with an exceptionally good strategy. It had been through the cancer forum. There was broad buy-in from the various stakeholders in society for the delivery of cancer care, but the critical component was full buy-in from the State, political cover and the resourcing put in place to implement the strategy, and it was implemented. We have many strategies but there does not seem to be the political will to resource and prioritise certain areas to implement the strategies. This area is one we know we have to start planning for in the here and now or else we will be failing many individuals and their families and broader society. From that perspective, it is time for the Department and the HSE to step up to the plate, look at what is required in the short and medium term and put plans in place to address that for beyond the horizon.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> Deputy Mary Butler highlighted why we tabled the motion. It is non-contentious and has been accepted by everybody in the Dáil. We knew that would be the case when we tabled it because everybody in the House is conscious of the needs and obligations that should be placed on the health and broader community services to deal with this issue. The motion highlights this and keeps it to the fore with policy-makers, which includes the House, the Government, the Department of Health, the HSE and advocacy groups. We can often forget what is beyond the horizon, and much Government policy is short term. It normally looks not much further than the next political cycle and general election. That is not a criticism, merely an observation of most western world democracies where the cycles are short and targeted. Our policy-makers need to be able to look beyond that in terms of developing policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has obligations in terms of the present dementia strategy which have to be fulfilled. She needs to expand the home care packages and ensure quicker diagnosis is available. I note that many suffering with dementia have not yet been diagnosed and may never be because of poor diagnostic services. Those are areas the Minister of State needs to address: home care, beefing up the community care system and its supports and expanding primary care teams. If we are to wait for the primary care centres to be established to enhance our primary care structures, I can assure the Minister of State we will be forever talking about when we will roll out primary care. We have become obsessed with the primary care centres and we have not instilled within the community the belief in the primary care team concept where all the specialties, State agencies, individual clinicians such as the GP, the nurse and the nurse specialist, and consultants work with the acute hospital in discharging patients from hospitals into the community and keeping them there. That is all still disparate and scattered and there is an obligation on us to deal with that. In discussing the dementia strategy, we need to ensure the primary care strategy, which has been around a long time, is implemented and resourced in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">If we do not do that, all the other areas referred to in the motion will fall and that means we will deny many individuals, their families and future generations the opportunity to live with dignity at home for as long as is possible and practicable, for their sake but also for the sake of the health service and to ensure people are retained in the community as opposed to being in the acute hospital setting or in long-term residential care. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#HelenMcEntee" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_330">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Helen McEntee)<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_623">I thank the Deputy for introducing the Fianna Fáil motion, which I accept. I believe it reflects much of Government policy and it effectively describes many of the issues and challenges that will arise in terms of supporting those with dementia. We in this Chamber know the figures but many people are not aware that 4,000 people in Ireland are diagnosed with dementia every year, which is 11 people a day. As Deputy Kelleher pointed out, 55,000 people in Ireland live with dementia. Dementia prevalence is set to increase in line with our increasing ageing population, but it is the case that dementia can also strike at a much younger age. I recently met Ms Kathy Ryan, who along with her two sons took part in an awareness campaign. Unfortunately, she first began to see symptoms in her early 40s. That is why we must act and plan ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> The challenge facing us is to support those who develop dementia and their families as much as we can, and in doing so to recognise that a great many people can live well with dementia for far longer than most people appreciate. When a person first realises he or she may have dementia, there is often a great deal of fear. There is fear among those affected but also among their families and friends. There is also much confusion about what it means, what happens next, what people can do, where they can go and what advice and assistance is available. They do not know how to access or indeed navigate the relevant public services and supports. I acknowledge the work of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, which acts in conjunction with the HSE, for the services, assistance and listening ear provided at local level. It is very much an invaluable service and I know we would be lost without it in my county.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> Far too many people feel that the life of a person diagnosed with dementia is effectively over. However, life is far from over for a person diagnosed with dementia. In recognition of the particular challenges faced by people with dementia and their carers, the Government published Ireland’s first national dementia strategy in December 2014 with the objective of increasing awareness, ensuring early diagnosis and intervention and developing enhanced community-based services. The strategy contains 14 priority actions under five headings, namely, leadership, better awareness and understanding, timely diagnosis and intervention, which is a key priority, integrated services, supports and care for people with dementia and their carers, and training and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> The strategy also contains 21 additional actions to be prioritised as resources become available. In parallel with the strategy, the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Atlantic Philanthropies agreed to co-fund a national dementia strategy implementation programme over three years to implement specific elements of the strategy, which represents a combined investment of €27.5 million, of which the Atlantic Philanthropies contributes €12 million and the HSE €15.5 million. Key elements of the initiative include the establishment of a national dementia office in the HSE, the roll-out of a programme of intensive home care packages for people with dementia, the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs and primary care teams to include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points, and measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia. Sometimes people hide their illness or the fact they have been diagnosed, and that is something we must address.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> The roll-out of intensive home care packages commenced in January 2015, and monitoring of the allocation and uptake of the packages is ongoing over the lifetime of the strategy. Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from intensive home care packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme. Understand Together is the second strand of the national dementia strategy implementation programme. It is designed to raise public awareness of dementia and to build community support for people with dementia, their families and carers in a compassionate and inclusive way. The campaign is being led by the HSE and it was developed with partners, including the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and GENIO. I am pleased to say the campaign is being launched next Monday, 24 October.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> The third strand of the implementation programme is the PREPARED project which is based in UCC. PREPARED is designed to upskill GPs in dementia diagnosis, and it will train GPs and primary care teams in the management of dementia. Training must be introduced as soon as possible and, where possible, across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> Those with dementia require services across many care streams, and that is acknowledged in the national dementia strategy. For example, given the prevalence of dementia in relevant age cohorts, it is inevitable that many of those in receipt of home care will have some degree of dementia. Dementia also arises as a co-morbidity with other conditions, and there are practical reasons it would be difficult and might not make sense to establish a separate funding stream for dementia services. Instead, my priority is to develop services in order that all those in need, including those with dementia, can get an early diagnosis and also all the services and supports they need when they need them. I appreciate that it will take us some time to get to that point, but we have made a real start in terms of the work, which must continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> The motion calls for progressive increases in home care supports for people with dementia, ring-fenced funding, a scheme similar to the nursing homes support scheme, and a revised dementia strategy. I will deal with the issues one by one. The national dementia strategy already acknowledges that health and social care policy is focused on caring for people with dementia in their home. At a wider level, it is stated Government policy to facilitate older people, including those with dementia, to stay in their home and community for as long as possible. It is not appropriate, therefore, to recast the national dementia strategy which was completed only relatively recently and is still in the course of its implementation. Our energies and resources are better directed towards implementing the strategy effectively rather than trying to rewrite it, given that it already includes what is being requested. While the strategy is set out over three years the intention is that it would continue to develop and evolve, but I do not envisage starting again from scratch. The foundations have been laid and the intention is to build on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> As well as the intensive home care packages that I have mentioned, a very significant proportion of those in receipt of the HSE's normal home care services have some degree of dementia, and those with the greatest care needs are prioritised in that context. Home support services across the country are being stretched by demands from more people and for more hours outside of core hours, which comes at a cost. Activity at the beginning of last year was at an all-time high and we have had to try to deal with that. Despite the fact that public finances are still very tight, we have responded to service pressures by providing additional resources this year and into next year as indicated in last week's Budget Statement. I agree with the Deputy that there needs to be a particular focus and priority on home help. That is the reason overall funding for services for older people has increased to €765 million, which is an increase of €82 million on the 2016 service plan. More than 80% of funding has focused on home care in particular. While we encourage people to stay at home for as long as possible, the nursing homes support scheme will be funded to the level of €940 million in 2017, which will allow the approval of funding to remain at a maximum of four weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> It is clear the existing home care service supports many people with dementia to remain living in their home. The single assessment tool, which is being piloted for older people in a number of hospitals and communities, will improve the provision of far better levels of data on people with dementia. It is intended that as it is rolled out in the coming years, this tool will be used to assess people seeking home care services countrywide on a standardised basis. The data will allow us to prioritise home care allocations more accurately on the basis of care needs, including for those with dementia.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> The motion calls for a review of home care based on the model of the nursing homes support scheme which supports residential care. I have asked the Health Research Board to examine international approaches to the financing and regulation of long-term home care. Stemming from that, the Department of Health will develop policy proposals for the financing and regulation of home care services. The motion refers to the work of the World Health Organization, WHO, to make dementia a global health issue and to encourage member states, international organisations and non-governmental partners to work together to meet the challenge of dementia. The WHO has recently launched a consultation on a global action plan on the public health response to dementia. My Department has welcomed the proposal to develop an action plan and is leading the Government's response. The Department of Health and the HSE also take part in an EU governmental expert group on dementia and we are a member of an OECD working group that is looking at the development of dementia indicators.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> Other speakers mentioned that family carers are a backbone of care provision in Ireland and the Government has sought to recognise that through the publication of the country's first national carers strategy in 2012. The guiding principles of the strategy state that carers will be recognised, supported and empowered. The strategy also outlines that training and skill development for carers are to be provided by HSE staff such as public health nurses and through HSE and dementia elevator programmes which are available free of charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> I agree with the Deputy that there needs to be a broad consensus on the issue, which is one on which we need to work. The strategy that has been put in place is a foundation. It is something on which we must build and that we must adapt where possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">As the strategy is at an early stage, we need to make sure there are resources there to fully implement it. It is something I will prioritise in my time as Minister of State here. </p>

          <p eId="para_638">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion. I commend Deputy Mary Butler on bringing it forward. We will be fully supporting the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> The provision of health and social care services for people with dementia has become an increasingly important issue. That is set to continue as a result of our ageing population, longer life expectancy and the expected trebling of the numbers of people with dementia in the coming years. Health and social care services do not match up with need and are often inconsistently provided, if at all. Of the 48,000 people living with dementia in this State, it is estimated that 63% of them reside in their own homes. The national dementia strategy acknowledges this and the fact that most people with dementia who live in their communities wish to continue to do so. This is not always possible. More must be done to ensure that every person with dementia who requires home care has access to dementia-specific care in his or her home. The Alzheimer Society of Ireland has been very active on the national dementia strategy and has requested that all parties commit to its implementation, an aim of which is to ensure that every person with dementia who requires home care has access to dementia-specific care in their own home. Sinn Féin fully endorses and supports this recommendation and is committed to the full implementation of the national dementia strategy. We are also of the strong belief that when implemented, preferably in full, there should be a follow-up strategy based on a review of the current strategy’s implementation and effectiveness. </p>
          <p eId="para_640"> The Government must improve investment in care. Carers need to be rewarded and given every support so they can help their loved ones stay in familiar surroundings, if it is their choice or the safest and most manageable option. </p>
          <p eId="para_641"> In our alternative budget proposals for 2017, we also identified housing adaptation as a critical area of importance for those with specific health needs. The existing local government adaptation grant schemes are chronically under funded. Therefore we committed to increasing the central funding of these grant schemes by 50% through the allocation of an additional €15.75 million, a measure which would especially benefit people with dementia and their carers. Additionally, we believe it is of critical importance to ensure that everyone with dementia has access to a timely diagnosis and appropriate post-diagnosis support including, but not limited to, a dementia adviser as a minimum standard of follow-up support. Adequate training must also be provided throughout the health and social care services for staff dealing with people with dementia. </p>
          <p eId="para_642"> I will revert to one of my initial points about our ageing population. Improved health and longevity should be seen as an opportunity as well as a challenge, with older people contributing to our society. The words of the democratic programme of the first Dáil Éireann resonate as loudly today as they did back then. We should be committed to the care and support of Ireland’s older people "who shall not be regarded as a burden, but rather entitled to the Nation‘s gratitude and consideration".</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> It is also important to speak about our older people in the context of this motion and their right to choose how best they will be supported as they age. The vast majority of older people prefer to live out their lives in their own homes if at all possible. Current Government policy is supposedly oriented in this direction but has failed in practice. Cuts to home help, home care, housing adaptation grants, carers’ supports and other services have resulted in more people than necessary going into long-term residential care. It has been estimated that possibly up to one third of people in nursing homes could be at home if adequate supports were provided. A greater emphasis on community-based care has the potential to reduce the number of older people requiring nursing home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> While most care is provided for people living in their own homes, the bulk of State spending is on nursing homes. In 2015, €315 million was allocated for home help and home care, compared with €933 million for nursing home support. Home support services as part of a comprehensive programme of reform, with emphasis on the home and the community, must be introduced. The serious deterioration in the pay, terms and conditions of those workers and carers who provide care for older people at home, in the community and in residential settings must be addressed. Most older people who require care and assistance with daily living are looked after by unpaid family or friends in their homes. It is vital that the role of carers is fully recognised and that current State supports for carers are enhanced. Sinn Féin opposed the cut of €325 that was made by the Government to the respite care grant and provided for its restoration in each of our annual alternative budgets since. Respite care involves giving families and carers help in caring for their loved one for a short period. This care is provided by the HSE and by voluntary organisations. Current provision is far short of what is needed. Without adequate respite, family carers are themselves left more vulnerable to ill-health. </p>
          <p eId="para_645"> While the tendency in one's address of dementia is to focus on older people, there is also the sad reality of younger onset dementia. As the motion before us states, an estimated 4,000 people under the age of 65 are now affected. In that number, are people in their early to mid-50s, with all that represents for their loved ones. It is also appropriate to mention the key contribution of Atlantic Philanthropies whose generous support has helped to develop the national dementia strategy implementation plan including the establishment of the national dementia office. It is not just nice but right to thank Atlantic Philanthropies.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Special thanks are also due to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the many local ASI groups across the country. Founded in 1982, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland will celebrate 35 years of service and support for Alzheimer's disease sufferers, including those with dementia, in 2017, which is just around the corner. I wish to record my personal thanks, as I have done previously on the floor of the House, to the County Monaghan branch of the ASI, to Mae Murphy and all at the Drumkill day care centre in Threemilehouse in my county of Monaghan. My family will always appreciate the great work they do. I also record my admiration and great respect for all achieved to date by the County Cavan branch of ASI. Molaim iad uilig. Mar fhocal scoir, cuirim fáilte arís roimh an rún seo. Is dócha go bhfeicfimid dul chun cinn mór i leith cúraim do dhaoine le néaltrú san am atá amach romhainn.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kathleen Funchion<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_647">I welcome the motion and commend Deputy Butler on bringing it forward. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> There is plenty of information in the public domain to substantiate the very valid calls for increased supports to all those affected by the condition of dementia. We understand that Ireland’s population is ageing at a rapid rate. We also know that the prevalence and incidence of dementia rises significantly with age and dramatically so in those over 80. Some studies estimate that as little as 10% of people's symptoms are caused by dementia itself with the other 90% resulting from the quality of care people with dementia receive if in inappropriate settings. We know how a person’s physical condition often deteriorates when his or her mental state is in decline. The living space for people affected is therefore crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> If we are to support a person’s right to a high quality of life, the State must take into consideration a person’s right to autonomy and the individual’s sense of identity. International best practice recommends that dementia-specific care should be domestic-like and small-scale with facilities catering for no more than about ten people. Unfortunately, many facilities across this State fail to comply with those principles. Often, as a result, the preferable option is to live at home with one’s family or relatives. We are told that Government policy supports this approach but how do the decisions on cuts to home help, housing adaptation grants and carers' supports echo that?</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The cuts are hypocritical and counterproductive. The reality is that the consequences of those decisions have pushed families unwillingly into long-term residential care. This is wrong and must be reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> Our party’s alternative budget proposals for 2017 identified housing adaptation as a critical area for those with specific health needs. We committed to increasing the central funding of grant schemes by 50% through the allocation of an additional €15.75 million. This measure would particularly benefit people with dementia and their carers, and support the choice to remain living in their homes. We know from organisations such as the Alzheimer Society of Ireland that the outcomes of investing in home care services and supports will: meet the demand for care at home, allowing for greater flexibility to appropriately meet need and reverse cuts to home care services; reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and shorten the length of hospital stay for people with dementia; avoid inappropriate, unnecessary or premature admission into long-term residential care; and reduce carer stress and support family carers. Ultimately, it is in the State’s interest to support this type of long-term strategy, which invests in people being as self-sufficient and independent as possible should that be their choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> As stated by Deputy Ó Caoláin, more emphasis on community-based care has the potential to reduce the number of older people requiring nursing home care, on which the State spends the bulk of its funding. Why can we not acknowledge those facts and proceed in a direction that supports those affected in a progressive and respectful way, which will benefit the State as well? The measure of our society is in how we treat our most vulnerable, and the choices we make to provide them with the deserved dignity. The lack of ring-fenced funding for dementia home care in budget 2017 is foolishly short-sighted and an absolute shame. We know that the majority of the 55,000 people affected by dementia prefer to live at home in familiar surroundings. This is a fact. They deserve that choice, and for that choice to be supported in a way that makes it a reality. Our party supports the call for adequate resources to ensure full implementation of the national dementia strategy and the development of a revised and reformed strategy that prioritises dementia.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> To conclude, we are happy to support the motion and I commend Deputy Butler on bringing it forward. This area is often overlooked and it is important that we discuss it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gino Kenny<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_654">People Before Profit welcomes the opportunity to discuss supports for people with dementia in the community and to draw attention to the urgent need for resources for them. I have first-hand experience in this area as I worked in a hospital ward specifically for patients with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The education and life experience I received there will always shape who I am. The cruelty of dementia is only mirrored by the sheer compassion and love for our loved ones in their final years. Lives that were so fruitful and full of happiness have been taken away by this cruel disease.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> However, it beggars belief that Fianna Fáil has tabled this motion this week, after a budget that had, as one newspaper put it, "Fianna Fáil written all over it". Surely the time for Fianna Fáil to show its support for older people in general and people with dementia in particular was last week. Dementia is a condition which requires greater recognition and support, as its incidence is increasing with the increasing age of our population. It is good that more people are living to an older age, but with increasing age comes a need to plan better health and social care services. A study published this year by UCD researchers, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and others, entitled "I'd Prefer to Stay at Home, But I Don't Have a Choice", reported that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_656">The present social care approach has not been resourced adequately to meet the actual needs of older people. The HSE are spending less now on home support services than they did in 2008, despite the increase in the numbers of people aged 85 and over and those living with complex conditions such as dementia. Older people cannot access safe, compassionate, individualised and quality care when they need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Home help and home care services were top of the list on budget day for support groups such as Age Action Ireland and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> The records of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments are equally appalling on this issue. During the years of austerity cuts to services to pay off bankers' gambling debts, Fianna Fáil attacked home help hours by reducing them from 12.63 million hours in 2008 to 11 million hours in 2011. Fine Gael and the Labour Party continued the austerity cuts and slashed home help hours to 9.74 million in 2013. In 2016, the number receiving all home care, that is, both home help hours and home care packages, has still not recovered to the 2008 level, despite the fact that the number of people aged over 65 years and over 85 years has continued to rise.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> In 2016, only 63,000 people were receiving home care compared with 64,000 in 2008. Meanwhile the population aged over 65 years has increased by 30%, from 481,00 in 2008 to 624,000 in 2016. As Age Action stated in its budget submission:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_660">Between 2008 and 2012, the number of people receiving home care services (home help and home care packages) fell by nearly 30 per cent (17,138 people). There has been a nearly 30 per cent increase in the population aged 65 and over between 2008 and 2016. ... The evidence clearly points to the needs of many older people going unmet.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The increasing use of for-profit agencies has meant worse conditions for staff and a system of speeded up care which allocates insufficient time for even personal care. It leaves much domestic care undone and dependent on relatives and friends who are often elderly and in poor health themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> Clearly, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael stand condemned for targeting the older population with cuts in services and welfare to bail out the rich bankers and developers, who play the tune to which they dance. AAA-PBP would be happy to support a motion proposing to increase the funding of home care, hire more social workers and social care workers, provide home care on a demand-led and needs basis in every area, increase the pension without delay, abolish prescription charges, water charges and property tax, improve the household benefits package or any of a host of other measures that would improve the lives of older people and people with dementia. This motion makes no such practical proposals and hides and denies the responsibility of previous Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments, as well as the current Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael coalition. This failure and denial of responsibility by those parties should also be noted.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_335">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_663">I was struck by the headline on an article about Alzheimer's disease and dementia which stated, "Dementia tsunami looms". However, the figures are startling and they justify the use of the word "tsunami". An increase of 240% is forecast in the number of people who will present with either dementia or Alzheimer's disease. We are aware of the figures from the 2012 research in the review undertaken by Trinity College and National University of Ireland, NUI, Galway in preparation for the national strategy. Those figures quoted 42,000 people living with dementia. However, in 2014, the Department of Health revised that upwards to 50,000. It was startling that 8% of those were under 65 years of age. The word "tsunami" is justified.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> We are aware of the national dementia strategy and its priority areas. A very important area is timely diagnosis, but that requires general practitioner, GP, training and education. There are also the areas of intensive home care packages, integrated services, research, and public awareness and understanding. I looked at the 2015 first national survey on the provision for people with dementia in long-time care. There was a good response from the nursing homes - 469 from a sample of 602. There were positives in it regarding the therapeutic services, such as music, art, sensory rooms and gardening, but it is disappointing that these were not available everywhere. One can see in that survey the discrepancy between the public and private sectors. In the HSE-operated facilities, only one third of the staff and care attendants were specially trained, whereas in the private establishments all of the staff and care attendants had specialist training. In addition, the privately operated facilities were more likely to offer individual bedrooms. The most serious concern related to the number of specialist care units at only 11%. There is a need for strong political leadership and commitment to address those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> I recall the film <i>Still Alice</i> which was released a couple of years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">It gave a very powerful view of the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease and how terrifying it is for the person experiencing that loss of memory, finding themselves in places without knowing how they got there, forgetting how to eat, forgetting to dress and the loss of words and the ability to express how they feel. It is a very lonely and dangerous place. There is also the challenge for those who love them because we know that caring can be a 24-hour activity. It has been said that 25% of carers are elderly and many of them experience financial strain. I know from family and friends how caring for somebody with Alzheimer's disease can be overwhelming at times.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> Some people take refuge in denial or in hiding or camouflaging it. One of the most impressive and moving presentations I attended was one organised by Dementia Ireland and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland where a lady in her early 50s spoke about the early onset of Alzheimer's disease and the way in which she was managing to deal with the illness. I also want to acknowledge the support that is given to carers and loved ones by the Alzheimer Café events. I have been to two of them, one at the Clareville centre in Glasnevin and the other in Cabra. I hope we get a new primary care centre in Dublin 1 and that there will be a space for that type of café for people. We must try to get away from being embarrassed about or ashamed or fearful of people with dementia because compassion, empathy and inclusiveness are what they need. All too often, some of them feel that they are better off staying at home or their relatives want them to stay at home but staying at home just leads to depression.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> We know there is no cure at this stage but we know that diet, exercise, meditation, mindfulness, social inclusion and involvement and, above all, public awareness all help. I read an article by a woman with early-onset dementia in which she wrote that her mind is slowly dying but that, in the meantime, she is living her life one day at a time.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_669">A strange anomaly is occurring in funding for home help packages. Funding for home care packages for people with dementia fell by €11 million in the four years up to 2015 while nursing home care investment rose by €84 million. Simultaneously, we saw the number of home-help hours being significantly reduced. Furthermore, according to Age Action, in 2013, out of a total budget of €1.39 billion, 72% was spent on the nursing homes support scheme, which supports over 22,000 elderly people - approximately 4% of the population aged 65 and over - while only 14% of this was spent on home-help services with 9% spent on home care packages.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> Age Action has noted an overall trend in the admissions policies of nursing homes, which have increased the number of low to medium-dependency people being admitted while lowering the number of high-dependency residents. This is placing the greater burden of dealing with high-dependency people on community and public facilities. We are always treated to nursing home providers' complaints about the cost of care in the community sector but this is mainly because it has higher-dependency patients. According to a report compiled by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, Age Action and a number of other groups, more than half of older people could remain in their own homes instead of going into long-term care if more home support services were available. That same report also confirms that multiples of resources are being invested in long-term care instead of community-based care despite the fact that Government policy is supposedly to support people to remain at home. As it stands, Ireland places 35% more of its senior population in institutional care than the EU average. This is proof that the Government is pushing towards the privatisation model of care and allowing nursing homes to dominate the sector. I am happy to say that Donegal has the highest number of elderly people being cared for at home in the country. I think this is due to how well our community hospitals are connected with Letterkenny University Hospital and how elderly patients are transitioned out of community hospitals and prepared to go back home again. It is also due to the fact that families want to care for elderly parents, aunts and uncles at home for as long as possible. However, we are not making it any easier for them. There seems to be an attitude within the health service that because someone has dementia, he or she may not be as important as somebody with normal mental capacity. We see treatment delayed and GPs not responding to people with dementia. These families save the State hundreds of millions of euro every year by keeping their loved ones at home in the surroundings with which they are familiar, going all out to care for them and organising their entire lives around looking after their elderly loved ones. However, they do not get the support they deserve from the HSE and the health service. There should be a recognition that supporting people at home saves the State money in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> In respect of people with intellectual disabilities, I know of one woman with an intellectual disability who lives in supported community housing and who has early-onset dementia at 47 years of age. The HSE is trying to move that person into a nursing home away from surroundings in which she has lived for over 20 years and a community in which she has been supported. The HSE wants to get her into the nursing homes support scheme and out of intellectual disabilities care because she has early-onset dementia. This will do nothing for her quality of life. This is the core of it. We must recognise that people with dementia are every bit as valuable as everybody else in their communities and that they and their families need to be supported to keep them in the settings in which they are most comfortable and with which they are most familiar, thus saving the State money. It is hard to believe that this Government, which has been so obsessed with saving peanuts in many cases over the years, does not see the value of keeping people at home and the savings to which this can give rise. Perhaps that has something to do with the privatised model of nursing home care we have in this country.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelHarty" eId="spk_337">
          <from>Deputy Michael Harty<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_672">I am sharing time with Deputy Mattie McGrath. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I congratulate Fianna Fáil and Deputy Mary Butler on introducing this topic for discussion. I know the Minister of State is well aware of the topic and is extremely interested in it. I know it is a topic that will probably not be contested and all the better because what is in the motion is very sensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> Dementia is the most common degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Due to our ageing population, it is going to be an ever-increasing burden on our health service. I think we are all aware of this and we all realise the challenge this will pose for us. As it is structured, the health service is probably ill equipped to deal with the problem. Diagnosis can be difficult. Dementia becomes apparent over time but the changes can be very subtle and can be quite similar to symptoms of depression. Gradually, it becomes apparent that it is a disease of most recent event memory loss. People with dementia can remember their childhood but, unfortunately, they cannot remember what they did yesterday or even in recent times. It can be a difficult diagnosis to make but it becomes apparent eventually.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> Unfortunately, medication currently available does not alter the progression of the disease. It may control the speed of progression but it does not alter the disease process. Much of the medication we use involves controlling symptoms rather than the disease. There needs to be far more research into the causes of dementia, prevention and delaying progression. For the moment, the health service is tasked with dealing with the problem as it is. Dementia puts huge pressure on the patient and his or her family and carers. These are patients who have lived very productive lives. They have raised families and worked hard all their lives and now they are struck with this devastating disease, which may be a prolonged illness and last for many years. It robs them of their older years when they can enjoy their family and grandchildren, which is devastating for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> It is very important that people with dementia are managed within their own homes. This is where the emphasis should be. Many families are able to cope with relatives suffering with dementia and keep them at home in familiar surroundings.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">This is the most important thing. Many do it without assistance. Sooner or later, unfortunately, they will require greater care, which should be delivered in the home by carers and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, which provides excellent home care for patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> We also need to develop non-residential day centres where patients can go for themselves in order that they can have social interventions, which are probably more important than medical interventions. Many day care centres provide dementia-specific care, giving patients an intellectual outlet. They can engage in art, music, group therapy and reminiscence therapy. Reminiscence therapy is very important for people with dementia. There are many strategies which can be introduced which do not require residential care.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> Unfortunately, sooner or later, people may reach the stage where they require residential care, and this may be accommodated within our standard nursing home structure. Many of our nursing homes go out of their way to look after patients with dementia within the common care of a nursing home. Unfortunately, some people develop serious behavioural problems and require nursing care in specialist dementia units. These are being developed throughout the country and it is very important that the Government supports these structures.</p>

          <p eId="para_679">I am delighted to speak on the motion and I compliment Deputy Mary Butler and Fianna Fáil on tabling it. It is good that we are having a reasoned and calm debate on the issue. I hope the Government will not oppose the motion, given that we should all aspire to it. Everyone here knows people or has family members who are afflicted by this very serious illness, as Deputy Michael Harty said. The slowness and the difficulties in diagnosing it makes it very difficult for loved ones, children, relatives and siblings, and it is very challenging. We need more day centres and specific nursing homes to deal with this very troublesome and difficult diagnosis when it arrives and when it progresses.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> Family carers must be supported and complimented. There has never been an audit of the monetary value of the savings to the HSE that result from the care which loved ones and families give in their homes. It is very difficult for ordinary people to understand why it is so difficult to get home care packages, extra home help hours and support for carers. No matter what the illness, family care at home is better for patients. They are healthier and happier and have peace of mind in the knowledge and comfort that they are cared for in their homes. I salute the carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> I also salute some of the district hospitals, St. Patrick's in Cashel and St. Anthony's in Clonmel and the hospitals in Clogheen and Carrick-on-Suir which do tremendous work. They are small and efficient. There is no big bureaucracy. Very intimate caring and minding is delivered to the patients and there is great interaction with the families. The HSE is slow and unable to value and appreciate the efforts, time and energy spent by family members trying to care for people in these areas. I am tired of saying this; I am like a bad record. All they want is a little support and to be left alone to do it and not to be intruded on but supported. This is where the carers in their homes are invaluable. While the cost of it should not be in monetary terms, they save a lot of time and bed space in hospital wards. When a diagnosis is made and people know what it is, they do not need to be traumatised further by being brought here and there and moved to different settings. For people with dementia, it can be very troubling to be in strange surroundings.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> We must all support and welcome the motion and welcome the debate to get a shift at senior managerial level in the HSE. Although the budget allocated extra money for home care packages, getting it delivered is like pulling teeth. It has to get down to the areas and be divvied up. The difficulty in getting applications in and getting the return is not acceptable. It is shameful that families have to go through such trouble and trauma when they are trying to do the caring as well. The applications should be simplified and made more user-friendly. I appeal to the Minister of State, as the one mark she will leave on the Department and the HSE, to try to get a bit of humanity into the applications and how they are dealt with, and to speed them up and reduce the form filling, red tape and unwillingness - despite that there are many people working hard in the HSE - to get through the hoops and measures. It must be tackled. I appeal to the Minister of State to do so. I support the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_683">I welcome the debate. I appeal to the Minister of State and the HSE to continue the funding of the five steps to living well with dementia project in south Tipperary. In 2012, south Tipperary received funding to develop a new and innovative dementia project for a three-year period. The project was jointly funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and the HSE through the Genio trust. It is time to put the funding for the project and services on a permanent basis. A core principle of the project and the services in south Tipperary is to provide flexible, person-centred care in the home and allow people to remain at home for as long as possible. The project has been a great success. It has already transformed the life experience of many people with dementia and their families in south Tipperary and is an ideal template for the national dementia strategy. Crucially, the development of the services included dementia sufferers, their carers, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, the Carers Association, Muintir na Tíre, the South Tipperary Community and Voluntary Forum, GPs and representatives of the HSE. I acknowledge the vital input of people such as Dr. Caitríona Crowe, consultant in the psychiatry of old age, and Professor Eamon O'Shea of NUI Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> It is a five step programme, the key elements of which include a media campaign. The campaign was to raise awareness among the public about dementia, dispel myths and reduce stigma. There was buy-in to the programme by all the local media such as local radio stations, including Tipp FM, Tipp Mid West Radio and the print media. A community connector was appointed to liaise with organisations across the county and raise awareness in general about dementia and in particular about the services and supports available. Volunteers were largely provided by the Carers Association.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> The single most important element of the programme was establishing a single point of contact to ensure people could access the information, supports and services they needed. The appointment of dementia support workers was also important. These people support people with dementia in their homes and ensure they can live at home for as long as possible and delay the need for long-term care. A further development at South Tipperary General Hospital is the memory technology library which provides a large range of assistive technology products to support people with memory loss. The programme in south Tipperary has been significant and successful and I compliment all those involved. I again ask the Minister of State to put permanent funding in place to continue it.</p>

          <p eId="para_686">I welcome the tabling of the motion by Deputy Mary Butler and her colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Its most important aspect is that it puts a focus, at least for a short while, on the major challenge that dementia poses for the country. Due to the incredible demographic changes facing us, we have no choice but to be proactive in putting in place the kinds of services that are required currently and will undoubtedly be required in future. Not enough was done in the recent budget in this regard. Those parties that were involved in putting the budget in place must take responsibility for that. Choices were made on how limited resources would be spent. At a time when there is a need for public services to be repaired and such glaring shortages in services, particularly in health and in light of the housing crisis, it seems like a bad decision to support a proposal to give €335 million back to some of the better-off people in society by way of cuts to the USC.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> The damage done throughout the recession and by the austerity measures that were imposed have wreaked havoc on many public services. The priority should have been to repair that damage and ensure that our public services were returned to a reasonable standard and equipped to deal with the demands that would be placed upon them in future. Nowhere is this more noticeable than in the health service, given the demographics with which we are dealing. There is a significant additional demand for services, but the budget will go nowhere near meeting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> It has been suggested that some 55,000 people suffer dementia. We are unsure, as there is an absence of reliable data. If one accepts this figure, which has been cited by some of the NGOs working in the area, it is set to treble in the next 30 years. Of those nearly 160,000 people, at least half will be over 85 years of age. This poses considerable challenges for our health and community services. We must start being serious about preparing for this eventuality.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> Dementia is associated with the increased use of medical services. Cognitive impairment and confusion are significant co-morbidities for many older people. A significant number of people who are occupying hospital beds have some element of dementia, although it may not be the initial reason for their being in hospital beds. This figure has been placed at approximately 25% of the hospital population. Being in hospital results in a decline in the person's condition, so we should not be placing these people there. Rather, the emphasis should be on community care. Older people want to remain in their own homes and communities. We should facilitate this instead of maintaining a situation in which people have a statutory entitlement to nursing home care but no similar entitlement to home care packages. This is what we must do. It makes sense, achieves better health outcomes and provides better value for money. We need a greater emphasis on home-care packages, as the budget's provision will only meet half of the demand. For this reason, 17 NGOs joined together recently to demand additional investment in home-care packages.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> The involvement of Atlantic Philanthropies in the funding of this strategy has been welcomed, but why is it involved? Is it appropriate that we must depend on philanthropy in order to provide basic health services for older people? Surely this is not a defensible position. It should not be the case that our taxpayers' money is being used for other purposes instead of for meeting the most glaring need in our community. We should move away from relying on philanthropies and instead use our own tax resources to fund the essential services that are required by people with dementia.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy)<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_692">It is clear from the contributions made on all sides of the House that everyone wants to do the best possible for those with dementia and that there is substantial agreement on what is required to give them the best quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> Only a few short years ago, dementia was hardly understood at all. While matters have improved, we are still well short of where we want to be. The key message is that people who have developed dementia are still the people they always were. They worry, laugh, get angry and sad, and they feel lonely and happy just as they always did. They also continue to enrich our lives and help those around them.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> This motion is substantially in line with what the Government has committed to do. Those with dementia must be included within our communities and supported to remain as valued members of same. It is where they belong and where they want to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> I am hopeful that, before too long, the many strands of medical research that are under way will allow more decisive medical intervention in the course of this condition, but we are not there yet. That said, evidence is increasingly indicating that lifestyle choices over many years can have an effect on the likelihood of dementia occurring, and perhaps even more on the age at which it occurs. Diet, physical and mental activity and social connectedness all seem to act alongside genetics in influencing what happens. It is critical that we get this message to those who may be concerned. This is being addressed as part of the Irish national dementia strategy and the wider health promotion efforts under the Healthy Ireland initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> The national dementia strategy was based on extensive consultation and significantly shaped by advice received from health professionals, advocacy groups and academics. It seeks to draw together the elements of support that matter most to those with dementia and those who live with and care for them. These range from the role of the general practitioner, GP, which is often the first point of contact with the health system for a concerned person, to advice and case management, more specialist diagnosis, home care, awareness raising and, finally, acute and palliative care. Inevitably, this includes a large number of services and, unfortunately, we cannot do everything immediately. In collaboration with Atlantic Philanthropies, however, we are carefully prioritising what to do first and will continue to spread the net wider as we move further through implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> A significant benefit of the strategy is the establishment within the HSE of a national dementia office, which is charged with the ongoing prioritisation of issues and services relevant to those with dementia. This office can bring a much clearer focus to these issues and facilitate the framing of a more effective case for additional resources for dementia in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> I thank Deputies for contributing on this motion. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is looking forward to working with colleagues from across the House to develop and strengthen the supports that are provided to those with dementia over the coming months and years.</p>

          <p eId="para_700">I congratulate my colleagues on this motion, which is a significant step forward in raising awareness of this disease among people, in particular among those who may not be touched by it, so that they can be informed of the situation. It is important that we make a big deal out of this. Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, such as frontotemporal, vascular, mixed, Lewy Body and so on, will eventually touch everyone, particularly as our society grows older.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">In some ways we are probably in the calm before the storm, and as our population ages and our life expectancy increases, we will experience more issues related to dementia. We can predict their demographic growth and within reason we can predict the general growth of these dementia-related diseases. This motion is timely in bringing attention to the issue so the HSE can start preparing for the inevitable increase in dementia-related illness in this country. I hope we are not without hope, however, and I know that with the increasing mind mapping that is ongoing, there may eventually be a breakthrough in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> Those currently suffering from dementia are going through a quiet crisis whose impact is colossal but often barely acknowledged. We know that in families with a member suffering from dementia, it steals lives and breaks hearts. Every day throughout Ireland, families go through a kind of slow and aching pain. It is a disease that slowly robs people of their freedom of personality but it is important they are not deprived of their dignity. That is why we need supports for families and individuals. Even as a person's memories slowly leave, his or her character and personality will remain. It is very important these people and their families are given the necessary supports. There are more than 55,000 people living with dementia in this country, with 165,000 people directly affected and even more people indirectly affected. We know from the mentioned statistics that the incidence of these illnesses will double in the next 20 years and treble in 35 years. They are also a significant cause of death.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> In my time today I will highlight a very narrow and particular type of issue, early-onset dementia. I am not even talking about traditional early-onset dementia, which might affect those aged between 55 and 65, but rather the type affecting young parents. It might be quite rare but it exists and has a devastating effect on people's families. If a young parent suffers from this type of dementia, the husband or wife will have to watch him or her go through dementia when they are in their 20s, 30s or 40s. If the children are young, the spouse taking care of the affected husband or wife must explain to the children what is happening to their mother or father, while also having to maintain employment so the mortgage will be paid. It is a particular sense of suffering and agony that those families must go through. In those circumstances, very often the sufferer's parents are alive as well and they must watch their child, a young parent, go through dementia.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> This can cause all sorts of tensions. In particular, a caring partner may find it very difficult to get access to the support he or she needs. The sufferer would not be over 65 so he or she would not meet the relevant support criteria. Almost anywhere they go, the people will be told they do not fit into this or that box. They might work or have a half-decent income, so they may not be entitled to any support. These people are not old enough for old-age care. The fair deal scheme might be suitable for an older person not taking care of children or having to pay a mortgage but for a husband or wife in their 30s or 40s trying to pay a mortgage, it is not suitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> Very often, when dementia becomes very serious, the only option is to bring a husband or wife to the accident and emergency department and leave him or her there. That is a horrendous position. I am certainly not taking the Minister of State to task about this, but I am trying to highlight the issue, as it is something that could probably be resolved with just a little bit of thought and application. Some tweaks are just needed here and there and it is not something that needs to be costly. It is just about making a few exceptions when somebody is a young mother or father. They would be under 65 and have a child, with a mortgage to be paid and a job to be kept. I ask the Minister to look at this issue and provide supports for husbands or wives in such a position. This concerns a tiny subset of people but it has a devastating effect when a husband or wife has to watch a partner lose memories and the ability to look after themselves or a child. They have to explain this and deal with the mental impact on children. It also affects a sufferer's parents and extended family. It is an extremely serious issue that has a debilitating effect on families.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> I give great praise to all the families and support groups which deal with dementia sufferers. They are soldiers in dealing with these issues but I just wanted to highlight this narrow matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_708">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic, albeit for a few minutes. The increased prevalence of dementia and particularly Alzheimer's disease means that as a society we must increase our knowledge and ability to deal with these conditions. Unfortunately, my father-in-law suffers from dementia and I am very aware of the demands on families and the people affected on a daily basis trying to deal with this very debilitating illness. On the other side, it should not mean a person cannot have a quality of life. It is our responsibility as a society to try to come up with the right care packages and supports to allow families dealing with family members suffering from dementia and particularly Alzheimer's disease to have a decent quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> My father-in-law at the onset of his condition was put on a clinical trial. The drug used is nifedipine, which was previously used to treat blood pressure problems. The positive impact of that drug was significant and I hope it will be something seen as a breakthrough treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We may never find a cure but there is a possibility that we will find something that will slow the progression of the disease. Certainly in the case of my father-in-law, he has had a significant improvement in his quality of life because he has been on this drug for the past three or four years. I look forward to advances in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> I commend my colleagues, Deputies Mary Butler and James Browne, on bringing forward this topic. I look forward to us as a society learning more and dealing better with what is a debilitating disease. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to ensure a quality of life for those who are affected.</p>

          <p eId="para_712">This special debate has been brought about by my colleague, Deputy Mary Butler, and it has probably been one of the most moving debates in which I have participated since becoming a Member of this Dáil back in late February. I compliment Deputy Butler on the way she made her case earlier, supported by our health spokesperson, Deputy Billy Kelleher.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, for her response to the motion. I am sure the Ministers of State who are in the Chamber now, Deputies O'Donovan and Corcoran Kennedy, take the same view as their colleague. We are all touched by this issue in some way or another. I was glad Deputy Ó Caoláin mentioned the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, which does extraordinary work throughout the country and is a wonderful advocate for families of people suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. This issue impacts on so many lives, not just those affected by these conditions but also the loved ones who care for them on a daily basis. Speaking to those who care for people with Alzheimer's disease, one often finds they are broken-hearted by their loved one's condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> A 2012 survey showed that local health office areas in the HSE west region have the highest prevalence rates for these conditions, with each of the nine areas estimated to have at least 1% of its population living with dementia. My own county of Roscommon has the highest share of people with dementia, at 1.4%. The lowest rate, meanwhile, is in west Dublin. There are 55,000 people in Ireland living with dementia and a further 165,000 directly affected by it. It is expected that one in three people aged over 65 years in this country will develop dementia and that the number living with the condition will double in the next 20 years and treble in the next 35 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> Fianna Fáil wants to see progressive increases in the investment in home-care supports for people with dementia in the coming years in order to meet the needs of persons in the community living with the disease. We need flexible health and social care services based on individual needs. Some 63% of people with dementia live at home. Most people with the condition want to be cared for at home and that is also the wish of their families. It is important that we all give this matter our full attention. How to deal with the needs of people with dementia is one of the fastest-growing problems for the health service. As a society, we must prepare for the implications of an ageing population. That means resourcing services, supporting carers and investing in research.</p>

          <p eId="para_716">I thank my colleague, Deputy Mary Butler, for bringing forward this motion. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, for her positive response and for her Department's endeavours to progress supports and provide further funding for this area. Dementia has impacted my own family, with my mother suffering from the condition. It is important that we try to keep people at home; I see myself how beneficial that is to the person with dementia. We must increase the provision of home-care packages and fast-track the various schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> Great work is being done in this area by the voluntary sector. Colleagues referred to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland. I often attend its coffee mornings and see the great support it receives from the public. However, it cannot all come down to voluntary support - we in the Oireachtas must ensure there is adequate State provision for people with dementia. Several speakers noted that the incidence of dementia is increasing. I am aware of several people in my own area with the condition. I read a newspaper article yesterday in which an actor from one of the soap operas spoke about his mother's struggle with dementia. He pointed out that he can afford to keep her at home but there are people who simply do not have the resources to provide home care for their loved ones. I hope the Government will commit to making progress on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_718">This is my first opportunity as a Deputy to bring a motion before the House. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, that it is a non-contentious proposal, and with Deputy Harty that it also is a sensible one. I am delighted it has attracted such a high level of cross-party support. A small number of Members have chosen not to support it, which is their choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, for her comprehensive response. She explained that 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from the intensive home-care packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme, which is due to expire at the end of 2017. I was concerned about the expiration date and how we might move forward from there, but the Minister of State explained this was only the beginning and it will move on from there. That is most welcome. I thank the Government for supporting this important motion. I take the opportunity, too, to thank Deputy Ó Caoláin and his colleagues in Sinn Féin for their support for the motion. The Deputy referred to the housing adaptation scheme, which is very important to people living at home. I also recognise the work of Senator Colette Kelleher, whose office is close to mine and with whom I worked closely on this motion. </p>
          <p eId="para_720"> As a society, we must prepare for the implications of an ageing population. I welcome the fact that in the United States, the Democratic Party nominee for President, Hillary Clinton, has committed, if elected, to finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease by 2025. Ireland has some of the world's best geneticists and neurobiologists and we can and must play our part in trying to find a cure.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> I acknowledge the work of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in supporting people throughout the country who are living with dementia. I am honoured to be chairing a cross-party committee on dementia. My focus in this motion and in my work on the committee is to raise awareness of dementia. That is the most important thing we can do. I welcome the Alzheimer Society of Ireland's vision that nobody should go through dementia alone. Dementia-friendly communities provide an opportunity to demystify dementia so that it is no longer perceived as something to be feared. These communities demonstrate a high level of public awareness and understanding of dementia. In Ireland, such communities are found in Galway, Donegal, Mallow and Wicklow, to name but a few.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> Experts in the field have pointed out that with the right information and supports, people can live well with dementia and there need not be a stigma attached to it. Community-based dementia advisers offer a critical early intervention for those living with the condition and help to promote dementia awareness within communities. Since the middle of 2014, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland has funded seven dementia advisers who cover specific parts of the country. It is nowhere near enough but it is a start. If that initiative could be rolled out throughout the country to build a comprehensive dementia advisers network, it would be an important development.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> I thank colleagues for their support for the motion. The most important point I want to make is that we must provide the best possible quality of care for people with dementia and the best possible quality of life, preferably in their own home. That is what we are trying to achieve.</p>

          <p eId="para_725">I want to say a few words about this small technical Bill, which we are happy to support, before it is passed by the House. As the Minister of State said during the good debate we had on Committee Stage, this legislation provides for a cumulative increase from €150 million to €300 million in the capital funding that can be provided to Fáilte Ireland. I would like to reiterate the importance to our economy of the tourism sector, which grew by 13% in 2015. More than 8 million tourists visited the country in that year. If we are to ensure we continue to attract tourists to this country, it is very important that we stay competitive, maintain a high quality of service and keep our prices reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> In that regard, I want to take this opportunity to question the wisdom of the decision announced in budget 2017 to cut capital funding by 4%. It is incredible that such a regressive move is being made at a time when the tourism sector is facing serious challenges. I refer, for example, to the result of the Brexit referendum and the resultant devaluation of sterling. In 2015, some 41% of our overseas visitors came from Northern Ireland and the UK. I think this regressive step needs to be revisited. As I said when we considered this Bill on Committee Stage, there is no point in increasing the threshold if we are not going to exceed the amount of money we have invested in Fáilte Ireland over recent years. I asked a number of questions at that time and the Minister of State said he would revert to me on Committee Stage. I will repeat some of them today. Perhaps the Minister of State will come back to me with answers at a later stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> I will repeat the questions I asked about a critical area. The establishment of a new lakelands brand is intended to complement, rather than detract from, the existing brands of Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, is eagerly awaiting the establishment of the lakelands brand, just as I am as a representative of the constituency of Longford-Westmeath. It was a key commitment in the programme for Government that this would happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> The most recent tender that was put out precluded areas like Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and Tipperary from being included in the lakelands brand because they are already included in Ireland's Ancient East. We had a good discussion on this matter on Committee Stage. I am not trying to trip the Minister of State up. I just want to know the current position regarding the establishment of the lakelands brand. Is that going to be done any time soon? Can we have confidence? Will the Minister of State confirm to the House that the middle corridor of this country, as he referred to the area from the tip of Donegal to the butt of Cork that is not covered by Ireland's Ancient East or the Wild Atlantic Way, will be included in this new brand?</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> This Bill increases the cap that applies to Fáilte Ireland so that additional funding can be allocated to it. The Minister of State referred on Committee Stage to the process of opening for new applications for large capital projects. That is to be welcomed. The Minister of State said during the same debate that decisions would be made at arm's length from the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> Do we have any indication of when those decisions will be made? When can the groups that have made huge efforts to draw up comprehensive proposals expect to know what the decision is? Similarly, will the Minister of State tell us when we can expect applications to open under the smaller capital programme? We are delighted to support this technical Bill, which relates to a very important industry. We believe more needs to be done to support the industry because it is facing very challenging times, particularly in the context of Brexit, as I have mentioned. We are very reliant on visitors from the UK and Northern Ireland. I suppose that is something we can come back to at a later date.</p>

          <p eId="para_733"> Deputy Troy has repeated the request he made on Committee Stage for an update on the lakelands brand. This is one of the issues that were discussed when I met the chairperson of Fáilte Ireland recently. I will give the up-to-date position in this regard to Deputy Troy as soon as I get it. That is no problem. As I said on Committee Stage, we have some very good tourism brands in this country. The Wild Atlantic Way has been a phenomenal success. Ireland's Ancient East is a phenomenal success as well and I think it will be an even greater success into the future. There is a Dublin brand as well. I will not deviate from the point I made on Committee Stage, which is that I think local authorities can play a huge part in the response in these areas and brands, including in my own county. That is why the Department, at my instruction, recently asked that a subset of the County and City Management Association come together with a view to looking at how local authorities can assume the responsibility given to them under the local government Acts to ensure they exploit the capital investment that is allowable under Fáilte Ireland. I recently met the Westmeath county manager at an event along the banks of the Royal Canal.</p>

          <p eId="para_735">I was very impressed with the Westmeath county manager and the plan he has in place. I know they are called CEOs now, but I will always call them county managers. Many other county managers could learn a great deal from the manner in which the Westmeath county manager has taken to the job. I refer, for example, to the development of a greenway across his own county and into County Longford. I believe bodies like local authorities, Leader groups and Fáilte Ireland have a key role in this regard. I know Fáilte Ireland is looking at the whole concept of branding. As I have said since I went into the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, I believe the focus in the corridor from east Donegal, in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency, to the outskirts of Cork city should be driven by local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> I met representatives of the banks recently to discuss the ongoing investments in the tourism industry. I have also engaged with the County and City Management Association and with Fáilte Ireland regarding the part of the country where I see an obvious challenge. I agree with what Deputy Troy is saying in this regard because it affects my own county. The overall budget for tourism has been increased by €1 million. I know that is a small amount of money in the overall scale of the budget, but I am happy to get my hands on every amount of money I can. There will be a capital review in 2017. It has been brought forward. Fáilte Ireland will be calling for applications for the smaller-scale projects in the near future. I will give Deputy Troy the exact date when I get it.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> I would like to mention some of the other tourism development measures that were introduced or sustained in last week's budget. The retention of the 9% VAT rate is of great importance in County Limerick as much as it is in County Westmeath. I know hoteliers, restaurateurs, publicans and others were anxious to ensure it was retained. We have not deviated from our approach to the travel tax. These significant investments, which were introduced by the last Government, have been maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> I agree with what Deputy Troy has said about this country's exposure to Brexit. As I said at the committee, Brexit and competitiveness are the two biggest issues facing this country's tourism industry. Perhaps stability could also be mentioned as a third issue. We will face challenges as the Brexit issue evolves over time. Officials from Tourism Ireland have told me about their plans to instigate intensive marketing campaigns in Britain to ensure people there view not just this jurisdiction but the whole island of Ireland - as opposed to, say, Scotland - as a place to go on holiday. As sterling continues to devalue, the package that is available in Scotland will become much more competitive than it was before now.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> The challenge for us is to continue to advertise the unique quality we have here in Ireland, North and South. We must do this internationally through Tourism Ireland and nationally through Fáilte Ireland. It is clear from our engagement in recent months with representatives of bodies like the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland, and with tourism industry leaders through Fáilte Ireland, not only that they are acutely aware of the challenges that exist, but also that they are up to the challenge. I recently attended the Flavours of Ireland event in London, which was organised by Tourism Ireland and was purely designed to ensure we engage with the industry. Those involved in the industry will openly say that the pipeline into Ireland is very strong.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">However, the major concerns of people in the industry relate to competitiveness and Brexit - Deputy Troy is quite right in that regard. I have spoken to representatives of the Irish Hotel Federation to ensure we get good value for money for people coming here as well as for "staycationers", namely, people who holiday at home. They represent an important market as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> The Bill is technical in nature. It allows the Fáilte Ireland spending ceiling to rise, as Deputy Troy said. It also gives us an opportunity to discuss the tourism industry on Committee and Second Stages. However, the importance of the Bill lies not so much in the ceiling that will be raised when the Bill is eventually passed but rather to ensure appropriate capital funding for Fáilte Ireland for now and in the time to come. The authority is in the process of announcing major projects which will hopefully be vetted and allocated in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> It is not simply about that alone. It is also about ensuring that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Government and the Oireachtas in general see tourism as an industry that has helped drag the country out of the mire. The policy document, People, Place and Policy, estimates that by 2025 over 250,000 people will be employed in the tourism and hospitality sectors. That figure is accepted by all parties in the House and I am of the view that it can be exceeded far sooner. It will be exceeded far sooner if we do the small things properly and get the basics right. That is why I agree with Deputy Troy.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> I will get back to Deputy Troy before the end of the week on the exact timing involved and where we stand in respect of the specific issue on branding. I will also notify him of the date when the capital programme will be announced. As the Deputy quite rightly stated, it is not a decision for the Department because the process is at arm's length from the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> I am keen to make one point on branding. It is important that we work in an organised way, regardless of what we come up with for any given part of the country. I have a strongly held view on this matter and I believe local authorities are the key. Deputy Troy's part of the country has a great deal to offer. In fact, it is unique in terms of its offering. Local authorities have a role to play and that is why I have asked them to begin the process of developing, for 2017, county tourism strategies that will be reflective of the product in their counties. It cannot be all about the Department, Fáilte Ireland or the Oireachtas. City and county managers have a responsibility under the Local Government Act and they have to live up to it. I expect them to do so. I will challenge them in 2017 by asking every local authority to bring forward a tourism strategy for approval by the Department. If I believe a tourism strategy is sent to me as part of a box-ticking exercise, it will not be accepted by the Department. That strategy will be sent back and those responsible will be asked to do it again. I know this will not be the case in Deputy Troy's county of Westmeath, particularly in view of who is manager there.</p>

          <p eId="para_746">Fianna Fáil supports the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage. The main purpose of the Bill is to give a basis to one of the core planning reform recommendations of the Mahon tribunal. The recommendation in question calls for the establishment of an independent planning regulator to oversee and assess decision-making and other processes in planning authorities. We are committed to drawing from the lessons of the Mahon tribunal and improving transparency, consistency and good decision-making. Following strong action throughout the planning system when Fianna Fáil was in government, it is vital that we continue to put in place the legal institutional framework to prevent the corruption and planning abuses that the Mahon tribunal uncovered.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> The big problems are in the major urban centres such as Dublin and elsewhere. I served as a member of Sligo County Council for many years. There was never any question of corruption or anything like that. People did their business honestly. In Dublin, however, it is different because the value of an acre of land could increase from €20,000 to €2 million. One could understand that there is the possibility that corruption could take place, and it did.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> We believe this Bill strikes an appropriate balance in giving the new planning regulator independence in its role in evaluating local and regional development plans while maintaining some democratic control over the body by the Minister and the Oireachtas. However, we have a number of concerns regarding some of the key provisions. We believe these require further scrutiny and amendment. There are several major omissions from the Bill relating to key Mahon tribunal recommendations in respect of improving transparency and planning, the disclosure of political donations by planning applicants and the noting of all submissions by political representatives in planning applications. It is important that these facts are recorded and that people can see exactly who is supporting what at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> Some of the planning regulator functions and powers prescribed by the Bill may not make it an effective overseer of the national planning strategy. For example, the regulator is given no role in overseeing executive transport planning agencies, including the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII. The rationale given by Mahon for establishing the planning regulator was to achieve greater integration between land-use planning, including local authority zoning decisions and strategic transport planning. It is disappointing, therefore, that the new regulator is not given any role in overseeing the development or implementation of plans by the NTA or the TII.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> We are concerned that the limitation of the planning regulator's powers, as prescribed in the Bill, may make it toothless as an anti-corruption watchdog of the planning process. We also have serious reservations about placing the successor to the national spatial strategy - the Government's as yet undrafted national planning framework - on a statutory footing in view of the fact that it does not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> I wish to make a point about An Bord Pleanála. Any politician in the House can appreciate the way objections to planning applications are made to An Bord Pleanála. Some are vexatious and some are genuine. An Bord Pleanála sends inspectors to inspect sites and examine applications. Sometimes the inspector might recommend granting or refusal of an application only for the board to overturn the recommendation. That is unfair and people do not understand it. Sometimes the decision is made by a roomful of people in Dublin. The inspector has looked at the application and has made a decision. In fairness, that procedure should make a strong case for whatever the inspector says. However, this does not happen and it annoys people. This is something at which we should look and perhaps this Bill provides the opportunity to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> Another issue I am keen to raise relates to An Taisce, a prescribed body. We have a situation in Sligo at present involving a man who employs 12 people in a rural area. He runs a vegetable business and he has applied for planning permission. He could create a further 12 jobs. Given the area in which he is based, that would be the equivalent of 50 jobs in a small town. He applied and got planning permission from Sligo County Council. However, the application was objected to by An Taisce. The individual spent a great deal of money. He reapplied and addressed every issue raised by An Taisce. He went above and beyond in respect of the concerns expressed. We are not talking about a national heritage site or a national heritage building. The second objection related to a road. In fairness, Sligo County Council has plenty of engineers who can decide whether a road is safe. Unfortunately, this objection has cost the man a substantial amount of money. He is prepared to employ people and a further 12 jobs are available if he obtains planning permission. The case is before An Bord Pleanála. I hope the decision handed down will be fair and that he will be given the opportunity to progress his work. In fairness, An Taisce has a job to do and I would never question that to any great degree. However, to object to a planning application because of a road amounts to going way beyond the function of An Taisce in respect of planning. It is very unfair. We should look at these issues when we are considering planning legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_755">I welcome the opportunity to debate this very important legislation arising from the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal. Despite its rather anodyne title, the tribunal report dealt with issues of corruption in the planning process. It is disappointing that it has taken so long for Government to implement some aspects of its recommendations. It is even more disappointing that many aspects of the report's key recommendations remain unimplemented. It is also important to point out that given the length of time since the Mahon tribunal was established, the debate on how best to tackle corruption in public life has moved on and Government action on these issues and the issues raised in the tribunal report should not be limited just to its own recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> One of the areas dealt with by the tribunal and worst affected by politicians trading cash for votes was in my constituency Dublin Mid-West. The zoning and planning decisions that led to the development of Liffey Valley continue to have a profound negative consequence for the communities of Clondalkin and Lucan. In exchange for bribes, politicians named in the Mahon tribunal report disregarded a long-standing proposal for a town centre in Clonburris to serve the social, economic and cultural needs of the local community. In its place, they facilitated an out-of-town shopping centre in Liffey Valley which served neither the needs nor the interests of the people who lived at that time in Dublin Mid-West. Politicians made the decision in exchange for donations to their election campaigns, printing of leaflets and posters, trips to Cork to meet Seanad election voters and expensive meals and fancy hotels. Today, communities in Bawnogue, north Clondalkin and south-east Lucan live without a viable town centre, without adequate amenities, services or infrastructure. It is important to keep in mind the real human cost of the planning decisions that the Mahon tribunal examined. </p>
          <p eId="para_757"> When this House sets about the task of implementing the planning-related recommendations of the tribunal report, we need to make sure that we do a job in a way that ensures communities such as those in Clondalkin and Lucan are never treated in this way again, and that those who are responsible for the decisions do not go unpunished. Before I comment on the substantive proposal in the Bill, the office of the planning regulator, I want to raise several issues about other aspects of it. I would like the Minister to clarify some matters in the Bill and omissions from it. I am conscious that many of us who were Members of the Thirty-first Dáil did not have the benefit of the very extensive engagement at the then environment committee preceding the drafting of the Bill. Some of my questions may have been dealt with at that stage. Those of us who are new are keen to get clarification on them. Section 8 relates to publication of documents on council websites. I welcome this move and many councils already do this as a matter of course. The issue does arise, however, of those without access to the Internet and how they can be assured of equal access to the information. I would be interested to hear at the end of the debate the Minister’s views on how we can ensure this access.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> Section 9 facilitates the making of planning opinions available electronically, which is also very welcome. Can the Minister assure us that this will not result in reduced access to non-electronic facilities as has been the case, for example, with motor tax registration as we are seeing in some parts of the country and library services? I am not clear on the purpose and intentions of sections 11 and 15 and would like the Minister, if possible, to provide more background to these changes. With respect to section 14, was consideration given at drafting stage to including other categories of premises, for example, fast food restaurants and takeaways? If not, would the Minister be open to considering the inclusion of these on Committee Stage? I am also concerned about the proposed exemption from publication of certain documents as outlined in the amendments to sections 9, 11, 12 and 13 and in particular exemptions arising from legal opinions or ministerial interventions. Could the Minister give more detail of the kinds of documents that he or the drafters of the legislation think will be covered by these exemptions?</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> I am also concerned by the absence of several key recommendations from the Mahon tribunal. While the issue of directly electing members of regional authorities has been deferred, does the Government have any proposals for improving the accountability or transparency of this body in planning related matters, which is a key concern of Mahon? Why has the Government ruled out using an independent appointments process for appointments to what was the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII? I listened with interest to Deputy Cowen during the previous session of this debate and I share his broad concerns at the omission of these transport bodies from the broader remit of the Bill and, like him, I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> Contrary to claims made previously, the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal on increasing transparency in the planning process have not been fully implemented in the Bill before us, which does not address some key proposals. I would like the Minister to say why this is the case and if we can return to these matters. Measures relating to decisions by councillors in contravention of the advice of officials and declarations of political donations by planning applicants remain unaddressed. These are key recommendations of Mahon. I urge the Minister to reconsider these important issues and either table his own amendments on Committee Stage or be open to those from Opposition parties. This is not a criticism of the current Minister but a point about how some of these issues were reported during the previous Dáil. It is not good enough to produce progress reports as has been previously the case, stating that recommendations are supported in principle or being progressed to some degree. I urge the Minister, now that he has taken responsibility for this Bill, to bring forward to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, at whatever stage is appropriate, more detailed progress reports on the implementation of the planning related aspects of the Mahon tribunal, stating very clearly what has and has not been done so that members are very clear about that aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> The real substance of the Bill is the creation of a planning regulator. It is not unjust to say that this is the most important recommendation that Mahon made in planning terms arising out of the report. It is important to read the key wording of that recommendation in chapter 18 1.14:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_762">...with regard to enforcement, the Tribunal is concerned that recent changes in the planning system have resulted in an over-centralisation of power in the hands of the Minister for the Environment which is not subject to sufficient checks and balances. Consequently, the Tribunal is recommending that the Minister for the Environment’s ability to give directions to Regional Authorities and Local Planning Authorities should be entrusted to a Planning Regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">It goes on to state that the Minister’s responsibility in terms of adopting the spatial strategies and development plans should continue. The specific wording of the tribunal is really important. The intentions of that recommendation are not contained in the Bill before us; in short, it simply does not create a planning regulator. The language used in section 31P of the Bill before us has been chosen very carefully and deliberately. This new body is being given powers only to evaluate, review, assess and observe specific aspects of the planning process. Crucially, and this is the big difference between what is at the heart of this Bill and the Mahon report, its only power is to make recommendations to the Minister, which he or she can disregard if he or she so wishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> While the training and research functions are without doubt welcome in the Bill, it cannot in any way be described as an independent body with the powers of regulation and enforcement as recommended by the Mahon tribunal. It is arguable that rather than enforcement powers being transferred from the Minister to the independent regulator, we actually end up with the contrary of what Mahon requested, which is increased powers being given to the Minister. That is against both the letter and the spirit of the tribunal's recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> The language in section 31AU dealing with complaints about specific planning matters is similarly weak. It refers to examinations not investigations. The powers to compel witnesses to secure relevant documentation and to make findings are not clear. This is something we will have to return to on Committee Stage. How any of this would have stopped the kind of planning corruption that left the people of Clonburris and Lucan without a town centre is not clear. If the Bill before us cannot prevent such corruption in the future, we would be better to return to pre-legislative scrutiny after drafting a Bill that does what Mahon recommended and what people across the country deserve. In addition to these legislative weaknesses, I am also concerned about the issue of resourcing. Whatever powers are eventually given to this new office, without adequate staff and funding these powers will be of limited value.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> I raise these issues because I am genuinely interested in the passage of this Bill. Sinn Féin is not going to stand in its way on Second Stage and will engage very constructively on Committee Stage by proposing amendments in the spirit of the tribunal’s recommendations. Having listened to the debate and the Minister’s comments at the start, all of us in this House want to have a fair, transparent and accountable planning system with a robust and independent system of regulation and enforcement. If we can do additional work on this Bill on Committee and Report Stages, we could end up with an Act that not only could we all support, but do so enthusiastically.</p>

        <speech by="#MauriceQuinlivan" eId="spk_361">
          <from>Deputy Maurice Quinlivan<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_767">Sinn Féin welcomes this legislation as it places the national planning framework on a statutory footing. The legislation is one of the outcomes of the Mahon tribunal which in itself was set up as a result of huge public disquiet, political instability and charges of corruption, criminality, brown envelopes and shady deals. The physical manifestation of that is found in every village, town and city across the country. Ghost estate sprawl, poor architecture, badly designed public realm and huge infrastructure deficits are the hallmarks of that era. The purpose of the legislation is to ensure that untrammelled, corrupt and vulgar development on such a scale never happens again.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> The Mahon tribunal shed a light on the dysfunctionality at the heart of the Irish political system and the failure and startling inability of the institutional machinery of the State to protect ordinary people from a corrupt and greedy political elite and officials. The lust and insatiable appetite for money pushed the price of land and housing into a different sphere and out of the reach of ordinary people, and city and county councils. A house became a commodity to be bought and sold to the highest bidder like any other product on the open market, with the sole aim of maximising profit. The idea that a house was not just a place for living in but a home with sentimental ties to family, which marked it apart, was all but ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> If we fast forward to 2016, we find ourselves in a shocking and shameful situation in that we cannot house large numbers of our people and young children spend the important formative years of their lives going to schools from cheap, cramped hotel rooms. This same society places no value on public housing. In the event that some units are to be built, the dominant discourse is about limiting the numbers, integration, and basically limiting the impact of housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> Long gone from both official and public discourse is the notion of public housing as a social good and a key component of the State's duty to house people. The main function of the new office of the planning regulator is to evaluate and assess local authority development plans, local area plans and regional, spatial and economic strategies during their development. I welcome this important provision in the Bill. I hope that the establishment of this office signals a clear departure from the corruption and greed of the past and that from now on, public interest and common good will take precedence over all issues, particularly over profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> I want to briefly mention the national spatial strategy, which the Mahon tribunal recommended be put on a statutory footing. As the Sinn Féin spokesperson for jobs, enterprise and innovation, I am confronted on a daily basis with the failure of successive Governments to plan for the long-term economic, social and infrastructural development of the country. Nowhere is that more evident than in Limerick, where we do not have a Limerick to Cork motorway, and no plans for one.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> We are now in a situation where the spatial and economic development of Dublin and the greater Dublin region is speeding ahead while the rest of the country languishes in a sort of economic limbo and is powerless to stop its decline. Uneven economic and spatial development has resulted in the overdevelopment of the Dublin region at the expense of the under-development of the rest of the country. There is an onus on all of us to face up to that fact, and to address it. My hope is that the new planning framework and the office of the planning regulator will mark the end of past practices which served only the corrupt and the greedy. We have truly crossed the Rubicon in terms of planning at all levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> Our task in the future must be sustainable development, grounded in good planning practices, that has the interest of ordinary people and communities at its core. That philosophy must be the guiding principle at local, national and regional levels. We cannot sort out local issues without also addressing regional imbalances, and we cannot deal with national problems unless local areas feel a genuine connection to national decision-making policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> I wish the office of the planning regulator well. This Bill is important, but it is only a first step in the momentous task of ensuring that Ireland has a planning system and culture fit for a 21st century country that likes to think of itself as a republic.</p>

          <p eId="para_775">As we all know, planning issues have been a huge area of contention and concern for many years. In the eyes of most people, the planning process represented one of the most corrupt areas where politicians and planners had a huge influence over zoning and development. To remind the House and to put in context what the Mahon tribunal meant to people living in my constituency, many working class communities, and particularly in Dublin West and Dublin North West, had been affected by corruption in planning matters, and some are still living with its consequences. It was big business, and those who held high political office conspired to corrupt the planning process. Those individuals used their positions of influence within some political parties to line their own pockets with corrupt payments by corrupt developers at the expense of the very communities and citizens they were elected to represent. The effect is that some estates are located on flood plains as a result of land rezoning decisions made by local councillors at the behest of landowners or property speculators, while sizeable populations in this city have to get into their cars to travel to a shopping centre because the one that was planned nearer to them was not built or those nearer to established communities were not facilitated against planning advice. There was over-zoning of lands, much of it in the wrong place, and absolutely no consideration given to any long-term strategy or support in terms of the required services.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> To this day, there are people dealing with these decisions every day of their lives so, as Members can imagine, it came as a surprise to me that one of the key recommendations of the Mahon tribunal, namely, the establishment of an independent office of the planning regulator, is not being fully addressed in this Bill. The tribunal was concerned that the changes in the planning system resulted in an over-centralisation of power in the hands of the Minister. As everyone knows, the Mahon tribunal recommendations were to improve transparency. The proposals in the Bill to establish an office of the planning regulator do not really deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> In May 2015, Sinn Féin and Deputy Brian Stanley brought forward a Private Members' motion calling for an independent planning regulator. The Government of the day voted against the Sinn Féin proposal. Our proposal included the strict application of planning criteria before any rezoning of land could proceed. We also proposed that any housing development must include access to social and cultural amenities, public transport, jobs and education facilities. I am disappointed that the Bill does not provide a fully independent office of the planning regulator, but I am not the only one disappointed with this Bill. In respect of enforcement and the role of the Minister regarding the office of the planning regulator, two bodies that have to deal with planning issues are also disappointed. An Taisce is largely disappointed with the proposed arrangements for the office of planning regulation, and the president of the Irish Planning Institute, Mary Hughes, stated: "...the Regulator can be overruled by the Minister meaning it is more advisor than Regulator in some respects and its powers fall short of those originally envisaged by the Mahon Tribunal." The Minister can overrule the regulator. What is the point of the office? It does not go far enough. If the proposed office of the planning regulator does not have teeth or real powers, it will not be effective. We are potentially back to those days where the corrupt and the financially astute decided how we lived in our country. We have concerns, as outlined by Deputy Eoin Ó Broin, and it is extremely important that we put in place a robust planning process and not one overseen by the Minister. While we welcome the Bill, it is clear more needs to be done. I hope the Minister will take on board our concerns.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Kenny<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_778">Considering the recommendations arising out of the Mahon tribunal were published four and a half years ago, it is good to see this Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill in the Oireachtas. We in Sinn Féin tried to bring a motion before the House last year, as Deputy Ellis stated, to establish a planning regulator's office but the Government opposed it on the basis that the legislation before the House now was coming on-stream. However, we believe this is a poor implementation of the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal. Our motion called for the appointment of an independent planning regulator because Mahon found rampant planning corruption in Dublin. As a rural Deputy for Sligo, Leitrim, west Cavan and south Donegal, I can attest that corruption did not end when one crossed the Dublin county line.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Rural Ireland is littered with ghost estates while many people cannot get planning permission to build in the field beside their home place. Rural Ireland is littered with the results of bad planning decisions, and these do not just affect those who live beside them, they affect us all. The flooding we have experienced in recent winters is due in no small part to construction on flood plains. These estates were built in areas with no facilities for families and they are not good places to live. Planning matters even more in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> To show how the planning regulator in this Bill is not the one envisaged by Mahon, I will read into the record the role of the planning regulator as recommended by the Mahon tribunal. Section 1.15 states that the planning regulator's role should be:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_781">[T]o investigate possible systemic problems in the planning system, including those raising corruption risks, with the aim of making recommendations to address those problems. The Regulator should also be responsible for providing training to members of both local and regional authorities on planning and development to enable them to discharge their functions in this area more effectively. The Regulator should have sufficient powers to carry out his or her functions effectively, including the power to question witnesses and compel the production of documents.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">That is a far cry from what this Bill is proposing, which is nothing more than an advisory position. The issue of planning permissions and regulations raises the hackles of many people in rural Ireland like almost nothing else. That is because of the disasters we have seen. To avoid more of them, to be more ecologically constructive, to be fair and to be transparent and honest, the planning regulator will need to have the teeth, backbone and powers as described in the Mahon recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> We have not forgotten how, when the then Minister, John Gormley, instigated investigations into seven local authorities with regard to planning decisions, the then Fine Gael Minister, Phil Hogan, stopped them by watering them down into ineffectiveness. I have not heard the present Minister, Deputy Coveney, say he will get to the bottom of the outrageous planning decisions that have arisen around this State, many with a planning history like that. It is even more worrying that, under the terms of the Bill, the Minister seems to be able to overrule the decisions of the so-called regulator. Everyone with an interest in good, honest and transparent planning has agreed that we need a regulator and not an adviser. This feature should be included in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> Last year Deputy Ferris introduced a rural equality Bill, which I will be reintroducing into this House shortly. I wonder if, were it to be enacted, the national planning framework would stand up to that kind of scrutiny. Where I come from, precious little attention is paid to equality in the provision of services and certainly not in respect of infrastructure. There are many examples and one of the big ones in rural Ireland, particularly in Leitrim, is what is practically a ban on rural planning permissions. This is because of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, rule that if the soil sample fails the test, no effluent can be allowed to flow. In these cases there is no possibility of using any kind of system, which effectively bans rural planning across vast areas of the country, even though there are engineering solutions which have worked in the past and still work perfectly well.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> Another issue is the need to deal with the unfinished estates around the country, of which there are many in rural towns with no footpaths, no lights and a developer who has gone bust and disappeared. The local authority is under pressure from people living there but they have a bond which is held by a company in London or Frankfurt. This company avoids its responsibilities while the local authority has to decide whether it will take the risk of doing the work and then calling in the bond. Many local authorities are afraid to take that risk because they do not know if they will get their money back if it goes to court. In these cases maybe 100 people, who had paid dearly for their houses and who had expected the estates to be finished, are left high and dry as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> Infrastructure is also very important for rural Ireland, and rural Ireland wants a planning process in which an infrastructure project can be delivered quickly and effectively, especially in the case of fibre optic broadband, which is vital. The role of Irish Water has also come up for discussion in rural Ireland. The local authority used to be in charge of our water services and if a business wanted to come to a rural town, it would want to know if water and sewerage services were available. Now they find the local authority has no control over it and it has passed to Irish Water. Companies who might want to come to Manorhamilton or Ballyshannon will not do so without those services. They will go elsewhere if they have the capacity to provide the sewerage and water services they require.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> There are many areas in planning that need to be dealt with, but at the forefront is ensuring housing estates that are only partly finished are finished properly and that, where people want to buy houses in rural areas and have the justification for it, they can do so. I look forward to the regulator who will be put in place by this Bill being able to deal with these issues and to make a constructive difference. For too long these things have been kicked from pillar to post while many people in rural areas have been betrayed by the planning process. Amendments will be necessary to the Bill in order that the regulator has teeth to deal with these issues. I hope it goes through with speed and is implemented in order that people can be proud of it.</p>

        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_364">
          <from>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_788">I welcome this Bill which has been a long time coming. Its history goes back to a long time before the publication of the Mahon report. There was the McCracken report and then the Flood report, which led to Mahon. They were established because of appalling corruption in the dealings between public representatives, planners and developers. As Deputy Ellis said, that did a great disservice to people, particularly those living at the edge of Dublin who had to live with the consequences. It also led to an abhorrence of the practice of the brown envelope. I remember the news reports of the evidence of gatherings in public houses at which councillors were met and given their envelope, with planning decisions being made as a result of these corrupt payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> We need to remember the source of the legislative proposals we are discussing today, namely, the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal, but not all politicians behaved in this way and Deputy Joan Burton in my own party, who was a member of the county council at the time, vehemently fought against the corruption she saw all around her. Deputy Broughan also had personal experience of what was going on and he will speak later of that. It is a terrible indictment of public representatives that they behaved in this way. It was not only public representatives. Planning officials were also involved, as were developers who stood to gain a great deal. It is not a victimless crime and there are people for whom a shopping centre that was meant to be close by was put somewhere else because somebody paid people to vote for rezoning and changes in planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> The background is grubby and unethical but, thankfully, it brought about a total change in how we approach these issues. There is legislation before us tonight but a series of legislative and other measures has been brought in by this House, including ethics legislation, legislation controlling political donations and legislation requiring lobbyists to register.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Thankfully, we now have a very different situation where there is much more transparency and where the possibility of corrupt behaviour for personal gain and greed has been taken away because of these various legislative and other measures, and that is to be welcomed. What we want is a planning system that serves the community and does not serve private interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> Another measure that was taken was to get rid of developer-led plans. Previously, developers could submit planning proposals, not only individual plans but local area plans. I have to declare an interest because I was Minister of State at the then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with responsibility for planning for some of that period, including that particular measure, and I and other Ministers used powers under section 31 of the Planning and Development Act to stop proposed zonings because they were not in accord with good evidence-based planning and due to issues such as building on flood plains to which Deputy Martin Kenny referred. There were so many abuses in the past and to paraphrase somebody else, a lot has been done. We are doing one of the "more" things, so to speak, by bringing in this legislation to implement the main recommendations of the Mahon tribunal, as others have said, particularly the establishment of the office of the planning regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> Another measure is putting the national development plan, which I understand will now be called the national planning framework, on a statutory footing in order that it has the power and authority of statute. Planning needs to be evidence based, but it also needs to fit into a hierarchy, which is the term that is used, where we have the national spatial plan, regional plans, local authority plans, what are called core strategies in which local areas decide on their strategy and priorities and what they have to do to serve their population in terms of providing housing, schools, infrastructure and everything else a community needs, and local area plans. These all have to be part of a whole in order that we know what we are doing, why we are doing it in different areas, and people do not build something merely because it serves their own interests and that is not in accordance with proper planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> Often planning does not get the central position it deserves in our national debates. We also need to ensure we have different kinds of plans. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has housing plans. For example, we have capital plans. We need to make all these plans fit together and serve the purposes of the community. In this regard, I agree with my constituency colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, on having a balance in the country and not having everything happen on the east coast. We need to link up the parts of the country, and that is why the Limerick-Cork road is so important. It is about not having everything go into or come out of Dublin and having the rest of the country linked. That is important in terms of getting balanced regional development. That is my general view on the importance of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> The Bill makes a number of provisions, the main one being the office of the planning regulator. It provides for the publication of submissions on local area plans and development plans on the websites of planning authorities. That is by way of providing the public with information with regard to the plans under which planning applications are made and under which other decisions are made with regard to the local area. The sending of notice to the relevant regional assembly of any proposed grants of planning permission which would constitute a material contravention of a development plan or local area plan is about having the hierarchy of plans fitting in with each other. The provision that the local authority development plan can regulate, restrict or control the location of new licensed premises is an innovative one. Underpinning in statute the concept of electronic planning allowing the introduction of online planning applications, appeals and payments is purely practical in terms of how the process works and the modern technology we have now.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> Requiring planning authorities to provide data for databases on our national planning systems, as may be specified by the Minister, is about having the appropriate information that can provide the evidence for decisions that are appropriate and objective. I attended the briefing on the national planning framework which the Department provided recently, and one of the statistics arising was that the minimum projected population growth over the next 20 years is 500,000 people. Obviously, we have to plan for the future where our population will significantly increase, but we must do that in a way that avoids doing the kind of stupid things that happened previously whereby houses were built, with due respect to Deputy Martin Kenny, in some counties where there was no population to justify them, and yet in areas where there was a need, houses were not built. We now know where populations grow. We know where populations are and where they are likely to be in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> In my previous role as Minister for Education and Skills, the demographic information we had was very useful in planning schools several years ahead. We knew that there were a certain number of children already born in certain areas who would require a school. There has been much more integration with the local authorities in the planning of schools, for example, and this measure works in tandem to avoid a situation where a school is needed in an area in a year's time. We plan well ahead. Those kinds of relationships have been built up now between the Department of Education and Skills and local authorities, and that is a good development.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> The other measures are around providing for the payment of reduced fees or no fees by elected members when making submissions on applications for planning permissions and the noting of such representation on the relevant planning file. The balance in that is important. Local authority members made the point that it is part of their job to have a view on these matters, but this provides that they do not merely have a word in the planner's ear. Those views are noted on the file in order that it is clear that they have been expressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> I refer to the main issue, which is the planning regulator and the decisions with regard to the office of the planning regulator. I hold a different view from the one expressed by Deputy Eoin Ó Broin. I think the balance is correct. One is getting the balance between evidence-based planning and the democratic role of both local authority members and, in this case, the Minister. If the planning regulator were to make the final decision, there would not be accountability. We have often heard complaints that answers cannot be obtained in this Chamber from the National Transport Authority or the HSE. The decision, which the committee, when looking at these proposals, agreed with as well, was that the regulator would make the recommendation after an investigative process was completed but that the recommendation would then be given to the Minister, who would make the final decision and he or she would then be accountable. If the Minister were to make a decision that was different from the recommendation of the planning regulator, the Minister would have to explain why he or she was making a different decision. I hope I have understood that correctly. I think I have.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">Therefore, there is accountability. The recommendation is published. The Minister's opinion is published. If the Minister makes a different decision, he or she has to explain why. That is a fair balance between democratic accountability and evidence-based planning. It is well known that one of those central to the investigations of the Mahon tribunal was a senior planner in the local authority concerned, and planners are not immune from corruption either.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">There are not purist planners here who somehow or other should be given all-embracing power. Planners do not have public accountability whereas Ministers do. I think the right balance has been struck between democratically-elected people and trained and expert planners. There is balance at local level whereby local authority members must sign off on the plan, which must be based on the core strategy and fit into national and regional planning. There is a great deal of material now in the public arena and public representatives are held to account to ensure the plan they adopt is in accordance with proper planning. Public representatives do not make individual planning decisions, which are left to professional planners. I think the right balance has been struck at local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> It is an interesting debate and it is one that is worth having. It is valid for people to have different views on the Bill. We have been discussing the core element of the proposed legislation but there are other elements to it as well. I hope we will deal with the Bill relatively quickly but at the same time that we will have the necessary debate on it. There will be further Stages in the Dáil and subsequently in the Seanad. We will support the Bill on Second Stage and I expect we will also propose amendments on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_806">I wish to give an overview of the Bill we are discussing. The publication of the long-awaited final report of the Mahon tribunal brought to an end the longest running and most expensive public inquiry in Irish history. The Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, which was the tribunal’s official title, was established by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in November 1997 and held 917 days of public hearings with 400 witnesses. The tribunal’s terms of reference were soon expanded to allow for the investigation of all suspect payments to politicians and local authority officials in connection with a spate of rezonings in Dublin city. The tribunal cost the public in or around €250 million, taking into account third party costs, so it was a high price to pay for the grubby actions of certain people - politicians, developers and planners - involved in the planning process.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> That brings me to certain points I will make on the regulator. The Mahon report was issued in 2012. The process involved many witnesses and the investigation of politicians and planners and I am very concerned that parts of the report’s recommendations are not being implemented. I would like more of an explanation as to why the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal are not being implemented to the letter.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> The Liffey Valley shopping centre was built in an area where it should not have been built, as people did not have access to it. The shops in the centre are a bit more expensive than shops in other areas. Houses that were built on the flood plains in the Blanchardstown area and likewise in Athboy were flooded two or three times because they were built on flood plains. Many people suffered because of that and could not subsequently get home insurance, for example. The follow-up response to the bad zoning decisions, bad planning and bad building was to put in flood barriers, which also cost the taxpayer money.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> The man and woman in the street saw the tribunals as more of a fig leaf to allow the politicians to say: "Carry on, there is nothing to see here and we will get back to our business of being in the Dáil and getting paid our wages". Nobody was brought to account following the tribunals. The only person who went to prison did so because he did not respond to an instruction from the tribunal rather than due to the tribunal’s findings. The then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, resigned in 2008 due to the controversy surrounding the tribunals. People were very angry about what happened and rightly so.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> Four judges were involved in the course of the tribunal. To my knowledge, 64 recommendations were put forward for further consideration on a range of policy areas including planning, conflicts of interest, political finance, lobbying, bribery, corruption in office, money laundering and the misuse of confidential information, asset recovery and miscellaneous matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> The tribunal made a total of ten planning recommendations, all of which I will read out. The first was to place the national development plan and the national spatial strategy on a statutory footing. The second was to directly elect members of regional authorities. The third was to facilitate documentation of regional authority considerations in making draft regional planning guidelines. The fourth was to have an independent appointments board to appoint members of the National Transport Authority. The fifth was to increase transparency in the planning process. The sixth was to provide for advance notice of material contravention of development plans. The seventh was to restrict the use of the procedure set out in section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001. The eighth was to provide for documentation of submissions and interventions made by elected members on applications for planning permission. The ninth was to introduce a requirement to identify relevant political donations when making a planning application for planning permission. The tenth was to transfer the Minister’s enforcement powers to an independent planning regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> They were the ten key recommendations made by the Mahon tribunal. As far as I am aware – Members can correct me – recommendations 1, 3 and 5 have been partly implemented. It is not proposed to implement the recommendation on the independent appointments board. It is considered that recommendation 2 on having directly-elected members of regional authorities, would be incorporated as part of a broader local government reform programme in the future. The outstanding recommendations are from 6 through to 10. They include the provision for advance notice of a material contravention of development plans and restriction of procedures set out in section 140 of the Local Government Act. It was felt that they would result in additional responsibilities for An Bord Pleanála and could be achieved by way of legislative amendment, according to the then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. I would like to know what those amendments are.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> The tribunal also recommended that interventions made by elected members in respect of specific planning applications should be noted on the file and that the file should be made available for inspection on the relevant planning authority’s website. That is currently practiced by some planning authorities. However, the Department, in its analysis of the tribunal’s recommendations, stated that a circular or amendment to regulations could make the process more transparent in that it could clarify that any form of contact by an elected representative, be it by phone, e-mail or other means, should be recorded on the planning file of all planning authorities. I fully support that approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> The Department’s analysis also stated that recommendation 9, while logical, is difficult to implement in that reliance on accurate declarations would be required and would be difficult to verify. That was the recommendation to introduce a requirement to identify relevant political donations when making a planning application for planning permission. I do not think we can accept that. We must find a way, if we can, to determine if anyone has received a political donation from anybody in relation to a planning application.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> The final recommendation relates to the establishment of an independent planning regulator, which would require the amendment of planning legislation. The tribunal recommended that the Minister for the environment's enforcement powers should be transferred to an independent planning regulator who should also be charged with carrying out investigations into systematic problems in the planning system as well as being conferred with education and research functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">There is a question over the required staffing levels for an independent regulator. </p>
          <p eId="para_817"> What is the reason for the change in the provision that the regulator may also advise the Minister to reject or overturn part or all of a plan when it is not deemed acceptable? The advice will be published and the final decision to act will rest with the Minister of the day who will be accountable to the Oireachtas for his or decision. That is not an independent regulator. If the independent regulator deems that he or she must reject or overturn part or all of a plan because it is not acceptable, it should be brought to the Dáil to be debated. It should not be the decision of the Minister. It should be brought to the Chamber to be debated. That is proper accountability. It should go back to the public representatives again after going through the councils. It should be brought through for the regulator to adjudicate over and decide it is all above board and that all planning regulations have been adhered to. It should then come back to the Dáil if there is a problem with it. If the Minister does not disagree with it, he or she should bring it back to the Dáil to elected public representatives for discussion and debate. I will table amendments of that nature to the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> Regarding the staffing levels of An Bord Pleanála at the moment, as a result of the cuts over the past number of years to An Bord Pleanála, it has reduced staff and resource levels. The regulator, whoever it is, will have to be fully resourced on these matters because at present An Bord Pleanála has reduced the capacity with which it can process planning appeals. In order to cope with a growing backlog of cases, in recent years the board made a decision to focus on strategic infrastructure cases, in other words applications of national or regional significance. It then makes decisions on regular planning cases in chronological order. It was a decision An Bord Pleanála had to make because of the cutbacks. This contributed to the delay of new developments, including a delay in residential units being delivered into communities. If the regulator is set up, which it should be, it should be independent and able to make a recommendation to the Minister. The Minister should come back to the Dáil to debate it and it should not be a decision of the Minister. It should be independent and accountable.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_819">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak briefly on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016. It is welcome that the Bill is finally before us and provides for an office of the planning regulator, which was a key recommendation of the Flood-Mahon tribunal. Ordinary constituents and citizens welcome the idea of a regulator because we often have a situation in planning where some crass development is proposed which is not sustainable or is totally out of sync with its immediate district. Perhaps when people register their opposition to it they are supported by the council but when it goes to An Bord Pleanála, it overturns the decision and permission is granted. As it is now, the only recourse is to go to the High Court on a point of law. At least we will now have a regulator to whom our constituents can make a complaint. At that basic level, the idea of a regulator is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> The Mahon tribunal's final report was published early in 2012 and made 64 recommendations to the then Government. Ten of these 64 recommendations were on the planning system and the key recommendation was the need for an independent planning regulator. This Bill is part of a series of Bills introduced by the Government in a feeble attempt to address the housing crisis through the Construction 2020 strategy. While the steps taken by these Bills are to be welcomed, it is a very slow process. At the end of 2016, in my constituency and many other urban areas, the desperate need of families for housing is acute and despite the roll out of the HAP programme, it is worsening. </p>
          <p eId="para_821"> For most citizens, over its 15 year lifetime, the Flood-Mahon tribunal revealed a history of brazen attempts to subvert the democratic planning process. Failure to implement the Kenny report of 1974 allowed the hoarding of huge land banks around the greater Dublin region and similar practices around other cities and towns in Ireland. When development plans came along, councils were subjected to immense pressures. Councils used to be in charge of water before Deputy O'Sullivan's party was in Government. We were the water authority. It is very striking that while elected councillors are not the planning authority, housing authority or drainage authority, they had a unique power to rezone land in their functional area at the time of development plans. It is an extraordinary and important power but it was open to very severe pressure. We had the careers of lobbyists like Frank Dunlop and agents for the developers allegedly seeking to influence zoning and the shape of development plans. While some conclusions of the Flood-Mahon tribunal may be rolled back, the tribunal clearly revealed very disturbing practices in the making of development plans. It also demonstrated a planning process for the development of our towns and cities which compares very unfavourably with the far more democratic and publicly controlled land zoning and planning systems in countries like Sweden, Norway, Finland and indeed the UK. In my region of the north fringe of Dublin city or the south fringe of Fingal, we were shown comparisons with the cities of Stockholm and Amsterdam when they developed new huge urban regions like we were hoping to develop of 20,000 or 30,000 homes with ancillary social services, schools, health centres and so on. The process in Sweden and Holland was much more publicly controlled.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> On a number of occasions in the Thirty-first Dáil I asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Taoiseach to report on the current situation with regard to the investigations by An Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions into the findings of the Flood-Mahon tribunal. The Minister told me in May 2015: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_823">As the Deputy may recall from my reply to his further question No. 491 of 24 March, the position is that following the examination by An Garda Síochána of the report of the Moriarty Tribunal, the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions was sought with a view to determining whether or not a full Garda investigation should be commenced. The Garda authorities have also been engaged in an examination of the Report of the Mahon Tribunal, which was referred to the Garda Commissioner by the Government. This examination is ongoing at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, has just left the Chamber but perhaps he might refer in his reply to the examination of the report of the Mahon tribunal and whether the Government has received a report from the Garda Commissioner. Will he indicate if the examination is continuing, whether full Garda investigations are proceeding and whether any file has been sent to the DPP? </p>
          <p eId="para_825"> Chapter II on the establishment, functions, organisation and staffing of the office of the planning regulator is the heart of the Bill. In section 31P, the key functions of the regulator include the evaluation of development plans, variations of plans, local area plans and regional spatial and economic strategies. They are all very important aspects of planning. The key power in section 31P(1) is to bring a plan which the regulator considers deficient to the attention of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. The office also has important research, education and review functions and has to produce an annual report and statement of strategy. I agree with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan about the importance of sustainable planning in creating a humane society in which people can live very comfortably. It is a critically important subject. </p>
          <p eId="para_826"> The regulator has to take cognisance of the policies and aims of the Government, the public interest, EU directives on environmental impact statements, the habitats directive, the birds directive and especially the national planning framework, which is given statutory basis in the Bill, which I welcome warmly. The planning regulator is appointed by the Minister as provided for in section 31W for five years following a competition by the Public Appointments Service. Its accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and its annual report sent to the relevant Oireachtas committee. Two committees in this House, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, will have the opportunity to question the regulator. They can send the regulator a note asking him or her to attend. Deputy O'Sullivan feels that the Bill got things right on the public control of planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> The helpful Bill's digest prepared, very well as always, by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service staff, notes that the Mahon tribunal recommended establishing a post of independent planning regulator, as Deputy Joan Collins mentioned, and that the Minister’s powers of enforcement and to issue directions to planning authorities should be transferred to that new office. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, in its pre-legislative scrutiny in response to the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly’s general scheme of a Planning and Development (No 2) Bill, agreed with his recommendation that the final power to issue directions following assessment of local plans should rest with the Minister. However, given the history of the Flood and Mahon tribunals, I fundamentally disagree and agree with other colleagues who have spoken tonight. The planning regulator should be fully independent of the Government. After all, and I emphasise this point for my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, when I asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, about car insurance prices going through the roof, and our constituents screaming at us as a result, he replied with a long letter in which he said he cannot do anything about it because the Central Bank is independent. In the past, when I asked the former Minister, former Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and other Ministers about energy prices and what they intended to do about those prices going through the roof at the time, they said they could not do anything because the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, was independent. When I asked about the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, and the rip offs in mobile telephony, which still exist and we are not sure how that will pan out regarding roaming charges and so forth as a result of Brexit, I was again told that ComReg was independent and the Minister could do nothing. Why should it be the case that in the vital area of planning the regulator should not be fully independent?</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> When an inspector is appointed and prepares a report, the Bill is unclear on whether the Minister may depart from a planning regulator recommendation after an investigative process has been completed by the regulator. The general scheme of the Bill referred to periodic reviews of regulators under the OECD’s best practice principles for transparency and accountability, but did not indicate how often this should take place. The provisions of the Bill before us also have this lacuna and it appears to be left to the regulator to conduct his or her reviews of the performance of their own office. Obviously, the Oireachtas committees will keep an eye on the performance of the regulator, but perhaps the Minister will examine this matter on later Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> The Bill does not make provision for the establishment of a national register of enforcement orders and-or sanctions imposed by courts for breaches of planning law. The environment committee of the Thirty-first Dáil called for such a register so it would be possible to easily identify, on a nationwide basis, developers in breach of planning law. As part of our job as public representatives representing our constituents, Members generally know what developments are taking place in their constituencies and are interested to know the track records of developers, particularly people engaging in major commercial or housing developments. Recommendation No. 6 of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht report called "for the introduction of a national register of enforcement orders and/or sanctions imposed by the courts for breaches of planning law". According to that committee, it should be possible to readily identify on a nationwide basis any developers who have engaged in serious or serial breaches of the law. This is not provided for in the Bill. It is a major gap in the legislation and should be addressed on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> I recall a Bill I was proud to support in the Twenty-eighth Dáil. It was a planning Bill put forward by my great Fingal colleague, former Deputy Sean Ryan, one of the greatest Deputies ever to speak in this House. The Bill sought to refuse any further planning permission to a developer who had failed to carry out the provisions of an earlier planning permission or to remedy major defects arising from the permission. We have seen developments with horrendous defects, for example, in the north fringe, yet developers put forward new developments before the remediation has taken place or before we have had a chance to study their track record. Unfortunately, that Bill was defeated by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, which refused to put any constraints on developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> In view of the history of planning, the code of conduct in section 31AL is vital. It will relate to the management of conflicts of interest. I note that there will be a written policy statement which will set out the need to disclose relevant relationships and interests within the regulator, including memberships of other agencies and, importantly, disclosing financial interests, whether work outside the office is taking place, gifts and so forth and disclosing information which may be of importance to the work of the office. It will also lay down the best practice for reviewing and management of development plans and submissions. I did not notice whether there is a cooling off period for the regulator and its staff. In other words, if the regulator leaves the office of regulator, will there be a period during which that person could not immediately go to work for a property company or developers? Is there an intention to include such a provision? If it is included I did not see it. I believe we have that type of provision relating to other areas of the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> With regard to section 31AS, I welcome the provision for reviews of those involved in planning and their systems and procedures. The section sets out the parameters of the review, including the provision for sending a draft report of the review along with recommendations to the relevant planning authority and other appropriate recipients. I am most familiar with the development plans of Dublin City Council, of which I was proud to be a member for 12 years, and of Fingal County Council, which I have been proud to represent for the past 24 or 25 years. We were educated through those development plans to seek the highest standards of sustainable planning in our areas, particularly in major developments, and in the sustainable development of the north side of Dublin city.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> I welcome the provision in section 31AU for access to information during a review, and that once an authorised person is assigned to the review the Bill provides that he or she will have the authority to enter lands and other premises for inspection. Should somebody not comply with an office of the planning regulator request or, indeed, obstruct or impede a review, the Bill provides for such obstruction or non-compliance to be classified as an offence. Employees and consultants working with the OPR will also be prohibited from disclosing information. How will that chime in with the Protected Disclosures Act 2014? The House has had long discussions about the role of whistleblowers in the Garda Síochána and in other organisations, so I wonder how that will pan out in respect of that section.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> Chapter lIA of the Bill provides for the replacement of the national spatial strategy with the national planning framework. I welcome that. Sometimes, however, I believe there is a feeling among our rural colleagues that everything goes to Dublin and so forth. Of course, we feel the opposite and that the city has not been given sufficient resources. The population of the greater Dublin area is heading towards 2 million people. If we want Dublin to be a premier league capital city and a premier capital of the European Union, which I believe everybody does, we must include that as an ambition. There should be a section of the framework discussing the capital city and stating that the city will be planned to the highest international standards. I recall the budget day when the former Minister for Finance, former Deputy Charlie McCreevy, announced decentralisation, which seemed to include a range of towns and villages across the country. I believe that was the wrong approach. In spreading development across the regions, we should have concentrated on building up cities such as Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Sligo, Castlebar, Tralee, Letterkenny and the Athlone-Tullamore nexus in the midlands, to hold their populations and give them the widest range of social services and jobs. The ambition should be included to have Dublin as a premier capital city but also to develop Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's city and our other cities as fine, important regional capitals as well. Section 20C(2) outlines the matters the national planning framework will address and it should include something on the capital. Such infrastructure includes water, waste, energy, health and cultural requirements. There is also a framework for maritime spatial planning. Under Directive 2014/89/EU, a framework for maritime spatial planning must be established. The framework will be reviewed every six years, and I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> Regarding our capital, I am of the view that, at times, there has been a lack of a cohesive plan for the region among the four councils. In the south fringe of Fingal and the north fringe of Dublin city, one tends to find the planners of the two councils doing their own thing and meeting very rarely to plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">In my constituency, a person living in Baldoyle and another person living up the road in Donaghmede do not really think of themselves as being in two different local authorities. It is the same region. One of planning's key failures is the fact that the north fringe of our city was not a single strategic development zone. This is something that should be worked out for the future. I was once a member of the regional assembly for the greater Dublin region. This included counties around Dublin, including that of the Ceann Comhairle. We need to work together to have a sustainable and, hopefully, a very fine urban environment. We need a direct election for the mayor of the Dublin region, a cohesive plan for the region and all the facilities we need for sustainable development. </p>
          <p eId="para_837"> Deputy Jan O'Sullivan referred to developer-led planning and said that we had got rid of it. I do not think that is the reality. If one looks at the kind of plans that are coming before Dublin City Council, one can see that developers are still making the running. I agree with the Deputy that this House and the county and city councils are the ones who should make the running and have the master plan. For example, the north fringe had a few lines scribbled on a page instead of a detailed plan. When we get the plan together, that is the time to bring in the builders and let them build. </p>
          <p eId="para_838"> I welcome the planning regulator with a few caveats. I would like the office to be fully independent and I hope a few issues I have mentioned will be addressed. I hope it will be a step in sustainable planning and the sustainable development of our country. </p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_371">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_839">I am also delighted to be able to speak here tonight on this Bill, which we discussed in the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government with the Minister. I am disappointed he has gone. I know he could not stay all night but he has left the Chamber. Much of the Bill came about as a result of the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal. The public in Tipperary, and the public all over the country and I, are sick and tired of tribunals and more tribunals and hearings by retired eminent judges. When someone fills out a form for a college course, they will have to put in a position for a retired judge or justice of the peace because it is inquiry after inquiry. It is like a spinning top. Nobody knows when it is going to stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> We had the Mahon tribunal, and there are lots of references to it in the explanatory memorandum. The tribunal went on for 997 days and cost hundreds of millions of pounds, with still more to be paid in euro because there are still outstanding challenges regarding fees and expenses. What happened? What was the result apart from keeping journalists busy, selling newspapers and exposing dirty laundry in public? We have all these recommendations and are acting on some of them, but no real charges were brought. We know that the file is still with the Garda Commissioner and we do not know whether any charges will be preferred by the DPP. If they do not hurry up, all the people they were investigating will be dead. It is like something one would see in outer Mongolia. There is no effective accountability. We are waiting and waiting for the DPP. We do not know if the files have been referred and, if they have been referred, we do not know when the DPP will come back with recommendations for prosecution, if any. That is a very unhealthy situation in our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> We know it came about because of the boom in Dublin. I listened to Deputy Broughan, for whom I have great respect. He lamented the fact that people in the country complain that Dublin gets everything. We are complaining with some justification that Dublin gets most of the cake. There is congestion and huge problems but if Deputy Broughan was living in Tipperary, east Cork or even south or north Kildare, not to mention Kerry, he would see that we get the crumbs. We do not even get the crumbs. We might get a bit of the vapour that blows off the mist from what goes on in the city. It is an imbalance that must be addressed, but this Bill does not do so. </p>
          <p eId="para_842"> This Bill does not address many issues. We talk about setting up a regulator as if it was the Almighty. We have regulators galore. It is a mushrooming industry. There are regulators for everything and they are regulating nothing. We see the insurance scandals at the moment where people and families are being ripped off and plundered for car insurance, house insurance and business insurance. We have a regulator, but what is he or she doing? I am talking about the office of the regulator. It is nothing personal. It is doing absolutely nothing. It has no powers and the same is true of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. When I and lots of other people have complained to it and asked it to intervene, we are told that it is not its area, it cannot intervene and it does not have enough enforcement officers. It is a joke.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> Ordinary people have to comply. For example, there was a dawn raid quite recently in Tipperary involving up to 14 small bus operators - the little people who are vulnerable and can be challenged. There were huge dawn raids and their computers, phones and records were taken because there was a fear that they were coming together to try to survive and get a base price for every mile for every student they brought to school. I do not know whether there was a breach of competition laws, and I hope there was none, but there was ferocity, force, showing off and muscle flexing involved. They came back with the gardaí if they were not allowed in and they terrorised some people who have been in business for 40 years because they had phone calls, letters or correspondence with other people. What are we supposed to be? All these small businesses are being driven out of existence for quoting for State work and the competition authorities are coming the heavy with them. Some of them have not had their computers or records returned. Records of up to 30 or 40 years have been taken away. They have the time to do that but they cannot touch the big people. It is not about Dublin as such. It is all about who one is rather than what one is. Ordinary people have to put up with all the legislation and regulation. </p>
          <p eId="para_844"> This is toothless. I said this to the Minister in committee as well. We must have the regulator and in this case, the regulator can be overruled by the Minister. The regulator can make a decision and the Minister can overrule it, but the Minister must explain to the House or on the public record why he or she overruled it. That is a good thing because we cannot keep appointing regulators. We are going to have a public competition and it will be transparent, but it will not be anyone we have not heard of who gets the job. It will not be anyone who is a very eminent person, for example, an unemployed person with degrees or qualifications. It will be an insider who has probably been in the public service. That is what happens. There will be a bit of accountability, but I know it is very difficult for the Minister and the people writing the legislation to couch this so that we do not have a regulator who is toothless, fruitless, does not even have a peann luaidhe to write a letter, as has been the case so far, has no accountability, cannot be challenged by anybody, and says he or she has no power.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> We ask questions in the Dáil and the Minister tells us the regulator is independent. We ask questions in the Dáil about the HSE and are told "the HSE is not under my Department". We have abdicated responsibility and control. We are elected, the Government is elected by Deputies and this Government is, thankfully, a minority Government because there are good restrictions on it and the Cabinet, but there is no accountability. It is a case of just handing it over to the regulator. There is a plethora of new regulators. We build new offices for them and then we have to build regional offices for them with all the equipment and God knows what. There is a plethora of staff around them and a board must also be appointed. It is very important to have five or ten people on the board that can be replaced every couple of years. It was mentioned by an earlier speaker that we are supposed to have a process for appointing board members. There is nothing new about it. It is about insiders, friends and cronies. This is what has gone on and it is still going on. For the first four years I was here, I listened to Fine Gael attacking Fianna Fáil for all the board members it appointed but, my God, there were no slow learners on that side of the House when they got over there. They filled, packed and stuffed them with all their cronies. Look at where the former Minister, Phil Hogan, is now.</p>

          <p eId="para_851">I am not. The regulator has been appointed. I am trying to address some of the issues and recommendations from the tribunal, which cost so much. If we knew the price per word, it would be some amount. It is farcical. We are still not grappling with the issues. We are trying to deal with the housing crisis and fast-track legislation on Committee Stage to allow developments of 100 houses or more to bypass local authorities. The relationship between members of local authorities and the planners is a very important and noble one, and we are celebrating it this year. I was a member of a local authority for many years before being privileged to be elected to this House. Local authorities cannot have any say or have any interaction with planners in Tipperary. While there are some very good local planners, with whom I deal, senior management at Tipperary County Council does not want anything to do with public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> I have no problem with the idea that any correspondence or lobbying - whether by phone, text or e-mail or by meeting a planner at a match - about planning of any make, shape or form should be recorded and kept on file. It must happen. We cannot have the nod and the wink but we must be able to interact. I have said this to the Minister at committee meetings. Councillors in Tipperary and Oireachtas Members - I am speaking for myself - have less and less interaction. If a constituent asked a representative to keep an eye on a file in the past, we could put our name on the file and we were notified if further information was going to be requested. If the applicant was abroad, we could alert them. In the context of what is proposed, we will not be notified anymore. That is a bit of a nuisance. Is it so hard to send an e-mail, or press a button to add two or three more people to an e-mail? Neither will councillors be notified, and there are 40 of them in Tipperary.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> We always used to have site meetings with planners. If a person wanted to build one house - which is very important to themselves - or a number of houses or a business development, we would have facilitated it. This has also stopped. A planner cannot meet a public representative and an applicant on site together. You would think there was going to be fisticuffs or something and that it is a health and safety issue. It is pure nonsense. We sorted out many issues where neighbours might not have been the best of friends. One looked at the site holistically, and if it was a farm for rural development, and the site was not the best site, and the planners attempted to come to an agreement, one helped to persuade the planner to get a better site, a different location and land holding. The Minister of State would understand this, given that she is from a rural constituency. For example, if there was an issue with site distances for the entrance, one could negotiate with the neighbour to realign the roads for everybody's safety, never mind the house. A lot of good will was earned as a result. I am sure the Ceann Comhairle and many of us have stood in fields, on roads and boreens and God knows where else, played our part and done our public duty. We are elected by these people to help them, to try to advise them properly and to ensure that they do not find themselves in dangerous or other kinds of situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> I recently dealt with a case in Tipperary. The Ceann Comhairle might say I am straying, but it is all to do with the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_856">Good man. Go raibh maith agat. It is very difficult to keep out of trouble all the time - one can sometimes wander. We appreciate the help and guidance of the Ceann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> I dealt with a business in Tipperary town which employed 30 people and leased a yard. The lease was being withdrawn because the owners of the yard wanted it back. The business identified a site on the Limerick road in Tipperary town and wanted to lease it and keep the jobs in the town. However, I could not get a planning meeting for weeks and the planners refused to visit the site to see what was involved. There is nothing better than being on a site, seeing the traffic flows and identifying the issues that arise. Eventually, a meeting was held in the council buildings. While the business development officer and others were trying to keep the business going, the planners seemed to be on a different planet and did not want to engage. When they did engage, it took ages to get back and the business owner was phoning me to say he had to consider other locations. Then, the planners came back with a negative answer - "Níl" button was on and it was stuck in "Níl". We have a new button here, "Staon". We can abstain, and perhaps then press the green button and change to "Tá". However, the "Níl" button was on in this instance. The planners would not go and meet the business owner. It would take a variation of planning, given that, as we were told, the area was zoned for retail. There are acres of retail space in Tipperary town, and in most other towns and villages, which are not being used. The planners said the council would probably not support it and could object. The business had to move 16 or 17 miles to another town. Thankfully, it stayed in County Tipperary and did not go to some other county. What happened was due to lack of interest, understanding and empathy with the difficulties of keeping the business afloat, paying the wages and dealing with the trucks and staff. It is a logistics business. There was no empathy from the planners. It was a lethargic effort in a jobs black spot in Tipperary town with no supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> I am disappointed that the Bill does not deal with revitalising our town centres and villages. There is a small mention of little things, as there is in the budget. I proposed that we change Tipperary's county development plan to deal with shops that have been closed for five or ten years, of which there are many in all the towns in Tipperary and in the towns in the Minister of State's constituency. I previously proposed that it be made easier and quicker to change the use of such a premises without being faced with a planner and without huge charges being applied. If we rejuvenate town centres, we will bring life back into them and bring people back to living in them and we will deal with the 3,000 approved housing applicants in Tipperary waiting for houses, never mind the countless thousands of people who have not even been approved. We would have living town centres. At the Government formation talks, I proposed that property owners, or those who buy or lease a property, would get the VAT back on what they spend in changing a property's use. I did not ask for money for developers or bankers or anybody else, just a straight return of the VAT, as is the case with regard to the home improvement scheme. It did not happen and it is not happening in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> We all get lip-service and talk about the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act and how we are going to revitalise our towns. We are not. We could crack two nuts with the one sledgehammer. We would provide accommodation units and bring life back into our towns. O'Connell Street in Clonmel, which used to be a thriving town, has been destroyed by all the out-of-town developments. There are only two units occupied over premises in the town, never mind all the shops that have closed down. The same has happened in Tipperary town, Carrick-on-Suir, Cahir, Clogheen, you name it. Villages such as Ardfinnan are all being devastated. This would be a way of reducing housing lists, dealing with the homeless crisis - we could use the voluntary sector if it is needed - and revitalising the towns. Towns would be living. People would be there at night and the towns would not become ghost towns at 6.05 p.m. after the shops close and everybody has gone home. It did not happen and there is no sign of it. Where has the imagination gone? Where is the vision to do this and deal with the problem? We do not need a Mahon tribunal to give us a recommendation or regulation. We need joined-up thinking, but it is not there.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> The other issue we are not dealing with is the planning charges. There are gravy trains for the councils, county managers and finance officers. They have fancy names now; the finance officer is now known as director of services for finance. The previous Government - which the Minister of State voted for - abolished the town and urban councils. The town of Clonmel had a budget of €15.1 million. Now, it has diddly-squat. The enabling document for it was called Putting People First, yet the Government took away the services from the people and shut down democracy. The Minister of State's former colleague, Phil Hogan, did this. I will meet him tomorrow at the meeting of the Joint Committee on European Unions Affairs, and I look forward to a robust engagement with him. Now an esteemed European Commissioner, Phil Hogan devastated democracy and bulldozed Tipperary together. As a result of what he did, the Minister of State has to canvass a big part of Tipperary and there is a constituency in Offaly. He just bulldozed them. It was arrogance and ignorance. There are not enough adjectives to describe the actions. Again, we are left without any source of funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> The gravy train of charges was okay during the boom times, if such charges were ever okay. I voted for them in my county and I voted for the community charge, which came to good effect with playgrounds, halls and crèches being built with assistance from it. Now, eight years into the recession, why can we not see that they are too high and are prohibitive? A man came to me in Clonmel six months ago. His business had closed and he wanted to turn his premises into five apartments. Again, this would solve accommodation for five families. His bankers and accountant told him he was bonkers, particularly as 48% was going to go on change-of-use charges, planning fees and development charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">It would have been off the wall and he could never have made it viable. Even leasing it for ten or 20 years would not have repaid the loan, so another project was abandoned. The Bill misses that completely. It offers no recommendations, directions or guidelines to councils to start viewing the gravy train of fees as a negative for building and development. It is the same for a young couple trying to build a house. It depends on whether people can get a planning meeting and planning permission. They cannot see planners with me or any other public representative. I do not know why such regulations have been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_863"> Many recommendations of the tribunal have not been implemented. The tribunal was a sham, full stop. We should not even be discussing this legislation four, five or six years later, a Bill that is meant, mar dhea, to implement some of the planning tribunal's recommendations, because that tribunal was farcical and like a long-running soap opera. Afterwards, we decided to set up more tribunals. We will have tribunals in 20 years' time to examine the standards that we are forcing on people now. We are setting up this and that body. This is quangoland. The Bill is weak on decisions and definite actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> As to local public representatives and fast-tracking, I warned people at the committee. We must be careful because we are in a democracy and the planning process must be public and transparent. There must be public notices in newspapers, files must be available and everyone is entitled to make observations. We cannot stop this because there have been devastating effects in my county, where there are up to 60 unfinished estates waiting and no funds to finish them. I lay much of the blame with the planners. They gave planning permission for large estates but, when those were half built, people came forward with plans to build more. There was no enforcement whatsoever. If I built a dog house without permission, officers could enforce the regulations, but they could not enforce these permissions. They were oblivious.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> I have held meeting after meeting with planners, enforcement officers and residents in Tipperary town, Cahir, Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and so on where people have been left in appalling conditions - unfinished footpaths, holes in roads, unfinished surfaces and, above all, no lighting. We will head into old time in a week or ten days when there will be darkness from 5 p.m. People talk about security, health and safety, but there are health and safety issues everywhere and the council is just rubbing its hands. When asked why the regulations were not enforced, it says that it could not and cannot do so now because the builders are broke, in liquidation or in NAMA or it cannot speak with them because it is dealing with the receivers. This is disgraceful. People invested and bought houses off of plans for pristine, finished estates with crèches, playgrounds and everything else, but what have they now? Ramshackle estates like one would see in Third World countries with holes, water, no public lighting, no proper sewerage systems, collapsed attenuation ponds and hoarding around them to stop children from falling in and drowning. It is a nightmare from morning until night and the planners are rubbing their hands and saying that they can do nothing about it. The enforcement laws existed and should have been enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> The bonds were ridiculous. That issue is not addressed in this legislation. The Minister is back. Trying to call in a bond is nigh impossible. The Minister knows that. There is no real effort being made in this legislation to deal with the issue of outstanding bonds. Some of the developers are in the Congo, Hong Kong or America and their bonds cannot be called in, yet the unfortunate people who worked hard to earn their deposits and got loans are repaying their debts. Many of them are in negative equity. They are living in hellholes of estates without even stop signs or children-at-play signs or a public light. It is disgraceful. I am referring to the fast-tracking of more than 100,000 houses. They are the people who caused all of the problems, but we are going to fast-track the houses. There is nothing in the Bill to stop this from recurring.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> While I can be critical of how slow the planning process is, the ordinary citizen is entitled. It is the same up and down the country with EirGrid and overhead power lines for the North-South interconnector and wind turbines. It is the same carry on. Communities are being ridden over roughshod.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> I am disappointed that there is nothing in the Bill to stop a retired official or an official who leaves early from joining a planning company. This happened recently in our area in the middle of the EirGrid battle when a senior member of An Bord Pleanála was appointed chairman of EirGrid. That sends out desperate signals. He might be the most honest man in the country, but he has influence. He knows the pitfalls and how to get around An Bord Pleanála. How it happened was disgusting, but that is happening all of the time. The greatest evidence of this was in Irish Water, which had three or four retired county managers as well as others. Some did not leave a blaze of glory behind in the areas from which they came. I could name them. They were pushed into Irish Water. Thank God that they are being weeded out. There were some good ones in there as well. There must be strict legislation. There should be at least five years of a buffer between leaving a planning office or a State board, for example, An Bord Pleanála, and getting a top job in a semi-private company like EirGrid. There has to be. There is too much temptation.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> We gave the Mahon tribunal a long time, it has been four years or longer since we received its report and it had a cost, but here we are doing this. What about the basic issues? People can have no trust or faith in the process. We are not dealing with that situation in this legislation. We should have dealt with it. It sends out the wrong message and only proves what people know, namely, if one is a big business, one can do what one likes.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> It is the same in my county, east Cork, west Waterford and south Kilkenny with large racing conglomerates. They have done a great job with the racing and are buying up every perch of land. They are buying houses, cottages and everything else and doing them up. That is the power of money. They bring bulldozers in the next day without any planning application and transform the place. The Minister should have dealt with this because we have major issues with development on flood plains. A fellow rang me today. He was looking for a house in a rural parish. He was told by the planners that it was on a flood plain, but if it got flooded, we would all be on the ark. The 100-year flood plans are there. They have to be brought in now. The guidelines for these are not published. When are they going to be published so that we will know about the flood plains? Insurance companies are using them as an excuse not to insure. We were told two years ago that flood plain risk assessments would be published, but they have not been.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> The changes in land use, demographics, the removal of fences and the demolition of drainage should be covered by this Bill. If one puts a bulldozer in a field, one will lose natural drainage. This has an impact on flooding, making it worse because water travels and many of those fences were carefully constructed, but they are being blown out of it by the power of money and machinery.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> There are many weaknesses in the legislation. We should make haste slowly to address many of the issues that the Minister has examined. He is bringing us to somewhere in Dublin in the next day or so to look at an estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> I mentioned career people hopping from State bodies to local authorities to An Bord Pleanála and back. An Bord Pleanála is transparent and above reproach, we are told, but countless times an inspector's report has been overturned by the board. The Minister has seen it happen. I have seen it happen. An Bord Pleanála is paying the inspector. The inspector is supposed to be a qualified person. I know some of them and they are. When an inspector makes an honest report, it is rubbished. It is not expedient enough and is overruled by the board. We need a great deal more insight into that so as to ensure a more transparent process in dealing with issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> The costs cannot be prohibitive either. I know there is NIMBYism about many issues, but we must separate the wheat from the chaff and ensure that making legitimate submissions is not prohibitive and local communities are listened to. They are not being listened to concerning wind farms and pylons. EirGrid did not consult the community. It came in top heavy and bulldozed. We need a greater response from planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to deal with issues of that magnitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">The big bugbear is money and greed, or even big money and big greed. Farmers, who are currently hard-pressed, are offered so much per year per pylon on their land. It is an attitude of divide and conquer from these companies, with expertise, mar dhea, brought in from other countries. These are projects that have failed in other countries in the past 25 years but we are looking at them as if they are a new and great idea that has just arrived.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> I thank the Acting Chairman for his forbearance. There are many shortcomings in the Bill. It cannot all be about the Mahon tribunal but it is meant to put clothes on the Mahon skeleton. It has not done so. It is meant to facilitate the fast-tracking of some developments and achieve some transparency. That has not been happening. It is the ordinary cottier, the man and woman building a house, who must go through planning hoops. They are easy prey. There are many good developers but it is the rogue fellows that left abominable messes that cannot be touched. We have challenged the authorities at meetings and they have told us they were too busy, there was not enough enforcement, this or that. The bonds were ridiculous and the bonds they could put in place cannot be retrieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> Surely to God we should get more legal advice on this. We have legal advice in every county council in the country that is very well paid. There is a letter written to a farmer about a patch of land or a road and the legal advisers get a good stipend from it. We are getting very poor value for buck for the public with these planning issues and enforcement. These authorities can make sure an ordinary person has built a pier at an entrance that he or she was supposed to - we want safety above anything else - but they ignore the big developers.</p>

          <p eId="para_878">We believe the establishment of an independent office for the planning regulator is welcome in principle, although we have concerns about it being independent. That is something that is likely to come up on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> The Mahon tribunal cost in excess of €160 million, although the currency was in pounds when the tribunal started its work. That demonstrates the length of time we are talking about. It cost much more in terms of bad planning and loss of confidence in the planning system. For example, the cost of duplicating services is a component, and we have had a series of tribunals, including the beef tribunal and the Mahon, Moriarty and Smithwick tribunals. Part of the reason we now have commissions of investigation is the cost and time involved in those tribunals and, in many cases, the lack of sanctions that followed. That we are discussing this legislation in 2016, so many years later, demonstrates there is still a ripple effect arising from what went on in the planning system. This is part of the reason we have proposed an independent anti-corruption agency that would work across sectors. That is not unique as the process has worked well in other countries in changing the culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> The independent office of the regulator would be responsible for the independent assessment of all local authority and regional assembly forward planning. The goalposts will change because of new legislation facilitating the fast-tracking of housing developments. I question whether that initiative will speed things up to the extent that is expected and it will further reduce powers of councillors. The value of development plans is that they are the rule book, and it pretty much determines the decisions made. If that is undermined, and to a degree it is being undermined with another planning authority-----</p>

          <p eId="para_882">I will deal with it a little later but if another planning authority is making the decision, it erodes the local government system further.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> The planning regulator will be responsible for looking at the systems and procedures in local authorities. There is not a uniformity in local authorities and there are great variations, for example, in the number of staff available, depending on what part of the country one is in. Some staff are busier and my local authority is certainly seeing much more activity than there has been. If the planning regulator is considering this process, it cannot consider like for like. It is important there can be some degree of equalisation, meaning there can be some sort of uniformity of outcome, which cannot be done without the proper resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> Compliance with planning permission has costs one way or the other. We have seen many failures, and the Minister has seen them in his Department as there has been poorer building practice and a lack of oversight. Some of the housing stock in some quarters is unsafe as a consequence. We will pay for it one way or the other. If the planning regulator considers the performance of local authorities, the ability to monitor the conditions of planning permissions properly and watch buildings as they progress will be an important component. There is a fairly big piece of work involved with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> The taking in charge process is a major source of criticism. The planning regulator has a role in considering the performance of the planning authorities and their functions. The public purse will pick up quite a lot and has done already in trying to work out some of the unfinished housing estates. If estates are taken in charge in a timely way, in many ways risk is mitigated. The extension of planning permissions has allowed a scenario where it can be 17 years before people may petition to have an estate taken in charge from the time planning permission has elapsed. The issue must be addressed in a timely manner because there is a price to pay in the length of time it has taken, in some cases, to take estates in charge. When a developer disappears, essentially, and people petition to have the estate taken in charge, the difficulty is that very often there is much remediation to be done and the local authority must do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> There is not much point in having planning laws if we are not willing to enforce them. The area involving unauthorised developments will bring serious trouble, certainly from my perspective. These are the issues that the public pays attention to and demonstrate failures in the planning system. It is one thing getting planning permission, which is a legal process, but if that legal process is undermined by an inability to ensure conditions are complied with properly and there are no unauthorised developments, there can be a significant delay in the process and in some cases that is never resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">The explanatory memorandum to the Bill refers to the importance of proper planning, sustainable development and community involvement in the planning process. I am concerned, however, that the proposed housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will undermine the planning system in this regard. I am not saying there should not be changes, streamlining, simplification and a speedier process, which that Bill proposes to deliver. However, it is a mistake to think people will not have concerns about the idea of fast-tracking applications. We have improved the planning process over the years by way of the national spatial strategy, underpinned by the regional planning guidelines. I saw very significant changes in the local authority of which I was a member, with people starting to take a strategic approach as opposed to the piecemeal approach that was there in the past. That piecemeal approach was one of the problems that led to the planning tribunal. Under the new process, we have the county or city development plan, underpinned by the local area plan where most zonings occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> An Bord Pleanála is not obliged in its rulings to be consistent with a development plan. It has a responsibility to have regard to the plan, but that is not the same thing at all. I have seen many instances where submissions made have improved the planning decision, where it was a positive decision, and where members of the local community felt their concerns were taken on board. That type of process reinforces the faith people have in the planning system. There is now the prospect of that being undermined just as people have got used to there being a process they understood and could engage with if they needed to. The new regulations amount to a changing of the goalposts. Language is very important, whether the reference is to an obligation to have regard to something or a requirement to be consistent with it. Court cases have been taken on that issue and changes to the planning law have come about on foot of those challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> The legislation will require planning authorities to provide data and information for databases or national planning systems as may be specified by the Minister. I hope this will include provision for the establishment of a national planning compliance register. Each local authority is unique and what we have seen in the past is developers undertaking projects in one part of the country and leaving a trail of destruction after them before moving on to another local authority area and doing the same thing. The lack of a national planning compliance register, even in situations where enforcement proceedings have been successfully taken against developers, is a major omission in the system. It would be of assistance not just to the planning regulator but would also function as a good consumer protection element. The fact each local authority has its own unique register is not a benefit of the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> The provision that elected members will be subject to reduced or no fees when making submissions could be problematic if we end up with a situation where councillors and Deputies are looked to as a vehicle for conveying community submissions. A recent judgment issued in the European court concerned the introduction of planning fees, which was, if I recall correctly, done via the Planning and Development Act 2000. As I understand, the fees do not bring in much money and seem to serve little purpose other than as a source of frustration and expense. A charge of €20 might not seem like a lot of money to most people but for a pensioner, someone on a small income or a person in receipt of a small social welfare payment, it is a sizeable sum. I wonder why the exemption is not being fully extended rather than limiting it to public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> Fortunately, most of the unfinished estates in my constituency are being worked through. This is the second time I have seen that profile of unfinished housing developments. I was elected at town council level in 1988 and subsequently to the county council in 1991 and one of the main occupations for my colleagues and me right through the 1990s was trying to work through unfinished estates, calling bonds in and so on. We often saw the same developers reappearing under a different guise, which is something I am seeing again now. There is a sense, in fact, that we are repeating the mistakes of the past. That debate is probably one for another day but it is clear a change in culture is needed in the construction sector whereby good developers are incentivised and there are greater penalties for bad behaviour. That cannot be done without staff in local authorities having the ability to enforce regulations properly, to which end an enforcement register would be useful and might have a considerable impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> The 2000 Act was consolidating legislation and we have had much planning legislation in the interim. There is evidence these myriad legislative items are causing some of the delays in the planning system, which is an issue that may need to be addressed if we are to achieve quicker outcomes. We all want quicker outcomes, of course, but not at the expense of excluding the people who have a vested interested in an area, who live there and want to shape how it develops. I hope the relevant legislation does not come before us in the form that has been outlined because it would be a mistake. In principle, however, I support the establishment of an independent regulator. My only concern is that such an office must really be independent.</p>

          <p eId="para_893">This is the second night in a row that I am on the graveyard shift, having taken us up to midnight last night. One's chances of getting on "Oireachtas Report" must be increased if one speaks before the programme is broadcast, so I might get some coverage tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> I outlined last night my general welcome for the budget and the progress we have made in recent years. I compared this budget with some of the budgets that were introduced in the last part of the previous decade and the early part of this decade. In my sixth year in the House, I gladly welcome budget 2017 compared with what we had in 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">We have come a long way. We have a long way to go, but we are certainly moving in the right direction. Last night, I mentioned the progress we have made in areas like social protection, housing and the 9% VAT rate for tourism and hospitality.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> The possible equalisation of diesel and petrol prices, which was discussed publicly prior to the budget, caused a great deal of concern for me and for many people in my constituency. As a rural dweller and a representative of a rural constituency in this House, I feel such an anti-rural move would represent a major step backwards. Many people have invested in diesel cars and other diesel vehicles for environmental and economic reasons. Any move by the Government to change the current policy in this regard would be detrimental. It is not something I would welcome. I am glad the Government listened to our concerns and decided there would be no diesel excise increase in this budget. I hope that will also be the case in future budgets. This would have been a very negative development at a time when insurance premiums are skyrocketing and the general cost of motoring is increasing. I am glad it did not happen. The recent decision by OPEC to cut production could lead to a further increase in oil prices in the time ahead. That is not something we can ignore. I am glad this proposal was not pursued in last week's budget. I hope it will be shelved in future budgets because it would have a detrimental impact on the agricultural sector and on hauliers. It would be a retrograde step and I am glad it is not happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> I want to mention some of the measures that were taken in the budget in respect of agriculture. The introduction of the sheep scheme is a positive move because it represents a major step forward in animal welfare and, in particular, will result in a welcome injection of cash for rural areas. This is a welcome new development for sheep farmers in some of the most challenging terrain in the country, who have been very hard-pressed in recent years. I look forward to its implementation. Having spoken to people in my constituency last weekend, I know it has been warmly received. It is a major step in the right direction. The loan scheme for farmers is also quite timely and most helpful in light of the huge pressures many farmers are under. I anticipate that there will be a very high takeup of this scheme. It will be of assistance in these difficult and uncertain times, particularly in the context of Brexit. I am sure it will be availed of. The provision for the expansion of the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme is also most welcome. This was a good budget for agriculture and for farmers at a very challenging time. The reversal of the cuts in farm assist that were previously imposed is also welcome. I am pleased that there will now be increased opportunities for participation in the rural social scheme. Many people in my constituency would have suffered as a result of those measures. It is quite fitting that they have now been addressed. It will make life easier for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> While the reduction of half a percentage point in the 1%, 3% and 5.5% universal social charge rates is to be welcomed, I would have preferred to have seen greater decreases. Nevertheless, this is a step in the right direction. I maintain that further cuts would generate further revenue for the Exchequer and would lead to a greater return. In many parts of this country where the improving economy has not come fully across the threshold, people's tax burden is seriously hampering their spending power and their ability to live with any degree of comfort. I feel our tax policy could address this quite speedily. I understand the point that there is an initial outlay when it comes to things like reductions in the universal social charge, but I feel there would be a greater benefit from such reductions in this instance. It would reduce the cost of employment and make work more rewarding. It would bring down replacement rates and make it easier for people to spend and contribute to further economic growth. I would like to see the trend of reductions in the universal social charge continuing in future budgets. I hope the 0.5% rate will be abolished next year. We might also see serious movement on the 2.5% rate, as it will be in 2017. This would be a major help. I think we need to pursue such reductions because the lowest earners would be the highest beneficiaries. This will not be possible without prudent economic management and continued growth. That is why it is important for us to keep going in the direction we are going by managing things well.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> The last few years have been very difficult for the education sector. Thankfully, we have been able to spend more in recent budgets. It is fantastic that 2,400 additional teachers will come on stream in the coming year. Every cent we invest in the Department of Education and Skills is well spent because it is invested in the future of this country and its people. We will get a massive return on it. Outside of the human aspect of giving people a great start and every opportunity in life, the economic side of it is that money spent on education is a good investment. It is something we should continue to do. I would like to see further efforts made to reduce the thresholds, especially in small rural schools. I spent my first five years in this House fighting the Department and the Minister of the day on the issue of thresholds in rural schools. I felt there was a lack of recognition in the Department of the importance and relevance of such schools. I think we need to do more work on this issue. The value of these schools is not always appreciated by people in officialdom. As a representative of the people, I certainly value small schools and the massive work that is done in such schools in every community in the country. We need to protect and enhance the personalised approach to education that is delivered in small schools. We can do that by reducing the thresholds for teacher allocation. We need to do more on four-teacher and three-teacher schools, in particular, because the thresholds are too high and need to revert to pre-2012 levels, at least. There is no need to stop there. We need to drive on further into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> It is fantastic that we will reach a record level of expenditure on health in 2017. It was probably unthinkable a few years ago that we would be in this position. Health expenditure needs to be targeted at those areas that can achieve the best results for us. I still think we do not spend enough on protecting people and giving them the ability to live with dignity in their own homes, alone or otherwise. We do not do enough on preventative health measures. We need to do more on that front. We do not spend enough money on home care packages, given that it is money well spent. We end up with problems at acute level when we do not invest in home help, which is so crucial and vital for people. I cannot understand the reluctance to open the purse strings in this respect. I do not know why we are not spending money on something that is so important to people all over this country. I hugely welcome the extension of medical cards to all children in respect of whom domiciliary allowance is being received. It is long overdue. Anyone who is in receipt of domiciliary allowance is getting it for the right reasons and for serious reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">This is something I have been advocating for a long time and I am glad it is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> I welcome the recruitment of nurses and graduate nurses. However, a particular group of nurses has been left behind. These nurses were previously on temporary contracts, but they have now gone to the back of the queue. A number of constituents have contacted me. They are experiencing difficulty in being recruited. They had been working for 75% of the salary all along. Now, they are at the back of the queue when it comes to recruitment. This needs to be addressed given that we are experiencing difficulties in recruiting nurses. This is an area the Department needs to look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> I am keen to speak about another issue that has arisen in my constituency. It relates to health care provision, in particular, for disability services, an area which is still chronically under-funded. The model of de-congregation being pursued at present by the Health Service Executive does not fit everyone. There should not be a one-size-fits-all policy. An example in my constituency is St. Mary of the Angels in Beaufort, where all 77 residents have been contacted and offered a move into the community. That is great for the people for whom it is suitable, but for many it will not be suitable. Yet, the policy in place at present is to seek de-congregation. This needs to be changed; there needs to be a middle ground. There needs to be de-congregation but perhaps in a protected and safe setting. For example, it could be done on-campus in St. Mary of the Angels and autonomous living could be provided within the campus. Such a common-sense approach needs to be adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> It would be remiss of me not to mention the great progress made in child care. We have come a long way. First, we had the free preschool year and then we had the second free preschool year. Now, we have this year's efforts to reduce the cost of child care for hard-pressed parents. This will further lead to a reduction in replacement rates and will make it more affordable for people to go back to work. It is a step in the right direction. We need to keep going and take further steps in future budgets, but certainly I welcome this measure.</p>

          <p eId="para_906">With the permission of the House I intend to share with Deputy Lahart.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Like my friend on the opposite benches, I agree that it is unfortunate the debate is taking place at such a late hour. Nonetheless, it is a great opportunity for all of us to have our input and our say in what can only be described as a departure in terms of the way budgets are framed.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> I met an experienced journalist this evening at an event. He used to frequent this House. He wondered how we were managing in the new environment. He reflected on the question and said that much of the excitement and buzz had gone out of the budget. That is good. It is a recognition of a maturity developing around this House whereby on this occasion each Member, if he or she wishes, has an opportunity to contribute to the framing of the budget. Now, there are some who chose not to participate at all for party political reasons. They could have signalled their intent to be part of a new dispensation or framework that recognises how minority administrations work in a way that is not to the exclusion of the voices of those elected with such a valuable mandate. However, for naked political reasons these people chose to go into hiding during the course of government formation talks. Effectively they went into exile for that period. There may be some political advantage to that, although I am unsure. I believe it was a betrayal of the people who voted in the election.</p>
          <p eId="para_909"> I am pleased that the party I represent had the maturity and capacity to work with the Government, made up of Fine Gael and a number of Independents. We have tried insofar as we can to change the course of economic and social policy at a macro level. We are regularly asked about the Fianna Fáil achievement and what the Independents have achieved. I believe we should consider it in a larger sense. We need to look on it at a macro level. We campaigned on a particular platform during the course of the election earlier this year. Much of our emphasis was on investment in public services and overhead reduction in taxation. I am not being critical. This was simply the way the campaign was fought. Those in Fine Gael had a view that the universal social charge should be abolished. In fairness, they recognised that this was not perhaps what the electorate wanted. They have recognised how the electorate has spoken in terms of the support they have given to my party and others. As a result, they engaged in a process that sees us now with something greater than a 2:1 split between investment and tax modification from the €1 billion or €1.2 billion available.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> Perhaps there is some argument about where the extra €200 million came about in the latter hours of negotiations but that is water under the bridge now. The fact is that now significant moneys are available to allow Deputies on all sides to make their case for investment in the social, physical, health and capital infrastructure of the State. Furthermore, Deputies can make a case in respect of what to do from a tax or universal social charge reduction point of view. Such proposals were targeted principally at the lower income cohort of the population. To me that is the Fianna Fáil stamp. This stamp or push probably emerged when we achieved considerable support from the electorate last February. That is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> Whether it was a Pauline conversion on the part of those in Fine Gael or a recognition that an election is not in their interests or in anyone's interests in the short term - it is certainly not in the interests of the country - is irrelevant. The fact is that all Ministers have ended up in a better position because there is a greater capacity now in light of the moneys available to deal with the constraints. I note the Minister and Minister of State present in the House have ambitious targets in their areas. These are areas where there has been a considerable dearth of investment in recent years. Hopefully, the budget will allow them to move ahead with the ambitious projects they have in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> The budget is in many ways an opportunity for a government to set out its priorities. Sometimes it is not always possible to secure the desired funding from the Department of Finance to meet a Minister's needs, but the process does give Ministers an opportunity to set out their priorities. I have responsibility as Opposition spokesperson on communications, climate action and environment. I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, has not made more of the opportunity - I recognise the constraints in finance - around the budget to set out his priorities rather than focus on his attachment to spin, which is something to which he has become accustomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> I was taken by the Minister's recent announcement. One of the first statements he made when he came to office was to the effect that he would not take up the option of introducing a broadcasting charge. That was an option I was ready to support because it was part of our manifesto. As a strong advocate of public service broadcasting I took the view that there was an opportunity to increase the moneys available to support the national broadcaster. I believe that is the right thing to do. I also took the view that there was an opportunity to make available increased moneys in support of an element of public service remit within local radio stations. That has been lobbied for by the independent sector. I was taken by something I read in recent days.</p>

          <p eId="para_915">I have been, and I have said to the Minister that I am prepared to accept the principle of a broadcasting charge and that it should be extended to those homes, apartments and other places where people do not contribute. We have been unable to sanction people for evasion. We have a situation whereby approximately 14% of the population do not pay a television licence charge. The evasion rate is as low as 5% in the United Kingdom. Much work remains to be done in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> The Minister now wants to extend this charge to the print media. He is now such a believer in quality journalism that he wants to include the broader media. That will probably get him plenty of good headlines in the print media, but I am not so sure.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">He has not increased the pie and does not intend to. Whether he is going to cut funds for sound and vision within the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI or take money from RTE, which the previous Government did, I am not sure, but maybe he will help us on that in the days ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> I am somewhat concerned that there has been no action plan to roll out broadband. The Minister has identified approximately €15 million to be made available this year to get consultants in place and roll out the contract, but it will be 2022 or 2023 before the rural broadband scheme will get into those areas where it is not commercially available. That is an appalling vista for those of us who live in rural Ireland. We are struggling to accept 2022 or 2023. We need action rather than numerous announcements.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> The same is true of enhancing our mobile telephony services. There is nothing in the budget to suggest that the Minister is serious about putting in place the kind of funds that are needed to ensure our mobile network is fit for purpose. I recently attended an event in Limerick hosted by the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC, with several key employers who want to employ highly skilled, professional, competent and mobile young people. They were adamant that they found it extremely difficult to get staff for research and development facilities in the mid-west because they do not have the mobile connection for the kind of communication these people use. They can get high-speed broadband in the workplace but they could not get an assurance that when these people went home or travelled to and from work, they would have connection for social, leisure or business purposes. The same applies to the southern region outside the main centres of population. That is a real problem. If we tell these people that it will be 2022 or 2023 before broadband is rolled out and mobile connection will lag behind that, we have some real problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_920"> One area the budget has failed to address is our greenhouse gas emissions. There is some work in respect of insulation of homes, but in the transport sector it was a missed opportunity. If we had taken some of the principles applied in places such as Norway, which are at the leading edge of developing a transport system that is fit for purpose and helps reduce greenhouse gases, we would have eliminated benefit-in-kind for electric vehicles and said they should use bus lanes. We would have created more incentives. We are coming nowhere close to the 2020 targets and we need to accelerate our approach.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnLahart" eId="spk_388">
          <from>Deputy John Lahart<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T22:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_921">As my party’s spokesperson on Dublin I want to focus on measures that do or do not focus on the needs of the people in the capital. While the additional funding for housing in budget 2017 is welcome, I have some concerns about the new home buyers' saving scheme and the omission of measures to help reform the rental market and the absence of reforms to fast-track social housing. From the moment the budget was announced, the first-time buyers’ scheme came under close scrutiny from my party. One result of this proposal will see first-time buyers chasing fewer than 10,000 housing units expected to be built next year. Without any accompanying measures to increase supply, this help to buy scheme could make the housing crisis worse and lead to the overheating of house prices. As the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is aware, there is already an anecdotal suggestion that some builders have simply hiked the price of their properties already on the market commensurate with the terms of the scheme being introduced. When supply cannot cope with demand and measures are introduced that promote demand or create the impression that existing house prices are attainable, the Minister has created an incentive for demand that cannot be met in the short term. He is in danger of inflating demand for a stagnant supply. This budget has announced no measures to boost the supply side. Basic economics dictate that when supply cannot meet demand, prices rise, and supply cannot meet demand for houses in the capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> The average house price in Dublin is €330,000 for a three-bedroom semi-detached house. Apart from giving first-time buyers an incentive to buy, there are other factors which influence the price of a house. Site development in Dublin adds an average of €150,000 to each unit price. Levies and professional fees contribute a further €11,750. The initial site cost contributes an average of €57,500 to each housing unit. Sales and marketing costs contribute another €8,200 on average. The average per unit cost of finance for the build is €20,000. VAT adds another €3,900 per unit, leaving a profit per unit of €38,000 and that profit may come many years after the initial investment. There are no measures in this budget that address these supply side issues, that would assist in the release of equity to builders or that encourage off-balance sheet investment. These points have been made by my party colleagues. For a first-time buyer living in the many parts of Dublin where there are no new homes available to buy, this scheme simply does not apply and unfairly favours those first-time buyers who are geographically better located.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> I welcome the additional €150 million allocated from the capital budget towards new social housing provision. However, there is nothing in the budget which will bolster local authorities to enable them to deliver on these new housing targets. The councils have been given moneys to provide more housing. Regrettably, the Minister decided in this budget to cut the operational budgets of the local authorities by 7%. These are enabling budgets that empower the councils to draw up the plans, do the drawings, conduct site surveys and so on. Just as the Government increases the budget to address a problem, it creates a different problem by decreasing the funds which enable local authorities to carry out this function. This cut in the operational budget will severely restrict the ability of the four Dublin local authorities not just to provide usual services but also to deliver social housing. If the Dublin local authorities are to deliver increased social housing outputs, they will require much more significant staffing allocations and expertise to increase that housing supply, yet the Government has cut the source of such human resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> The level of investment secured for transport in budget 2017 does not reflect Dublin’s position as an area of key strategic importance for the economy and society. The M50 is almost at capacity, particularly at peak times, and is beginning to challenge the movement of freight from the port to the rest of the country. It will be three years before the electronic digital display overhead gantries along the M50 will be operational, ensuring that when there is an accident on the M50, and there are many, traffic and the capital will grind to a halt. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport stood by when the National Transport Authority, NTA, announced a cut to the budget for the proposed cycleways planned for Dublin. I was a councillor when these were proposed years ago and they would contribute significantly not only to the tourist attractiveness of the capital but also to making it safe for commuters to travel to work and leisure activities. The city bike scheme is treated by this Minister as some luxurious add-on for the city, and yet anyone can tell that it has become an essential part of the public transport network, displacing taxis and buses throughout the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">It is long past time this scheme was extended to the suburbs such as Templeogue, Terenure, Rathfarnham, Milltown, Goatstown, Dundrum, Inchicore, Kimmage and Drumcondra, to name a few. City bikes are an integral part of public transport in Dublin and ought to be treated as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> Dublin is in trouble, yet its potential as a driver for the economy has never been greater. This Government lacks vision when it comes to Dublin. It is barely mentioned in the programme for Government. When it is mentioned in a number of references, it is to do with the amount of investment being made outside the capital. "Dublin" has become a bad word, yet it is the great engine of our economy. The Minister for Education and Skills recently announced that, given the post-Brexit context, the potential for Dublin to take advantage of the international English language education market is now a reality. It always was a reality. It could have been addressed in the years following the crash and yet it is only now, following the collapse of a dozen or so language colleges due to poor regulation and no protection of students, that a paltry investment is being made in a market that is literally worth billions internationally. However, the Government has no plans and no vision for an area that is ripe with growth potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> Despite all the hyperbole and contrary to what people may believe, things are not beginning to boom in many parts of the capital. Dublin still has the most disadvantaged areas and communities in the country. Life beyond and within the boundaries of the Red Cow roundabout, which is often cited here, is not as Deputies often describe it. Two of the constituencies beyond the Red Cow roundabout are Dublin constituencies. I represent one of them and my colleague, Deputy Curran, represents the other. Two of the most disadvantaged areas in the country are located beyond the Red Cow roundabout.</p>
          <p eId="para_928"> Income tax receipts fell below anticipated revenue. Corporation tax is performing acrobatically and we will have to monitor it in the coming years. We need new sources of revenue. There are obvious new sources of revenue that could be explored by this Government but the budget fell very short in terms of that requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> I am aware that my time is up. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to contribute.</p>

          <p eId="para_933">I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak on budget 2017. Even though we had to wait until this late in the day - one week since the budget was introduced - it is still very important that we get to discuss all the measures because there was so much detail to take in on Tuesday, 11 October, and many different measures that affect different Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> I will touch on a number of the measures to which I refer but I will begin by referring to child care. This is an issue that had the Fine Gael imprint all over it, dating back to our manifestos from before the general election in which we set out our desire to expand the child care system to support those who go out to work every day to make a living but who are faced with very significant costs in that regard. Budget 2017 makes a significant investment in child care in order to make it more affordable for those hard-pressed families. A two-pronged approach was taken to this. First, there is the universal element whereby children aged six months to three years are covered in terms of full-time formal child care and will receive support to the value of €960 a year, which is a significant saving for those families. Second, the more targeted approach sees a subsidy scheme for low to middle income earners with children from the age of six to 15 years. That builds on the work Fine Gael would have done in its previous term in office when we introduced the second preschool year for the early childhood care and education scheme, the introduction of the two weeks paternity leave, and free GP care for children under the age of six. In the new child care structure under the Minister, Deputy Zappone, we have a system in which even more investment can be made as we continue to grow the economy, get more people back to work and have more money to play with, so to speak. However, the structure is as important as the significant 15% increase in investment for that sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_935"> In the social welfare element, there is a €5 increase for those on the old age pension, carers, those with disabilities, widows, blind persons, lone parents, jobseekers, those in receipt of maternity and paternity benefit and people on community employment schemes. The increase covers 1.49 million people. For many, this is the first increase they have been given since rates were slashed by €16 by the then Government in 2009. The 85% Christmas bonus for 1.2 million will be an important benefit, not just for those people and their families but also for the businesses that benefit from more cash going into the local economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> I was on a local radio programme last week with a Sinn Féin Deputy. We debated the issue of young jobseekers benefit and I was criticised for the fact that we had not increased it by the €5, but there was a very good reason for that. It is a <i>pro rata</i> increase and I do not believe we should be incentivising young people of 18, 19 or 20 years of age who are living at home with their parents and who are not employed or in full-time education to remain on that benefit. That is not what our system should do. I pointed out to the Sinn Féin Deputy that while he was calling for us to give €140 a week instead of €100, it is ironic that these young people's counterparts in Northern Ireland get €64 a week. Leaving that aside, it is important to put on the record that jobseekers under the age of 26 who go back to education get the full adult rate of €193, which was €160 previously. We reward for upskilling, encouraging them to take up training. Joskeekers under the age of 26 have their rent supplement contribution reduced as well, which is another benefit. That comes down to Fine Gael's core value of enterprise, reward and making work pay. That approach is working. There were 90,000 young people on the live register in 2010. That figure is down to 34,000 now and we want it to drop further.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> Fairness is a key component of this budget and while cuts in the three lower rates of the USC by 0.5% are not massive, it is another step in the right direction in terms of what we want to do to ease the burden on those working families. Medical cards for the 11,000 children in receipt of domiciliary care is another very important measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> The retention of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality industry, particularly in light of Brexit, is a crucial measure. However, hotels here in Dublin are making the case difficult in terms of tourist facilities the length and breadth of this country including restaurants in our regional towns and villages, which benefit from this VAT rate. We need to examine that into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_939"> The DIRT rate will be reduced by 2% this year and there is a commitment of a further 2% in each of the next three years. This will result in a reduction from the very high penal rate of 41%. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_940"> The Lansdowne Road mechanism is examining teachers' pay and pay restoration across the board. However, we must also continue to invest in our State Departments. The 2,400 new teaching posts, including 900 resource teachers and 115 special needs assistants, are crucial, as are the 800 new gardaí and the 500 civilians that will be employed to free up another 500 gardaí to serve on the front line.</p>
          <p eId="para_941"> I very much welcome the sports capital programme for 2017. The sports capital programme introduced by the previous Government had a strong impact on local communities the length and breadth of the country. It is money that is injected right into the heart of communities, with local contractors getting to do some of the works. A number of clubs in my area are benefiting from that. I refer to the investment the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, who is sitting beside me, has obtained for the Healthy Ireland initiative. Sports capital grant funding is inextricably linked to that. It is about targeting, for example, GAA clubs that take a cross-community approach in terms of male and female participation and so on. I presume the points system for sports capital funding will be the same as it was previously, which is very much weighted towards those clubs that have diversity and mixed use, and where we get the maximum use out of facilities. We should not invest in AstroTurf and floodlit fields for a specific club that has a narrow outlook. We should reward those clubs that open up their gates for multi-use purposes. That is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> The budget for health is €14.6 billion, which means that 25% of the overall national spend is in this area. The provision of 1,000 new nurses is a key component of that. We need those extra nurses in Naas General Hospital in Kildare, but we also have the challenge whereby nursing positions are available but we are having difficulty filling them. The difficulties in the recruitment of nurses is an area that must be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> The €20 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to tackle waiting lists and reduce prescription charges for over 70s is a key element. However, supports for school leavers with disabilities, the €5 million for the Healthy Ireland fund, the €30 million for supports for older people, home care packages, transitional and acute beds are also crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_944"> Housing has been a key issue. When we talk about a doubling of the investment in housing of €1.2 billion, it shows the commitment of this Government to the action plan for housing that aims to deliver 47,000 more social houses by 2021 and phase out the use of hotel rooms by 2017, which is vital for those families that are in short-term homelessness. The latter is a dreadful imposition on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">We have the help-to-buy scheme and there is a change in interest rates for landlords. Some of the changes were headline-grabbers and got a lot of focus in the media but, although they are important in their own right, they are part of a much larger action plan for housing, which mirrors our action plan for jobs. There are a number of key, targeted measures across a range of sectors that will get to the heart of where our problems are. The problems with homelessness are multifaceted and, in that regard, the extra €105 million for HAP and the extension of the rent-a-room limit to €14,000 are really important measures. </p>
          <p eId="para_946"> I welcome the measures for the self-employed, of whom we have 380,000 the length and breadth of this country. We talk a lot about our corporate tax rate and the foreign multinationals which employ a lot of people, notably in Kildare, but they are not so important as the self-employed person who takes on the risk of employing staff. The earned income tax credit of €400, on top of the €550 from last year, is another step in pay equalisation for the self-employed and a recognition of the very important contribution they make to our economy and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_947"> There are increases in long-term illness and treatment benefits without a change in PRSI, and these are really important. One should not be at a disadvantage if one takes the risk of starting a business. We need to encourage entrepreneurial spirit so the reduction in relief from 20% to 10% is important. We need the €1 million band to be lifted to get ourselves more in line with the UK. I welcome the Minister's comments to the effect that he will keep this under review for other budgets. There is also an extension of the start your own business scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_948"> Self-employed dental, optical and hearing benefits are back for employees and self-employed equally, and over 50,000 children will benefit from free school meals, over and beyond the DEIS schools. I think the DEIS school system is good but DEIS schools have everything while the non-DEIS schools miss out so this targeted measure of free school meals is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_949"> I would like to touch on many other areas, such as the €107 million for the rural development programme and increased funding for the horse racing sector which recognises the real and important contribution that industry plays, with the 16,000 jobs for which it is responsible the length and breadth of the country, as well as the additional €16 million for the Department of Defence. However, my colleague, Deputy John Paul Phelan, has a lot of good points to make so I will wrap up. This was a very prudent budget which uses the benefits of our improved economy to support those workers who get up in the morning, go out and make good lives for themselves and their communities. It is also a budget that looks to support the vulnerable and those who need our support the most. In the measures to deal with Brexit, it also keeps us well placed to deal with any future shocks. I commend it to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T22:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_950">I am not sure I have such good points to make but I will make them anyway. Budget 2017 was probably the dullest budget in my 15 years as a Member of the Oireachtas, and hallelujah to that. I am the only one in the House at the moment who remembers the era of McCreevy. When he came in on budget day there was always one rabbit, if not half a dozen rabbits, to be pulled out of a hat, though some had very little to do with budgeting and more to do with politics. The future of budget day announcements should be along the lines of this one - no surprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_951"> Deputy Lahart raised some concerns about the first-time buyer's scheme, concerns which I have and which I am sure others have too. He spoke about how basic economics were not applied but basic economics have not applied to the housing market in Ireland for a long time, if they ever did. We were building over 50,000 units at the height of the boom and yet prices were increasing exponentially every year. We will see whether this succeeds and I hope it does, but it is an attempt to see that people who are starting out and facing increased house prices, as well as the rules of the Central Bank, which need to be applied, have help in getting their foot on the property ladder and I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_952"> I also welcome the small changes in taxation and the reduction in the universal social charge at the lowest end. I am one of those who believes the universal social charge should be absolutely and completely removed, though it should be partially replaced and the USC itself replaced two levies which brought in most of the money the USC now brings in. In the committee of which I am a member we heard that, proportionately, Ireland is at the lower end in the OECD in terms of the amount we take in PRSI, both from employers and employees, and this is probably where the change will be made in the future. We have more moving parts in our taxation system than most countries and the removal of the universal social charge is something that should be aspired to. The reduction in DIRT tax is small and will take place over four years, at 2% per annum, but it is welcome. I would like to see reductions in capital taxes too, though there was not enough leeway in this budget for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_953"> Deputy Heydon mentioned earned income tax credit and I welcome that, as I do the social protection measures for self-employed people, limited as they are. The child care provisions are an initial but significant step and this is the first Government that has made a significant effort to deal with the colossal costs that many families have in this regard. With the after-school benefits being means tested this will not affect everybody we would like to help in the first years of operation but it is laying down the ground rules of how the system might operate in the future. </p>
          <p eId="para_954"> One regret I have is over education spending and I do not want to be political - though I am a politician, I suppose. Media speculation had it that, prior to the budget, Fianna Fáil was placing a lot of emphasis on third level funding but the increase in third level funding, while not as much as was sought, had a knock-on effect on the funding increases available for primary and secondary level. I have a couple of degrees but everybody goes to primary school and secondary school while not everybody goes, or should go or wants to go, to third level and increases in funding for education should start at primary and secondary level. The increases that are included really only keep up with demographic changes in the country and this is a regret I have from budget day.</p>
          <p eId="para_955"> The Committee on Budgetary Scrutiny which I am privileged to chair is the first of its type in this House. I thank the secretariat, Mr. McEnery and his staff and the members, Deputies Barrett, Brophy, O'Connell, Lisa Chambers, MacSharry, Michael McGrath, Pearse Doherty, Cullinane, Boyd Barrett, Donnelly, Burton, Eamon Ryan and Broughan. We are 15 very voluble Members of this House who endeavoured over the month of September to have some impact on budget 2017. There is an absolute necessity for the establishment of an independent budgetary office in the House by spring next year to support the committee in its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_956"> One of the things that has always surprised me about budgets is how we can have much discussion, here and outside the Chamber, about the €1.3 billion announcement but little or no discussion of the other €56 billion or €57 billion that is automatically part of the budget. That is a massive area on which the budget scrutiny committee will have to focus its attentions in the future, long after we have all gone. There was one clearly identifiable area in virtually every report produced on the economic crash in Ireland and that was that we did not have enough consideration of budgetary matters prior to the budget day announcement. We were extremely limited in what we could do this year as we only had our first meeting in the last week of July before the Houses rose for the summer. We managed to meet two days a week every week in September, before the Dáil came back, to produce a report.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">The members put themselves strongly to the task at hand. Indeed, some of the measures and areas that were highlighted in our report were dealt with in the budget, but it is imperative, if that committee is to function properly and as we all wish it would into the future, that the independent budgetary office and, indeed, a number of other supports, are given to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_958"> I join the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, in welcoming the provisions included in the budget for those on social protection incomes. One of the biggest criticisms I have of the budget is that it did not do enough. Maybe more money could have been targeted at individual areas but I believe there was a conscious effort by the Government to ensure that everybody got something out of this budget and that it was not just particular groups in society that were picked off. That was correct after seven or eight years of difficult financial times for individuals, families and communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_959"> Finally, I welcome the provision in the budget for additional funding for the work of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. Previous speakers mentioned the increase in revenue from corporation tax. There is a body of work that has to be done there. Hopefully, we as a committee will be able to take part in that too but the Revenue has an important function in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_961">I welcome this opportunity to speak on the budget and the measures that were passed and discussed in the House last week. I will focus on a few key areas, in particular, highlighting areas of opportunity that I believe have been missed in the different Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_962"> In regard to infrastructure expenditure the budget has been disappointing. Given that the capital borrowing is at such low interest rates, nearly in the negative, we missed opportunities where we could have included more in the capital programme to improve services nationally. For example, in public transport, under the NTA there has been good work done over many years and we need to do more to improve the public transport services, both rail and bus. This was an opportunity where we should have invested further in this area to improve the public transport links, from the capital out and inter-county. With interest rates for borrowing at such a low level, we should be considering the opportunity to invest further in significant infrastructure so that the country can develop further in the future and take advantage of the financial circumstances under the capital borrowing project.</p>
          <p eId="para_963"> On the road network, we need to build and do further work. We have an extensive network of motorway and dual-carriage, but there are parts of the country, for example, the N3, N4 and N5, that need to be expanded and further developed to bring them up to a proper standard. There are three reasons for this. First, we need to use them as an opportunity to attract more foreign direct investment and provide more opportunities for that in different parts of the country. Second, we need to support the industry and services that are there already. Third, tourism, which is a significant industry in this country, is doing exceptionally well. Ireland is well promoted. Fáilte Ireland and all of the different local authorities are playing a positive role in that regard, but Fáilte Ireland needs a way of encouraging visitors when they come here to move around with ease.</p>
          <p eId="para_964"> In my constituency of Kildare North - to be parochial when I have this opportunity in the House - Celbridge is one of the largest towns in the area with a population of just under 22,000. It has a deficit in that it needs a new bridge, the absence of which is stopping the town from developing to its true potential. Clane and Maynooth need ring roads so that they can continue their development and for the towns to progress. Then we need further park and ride facilities, tied in with the public transport element, so that those towns can develop and flourish further. Those services and infrastructure improvements can be delivered by capital investment and it is something we need to look at further in this House in the time ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> The programme for broadband roll-out, particularly into rural areas effectively now has a time deadline of 2021 for completion. In north west Kildare in my constituency, broadband virtually does not exist. This does not help new businesses set up and those, particularly students, who want to work from home. Where one needs to access that service in the home, it does not exist. While there is a plan, we need to fast-track to improve the delivery of the broadband service into rural areas nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_966"> In health, I welcome the provision of €15 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund. Hopefully, it will deal with some of the waiting lists for surgical procedures where in some areas there is more than a two-year waiting list. When the fund worked at its optimum when Fianna Fáil was in Government, it was probably being given an investment of €50 million. Perhaps there is an opportunity to look at further investment in that programme to help alleviate the waiting lists. Then we need to look at a further investment and a strategy plan so that we can put the infrastructure and supports in place to allow the front-line services deal with the issues in the health service, especially surgical operations, so that those waiting lists do not increase again.</p>
          <p eId="para_967"> We need to look at the medical cards for all. There is an issue here, particularly for those with disabilities, that needs to be addressed. The extra funding in the disability area is an improvement. It is moving in a positive direction but it is important that such funding is targeted in the right areas, for example, in the assessment of needs, in the programmes following out from the assessment of need and also to ensure that the correct services are in place, which does not happen at present where there is a deficit in that area. Funding is important, but we need to ensure that the funding goes into the right areas and that people are held responsible and accountable for it, including the delivery of the services, which are inadequate at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_968"> The €5 a week increase for the old age pension is positive and moving in the right direction but we need to ensure it does not have an impact on the means test, particularly for the medical card. I hope the Department will adjust the pension means test threshold to take that into account because otherwise it will have a negative effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_969"> It was disappointing to see no increase in child benefit. I raised in the House with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, the idea of extending the child benefit to all in full-time secondary education. He gave a positive indication that he would look at it. That is the most expensive year for families in second level education. I was disappointed not to see that included in some measure. Even if it had to be included on a phased basis by way of means, it would have assisted some struggling families right away. There was no increase in child benefit across any sector and that was disappointing.</p>
          <p eId="para_970"> Motor insurance, as the House will be aware, is a significant issue at present. We spoke about it at length in this House. The reduction in the USC, while positive, is of no relevance when it is being consumed by the considerable increases in motor insurance. The Minister is bringing forward measures next month. It is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_971"> The treatment of the self-employed is going in the right direction also, but we need to do more to allow them to access the social welfare benefits if they are out sick or if they are unemployed. That is an issue for the self-employed, who are contributing to the Exchequer and at present see that they get little in return.</p>
          <p eId="para_972"> The food sector is an important part of the economy. In light of the UK vote to exit the EU, I would like to see the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation put in place a fund to help Irish companies grow their exports and promote themselves better abroad and become less reliant on the UK market. We have an excellent product and it is most important that we support Irish companies to promote and market that abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_973"> I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the budget. I will hand over to Deputy Jack Chambers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackChambers" eId="spk_396">
          <from>Deputy Jack Chambers<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T23:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_974">Like Deputy Frank O'Rourke, I wish to mention some of my key focus areas in the budget. It is important to look at the budget in a global context. On a macroeconomic basis, it got it right and made the correct adjustment of €1.3 billion in the context of where Ireland was at. That was the prudent thing to do. Fianna Fáil, as part of its confidence and supply arrangement, approves of that type of macroeconomic policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_975"> In the context of Brexit and what we have seen in recent months, I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan’s announcement of a debt-to-GDP ratio target lower than what the European Union wants us to have in order that we create a rainy day fund. My view is that Ireland potentially is sleepwalking into a significant crisis, not because of our own decisions but owing to international factors. This is an open economy that is vulnerable and Brexit will have significant economic, political and social consequences for the State and the economy. I was disappointed with the lack of a focus on Brexit. It was unfortunate that the Government had left the budgetary allocation for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its specific Brexit section as it was, as there must be a greater investment focus and resources to deal with the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_976"> We could have been more innovative in the context of Brexit in attracting more inward investment. While I welcome the changes to the capital gains tax regime introduced by the Minister for Finance, capital gains tax inhibits investment in Ireland by indigenous companies and also by external investors, given that one third of an asset gain is taken by the State when an asset or business is liquidated. We could have looked at the mistakes made in the noughties in the capital gains tax regime when the focus was very much on property transactions. If we had differentiated between property and real asset price changes, it could have had a positive impact on indigenous businesses and Irish people investing in the economy but also from an international perspective. That issue should have been addressed, in addition to some of the other positive measures my colleagues mentioned that could have been introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_977"> Overall, while I thought the budget strategy was different, I was disappointed by the bartering in the media as to which measure would or would not be introduced and who would or would not take credit for it. The people outside this bubble do not care who takes credit for this, that or the other. We must get away from the big bang budgetary approach. Some of the points made by Deputy John Paul Phelan were welcome. I hope the budgetary committee will have a strengthened role next year and that it will start its process earlier. For example, while it is welcome in the health care sector that there will be a €14.6 billion allocation, we have no policy or focus from the Department for Health on its future plans for the health service. Fine Gael entered the general election with a plan to introduce hospital trusts, but the party has yet to legislate or do anything in that regard. In addition, it is deferring to the health care committee without addressing the core needs and crisis in the health care system. There is rhetoric around health care and recruitment, but we are still haemorrhaging significant numbers of nurses, doctors and health care workers to international locations while failing to bring back those who have left home. A proper recruitment practice has yet to be introduced by the Government or the Department. It is easy to make budgetary statements and announcements on key policy areas, but we must move away from this and stratify our budgetary approach on a Department by Department basis that will link budgetary decisions or changes with policy outcomes. It is easy to announce in a shallow headline what the budgetary change is, but if we do not see any improvement in health care in the coming year, in spite of the biggest health budget ever, it will be clear that there is a systemic issue that is not being addressed because we have no health care policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_978"> Deputy John Lahart has referred to some of the issues that arise with the first-time buyer's scheme, to which there has been a very negative response in my constituency. We have seen significant house price inflation in recent weeks since the budgetary announcement. It was a mistake. It would have been more prudent to award people who had been renting for a period and for the State to possibly help them with a deposit while recognising their rent payments. That approach would have less of an impact on the market. The Government has failed to address the regulatory costs introduced by the previous Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Alan Kelly, whereby a cost of more than €30,000 was imposed on each house before a sod had even been turned on a site. That was unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> In my area of responsibility I genuinely welcome the additional funding allocated to the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, for drug rehabilitation and treatment services. I hope that, as part of the next national drug strategy, she will move drug policy along in a positive and realistic way in order that we can address some of the core issues that face many in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> Before I allow my colleague Deputy Brendan Smith to speak, I wish to welcome the measures introduced for the self-employed and the marginal gains for pensioners and others who have not received an increase for many years. I refer to the vulnerable people in communities who have endured significant difficulties on a weekly basis. I asked the Taoiseach a question today, but I have not yet received a response. It was about the reduction of 17% in the allocation to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. He mentioned that on a year by year basis grants had not been allocated owing to delays, but this should not have impacted on the projected grants for other sports clubs and new sports organisations which would like to access sports capital grants. Perhaps the measure might have been broadened within the existing budgetary framework. The Minister of State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, launched some positive measures to tackle obesity levels and other public health care issues which I fully support, but the cut to the sports grants allocation was really disappointing in the context of dealing with the obesity crisis. </p>
          <p eId="para_981"> I could continue speaking, but I will allow Deputy Brendan Smith to make his contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_982">I wish to pick up on a few of the points made by my colleagues Deputies Frank O’Rourke and Jack Chambers. There is some fairness in the budget in the disbursement of funding that became available, commonly known as the fiscal space. It is welcome that there will be an increase in pension payments and other social welfare payments because since 2011 the hallmark of budgets was not fairness. </p>
          <p eId="para_983"> I echo Deputy Frank O’Rourke's comments in welcoming the provision of funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund which was a major success during the years. We must use the capacity available within the hospital system, north and south of the Border, to ensure people on waiting lists will have procedures carried out as soon as possible. In delivering health and other services to people, which is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, we must focus on their delivery using the capacity available in the hospital system, North and South. In the past when the National Treatment Purchase Fund was being fully utilised, significant numbers of patients from the South travelled to the North to source services, which was a very welcome development. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I represent Southern Ulster counties and had significant numbers of constituents who were able to avail of services in Northern Ireland owing to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. I welcome the provision of €50 million in that regard and hope it will be possible to increase the funding provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_984"> We must ensure local authority housing is provided as it is absolutely necessary to provide housing. There are many examples of housing stock around the country that must be returned to a habitable condition. Surely it is not beyond the capacity of local authorities, with direct funding from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to increase substantially the housing supply available.</p>
          <p eId="para_985"> On home support, we all witness on a daily basis too many instances of individuals who have been approved to receive home help but who must wait for assistance to become available. The time lag involved must be reduced. There are too many instances of people who have to remaine in hospital because a home support service has not been put in place. I refer, in particular, to services for children with special and additional needs. We must ensure additional professional services will be put in place. I sincerely hope the extra allocation will mean an improved service.</p>
          <p eId="para_986"> I refer to the capital programme which in recent years has lacked ambition. I welcome, however, the commitment to have a mid-term review of the programme in 2017. Those of us who represent Southern Ulster and Border counties can see the huge obstacles and challenges facing local economies because of the decision of the British people in the referendum on EU membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">I will take the opportunity to mention a few projects in my constituency that are needed to ensure we can maintain employment and try to grow it. There is an urgent need to progress the design and planning of the proposed Virginia bypass on the N3 in County Cavan which carries traffic right throughout County Cavan, south Donegal and through Fermanagh. There is a bottleneck there. If we are serious about rural development we have to ensure that much needed capital projects are progressed as rapidly as possible. It is essential not just to create additional employment but to maintain the employment that is already there. A proposal was advanced in 2009-10 for the development of the east-west route from Sligo to Dundalk with particular stretches that need attention, namely the Cootehill, Shercock, Carrickmacross to Dundalk route. Unfortunately that project was stopped by the previous Government's inability to provide funding to the National Roads Authority to continue work that had commenced in County Louth and also work in planning and design by Monaghan and Cavan county councils. Fortunately there is a good bit of employment across those towns of Cootehill, Shercock, Carrickmacross and Dundalk. Much of the product that is exported from that part of Cavan and Monaghan goes to Greenore Port. We need a proper route to ensure those heavy vehicles can travel in reasonable comfort and at reasonable speed. I appeal to the Government to ensure, given the considerable challenges we face now arising from Brexit, those projects are advanced. If the Border counties are to be given some hope of dealing in a meaningful way with the particular challenges we face it is absolutely essential that our infrastructure is improved dramatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> I am glad my colleagues, Deputy Frank O'Rourke and Deputy Jack Chambers, mentioned Brexit. I have posed numerous questions to the Taoiseach and various Ministers since the June referendum and I am most disappointed that much needed additional funds have not been provided to the different Government agencies and Departments that need to deal with the Brexit issue. It is most disappointing that it took the British Prime Minister almost ten weeks to reply to a letter from the Northern Ireland First Minister and deputy First Minister. I have a copy of the reply from Prime Minister May and it is most disappointing. It took ten weeks to send a holding reply that does not deal with the specific issues that were put to her and her Government by the First Minister and deputy First Minister. There are generalities included in the reply. It is not adequate. I sincerely hope the Taoiseach and his colleagues in government will be able to insist and ensure the British Government takes the concerns of the people of all of this island into consideration in their negotiations with the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_989"> There are particular challenges for us. There has been a huge downside already to the Brexit referendum result. I see it in my county and constituency. Small and medium enterprises that were heavily or totally dependent on exports to the sterling area of Northern Ireland and Britain have been impacted very negatively already with the loss of jobs. If one takes the mushroom sector in particular, there has been a traumatic effect on that particular sector because its only outlet was the British market. We need action, not just general policy initiatives. We need support for those sectors.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Buckley<recordedTime time="2016-10-19T23:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_990">I congratulate Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Their long running show is more like a documentary. On the one hand, Fianna Fáil is knocking Fine Gael for the budget, yet its Deputies will probably sit on their hands and support it very shortly. This is not a good budget for Ireland. It is certainly not a good budget for anybody under 26. It is certainly not a good budget for pensioners. If one is part of the squeezed middle, it certainly is not a very good budget. It was mentioned a while ago that it was not appropriate to give the under-26s the extra freaky fiver, as we will call it. If one puts oneself into the position of a 22 or 23 year old who has a part-time job, is probably living at home, has borrowed money from the credit union and is paying back a loan, a fiver makes an awful lot of a difference. It has not been put into perspective. I had a phone call the other night at 9.20 p.m. from an 83 year old gentleman who was so disgusted with the fiver that I actually thought it was my fault. He said, "I don't want it, Pat, give it to the kids." There is a sense of anger. I do not think Deputies in the Chamber realise what damage has been done to ordinary working people and to real working families. There has to be a reality check here. Again today in the Chamber I listened to the leader of Fianna Fáil criticise the Fine Gael leader on investment in health and mental health. Yet, a number of weeks ago when we proposed to do something about it, Fianna Fáil Deputies sat on their hands. There is no political will in this Chamber. I also heard the Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, state a number of days ago when we were discussing the budget that Fianna Fáil did not write the budget. I can certainly say that Fianna Fáil coloured it in because it has the hallmark of both parties. We know what will happen in a couple of days' time.</p>
          <p eId="para_991"> It beggars belief that there could not have been a better way on this budget. It should have been about investing in our country by investing in public services, housing, roads, broadband and schools. Establishing the knock-on effect of this is not rocket science. The Government has to invest in real jobs, give people an opportunity to earn real money and improve the services we have. They are all paying tax. It is not rocket science. The knock-on effect of that would be that the Government would address the problems in housing and our education system. It would certainly take the stress off the health service by investing in people. It goes back to one thing. Each and every one of these people would actually have proper, paid jobs so they could pay taxes. It is about making a fairer and more affordable system for our citizens. The Government had an opportunity to do it but unfortunately we stick to the <i>status quo</i> here which is very unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_992"> Big bang budgets were also mentioned. Perhaps it is not a big bang budget for Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil but it was certainly a big bang budget for under-26s, pensioners and what the Government classes as the squeezed middle. That is the reality of this budget. We have to empathise with people outside this Chamber. Even as a newly elected Deputy, I understand the notion of being in a bubble, but we actually leave the bubble now and again and engage with real people. We are here as elected representatives to work on behalf of the people we represent. I have a son at home who will be a teenager very shortly. He is excited about trying to go out and get a job and save up for his first car. This budget does not give much hope to the young people of today. It has deflated the people we should probably respect the most in this country, that is our ageing population, which is on the rise. They are the people who built this country. We should be planning ahead for this but we are not. We are going back to the same old <i>status quo</i>, specifically targeting certain areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> Deputy Doherty mentioned the figure of €20 million a while back.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">That could have been used in a more productive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_995"> We can discuss figures and numbers, but we have listened to the debate over the last few days and it just seems to be repetitive. I spoke to a gentleman last Friday at my clinic in Midleton. He asked me what it is like up here. I said, "It is 100 mph, it is difficult but it can be rewarding." He asked me to do him a favour. He said, "When you go into the Chamber, will you speak plain English? Do not be intoxicated by the exuberance of somebody's vocabulary." I laughed. The reason I laughed is the people do not need fancy terms. They do not need all of this colouring in and shading of numbers. They want the brass-tacks truth, and the brass-tacks truth of this budget is that it is not good for the young people of this country and is certainly not good for this country's sick people, pensioners or the squeezed middle. When there is another election, I hope people will remember what has happened in this Chamber. We can debate this budget at length, but at times one feels one is wasting time because the outcome will not be good for the people who put their faith in us.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> I could talk for longer, but it is very difficult. We in this Chamber will be judged on merit. When the next election is held I hope and pray that, please God, the young people, pensioners and the squeezed middle of this country will remember this.</p>
