#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	2	I thank the Minister of State for attending. Senators from County Roscommon have drawn three of the Commencement matters today which shows how active Senators from County Roscommon are. There is also one from County Mayo. I ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to resolve the outrageous circumstance in which a two-year old child is being pursued for €100 by Intrum Justitia for attending the accident and emergency department at Portiuncula Hospital in November 2015. Like all children under six years of age, this child from Roscommon town has a GP visiting card. Her parents' income is just €400 per week. She was rushed to the emergency department at Portiuncula Hospital last November. Unfortunately, as the Minister of State knows, we have no emergency department in Roscommon thanks to a decision taken by Senator James Reilly when he was Minister for Health in the Fine Gael-led Government in 2011. Her distressed mother telephoned Westdoc when her daughter took ill in the middle of the night last November. The Westdoc personnel told her to give the child Calpol, which the child then vomited up. Her temperature continued to rise. It was the middle of the night and Westdoc told her to go and get Nurofen. No shops were open locally which sold Nurofen and the Westdoc personnel said there was nothing else they could do. The family then drove to Portiuncula Hospital to seek immediate medical attention for their very ill child. The Westdoc doctor should have seen a child whose temperature was rising out of control and who was vomiting. Had a Westdoc doctor seen her and been unable to address her symptoms, he or she would have signed a letter for the accident and emergency department exempting her from any charge. As a former chairman of the Western Health Board, I find it morally wrong that a two-year old child, who is covered under the GP visit card and was not provided with a service by Westdoc, is now receiving threatening letters from Intrum Justitia in respect of legal action on a bill of €100. It is an international company and I have named already the directors from Sweden and elsewhere.This issue must be resolved immediately for the family concerned and an assurance given that all children under six years attending emergency departments will not be billed and their families pursued by a legal debt collection agency.  It should be noted that the child in question had to be brought to Portiuncula Hospital as the emergency department for Roscommon town which was located in Roscommon hospital was closed by the last Fine Gael-led Government weeks after taking office in the summer of 2011, despite promises delivered in the square of the town to keep the department open. The current situation is totally inadequate and unacceptable to the people of Roscommon and surrounding areas who have had no emergency services at Roscommon County Hospital, now known as Roscommon University Hospital. The name was changed but the hospital did not have its status improved. The HSE has failed to deliver a rapid response ambulance service in County Roscommon which was promised since the wrongful closure of the emergency department five years ago. The family to which I refer then received a letter from Saolta requesting the money. When I was chairman of the former Western Health Board and such issues came before me, I would have dealt with them more pragmatically, especially given the fact that the family made the effort to contact WestDoc but that service would not see the child and would not give the family a referral letter. Indeed, WestDoc could have supplied such a letter retrospectively, pointing out that the family had contacted the service. The family made an effort to contact a GP before attending the emergency department at Portiuncula Hospital. Given the circumstances, this matter should be resolved and the fee waived. Frankly, the bill has been sent to the child but the child is only two years old and does not have €100. The family are simply not in a position to pay it.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	3	I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to address the House on this matter. First, it is important to point out that it is not appropriate for me to comment on any individual or specific case. However, I have been advised that this issue has been resolved favourably for the people involved. I cannot go into any more detail in that regard. Regarding charges for attendance at emergency departments, there is a statutory fee of €100. This fee is payable by patients who do not have a medical card and who attend an emergency department without a referral letter from a GP. The fee is, of course, applicable to a patient's first visit as part of an episode of care but patients with medical cards do not have pay this fee. It is important to remember that this fee for presenting at an emergency department is the only outpatient charge currently payable in the public hospital system. Expanding and utilising primary care services to best effect is a core element of an integrated approach to alleviating pressures on emergency departments. There are now 13 community intervention teams in place and in the first half of 2016, these have reduced hospital bed requirements by approximately 73 beds per day. A total of 92 primary care centres have opened with a further 39 at the preliminary stages of development. A project to increase access to diagnostic services in GP surgeries is currently delivering approximately 1,300 ultrasound scans per month, while the GP minor surgery pilot project has delivered just over 4,200 procedures since commencement. Also, in the first half of 2016 usage of out-of-hours GP services increased by 14% over 2015. In September the HSE published the winter initiative 2016-17 which provides €40 million of additional funding for winter preparedness. Under this initiative, community intervention team services are being expanded in four regions and the availability of aids and appliances in primary care has been increased to facilitate patients being discharged from hospital back to their own homes. The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE to develop and expand primary care services but also to ensure these services work effectively in order to reduce the necessity for patients to attend emergency departments.  Without going into the details of the particular case referred to by the Senator, we must make sure that when doctors or nurses on call feel that they can fast-track a patient to the appropriate care, that is taken into account and the charges are not applied. Again, I stress that I am advised that this matter has been resolved favourably for those involved.

That letter says that the child was liable for the charge because the child's family has a GP visit card, not a full medical card. This issue has been going on for weeks and weeks. I thank the Minister of State for being here but she could have been saved the trouble of appearing before the House if someone had phoned me and told me that the matter had been resolved. I would then have withdrawn the commencement matter. While the 92 primary care centres are very welcome, there is an issue with staffing. Furthermore, I repeat the fact that we do not have an emergency department in Roscommon meant that the child to whom I refer had to be brought to Portiuncula Hospital. That is a fact. I again thank the Minister of State.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to highlight what is an extremely important issue for many rural communities. No one has ever denied that the turf cutting ban has been very difficult for all concerned. Despite this, many other stakeholders and I were determined, at the beginning of the term of the last Government, to work long and hard to address in a meaningful way the challenges posed by the EU habitats directive for turf cutting communities, especially in the special areas of conservation, SACs. I was one of the first politicians to travel to Brussels to meet the relevant EU Commissioner in order to highlight the impact of the turf cutting ban on those affected. I went there with Mr. Conor Skehan, Deputies Paul Connaughton and Martin Heydon and Councillor Jimmy McClearn from Galway to meet the Commissioner, Mr. Janez Potoènik. We told him that a new Government had just been formed and that the situation regarding the habitats directive was very serious. Mr. Skehan pointed out that there had been a ten-year derogation and that all we wanted was another six months. We were absolutely shocked when Mr. Potoènik and his officials said, "What derogation?" The Fianna Fáil-led Government had decided that this issue was so explosive that they would tell the people that there was a derogation and they could continue to cut turf. At the same time, solicitors' letters were coming from Europe. We were absolutely shocked. Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív admitted in the Dáil a few months later that Fianna Fáil thought there was a derogation but then found out that there was not. It was a shameful way to deal with one of the most important issues in rural Ireland at the time.  I am glad that the Government of which I was a member dealt with the issue. As part of my campaign on behalf of rural communities, I called for an independent commission and was very glad that this call was heard and a mediation process, in the form of the Peatlands Council, was established. I believe the council and the setting up of the peatlands forum allowed the genuine views and concerns of the turf cutting communities to be taken on board in a formal manner. All of this ultimately led to the setting up of a compensation and relocation scheme for turf cutters affected by the habitats directive. One of my primary objectives throughout the whole process was to make sure that those affected would be financially recompensed and thankfully that happened. In my own region I fought for and helped to deliver compensation for more than 1,000 turf cutting families. That equates to a sum of €23,000, tax free, to each turf cutter over a 15-year period. That is a huge amount of money for people in Roscommon, east Galway and other areas. There are other counties that do not have SACs and they wish they were part of this compensation scheme. I understand this issue has been considered for more than four years. It is also important to remember that the concerns of turf cutters wishing to relocate to other bogs were duly recognised by the Department. These turf cutters received a one-off payment of €500 and are also entitled to receive 15 tonnes of turf each year until the relocation bog is ready. Today I take the opportunity to ask the Minister of State for an up-to-date appraisal of the turf cutters' compensation scheme and the related bog relocation scheme. The latter is more complex, as everyone will acknowledge. These schemes have recognised the genuine concerns of the affected communities who have been carrying on the turf cutting tradition for generations.  I pay tribute to all of the stakeholders, particularly the turf cutting community which understood that the last Government was forced to deal with a very difficult legacy issue but came up with practical solutions for those affected.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	9	I thank the Senator for tabling this matter which I am taking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys. I commend the Senator for his work on the turf cutting compensation scheme and the relocation scheme in recent years. I want to acknowledge the work of the last Government in sorting out a mess that was left behind. There was a debate in the Dáil last night where similar sentiments were heard from the Opposition that the last Government had tackled something that had been left unresolved for a number of years. Since 2011 huge efforts have been made to solve the issue of the protection of Ireland’s raised bog special areas of conservation within the framework of the EU habitats directive. This has included intense and ongoing engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and the European Commission. In addition, a long-term compensation scheme has been introduced to compensate cutters for their loss arising from the cessation. This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme comprises a payment of €1,500 per annum, index-linked for 15 years, or relocation to a non-designated bog, where feasible, together with a once-off incentive payment of €500. Over 3,200 applications have been received and the total expenditure under the scheme amounts to in the region of €19 million. Some 11,086 annual payments, 1,649 once-off incentive payments of €500 and 896 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of these applications. The review of the raised bog natural heritage area network, published in January 2014, concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 has been presented to Dáil Éireann and published. Its purpose is to provide for the implementation of a reconfiguration of the natural heritage area network arising from the 2014 review. The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme has been extended to land owners and turbary rights holders affected by the proposals arising from the natural heritage area review. Some 246 applications have been received under the scheme and 342 annual payments have been made at a cost of just over €525,000 to applicants from these sites. Thirteen once-off incentive payments have also been made in respect of these sites. Details in regard to the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for each raised bog site are available on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department. The county or counties in which each bog is located are also shown. I am making available to the House a table illustrating the amount of compensation paid under the scheme on a county by county basis. Some 633 applicants to the cessation of turf cuffing compensation scheme have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog. My Department has written to over 400 turf cutters seeking expressions of interest in relocation to specific non-designated sites. The relocation of turf cutters is a complex process. Notwithstanding the complexity involved, 62 turf cutters have been accommodated on non-designated bogs in counties Offaly and Galway. For a number of special areas of conservation, the relocation site identified may not be suitable or may not have the capacity to cater for the number of turf cutters who may wish to relocate there. In such cases my Department, in consultation with turf culling interests, is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of Article 6 of the habitats directive. The national raised bog SAC management plan will set out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. The measures to address these needs include financial compensation, relocation to non-designated bogs and considering the possible utilisation of the provisions of Article 6 of the habitats directive. There has been a significant reduction in turf cutting activity on the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation since the cessation of turf cutting has come into effect on these sites. Final resolution of all issues in regard to the protection of Ireland’s protected raised bogs will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established for the purpose of ensuring input from all stakeholders. I have provided a table for the Senator highlighting the amounts paid in different counties. There is some overlap, given some bogs overlap county boundaries, and the table reflects this. He will see there are payments of €22,815 for Roscommon; €695,000 for Galway-Roscommon; €17,000 for Longford-Roscommon; €220,000 for Galway-Roscommon-Sligo; and €2,536,000 for Roscommon-Longford-Westmeath; and a sum total of €19,881,602.35.

The sums involved are staggering and I would like to thank the Government for making them available. Nearly €5 million has been paid in four years in County Roscommon and there are another 11 years to go. I am sick and tired of people out there asking, "What about the turf cutters?". I am very happy that we delivered for them. There are politicians who said from the very beginning that nobody would apply but, five years ago, we told them that 1,000 people had applied. Those politicians then said there would be no money but we said the money was ring-fenced. This is absolute proof that the Government has dealt as best as it could with a very difficult situation. It should be highlighted that this money is going to 1,000 families in counties Roscommon and Galway every year and there are another 11 years to go. Most of those families, thankfully, have a second NHA bog where they can continue to cut turf. This is something that needs to be highlighted. It is good news. Once again, the Government has put its money where its mouth is.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	11	I concur with the Senator and commend him for the work he has done in the past five years in achieving this settlement on behalf of turf cutters in the Roscommon-Galway area and across the country. I also commend my former colleague, Mr. Paul Connaughton, who put a lot of work into this and travelled to Brussels to meet the Commissioner. The details are that the sum is possibly more than people would have anticipated. A sum of €19,881,000 is a significant amount going into rural communities in lieu of the cessation. It demonstrates the commitment of Government to those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog conservation areas. The majority of those who were active on these sites are remaining in the scheme. Engagement with turf cutting interests continues with a view to resolving the issues relating to the raised bog special areas of conservation. As I said, the national raised bog conservation management plan was developed arising from a motion in Dáil Éireann in March 2012 which was supported by the Dáil. This is in line with A Programme for a Partnership Government, which outlines that the Government recognises that domestic turf cutters have a traditional right to cut turf, a right which is balanced with the conservation objectives and legal obligations of the State. I again state that, having inherited an economic and financial mess in 2011, we also inherited a mess in regard to bogs and what had not been done. We grasped that nettle under difficult circumstances and we achieved a result. There is more of a way to go and, as I said, a Bill is at present being debated in the Dáil and it will be brought before the Seanad in time to bring closure to the issues in regard to turf cutting. I again commend the Senator for his work on this issue in recent years.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	12	I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, is in the Chamber to deal with this matter. I ask him to immediately, not some time in the future, end the discrimination and injustice that pupils of Inver national school are experiencing by being denied the benefits offered by the DEIS scheme. The school is in a rural area with dispersed national schools. Every other school in the vicinity has DEIS status, which means that they receive certain educational supports in order that children can come through their education with a fair chance in life. Inver national school meets all the DEIS criteria such as high unemployment, low wages and low academic standards, which it shares with the other national schools in the area. This issue has been ongoing for 11 years. If DEIS means anything and if we can have confidence in it supporting people experiencing educational disadvantage and social disadvantage, something needs to be done now. The Minister of State could be the person to do that. The reality is that this school had disadvantaged status up to 2005. At this juncture, with the inception of DEIS, forms and reminders were sent to the school to be completed, but the principal failed to fill in the forms and, to this day, the pupils of the school have been missing out.Not only are the children at a disadvantage, their parents pay more for their education than any other parents in Erris. The school does not receive the same funding as other primary schools in the area. It does not receive the same book grants and it is excluded from applying for IT grants even though every other school in Erris can. The school has to pay twice the amount for visiting experts and workshops than every other primary school in the area. How can this be acceptable? Through no fault of their own, children have been at a disadvantage for a generation. This has to stop. I acknowledge a review is under way but when I was in the Dáil, I raised this issue several times. This review has been ongoing a long time and the notion that it will be concluded by December and that action will be taken next September cannot be stood over. Something needs to be done in the interim. There is a blockage in the Department. Officials are afraid to set a precedent but this is an exceptional case. This community was ravaged by the divisions caused by the Corrib gas project with neighbours going against neighbours during a deep and bitter dispute. Over the past ten years, many of the injustices have been righted in this area. Anomalies have been removed and mistakes forgiven and corrected. Will the Minister of State and his senior Minister stand over and ameliorate one outstanding source of division, which is the discrimination the children in Inver national school have experienced for the past 11 years? There can only be one answer because other than that, the benefits of DEIS will mean nothing. Over the years, successive Ministers have lauded and praised the success of DEIS in promoting school attendance, general well-being, mental health, and outcomes with children staying in school longer. This community and these children should be given a chance. It is an exceptional case through no fault of their own. The principal who was charged with taking care of these children failed to do their duty. This cannot be left to civil servants. Action has to be taken by the Minister of the day. Successive Ministers have failed.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	13	As the Senator may be aware, an extensive identification process to select schools for inclusion in the DEIS programme was conducted in 2005. This process took the form of an invitation to schools to apply to participate in the programme by way of a completed survey of their pupil cohort. This is new to me but she is correct that a number of reminders were issued to the school in question by my Department, a completed survey form was not received and, therefore, it could not be assessed for participation in the programme. Departmental officials say those are the criteria they laid down; I did not lay them down. They say on a number of occasions they contacted the school. Furthermore, an appeal mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the DEIS programme, but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage sufficient to warrant their inclusion. lnver national school did not participate in that process. I do not know if the Senator is aware of that. I accept there is a difficulty with the school and based on what she has said, it should probably be included in the programme. Officials say reminders were sent on two occasions and the school did not participate in the process. The Department has no information about the school, apart from that furnished by Members when raising the issue in the Dáil and the Seanad. Many representations were made to my predecessors on behalf of this school seeking its inclusion in the DEIS programme. These representations were unsuccessful. No schools which were unsuccessful in the initial identification and subsequent review processes were ever admitted into the DEIS programme. As the Senator may also be aware, a process to review the DEIS programme, which began last year, is almost complete and it is my intention to publish a new plan for educational inclusion before the end of this year. The review is examining all aspects of the DEIS programme, including the range and impact of different elements of the school support programme, and the potential for innovation within and between schools and its scope for increased integration of services provided by other Departments and agencies. No new school has been included in the DEIS programme since 2009, but now a new assessment framework is being developed using centrally held CSO and departmental data for the identification of new schools for inclusion. The number of schools to be included in the programme will be determined by this proposed new identification process, which will assess all schools in the country, including those not currently participating. It is important to note that it will not be necessary under this new arrangement - this may solve the problem for the Senator - for schools to make an application as all schools, including Inver national school, will be automatically assessed. The school will not have to apply for the new assessment and it appears, based on the school's history and the Senator's contribution, it will be included. That could be sorted following the automatic assessment.

The children have been waiting 11 years and cannot wait another year. Does the Minister of State think it is acceptable that children should have to wait another year and that a generation has lost out while successive Ministers stood over this? Will action be taken now even on an interim basis? I raised this issue in the Dáil and in person with the former Ministers for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and Ruairí Quinn, and nothing was done, which is unacceptable. Reasonable people would wonder whether we are tied up in bureaucratic red tape with officials saying a form was not submitted on time through no fault of the parents and the pupils. They would have submitted the documents. Senator Keith Swanick will also have some knowledge of this. They have spent significant time lobbying and courting the Department for some fairness. There needs to be an intervention, otherwise the Department is showing itself up as a bureaucratic nightmare that does not respond to the educational needs of children in a vulnerable situation. Their community has lived with the fallout of the Corrib gas project. Is it just lip service or does the DEIS programme mean something? Measures need to be taken between now and next September. I acknowledge the Minister of State is only new to this brief but he has championed people in disadvantage. I am hoping for a breakthrough because the parents and the school have had enough of being ignored. I ask the Minister of State to act.

I do not say that to be compassionate. I understand the difficulty is that criteria were laid down for all schools to be included in the DEIS programme and the school did not participate in the process. The school was also informed that there was an appeals mechanism in place but it did not even participate in that part of the process. I do not know why what was the case. The school was informed that an application had not been submitted and that an appeals process was in place, when it was not included, but it did not participate. Perhaps we need to know the reason for that but it is neither here or there. The school does not have to reapply because an identification process is being undertaken. Based on what the Senator has said, which I believe, if the school meets the criteria, no assessment will have to be done. I see no reason it should not be included. I ask the Senator to meet me in a few weeks and if she wants to bring a representative from the school I would be delighted to meet that person. We can go through this and see if we can push it forward. If what the Senator is saying, which I completely believe, is that the school should be included then it should be. We must go past what happened and whatever errors were made in the school. The Senator is completely correct; if an error was made, or a misjudgment was made by an individual, the rest of the school should not suffer. I accept this and there is no point in me saying otherwise. I ask the Senator to bear with me for a couple of weeks, then meet me, and if she wants to bring somebody from the school I would be delighted to meet that person, to see whether we can push this forward.

#KeithSwanick	unknown-#KeithSwanick-party	unknown-#KeithSwanick-dob	unknown-#KeithSwanick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	19	I thank the Minister of State for taking this important motion on investments held by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, through the strategic investment fund. This is a health and financial policy issue because tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in Ireland and is an enormous strain on the health system. We always want to see the NTMA generate a significant income for the taxpayer through prudent and strategic investments. The strategic investment fund has a statutory mandate to invest on a commercial basis and I fully acknowledge the independence of the NTMA in carrying out its important work. The long-term strategic investment of taxpayers' money is something that can and should be done professionally and devoid of political interference. My Fianna Fáil colleagues, Deputies Sean Fleming and Michael McGrath, have previously raised this broad issue on ethical investment with the Minister of Finance and the CEO of the NTMA, Mr. Conor O'Kelly. We know from the NTMA's most recent annual report that the State held more than €7.2 million in quoted equity and debt instruments for Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and other major tobacco firms. This is incredible and is part of almost €35 million of taxpayers' money invested in the alcohol, tobacco, aerospace and defence industries. I wish to concentrate on the tobacco companies for health and financial reasons. A detailed study, an assessment of the economic cost of smoking in Ireland, was produced by the Department of Health in 2016. The estimated cost of smoking on the health care system is more than €500 million per year. This is made up of direct costs in three areas. These are hospital-based costs of €211 million, primary care costs amounting to an enormous sum of €256 million, which could solve our primary care crisis at least five times over, and domiciliary costs of €40 million. It is estimated that approximately 6,000 people are killed annually by smoking. This is equivalent to the population of an entire town such as Bandon in County Cork, Westport in County Mayo, Kells in County Meath or Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary. The direct cost of €500 million year does not include lost productivity from ill-health and other huge drains on our public services. Department of Health data from three years ago shows an average cost of €5,400 every time a smoker was admitted to hospital with a tobacco-related illness, for example chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD. In 2013, which is the most recent year for which I have statistics, there were 31,000 such admissions at €5,400 per admission. This does not include the primary or GP care costs and associated costs such as medication. I am aware that investment by the NTMA in specific companies is made through fund managers, lest it be suggested the NTMA actively seeks to invest in such companies. However, it is the case that over the summer, the NTMA CEO told the Committee of Public Accounts that armaments is the NTMA's only restricted investment category. In 2015, information made available by the Minister for Finance outlined that the strategic investment fund has excluded 14 companies from its investments. These companies are not named, but it beggars belief the Irish taxpayer still has €7.2 million in equity and debt instruments in tobacco giants such as Philip Morris and British American Tobacco. In case anyone has forgotten, these are some of the same companies that threatened to sue my Seanad colleague, Senator James Reilly, and his successor as Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for doing their job. This issue is above party or partisan politics. We all need to address it and provide leadership on it. When he was Minister with responsibility for health, Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, led the way in pioneering our move in Ireland towards a tobacco free society with the ban on workplace smoking. Other countries followed suit once they saw the success it was having. The area of ethical investment is another area in which we should take the lead because while wholly independent, the strategic investment fund's investment policy is set out by the National Treasury Management Agency Act 2014. According to the Minister for Finance, the strategy is determined, monitored and kept under review in accordance with the Act. This is the basis for my call for a process to be put in place to put investment in tobacco companies on the list of prescribed investments. I struggle to understand how holding equity and debt instruments in such companies is in keeping with what various Ministers said regarding their intention to establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. Former Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, spoke on Second Stage of the legislation in 2014. He stated, "The intention is that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, will channel its resources towards productive investment in the Irish economy and leverage its resources with private sector co-investment and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy."
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	20	I thank the Senator for raising the matter of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, commonly referred to as the ISIF, and certain investments made by that fund. I raised this issue as a concern in the previous Dáil. By way of introduction and context, it is helpful to consider the evolution of the ISIF's investment portfolio. On the 22 December 2014, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, transitioned to the ISIF. The ISIF has a statutory double bottom line mandate to invest on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment creation in Ireland. Certain shareholdings which were inherited from the NPRF and which are in companies based outside Ireland are held in the ISIF's global portfolio. The global portfolio has undergone significant restructuring since 2014 and is being sold, over time, to fund Irish investment commitments as they arise. This approach provides capital for investment in Ireland. The ISIF commits to reviewing all of its investments for exposures to sectors and-or companies with potentially controversial business exposures and associated reputational risks, to ensure they are addressed and mitigated as appropriate. I can inform the Senator that the ISIF currently has equity holdings in four companies operating in the brewers, distillers and vintners category. These investments have a value of €3 million. The ISIF also has equity holdings in three tobacco companies. These investments have a value of €1.6 million. As of 30 August 2016, these alcohol and tobacco investments in total represent 0.06% of the lSlF's total assets. These investments are within the ISIF's global portfolio. They are legacy investments inherited from its predecessor, the NPRF. These investments do not form part of the ISIF's new mandate, which was formed at the time of its establishment in December 2014. Such investments should be considered in the context of the broader portfolio of the fund and the fund's commitment to responsible investment. The ISIF's mandate is aligned with sustainability principles, in terms of investment opportunities and risk management. The fund recently published its sustainability and responsible investment policy, which is available on its website. The fund operates to high international standards and invests in line with the UN-sponsored principles for responsible investment, which focus on the management of environmental, social and governance factors to improve sustainability of investment returns, and the Santiago principles, which are the globally accepted best practice principles for sovereign investment funds such as the ISIF. The fund implements its sustainability and responsible investment policy in a number of ways but primarily by focusing on the integration of environmental, social and governance factors into its investment decision-making pre-investment and by being an engaged and active owner of its investments to positively influence companies. Exclusion has not been part of the fund's responsible investment strategy, with the only exclusions from the fund being mandated by legislation. To date, the Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Act 2008 is the only relevant legislation and the ISIF operates a prohibited securities list of 14 companies on this basis. There is currently no basis for tobacco or alcohol exclusions in legislation.The ISIF has committed to a review of its exclusionary policy. ISIF senior management and the NTMA board investment committee have agreed to review the current prohibited securities policy to examine the potential of adding to the list of excluded investment categories. A review of the ISIF exclusionary policy is under way and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2017. The review of the ISIF exclusionary policy is under way separate to the ISIF investment strategy review. Given the new and unique mandate of ISIF as a sovereign development fund, and because of the uncertainty regarding the investment opportunities in Ireland, it was agreed at the time of the establishment of the ISIF in December 2014 that a formal review of the ISIF investment strategy would take place after 18 months. This allows for a sufficient period of time having elapsed before considering the operations and impact of the fund.  I am informed by the ISIF that preparatory work in respect of this formal review of its investment strategy has commenced and the review is due to be completed by the end of 2016. The review will include an appraisal of the success of the ISIF's mandate to date. The NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014 provides that ownership of the fund vests with the Minister for Finance. It also provides that the fund shall, in reviewing its investment strategy, consult the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The review of the ISIF will be conducted in accordance with these provisions. In addition, the legislation provides that the Minister for Finance may consult other Ministers, as appropriate.

I remind the House of some key facts from the World Health Organization. Tobacco kills up to half of its users and approximately 6 million people each year globally. Why is the taxpayer continuing to invest in this sector? I refer the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to a previous statement by the former Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, during the passage of the aforementioned legislation to the effect that the NTMA must consult the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who may consult other Ministers and must have regard to their views. Has this been done and, if not, why not? The issue of investment in fossil fuel extraction has been raised by other Members of the Oireachtas. I appreciate the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, taking the time to deal with this important issue. However, I intend to continue to pursue this issue and will be working with others to bring a motion or resolution before the Seanad seeking that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform do exactly as provided for under the legislation and thereby bring to an end the hypocrisy whereby the NTMA, through the ISIF, holds financial positions in companies that are suing the State and the Minister for Health in the knowledge that one out of two users will die from use of these products. We need to seek a timely unwinding of such investments held by the State.

I note that these are legacy holdings and that there is a review under way, both in terms of the fund's investment policy and its exclusion policy. Now is the time to engage on this front. In regard to the work which the Senator intends to pursue, he might want to look to Norway and its ethical policy for its pension fund which is well regarded around the world in terms of how it approaches its investments and is also very successful. In the last Dáil I published an ethical investments Bill, but, unfortunately, it did not make it to Second Stage. That Bill also addressed the issue of putting in place legislation dealing with cluster munitions as part of our obligations under the cluster munitions treaty not to invest in companies that manufacture those weapons. It was also an attempt to build a framework through which we could include other ethical investments and address the need for certain divestments on an ethical basis. Issues being considered in the context of the review include what exclusions should be contained in the policy of the new fund as it moves away from legacy investments into new investments as per legislation. I encourage the Senator to engage with that review which is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2017.

The Irish health system is pockmarked by the failures of the service itself and of politicians in terms of devising systems that do not work. In 2013, we highlighted that in the House with the recall of the Seanad to discuss organ donation. In one calendar year, 65 people on organ donor waiting lists will die. Currently, there are 650 people waiting for liver, lung and heart transplants, of whom one in ten will die waiting. Other countries have systems that work to the point where they actually have an excess of donated organs. It has nothing to do with the generosity of the people; it is simply a systems failure. Not only that, if we improved our system, it would save the taxpayer money. As the Leader knows, the cost of dialysis over a ten-year period is almost €325 million. Every organ transplant put in place would save money. The issue I raise specifically relates to the Orkambi drug therapy for cystic fibrosis. The genetic profile of the Irish population means that Ireland has the highest rate in the western world of people who suffer with cystic fibrosis and who carry the gene which leads to that condition. Orkambi has transformed lives. There are a number of people who are on a trial of this drug therapy and the Government is carrying out a review. The cystic fibrosis website has welcomed the review which is the second or third so far. Not all of the 500 cystic fibrosis sufferers in Ireland will benefit from the therapy, but it appears that the majority will. Research from the British Management Institute has outlined that every report commissioned by a Government Department over 20 years has ended up agreeing with that Department's initial viewpoint. It is the case that he who pays the piper calls the tune. We are not, therefore, hopeful about the outcome of the Orkambi review. We realise the drug is expensive. Everybody understands this. However, the transformation in the lives of those who benefit from it is enormous. I ask the Leader to find an answer to the question. We have had debates on this issue in the House. The former Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, attended the House to discuss the review. Meanwhile, people are suffering because they are not being given access to Orkambi and it is not made available more widely. I ask the Leader to organise an answer to the question in regard to Orkambi and to indicate when it will be available to those who will benefit from it.

There are two other items. This afternoon we will have a Private Members' debate on the judicial council. The Leader might indicate if he is aware at this stage whether the Minister intends to be here or if it will be the Minister of State. He may not be in a position to tell me but it would be helpful if we had some indication as to whether the Minister will be here. An issue that was covered in all national media today relates to a story that the Department of Health recommended to the Government in a memo, some of the contents of which were published in national newspapers this morning, that it not agree to sanction an additional payment for the approximately 4,000 people who work overnight in care centres with vulnerable children and adults. They are qualified staff who must stay overnight owing to the type of work they do, in some cases in 24 hour shifts. Some of them are on duty for seven days, but there are broken shifts. Prior to 2004, most of them were receiving no remuneration because they were sleeping on the premises at night, which was considered inactive activity. They are key, trained care workers. There are issues here of child safety and health and safety more generally. There are a range of reasons for which people must stay overnight, supervise and be there for vulnerable people who are in their charge. It is very disappointing to read in the national newspapers this morning the suggestion the Department of Health should write to the Government to ask it to hold back. They are on a basic, minimum wage of between €9.15 and €9.25 per hour. Clearly, the Leader will not know the detail of this issue, but it is something at which we should.We should draw attention to today's media comments on it and perhaps ask the Minister when he is next in the House to touch on it.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	26	I wanted to talk about another issue this morning but I have just come from a briefing by the Department of Social Protection about JobPath. I have very many concerns about this. My first concern is that in the west, the provision is made by the private company Seetec. I have nothing against Seetec, but it is a company that is based in Essex in the United Kingdom. One of my questions to the Department of Social Protection is if we had a choice in the matter of social welfare and job activation being privatised or was it an instruction from the European Union? I believe the Government had a choice in the matter. It is basically saying that the local employment services, LES, and Intreo were not able to do their job and did not have the resources to do their job properly. Now we have privatised the whole area of social protection. My other question is around how much would people be paid. For example, if somebody living in Belmullet is taken randomly off the social welfare list and instructed to take up a position which may be up to one hour away in Castlebar or Ballina, he or she does not have a choice in the matter. The only payment they would be given is to keep the social welfare payment. How much would that person then be given in travel allowance? It says there are travel supports available, but there are no set-out travel costs available. If people are required to travel for up to one hour to a position, if they do not have the option of public transport, they have the cost of getting a car and insurance, including meeting the rising cost of motor insurance. It is grossly unfair to do that and it will end up costing people. It is also said that there are supports for child care costs, but again there is ambiguity around that and how much people would get for child care. If it is decided to grant a child care allowance to them can that be given to a relative or to somebody who is a non-registered childminder? Again, there is no answer to that and it is at the discretion of the Department of Social Protection. I asked the Department if the person concerned has mental health difficulties will the Department accept a letter from a mental health practitioner or a GP to say this person is not fit to travel or to take up that position. Again, I could not get any answer to that question. I am gravely concerned about the destruction being caused to people who are being forced onto these schemes just to take them off social welfare and to massage the figures in order that the Government can say state another person has been taken off social welfare or that they have been put on a boat or a plane and are no longer our responsibility. It is a matter of urgency. I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Social Protection to the House to answer some of those questions. There are already dozens of complaints lodged about JobPath. Of course it is not only JobPath, it is also about many other schemes into which people are being forced or about their payments being cut completely, which is the nub of the problem. People are then dependent on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to provide a roof over their head or to provide them with food for the week. It is wrong.

This issue has been raised by other Members of the House, including by Senator Ray Butler last week. Night after night on television we watch helplessly the heartache of ordinary people. These people are like us and we wonder what we can do. There is something we agreed to do this time last year. Ireland agreed to take 4,000 refugees in the wake of what has been the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War. In establishing the Irish refugee protection programme, The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald highlighted the plight of unaccompanied children and she promised that special arrangements would be put in place to help these children. However, in the year to 19 September, despite the promised special effort, Ireland has only accepted one child according to the Ombudsman for Children. The Irish Times reported recently that Ireland has agreed to accept a further 20 children by the end of 2016. Over 109 unaccompanied children have applied for asylum in the European Union since the beginning of 2015. We can do so much better than helping just 21 children. Given Ireland's painful history with emigration and famine, it is so disappointing that we have not stepped up to the mark. The Minister said in the Dáil last year, "Ireland has always lived up to its international humanitarian obligations" and that the Government is fully committed to playing its part in addressing the current crisis. We need urgent action to live up to this promise, especially for vulnerable children. I would be grateful if the Leader could invite the Minister to the House to lay out her plans as to when we will reach the 4,000 target for refugees and our involvement in measures to support unaccompanied minors across Europe, particularly the children in Calais, and to explain why Ireland has not helped more children. We can, and we must, do so much better than we have to date to help the ordinary citizens and children of Aleppo and Syria who are caught in a living hell.

At this stage, however, we have reached a grave situation. We are facing strike action by second-level teachers and by An Garda Síochána. Today's advertisement in the national newspapers seeking members of the public to go in to schools to perform supervision and substitution work is, at best, misguided and, at worst, completely misunderstands the nature of schools and how they operate. Yesterday the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, thought it was a good idea to say that the public would never view members of An Garda Síochána the same way again if they were to go on strike. That is an outrageous statement. It is clear that the Government, in particular Fine Gael, has no comprehension of how industrial relations work or how best to deal with trade unions or the public sector in general. I suggest to the Leader that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, should be invited to the House to discuss his announcements in the budget of a public pay commission to report by next summer. Surely we must realise that the situation in which we find ourselves is grave, that schools will close and that gardaí will not be on the streets. The response from Government seems to be a complete misunderstanding of the sensitivities involved, of the public sector and of how to deal with industrial relations. The response has been a "face them down" attitude which is not going to work. What the House does not need is any more hyperbole; therefore, I ask the Cathaoirleach and the Leader to respectfully request the Minister to attend to the matter to overcome the situation where our schools are going to close down and where gardaí are not on the street. If that was to happen in any other European member state, the assumption would be that its government had completely lost control of the situation. I ask that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform come to the House to expand on his one line statement in the Budget Statement as to what is his vision for the public sector. It might contribute to a conversation on how we might avoid the situation of our schools closing, of gardaí not being on the street and of bitterness and rancour being in our schools and in our police force for years to come. If the Government's tone is to continue along the line of what the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said yesterday, I worry that the situation will completely unravel

I thank all of the Senators who sent emails after I spoke about the situation in Aleppo last week. I wrote to the ambassador and have received a response that reads:Dear Senator Mr. Butler,Thank you for your letter. It is very interesting to know your point of view on the current situation in Aleppo. Unfortunately, I am afraid that your acquaintance with facts of what [is] going on in Syria ... and in Aleppo [is] particularly ... far from objectivity. I dare say that you use one-sided and preconceived information widely spread in ... Western mass media. If you are interested in getting alternative point of view I would be ready to talk to you. Sincerely, AMBASSADOR ... PESHKOV.I welcome the ceasefire that was called this morning. I do not think any of us in here have been brainwashed by western media when we see what has gone on in Aleppo. We know that atrocities have been perpetrated by all sides from barrel bombs to suicide bombers. What we have seen in the past couple of weeks is nothing but the slaughter of innocents. Women and children have been slaughtered. The other night on television we saw a young man being dragged out of a building but he was just a child or young boy. I do not need a Russian ambassador to tell me that I have been brainwashed or any of us in here have been brainwashed. We want the ceasefire to happen and women and children taken out of the city, given safe passage and looked after properly.

The position of the Seanad is very important. Two weeks ago I raised an issue with the Leader of the House, tabled a Commencement matter and it has been resolved. Sometimes people do not realise the effectiveness of the Seanad. In fact, I was a Deputy for more years than I have been a Senator; therefore, I know that it is as effective to make representations as a Senator as it was when I was a Deputy.  To allay fears, I have had an opportunity to look at the Ceramics Room in the National Museum of Ireland and found it to be an ideal location for the Seanad. The Senators and the Daily Mail should fear not because the building is ideal for the Seanad. It links into Leinster House on the right-hand side and was part of the RDS complex at one stage. As far as education purposes are concerned, when I visited the room in July nothing was happening so I do not know what Dr. Pat Wallace, who has retired from the National Museum of Ireland, meant. There will be plenty of opportunities on Mondays, Fridays and weekends to use the facility for lectures, which would be in beautiful surroundings with the furniture from this room. I disagree with the idea of relocating the Seanad outside of the capital because everyone works here as part of a team with public servants, civil servants and more. Therefore, we cannot afford that kind of relocation. In respect of reform, the Seanad is working very well and if it is not broken then do not fix it. I was one of the Senators who was in this House when people voted to retain the Seanad. They voted because to my mind, it is and has been a very effective body. Let me explain. I recall that the leader of the Irish delegation to the Council of Europe is Senator Joe O'Reilly. Many of the members of the Council of Europe attended a meeting last week but Members of the Dáil were unable to attend due to the budget. At the meeting I put a question to President Hollande on Brexit and received a positive response. I am also Vice Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs. This House serves a useful purpose as it is and through the Cathaoirleach, previous Cathaoirligh and previous Leaders it has built up an even stronger reputation than ever before.

This year many events have taken place up and down the country not just to remember and reflect but I hope to rededicate and re-energise ourselves around the spirit and ideals of that era and the 1916 Rising. I draw the attention of the Leader and all Members to correspondence I have received from Belfast historians - people with an interest and expertise in this area - on the last remaining prisoner of war, POW, hut on the Frongoch site in Wales. As the Leader will know, it was the site to which POWs who took part in the Easter Rising were relocated and held during that period. The site was dubbed as the university of revolution. It was a place and time where republican activists honed their political craft, studied guerrilla warfare and many other acts of revolution around the world in preparation for the revolutionary years of the Black and Tans war that lay ahead of them. The site would be of massive historical significance at any time but as we move towards the end of 2016, it reminds us that this last remaining hut, which has fallen into a degree of disrepair, is in need of being salvaged and retained for future generations. The hut is no longer on the site that was used to hold the prisoners. It has been relocated about a mile up the road. The man who owns the land has diligently worked to preserve and direct people who make the pilgrimage to Wales to the hut. He has tried to retain artefacts and to build up information in a voluntary capacity to make it a worthwhile trip for people. As we continue to mark this historic year, it is not over yet, it would be an opportune time for Members of the Seanad to raise our voices in support of the site. Today, I contacted the Minister responsible and raised the issue. I am happy to share my information, but I would like us to collectively raise our voices to ensure the hut is not lost but is preserved for future generations to visit. It would mean that the spirit and ideals honed and crafted in the POW camp can be learned about and put to good use.

It would be great to have a system where a lot of those people could re-enter the economy because they are badly needed. Small businesses, in particular, will face a daunting task due to Brexit. I appeal to the Leader to invite the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, to come here for a debate on providing more funding for local enterprise offices, LEOs. She did secure extra funding for LEOs in the budget, but more funding is required. LEOs can help to create start-up small businesses. They could act as a lifeblood and be the first port of call in local authorities for small businesses. LEOs can provide guidance and funding to get many small businesses off the ground. Such an initiative would play an important part in the future. We need small business enterprises in this country now more than ever. Small businesses will find things more difficult now than ever before, especially with Brexit. I can see a situation where small businesses will strive but will encounter a difficult period if Brexit comes to pass in 2019.Will the Leader request the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to come to the House to discuss the small business sector and sources of additional funding for local enterprise offices?
#KeithSwanick	unknown-#KeithSwanick-party	unknown-#KeithSwanick-dob	unknown-#KeithSwanick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	38	One image or storyline often defines a conflict or tragedy. For example, we often think of the iconic image of nine year old Kim Phuc, the girl pictured naked as she fled horrific violence in south Vietnam in 1972. In the midst of the carnage and the suffering she experienced as a result of severe burns on her back, there can seem to be no hope at times. Seventeen surgical procedures were performed during her 14-month stay in hospital. She survived and today lives with her husband and two children in Toronto. She also established the KIM Foundation in the United States, with the aim of providing medical and psychological assistance for children of war. Much closer to home, we have seen the images of a three year old Syrian boy, Alan Kurdi, who perished in the Mediterranean and was washed ashore in Turkey in September 2015. As a father of a young boy, these images had a profound impact on me. In the midst of the terror being experienced by fleeing Syrian refugees, one heart warming story brought a smile to my face. Ahmed Soda, an 11 year old Syrian refugee, recently helped Patrick Sarsfields GAA Club win its first Antrim juvenile hurling title in many years. Ahmed and his family who are originally from Aleppo arrived in Belfast last December. The crisis in Syria, specifically the humanitarian catastrophe in Aleppo, has been mentioned by many Senators. Last week, for example, the issue was raised by Senator Ray Butler. The Fianna Fáil Party spokesman in the Dáil, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has been forthright in his condemnation of recent attacks on United Nations and Red Crescent convoys. I echo this condemnation and despair when I see media reports of medical and United Nations facilities being targeted and destroyed. In this context, I wholeheartedly support the comments of the Taoiseach who wants Ireland to introduce a Naval Service hospital ship to deal with global emergencies. It is perhaps fitting that he made this pronouncement earlier this week while launching a new Naval Service patrol vessel, the LE William Butler Yeats, named after a former Senator who served in the House in the 1920s. The introduction of a Naval Service hospital ship to deal with global emergencies would be a practical response to ongoing humanitarian catastrophes throughout the world. The incredible work of the Naval Service and the crews of the LE James Joyce, LE Róisín, LE Eithne, LE Niamh and LE Samuel Beckett is an inspiration to us all. The trauma Naval Service officers will have encountered is hard to comprehend. As a medic working on the west coast, I regularly liaise closely with the Irish Coast Guard and experience at first hand its members' bravery and commitment to serving the public while putting their lives in danger. They face danger on every call-out. The crews of Naval Service vessels working in the Mediterranean deal with hundreds of traumatic scenarios daily. The image of young Ahmed Soda with his hurley among friends in west Belfast provides an important counter-balance to the awfulness unfolding in his home city and country. This is what we must all focus on as we recommit to Ireland playing its part in dealing with the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Middle East and the Mediterranean.
#PaulGavan	unknown-#PaulGavan-party	unknown-#PaulGavan-dob	unknown-#PaulGavan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	39	This afternoon the Union of Students of Ireland, USI, will hold a demonstration which will move from the Garden of Remembrance to Merrion Square to highlight students' objection to any prospect of a "study now, pay later" model being introduced for third level education. The demonstration is a response to the Cassells report published earlier this year which suggested that one possible solution to third level funding problems would be the introduction of an income contingent loan scheme. Such a scheme would effectively mean hiking fees up to €5,000 per annum, thereby leaving students with debts of up to €25,000 on graduation. This figure does not take into consideration the cost of accommodation and living expenses incurred during four years of study. Third level education is already a two-tier system in which some can afford to go to college, while others are forced to miss out, emigrate or enter low paid employment. An income contingent loan scheme would exacerbate existing inequalities in the third level education system. Those who would find the money to afford such a scheme would become members of a generation of young people who would have an education mortgage hanging from around their necks. Such a scheme would condition young people to take the first job that came along, regardless of whether it paid low wages or had poor working conditions, all of which would result in young workers undervaluing their worth in the labour force.  It is great that the Union of Students of Ireland has organised today's march and good that it has the support of SIPTU, IMPACT, the TUI, the National Youth Council of Ireland and Sinn Féin Republican Youth. This issue goes to the heart of the ideological difference between the parties. We know that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, is very much in the neoliberal wing of the Fine Gael Party and chomping at the bit to introduce a student loan scheme, whereas those of us on the left believe in building equality into the education system. I call on the Leader to ask the Minister back to the House for a decent debate on the proposed loan system in order that we can find out where each of the parties stands on the matter.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	40	I agree with previous speakers on the wording used when dealing with ongoing industrial relations disputes. There appears to be a media view that if a demand is made, the Government must be in a position to pay. There is no significant debate in the media on the fact that it is the taxpayer rather than the Government who must pay increased costs in the public service. We must be careful about how we report matters. Additional gardaí have been recruited and trained and the Government has made a commitment to recruit more. It should be noted that the Garda Training College in Templemore was closed by the Government in 2010-11. It has also given a commitment to recruit an additional 2,400 teachers. It is allocating funding for Garda and teacher recruitment. It is important to realise that it is taxpayers who are providing the additional moneys required to do so. Balanced debate is needed and we must set out clearly that a substantial increase in the cost of providing services requires an increase in taxation. More than two years ago I raised the issue of access officers in local authorities. Each local authority is supposed to have an access officer. I find the interpretation of the role of access officer strange as it varies significantly from one local authority to another. Some view the role of access officer as one of ensuring access to public buildings for people with disabilities, while others view it as one of ensuring people with disabilities can access various services and meeting the requirement to adapt inadequate housing accommodation for people with disabilities. The relevant Minister must come to the House to set out clearly what is the role of access officers. If the legislation which requires local authorities to provide an access officer is inadequate, we must introduce amending legislation. We are falling down in this area and should stop passing the buck. The cost of addressing the problem would not be significant. The Minister must come to the House and local authorities must respond accordingly. 
#CatherineNoone	unknown-#CatherineNoone-party	unknown-#CatherineNoone-dob	unknown-#CatherineNoone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	41	It has been brought to my attention that sick children in Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin are being served sugar-laden foods as part of their diet while in hospital. Moreover, the person who brought the matter to my attention, a woman whose child is in hospital, could not find anything healthy to eat in the hospital shop or vending machines on the hospital site. This is shocking as it contravenes recommendations from international health organisations that babies and children under two years should have as close as possible to a zero sugar intake. According to a prominent study by the American Heart Association, there is strong evidence to support the association of added sugars with an increased cardiovascular disease risk in children. Research has also shown that adding sugar to a baby's food increases sweet cravings and instils a sugar dependency at a young age. As the baby grows, he or she will eat sugary foods ahead of others, leading to obesity and many other illnesses.A high sugar content in baby food also significantly increases the risk of tooth decay in babies. It is very depressing to think of a child having to have his or her milk teeth removed because of a sugary diet. Obviously, it naturally increases the incidence of obesity and diabetes in future years. When it comes to Crumlin children's hospital, the irony is that sick children are being served disease-inducing sugary foods in a State health facility, while a large sugar awareness poster is hanging in the corridors. It is all well and good to announce that we are going to have healthy eating and a healthy approach in hospitals. However, that is very superficial if we are actually going to serve pasta with sugary tomato sauce on it to children while they are sick in hospital. I want us to have a meaningful debate in this House on childhood obesity, with a particular emphasis on this issue. If it needs to be a debate on obesity generally, that is fine, but a debate on childhood obesity is long overdue. I would really welcome it if the Leader asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to come to the House to tell us what is happening as regards the announcement he made last year, which I welcome and commend, that we would try to instil healthy eating habits in hospitals. That does not seem to be happening. Pasta with Dolmio sauce or one of the sugary sauces on it is simply not good enough for children who are sick.

I refer to football hooliganism at League of Ireland matches. Very small crowds are attending these matches. I read that last weekend that casuals from Bury and Wrexham were siding with Shamrock Rovers supporters and fighting Bohemians supporters. This has been ongoing for quite a while and it is something I have raised before. I am very concerned that public safety could be at risk. The Garda has to deal with perhaps 50 or 100 fans fighting with one another. It does not happen at Gaelic football matches. I was a League of Ireland supporter and a Republic of Ireland supporter 30 years ago and this is a worrying trend. I would like to find out what exactly it is costing to police these events. Casuals are coming here from Wrexham and Bury and it appears that they are siding with supporters of Shamrock Rovers, Bohemians or otherwise. These are not the tourists we want. We need to have a debate on the issue and look at legislation on banning orders. I believe one senior member of the Garda said there was nothing that he could do. There are no banning orders to stop somebody who is intent on causing mayhem and trouble and throwing bottles from attending these matches. I am concerned that it is an issue we are allowing to go under the radar. We have a great reputation as Republic of Ireland socer team and GAA supporters. This is a tiny minority who seem to have a voice. They must be stopped. We should have a debate on the issue.

I completely agree with Senator Mark Daly on the need to transform the organ donation infrastructure. The committee I chaired in the last Oireachtas completed a comprehensive report on organ donation and, in particular, the need to change the model to a soft opt-out system. The Senator is right that that is part of the difficulty. Advertising or awareness raising will not meet the need for people to make organ donations. There is a need to change the infrastructure in dealing with the issue of dialysis in hospitals. The retirement of Dr. David Hickey has highlighted the vacuum. There is a need for consensus and a buy-in on all sides on organ donation. As somebody who, when in college, worked in a dialysis unit in Cork University Hospital, I am aware of the importance of the issue. I saw the range of emotions and trauma associated with dialysis and organ donation. The Senator is right that we need a change of approach to have a completely different system. I hope we can work to that end. Senator Mark Daly also referred to Orkambi. He knows quite well that the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics and the HSE make the decision. I am told that the HSE is involved in negotiations with the manufacturer of the drug to reduce the cost, particularly for cystic fibrosis patients. I agree with the Senator completely that we must look at ways by which we can make medications and life-changing or life-altering drugs available. Whether they are high-tech or high-cost is immaterial. It is about the preservation of life and the quality of life we can give, including to the people to whom the Senator referred. We have already done so with some of the cystic fibrosis drugs and other drugs used to treat multiple sclerosis. I do not see any reason we cannot see that change. It is important, therefore, that we keep the pressure on the Department and the HSE in the case of the drug to which the Senator referred. Senator Victor Boyhan also raised the issue of organ donation.  With regard to Senator Mark Daly's Private Members' Bill which is to be taken this afternoon, I am not aware if the Minister will be in the House because he was away yesterday. I cannot give the Senator a definitive answer, but I am sure one of the Ministers of State will be present. I do not have an answer for the Senator on the issue of the payment made to the 4,000 people who are working overnight, but I will raise it with the Department. Senator Rose Conway-Walsh raised the issue of social protection and said there was a need for the Minister for Social Protection to come to the House again to discuss it. To be honest, it might be appropriate to raise it in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, but if I can arrange a stand-alone discussion, I will certainly try to do so.

Senators Colette Kelleher, Ray Butler and Keith Swanick referred to the situation in Syria. As Members know, an all-party motion is being circulated and I hope it will be signed by the different groups as it is important that we send a unified message. We can argue about a sentence or a word here or there in the motion, but the overwhelming response from us should be a unified one in condemnation of what is taking place there. We can apportion blame in a different debate. We can argue until the cows come home about the example Senator Keith Swanick gave and the imagery Senator Ray Butler used in referring to the response he had received from the Russian ambassador, but people are being killed and displaced. Quality of life is being ruined and lives are being lost. It behoves all of us, therefore, to work to bring about a resolution. Whether one is a permanent member of the Security Council or a Member of Seanad Éireann, we must all work to ensure what we see happening in Aleppo and Syria is not condoned but condemned. We must all work to bring about a resolution. I will be happy to arrange for the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to address the issue of vulnerable children, to whom Senator Colette Kelleher referred. I know from talking to the Minister and her commentary in different fora that she is very progressive in dealing with the issue. I will be happy to talk to the Senator again about it. Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin raised the very important issue of industrial relations. I am not going to pick a political fight with the Senator who is somebody who has very much been on the picket line with the ASTI, but it behoves everyone to engage in negotiations. I would have thought that the tone of the Ministers was conciliatory. If one reads the language used by the Ministers, Deputies Paschal Donohoe, Richard Bruton and Frances Fitzgerald, one will see that it is about engaging in talks.

One cannot do so on the airwaves or television. The important point I wish to make is that I fully understand the frustration of members of An Garda Síochána. If Senators live and operate in the real world, they will hear their stories. They date back decades. One can judge the morale of gardaí from the internal workings of An Garda Síochána and the pay issues. Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin's party leader, the former Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, was very much involved in the negotiation of the Lansdowne Road agreement. A public sector pay commission is being established. There is one way to resolve the issues involved and that is through the industrial relations mechanisms of the State. The vast majority of unions have signed up to pay restoration. I speak every day to colleagues of mine in schools and members of An Garda Síochána. The Government does not want to be in dispute with unions, in this case public sector unions. The Minister for Justice and Equality has been quite clear - the way to resolve the issues involved is to talk. I appeal, therefore, to all sides - the Government and the unions - to become involved in the process. I look forward to the issues being resolved.

There will be no obfuscation on my part. Hillary Clinton made a remark in the first US presidential debate and it transcends a lot of what is happening in this country. She said "language is important." How we operate and communicate are critical. I will ask the Minister to come to the House. I will have no issue in doing so. I commend Senator Terry Leyden for his work at the Council of Europe. It is important that he, with other Members of the House and the leader of the delegation, Senator Joe O'Reilly, work to have our case heard in Europe, particularly post-Brexit. I refer to the relocation of the Seanad which is the Upper House of the Oireachtas. A process is being undertaken. I pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach and the former Cathaoirleach, Senator Paddy Burke, for the work they undertook in bringing the matter to a resolution. There would be no benefit or gain in continuing a public discourse on the issue. I appeal to all Members to accept that the process will continue and I am sure we will find a suitable home for this august body of Members.

I will, however, be happy to take up the issue if he gives me the details. Senator Paddy Burke referred to small businesses. I agree that they are the backbone of the economy and join him in commending the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, for securing increased funding for the local enterprise offices. He is correct that they require further funding. I will be happy to have the Minister or the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, come to the House to discuss the matter. I commend Senator Keith Swanick for bringing such great imagery to the story he told the House. I hope we can all work to bring the issue to a resolution. With regard to the Naval Service, I do not have the exact title for which the Senator is looking for the hospital ship. It is, however, an idea at which we should look. I join the Senator and hope all Members will join us in commending the men and women of the Naval Service who have done huge work in the Mediterranean in saving lives. From talking to the men and women who serve we are aware of the trauma they experience in taking bodies from the water and the effect it has on them. It makes us understand better the importance of the work they do. Sometimes newspaper reports do not illustrate or quantify in real terms the work they do and the impact it has on their lives. Senator Paul Gavan has pointed out that USI members are demonstrating today, as is their right. The Cassells report has been referred to the education committee to be discussed. I share the Senator's view that the right to an education is one we should all have. The funding of third level education is being prioritised by the Government. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, will come back to the House to discuss the action plan for education, with particular reference to third level education. There has certainly been an under-funding of education. In that regard, there is a need to increase further the capitation payment in the funding of third level education. I look forward to discussing how we can do this. Senator Colm Burke is right that we only have a certain amount of money to spend. If we were to adopt Senator Paul Gavan's payment plan model, we would have to increase taxation across the board. That is in line with the fact that Sinn Féin is a high tax party, but that is a choice it has to make. Senator Colm Burke also raised the very important issue of the role of the access officer. I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss it. Senator Catherine Noone referred to the consumption of sugar and the type and quality of hospital food served. This issue comes within the remit of Healthy Ireland and the task force on childhood obesity. I will be happy to have the Minister of State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, come to the House to discuss it. Senator Frank Feighan raised the very important issue of football hooliganism. I hope it can be taken on board in the FAI's strategic plan. To be fair to Mr. John Delaney and the FAI, they have been vigilant and worked hard to ensure grounds are free of football hooliganism. There are family enclosures and family tickets available. The FAI is to be commended for the work it has done in that regard. I agree with the Senator that outside influences from across the Irish Sea are not welcome and the FAI should ensure they do not take hold.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	57	I am grateful for the invitation to come to the Upper House to contribute on such an important issue. I thank Senators for giving me the opportunity to hear statements and take questions.I understand I will have an opportunity to sum up at the end of the debate and respond to some of the issues raised.  On 21 September 2016, my Department published the Report on Programme to Review and Enhance Fire Safety in Local Authority Provided Traveller Accommodation. The report sets out the approach to reviewing and enhancing fire safety in local authority-provided Traveller accommodation. The review was undertaken in the aftermath of the tragic deaths of ten members of the Traveller community in the fire tragedy in Carrickmines just over a year ago. I take the opportunity to offer again sincere condolences on behalf of the Government to the Connors, Lynch and Gilbert families. I had the privilege to be at the one-year commemoration last week, which was an extremely moving occasion, and I took the opportunity to meet some of the family members involved who are clearly still struggling to come to terms with the enormity of what happened a year ago. Nothing I can say and nothing in this report will alleviate the suffering of the families concerned. However, the report describes the work undertaken in the intervening period to plan, audit and implement fire safety measures and improvements focused on protecting families from the dangers of fire. While the report covers the period up to 1 July 2016, my officials have verified with local authorities that progress continues to be made on a series of outstanding remedial issues. In recent years, the statistics on fire deaths have been some of the lowest for more than 40 years, placing Ireland in the league of the most fire-safe nations, with an annual fire fatality rate of six deaths per 1 million of population. Having said that, the Carrickmines tragedy was a stark reminder of the speed at which a small fire can develop into an enormous human tragedy. It also reminds us that we need to focus our ongoing fire safety efforts on those most vulnerable to the dangers of fire.  Following the tragic loss of life in Carrickmines, my Department's national directorate for fire and emergency management was mandated to lead and oversee at national level a programme to review fire safety in local authority-provided Traveller accommodation. From the outset a collaborative approach, incorporating the concerns, views, advice and knowledge of Travellers and Traveller organisations, including Pavee Point, the National Traveller Women's Forum and the Irish Traveller Movement, was adopted, working with fire safety professionals in the local authority fire service and staff in the local authority housing sections. While recognising broader issues related to Traveller accommodation, the review process focused on life safety and on ensuring practical and appropriate fire safety measures, which contribute to preventing loss of life and injury in local authority Traveller accommodation, have been applied systematically across the country. This involved appraising fire safety in Traveller accommodation against the standards set out in the working draft, Guide to Fire Safety in Existing Traveller Accommodation, which was prepared by the national directorate to assist local authorities in conducting the review. It also involved running a series of community fire safety initiatives aimed at Traveller organisations and the wider Traveller community so that awareness of fire risk and fire safety is developed and maintained over a longer period. The review focused on local authority Traveller-specific accommodation such as halting sites and group housing schemes. As I mentioned, the report on the programme to review and enhance fire safety in local authority-provided Traveller accommodation was published on 21 September. The report enumerates fire safety measures and actions implemented as of 1 July this year. However, and critically from my perspective, it also proposes and recommends a series of further actions by relevant stakeholders to sustain fire safety into the longer term. The review process, which was driven at national level by the national directorate and implemented across the country by local authorities, has effectively concluded. Local authorities submitted returns to the national directorate detailing the work that was undertaken up to 1 July 2016, which was the cut-off point for the submission of data for inclusion in the report. This information was analysed by the national directorate, resulting in the generation of the report, which I am sure some Senators have seen or read. The report highlights that as of 1 July local authorities reported having appraised fire safety in 95%, or 2,042, of the 2,144 Traveller accommodation units identified for the purpose of the review. A total of 5%, or 102, accommodation units were not subject to a fire safety appraisal as some were closed and undergoing renovations, some were unoccupied and in a small number of cases the local authority was unable to gain access. The report recommends that relevant local authorities revisit the possibility of appraising this very small percentage of Traveller accommodation units which were not covered as part of the review. Following the appraisal stage, local authorities set about carrying out the necessary remediation works and prepared implementation plans detailing short, medium and long-term timeframes for action. Short-term plans typically included the installation of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms and fire blankets and the marking of fire safety points in halting sites. Medium-term plans generally dealt with matters such as the provision of appropriate electrical connections and the reconfiguration of units, where feasible. There was a lot of this type of work. Long-term plans covered the provision of alternative or additional accommodation where needed. As of 1 July, local authorities reported having carried out enhancements in 74%, or 1,501, of the accommodation units appraised and by the end of September this had risen to 85%, or 1,745 accommodation units. When making their submission at the end of June, a number of local authorities pointed out that while other enhancement works were ongoing, this was not reflected in their return which only detailed enhancements that had been completed. In some cases, official halting sites and group housing schemes were found to be well managed and maintained and, as a result, little or no enhancements were required. The three main issues arising from the review process were: the absence of smoke alarms which would alert families to the dangers of fire at an early stage and enable them to evacuate quickly; the danger posed in multi-unit accommodation by the layout of units, in terms of a fire in one potentially preventing people escaping to safety from another unit; and the dangers of fire posed by inappropriate electrical connections between units. The absence of a working smoke alarm was identified as an issue in 1,654 accommodation units. Of these, just over three quarters, or 1,274 units, have been fitted with smoke alarms as of 1 July. I would like to point out that in some cases there was reluctance and some persons did not wish to be provided with smoke alarms or to have them fitted. This points to the need for further work in raising awareness among Travellers of fire dangers and the value of appropriate, functional fire safety measures in the home. Separation distances between Traveller accommodation units and the configuration of adjacent units within bays were determined to be issues affecting roughly half of the sites appraised. I understand adjustments in layout have been undertaken, where feasible. However, in many cases, the works required to remedy separation or configuration issues involves the provision of alternative or additional accommodation and this is not usually something that local authorities can address in the short or medium term. Where the reconfiguration of units is not sufficient to address layout issues, the provision of alternative or additional accommodation will be considered by local authorities in the longer term. My Department is providing capital funding of €9 million for Traveller-specific accommodation in 2017, an increase of €3.5 million, or 64% on the 2016 allocation, which I think was also slightly increased last year. I think we are moving in the right direction and we need to continue to do so. As I mentioned, this is the second consecutive year that the Traveller accommodation capital budget has been increased.However, whether it will be enough remains to be seen. We will appraise that again next year with a view to making decisions for 2018. In addition to capital funding for the provision and refurbishment of Traveller-specific accommodation, the Department also provides current funding for accommodation-related supports to operate in tandem with the capital programme. Current funding of €4.3 million is being provided in 2016 and a similar amount will be provided again in 2017. Traveller-specific funding is ring-fenced and is additional to the general social housing funding, which will see a huge increase for next year because of the overall pressures in respect of social housing provision and from which many Traveller families may also benefit. No other group in Ireland has this additional accommodation option, which demonstrates, I hope, a clear commitment to providing culturally appropriate accommodation for Traveller families. The condition of electrical installations generally and, in particular, the external use of multiple-plug adaptors, was identified as an issue in 62% of the sites appraised. Of these, a little more than half have had remedial works carried out. Therefore, there remains a sizeable number of accommodation units in which this is an ongoing issue and collectively we need to address that. In such cases, discussions and communication between local steering groups and the individuals involved to develop remedies or solutions to make safe these electrical installations have taken place or are ongoing. In addition to the physical works, a parallel programme of community fire safety has been undertaken by local authorities incorporating education and training for key workers and engagement with community groups on fire safety awareness. Current community safety programmes are regarded as a significant contributor to the overall downward trend in the instances of domestic fires and fire fatalities. Engaging people to take responsibility for their own safety, in so far as they can, is seen as a particularly effective approach. I understand 90% of local authorities have already carried out community fire safety talks or demonstrations and that this element of the review has been generally well received by Traveller organisations and the Traveller community. Fire services have also carried out pre-incident planning visits as part of their fire prevention work to ensure familiarity of the local fire service with the location of Traveller accommodation within their functional area, which is very important. This is to identify access, layout of sites, hazards on sites and hydrant locations to access large volumes of water. This aspect of the review is considered to have worked very well and pre-incident planning for Traveller accommodation sites has now been included in the fire service's annual pre-incident planning programme. A more complete picture of the work undertaken as part of the review can be obtained from the report which is available on my Department's website. Overall, though, I am satisfied that the work undertaken to date as part of this review programme has improved considerably fire safety in local authority provided accommodation. On the broader housing issue as it relates to the Traveller community, the report has just been published and we are learning lessons from it and want to try to invest in ensuring that we implement its recommendations. We have made decisions regarding next year's budget, anticipating that we will need to spend much more on Traveller-specific accommodation, an increase from €5.5 million to €9 million. The Housing Agency is also undertaking a broad review of housing provision for the Traveller community and should report to me before the end of the year, I think. Therefore, a lot is happening in this area, but that does not mean that there is not more to be done and more to learn. I look forward to hearing what Senators have to say on the topic.

It was devastating. The whole country was devastated. However, who is responsible for fire safety in Traveller accommodation? There are about 10,000 Traveller families resident in Ireland. We have learned through bitter experience that self-regulation of fire regulations does not work. In 1998 the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act was enacted. The legislative framework we have today mandates all local authorities to draw up a five-year plan for Traveller accommodation. This legislation is patchy and, according to many Travellers, has resulted in no real change. For many years, the Traveller community has been calling for a housing watchdog in co-ordination with all agencies responsible for housing the Traveller community. We in Fianna Fáil support the setting up of this housing agency. The majority of the board would be Travellers in order to provide suitable accommodation for Travellers throughout this State. Improving Travellers' accommodation must be a priority for all parties. Some fire safety works have taken place in local authorities for Traveller accommodation rights. The absence of smoke alarms, the danger posed by multi-unit accommodation and the dangers of fire all need to be urgently addressed. I ask the Minister to make sure that every local authority carry out safety procedures on these factors for the Traveller community. Fianna Fáil proposes a national building inspectorate, as opposed to the assigned certificate system. I have massive concerns about the certificate system, which I believe does not address the issue. A building inspectorate, much like the national car test, NCT, system, with dedicated specialist staff monitored by the local authority, would be more cost-effective. I welcome the €9 million the Government has planned to go into Traveller accommodation. However, I heard the Minister a few weeks ago address the matter of local authorities not using their Traveller accommodation funding but sending it back over the years. The Minister needs to address this issue because at the end of the day, he is accountable to every local authority. I want to make sure this €9 million is put to the best use for the Traveller community because we must make sure that nothing like that fire ever happens again in this country. I welcome the extra money and the fact that fire safety is now an issue in the Traveller community.

I also welcome all the guests to the Visitors Gallery. I have no difficulty with the Minister's report. I have read it in detail. In the recommendations he has short-term, medium-term and long-term objectives, which is clearly strategic and makes absolute sense. The report is based on resources and practical things can be done, with which I have no difficulty. I want to spend my time talking about the Traveller accommodation issue in its broadest sense. I have come to the Seanad from a local authority. I commiserate because I was around on the very night that massive inferno took place in Carrickmines, in the local authority of which I was an elected member. However, it is the same local authority that is on record as opposing Traveller accommodation. I do not like to say it to the Minister, but he is a leading member of the Fine Gael Party, and Fine Gael councillors put out publicity and literature during the last general election campaign opposing Traveller accommodation. I know that does not sit comfortably with the Minister, because he is an innately decent person driven to deliver the policies, but that is the reality and it goes for most parties. They constantly oppose Traveller accommodation. There is nearly an incitement to hatred in some of the language used. I am amazed it has not been pursued as a hate crime because it is really irresponsible of any politician to talk in such derogatory terms and to frustrate and oppose the provision of Traveller accommodation. The big problem I see is that the county managers and chief executives, by their nature, wheel and deal to get things done. I say that in the best sense of the term. I also see the pressure mounted by elected representatives, who call themselves democrats, and community representatives who oppose Traveller accommodation. I am encouraged by a sentence in the Minister's contribution in which he talked about specific Traveller accommodation to address the specific needs of Traveller communities. He has acknowledged that, which is good and I welcome it. However, how can we progress the matter? It is not acceptable that we have a large number of caravans crammed into very tight sites.The question must be asked as to why they are on very tight sites in the first place. The reason is because the local authorities have not been able to get the cross-party political support, on the ground, to deliver Traveller accommodation. This issue needs to come back centrally into the Minister's Department, and there needs to be quarterly reports on his website, not the local authorities' websites. We know they have failed to deliver on appropriate, safe, good accommodation and sites. The work, trade and pursuits of Travellers must also be acknowledged, be they involved in horses, metalwork, crafts or mechanics. These are the things they want to do, that give them access to work and a meaningful day. That also has to become part of the overall view of what we are looking for in appropriate accommodation for Travellers' needs. If I can leave the Minister with one message it is that he needs to bring the matter centrally back into his Department. He needs to bring out quarterly reports on how councillors are delivering other accommodation programmes. Consider Dún Laoghaire west pier. There are four caravans facing the easterly winds with a timber lattice around them because nobody will provide appropriate accommodation for the needs of a family that has been there for 25 years. That is the reality of a situation in Dún Laoghaire which is a very affluent part of the world and it is happening on the watch of all parties. The issue needs to be taken back centrally and we need to have quarterly deliverables. We need to have people asking councils why they are failing, why they are not doing it, where they are not delivering on it. It is not enough for people they have washed their hands of the Customs House or that they have washed their hands of this into the local authorities. The Minister needs to take control. I appeal to him to go back to his parliamentary party and to issue a circular to councillors that he knows and works with to tell them of their responsibilities, that they must respect and acknowledge the dignity of Travellers in the political literature and in the councillors' language and discourse. Unless we change councillors' attitudes - that goes for all of us - we are not going anywhere. I would ask that the Minister puts on record with the membership of his party, where he stands and what he expects of them.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	61	It is one year since the Carrickmines tragedy and it is important to have this debate to let all views be heard across the House. One year ago it was a very human tragedy when ten lives were lost on a halting site in Carrickmines. It was a very real tragedy that affected not only that family but the wider Traveller community also. To be fair to the Minister and his officials, they have outlined the immediate steps that were taken at that time. I have listened carefully to the Senator and he is right. I say that as a Fine Gael representative. There are councillors in our party who have actively campaigned against Travellers' rights and entitlements but that goes for every party also. We need to show leadership and the Senator is right to raise that issue. These are the issues that we do not talk about, unfortunately, a lot of the time. This House should take a step forward in showing leadership on the wider Traveller accommodation issue. A consequence of last year's tragedy was a real reminder about standards and the ability of local authorities to carry out their obligations as housing authorities. Reference was made to funding, and the Fianna Fáil spokesperson spoke about the drawdown of funding. It is a fact that approximately 80% of funding for Traveller accommodation of the last ten years was drawn down and 20% was handed back. There are reasons for that and it is important we look at that to analyse why the full drawdown is not occurring. It is quite obvious to me, and Senators have alluded to it, that there are local issues where local authorities are the housing authority and elected members oppose the establishment of Traveller accommodation in their local electoral areas and that needs to be addressed. I recognise that Traveller representative groups are looking for a national Traveller accommodation forum or committee that would allocate housing. It is my personal view that I am unsure this is the right way to go. It could cause further division between local authorities and when allocations happen. I believe it is about building capacity and confidence within the local authority system, but that cannot be done unless there is some element of sanction or accountability for local authorities. If we are to be honest about it, since the Traveller accommodation committee was established some local authorities have been successful and some have been deplorable. There are reasons for that. It is very unfair to point the finger at Travellers. They are a minority and want further inclusivity, with which I believe we should all agree. I recall when I was a member of a local authority putting my neck on the line in my local authority area and saying to members that certain Travellers needed to be accommodated. There was some kickback on that electorally and, I will be honest, some of my electorate disagreed with me. I probably suffered a little for that view. Travellers genuinely need housing accommodation or accommodation to suit their requirements to a high standard. Last week the Department made recommendations for local and national levels. I shall not go over them again as they are on the public record. It is an obligation on local authorities, as housing authorities, not only for social housing tenants but also for Travellers, to ensure people who have a need in their respective areas are accommodated to the standard that, at the very least, ensures fire safety and meets accommodation needs. I acknowledge the increased funding for Traveller accommodation in the 2017 budget, but it is not just about providing money. There are deeper issues that must be resolved by Traveller representative groups, Travellers and communities engaging together, sitting around the table and building confidence and capacity within communities. It should not be about them and us. That is part of the problem. I return to the issue, as outlined by the other Senators, of public leaflets being put out by some people. It is unacceptable for Fine Gael representatives to do that and I say this as a Fine Gael Senator. It is unacceptable for any representative to do so. We should all show leadership with regard to our obligations and needs. The Minister can only do so much. He provides the policy, the framework and the funding and that has been put in place. He has directed local authorities and he has provided the audit of all local Traveller accommodation sites, be they unofficial or official. The record speaks for itself, but now we need to follow through. The Traveller accommodation committees throughout the State need a national review. The Housing Agency has a role to play in this regard as an independent body that can give independent oversight to how successful those committees are. We need to be very frank about where the barriers are. Some people will cite anti-social behaviour and other issues, but that is as much evident in the settled community as in the Traveller community. Many of us are experienced representatives and we have represented all sectors of society and that is the way it should be, but anti-social behaviour happens as much in a settled community as it does with Travellers. It must be acknowledged that there are a few - a minority - who give the Traveller community a bad name. That is where the confidence building issues need to be built on. We need to have further engagement with communities. We need the local authorities on the ground to engage, face to face, with Traveller representatives and need to bring them forward to community representatives and work together to provide high standards of accommodation. The funding is there and it has been proved in the past ten years that only 80% of the funding has been drawn down. There are deeper, underlying issues about which we all need to be honest and upfront. Senators have referred to these issues. With regard to local representatives, we speak in this House about local councillors, their increased workload and mandate. This is a very fundamental mandate for councillors. Why should we hand it back to a central Department and bureaucrats. Councillors should take this on board and stand up four-square. It is a responsibility, regardless of whether they like it. I know that councillors elect Senators to this House, but it is a responsibility they need to deal with on the ground and on which they need to show leadership. It is only by taking that route that it will work. By taking it away from local communities and councillors we are allowing them to abdicate that responsibility. I do not believe that is the answer. The Minister needs to have a national oversight and overview, provide the framework, the policy and the funding. Ultimately it is down to the housing authorities, supported by their local elected representatives, of all parties and none, to provide that accommodation. Until that leadership happens, with the leadership in the Traveller community, unfortunately we are not going to resolve many of the outstanding issues.

An rud is uafásaí ná gur tubaiste é a d'fhéadfadh stop a bheith curtha leis. Tá fadhb na tithíochta i measc an Lucht Siúil aitheanta leis an páirtí seo againne le fada an lá. Faraor, ní go dtí gur tharla an tragóid seo go chuir an Rialtas an méid sin suime sa scéal. Tá fáilte mhór roimh ár gcairde anseo inniu ón bPobal Siúil agus tá súil agam go mbeimid ag obair as lámh a chéile as seo go ceann i bhfad go bhfeicfidh muid réiteach ar an gcás scannalach seo. The report is dedicated to the ten people who perished in Carrickmines and we should dedicate this debate and our actions in this area to Willy Lynch, Tara Gilbert and their daughters, Kelsey and Jodie, Thomas and Sylvia Connors and their children, Jim, Christy and six month old Mary, as well as Jimmy Lynch, a brother of Willy, because this humanises the tragedy that brought all of this into stark focus.  As a community, Travellers continue to endure some of the worst and most overcrowded living conditions in Ireland. In the past seven years, funding for Traveller accommodation has been cut by 93%, from €70 million in 2008 to €4.3 million this year. A total of 1,536 Traveller families are living in overcrowded or unsafe conditions and many Travellers do not have access to basic facilities such as sanitation, water and electricity. Travellers fare badly in all key indicators of disadvantage, including employment, poverty, health, infant mortality, life expectancy and education. At the root of all these problems are the levels of prejudice, discrimination and social exclusion experienced by these citizens.  A total of 34 Travellers have been criminalised under legislation, namely, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, which allows the Garda to move families on demand and without notice. Failure to comply with such a demand may result in a heavy fine or term of imprisonment. This in itself constitutes a major human rights violation. Little consideration has been given to the cultural values of Travellers when providing accommodation. As a result, much of this accommodation has not been designed in a way that meets Travellers' specific needs. In addition, some current Traveller accommodation programmes do not meet basic standards. For too long, bigotry and discrimination have been allowed to hinder the provision of Traveller accommodation. We must ensure that funding for Traveller accommodation is used and the provision of homes for the Traveller community is no longer allowed to be used as a political football. In that regard, I concur with many of the points made by Senator Coffey. It is appalling, for example, that the Mayor of Galway, who is a member of the Traveller action programme committee, is also canvassing in opposition to Traveller accommodation in certain areas of the city. It beggars belief that an elected representative is engaging in such an appalling practice. Public representatives must show leadership and engage in proper consultation at local and national level to ensure the problem is alleviated.  The report was commissioned in the wake of the Carrickmines tragedy. I note from the introduction that co-operation took place between statutory agencies, local authorities and the Travelling community and I hope such co-operation continues on the work that will need to be done to find a permanent solution.  There are fears the report will be used as another excuse to evict people from sites or in circumstances that are not acceptable. These fears need to be addressed. The report is a starting point or roadmap, not an end in itself, and it must not be viewed as putting the matter to rest. Carrickmines was the result of a legacy from the foundation of the State.  The report gives a qualified welcome, as I do, to the measures carried out in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy. There is, however, much more to be done and Sinn Féin has argued for more to be done for a long time. In our most recent alternative budget, instead of tax cuts for the well-off, we proposed significant investment to provide adequate, secure and culturally appropriate accommodation for Travellers. We are committed to restoring the Traveller accommodation budget to the 2008 level of €40 million. We would achieve this by increasing the current allocation by €36 million in 2017. Sinn Féin also had Traveller accommodation at the heart of our Better for Housing document, which will underpin our housing policy when we are in government. My party is often accused of not making positive recommendations. Our proposals include the introduction of a Traveller ethnicity Bill; front-loading of funding to local authorities with a good track record of drawing down funds and delivery of Traveller accommodation and penalties for local authorities which refuse to build necessary Traveller accommodation; reform of all legislation that penalises Traveller culture and ways of life; the introduction of amending legislation to make the Traveller accommodation programme a mandatory consideration on an application for planning permission; empowerment of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committees to take charge of the provision of Traveller accommodation with an annual budget and targets; the establishment of an all-Ireland programme for provision for nomadism in co-operation with all local authorities in the Six Counties and Twenty-six Counties; incorporation of local development plan zoning objectives with provisions of the Traveller accommodation programme, especially for the use of temporary or transient halting sites; prescribing that the use of land as a transient halting site for a specified number of weeks per annum should be as an exempted development; bringing the development of private halting sites within the "open for consideration" or "acceptable" categories under agricultural zoning; using external mediation of disputes where Traveller and settled communities come into conflict over Traveller accommodation issues; and developing a broader, meaningful Traveller-settled community reconciliation process. As for the report, there are concerns about carbon monoxide alarms not being installed. This is vital because most Traveller accommodation is not linked to a service provider such as the gas network and many housing units rely on solid fuel burners or appliances run off gas canisters. All of this occurs in a confined space where ventilation may be a problem. This issue needs to be tackled immediately because unlike in the case of fire, there will be no prior warning of a build-up of this lethal gas. Access to Traveller sites for emergency vehicles was identified as a problem, albeit one that could be solved through a ministerial order to the local authorities to improve access from public roads and remove barriers that may impede access for emergency vehicles. Urgent action is needed on this point.  The issue of electrical connections appears to be the most urgent matter. In 62% of the sites assessed, a requirement to carry out remedial works was identified and the use of multiple adaptors was also identified as an issue. It is important that this and other reports not be used as a mechanism for seeking changes in accommodation arrangements. Sinn Féin wants to see the fire safety appraisals and any resultant fire safety enhancement works undertaken in partnership with the relevant Traveller community. Current legislative enforcement provisions must not be invoked as part of this process to try to effect change.  The reason for the long delay in implementing many of the recommendations is the substantial reduction in funding for Traveller accommodation. In addition, as has been noted by certain local authorities, there is a reluctance to draw down and utilise the money available to provide proper and safe accommodation. In one incident in County Dublin, local councillors actively campaigned through leaflets not to have a site used for accommodation, while ostensibly claiming that the proposed scheme would have been a waste of money.  Even when moneys are allocated for Traveller accommodation, for example, the €4.3 million allocated under the watch of Senator Paudie Coffey when he was the Minister of State with responsibility for Traveller accommodation, no moneys were allocated to many local authorities, including Carlow, Cavan, Donegal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, South Dublin, Galway, Laois, Leitrim, Louth and Mayo County Councils and Galway City Council. Many of these council areas have long waiting lists for Traveller accommodation.  In Galway, we see very little activity but hear much talk about Traveller accommodation. While I welcome the project under CENA to develop a halting site, compared with the group housing initiative under CENA in County Offaly, the project in Galway is very slow to be developed and the halting site proposed under the council's Traveller accommodation policy appears to have gone by the wayside. Sinn Féin would, as I indicated, immediately tackle these issues by front-loading funding to local authorities with a good track record of drawing down funds.  While it was great that so many parties adopted a united position in the wake of the Carrickmines tragedy and that the report was published, there is a need to match rhetoric with action, which means confronting those who hold anti-Traveller bias in council chambers at local authority level and in the community. Nothing will change unless it is made known to these people that they can no longer block progress. The polite protestations of certain politicians that some areas are more suitable than others for Traveller accommodation is a cowardly retreat into seat-saving and renders the holding of political office as nothing more than self-preservation.  Tá an t-am istigh. Fáiltím roimh an tuairisc ach, i ndáiríre, an scéal mór atá anseo ná an easpa gníomhaíochta maidir le tithíocht agus cóiríocht fheiliúnach don Lucht Siúil. Caithfear aghaidh a thabhairt air sin. Tá muide ag tiomáint chuige sin agus tá súil againn go gcuirfidh an Rialtas, in ómós do na daoine a cailleadh an t-am seo an bhliain seo caite, beart de réir briathar sa cheist seo ar fad.

I extend a warm welcome to the visitors in the Visitors Gallery who have travelled especially to be present. Some of them live with the daily reality of what we are discussing. On 27 September on the Order of Business I read out the names of the ten people who had tragically died in the Carrickmines fire and called on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to prioritise the issue of overcrowding on halting sites and respond to mounting international and moral pressure for action. I am glad that the Minister has come before the House to respond to these matters of life and death. Will the measures outlined in the report by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management prevent more unnecessary and tragic deaths?  Local groups have acknowledged that work has been done, as the Minister outlined. The consensus is that Travellers are still not safe in their homes. The response to Carrickmines needs to go much further and beyond fire alarms and fire blankets. We must tackle the underlying causes like chronic overcrowding. Until such time as that is addressed many halting sites are unsafe places for men, women and children.  The national directorate's Report on Programme to Review and Enhance Fire Safety in Local Authority Provided Traveller Accommodation noted that "protecting people from the dangers of fire is particularly challenging in the confined and cramped conditions that families living in caravans or non-standard accommodation may find themselves". This challenge is compounded by overcrowding. In the report separation distances were identified as an issue of concern in 57% of sites. The number of families forced to share accommodation has increased from 663 in 2013 to 862 in 2015 and 534 families live on unauthorised sites. That translates into more than 4,000 men, women and children. Such overcrowding is a direct result of policy failures and neglect. The State has a duty of care to Travellers and that duty has not been fulfilled. Successive Governments have failed to provide and continue to fail to provide adequate housing and accommodation for Travellers. It is not just me who says so, it is not just Irish Travellers who say so and it is not just the Traveller groups that say so. The eyes of the world are on us and on the way we treat Travellers. The eyes of the world are not going away. In the past year we have had two landmark judgments. One came from the European Commission of Social Rights, a body of the Council of Europe, and the other from the European Commission. Last May, a collective complaint, that is a form of class action, was taken against Ireland by the European Roma Rights Centre, supported by the Irish Traveller Movement, to the European Committee of Social Rights. The landmark judgment found that the Government has violated Travellers' rights in five respects under the social chapter. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted the findings on 5 October. How does the Minister plan to put into effect changes in policy and practice in the light of those findings? Some key grounds were cited - the insufficient provision of accommodation for Travellers; that many sites are in inadequate condition; and, that there are inadequate safeguards for Travellers threatened with eviction. The committee noted that of the 1,000 transient bays identified as needed in a 1995 taskforce report there are only 54 in existence and not all function as proper transient sites.  The second judgment came in recent weeks from the European Commission Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers, and gender equality, and threatened infringement proceedings against Ireland for its treatment of Travellers. Officials from the Commission are here this week to discuss the matter. I am interested in hearing the Minister's response to the European Commission's inquiries. The damning remarks from the European bodies have been echoed by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. Is the Government listening now? I fear not when we examine the actions of recent Governments. The budget for Traveller accommodation will be a welcome €9 million next year, but it was €40 million in 2008. That means there has been a 92% cut between 2008 and 2014. I ask the Minister to name another group that has suffered a 92% cut in funding support during the financial crisis. Let us remember that there was no Traveller in the Cabinet when the country went bust. There was no Traveller on the boards of our banks when they went bust. For those who might accuse me of going off topic, I am not. Recent Governments have used the cry of the crisis to cut funding for Traveller accommodation and supports disproportionately and unfairly. As a result, we have halting sites that are death traps. No one deserves to live in such circumstances and no one deserves to die like the people who died at the Carrickmines site. At the same time the Government cut funding some local authorities, as mentioned by other Senators, underspent their Traveller accommodation budgets to the tune of 36%. That was at a time when thousands of Travellers were in need of support. This amounts to a damning dis-investment by the State in the Traveller community that has had a devastating effect.  I say to the Minister that in our home city of Cork there is a halting site in Blackpool called Spring Lane that was built for ten families but now houses 30. Many families remain without water or toilets, some families continue to live in old damp mobile homes and all of the families live with overcrowding on a daily basis. Even though almost 100 children live on the site they have nowhere to play. We know that there is a direct relationship between the quality of housing and health and safety. Traveller infants are 3.6 times more likely to die than infants in the general population. The suicide rate among male Travellers is 6.6 times higher than in the general population.  Last week I spoke to a friend who works in the Traveller health service and she told me that there had been three deaths by suicide in Cork in the past few weeks. In 2008, life expectancy for Traveller men was 15 years shorter than for settled men and a decade shorter for women. As we all know, ten people died in the fire that triggered the report. We are shaving decades off people's lives by not providing them with adequate and safe homes. Every day Travellers experience marginalisation, discrimination and racism due to their ethnicity. It is time to respect this distinctive culture that can be traced back to at least Tudor times. A core part of the Traveller culture is expressed through housing. Living in a caravan and moving about is an integral part of Travellers' ethnic identity that was superbly explored in the recent RTE television series called "John Connors: The Travellers". We must recognise and provide for their identity. As the European Commission noted, Travellers are the most marginalised community in Ireland, yet two weeks ago in the Dáil a criminal justice Bill was supported and proceeded to Committee Stage without a distinct reference being made to their ethnic minority status. Their status is not recognised by the State and, therefore, will not benefit from automatic inclusion in the proposed Bill. For me, this is a matter of conscience and rights. The current situation is intolerable and shameful. Urgent meaningful action is required to remedy the situation for Travellers in Ireland. The Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness - Rebuilding Ireland is a commendable and ambitious plan, but it is short on specifics in respect of Traveller accommodation. The plan commits to having an expert independent review by the Housing Agency, which is needed, but it does not reference or recognise the scale of the issue that needs to be addressed. Travellers need to know when overcrowding will end, how much will be spent on Traveller accommodation, when, by whom and where. Will the Minister confirm that the promised review mentioned in the Rebuilding Ireland action plan will, at a minimum, reinstate Traveller accommodation funding to the 2008 level of €40 million? A budget of €9 million is going in the right direction but it is not enough. I ask the Minister to increase the provision of appropriate resourcing of accessible, suitable and culturally appropriate accommodation, to support Traveller nomadism with well managed and serviced transient sites and to introduce a moratorium on evictions. Given that there have been successive failures of leadership and political will at local level, I ask him to consider creating new independent national Traveller accommodation. We must never again lose ten Irish citizens to fire like we did in Carrickmines. We must respect Irish Travellers in words and deeds. We can and must end the marginalisation of Travellers. We must end the causes of early death and ill health whether it is mental or physical. We must end overcrowding through properly resourced housing. We owe this to the ten people who died in Carrickmines last year. We owe this to the thousands of Irish Travellers desperate for a decent home and life. We owe this to ourselves to make Ireland a country that cherishes us all equally and we owe it as an explanation to a world that is watching.  I thank the Minister for listening and look forward to his response.

I respect the fact that the last speaker spoke with great passion and commend her for her speech. I want to divide my time into two sections. First, I will talk specifically about the report that the Minister has brought to us. Second, I shall talk on the broader issue. I welcome the report. I appreciate that the Minister and the other people involved in its compilation have done a lot of work. Having said that, there are obvious deficiencies.Will the Minister respond to some of these points in his reply? As only 42% of remedial steps were implemented, will he explain the reason the remaining remedial steps were not implemented?  In regard to smoke alarms, 81% of accommodation units were appraised and 77% were supplied with smoke alarms. As is the norm in mainstream local authority housing - where the local authority has an input into the provision of the units - I would have thought the provision of a smoke alarm would be compulsory. I fully understand the concerns of people with regard to smoke alarms in Traveller accommodation. Will the Minister address that issue? The report states there was extensive discussion on smoke alarms and while a smoke alarm will assist in all practical senses, there is resistance to installing one and I ask the Minister to address that issue. A key recommendation is to change the code of practice under the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981 and the 2003 amending Act and I ask the Minister to implement that change. I know that the Minister has a great interest in this issue, but in his opening statement he stated the statistics here were low with "six deaths per 1 million of population." With respect, no death is acceptable. I acknowledge the Minister accepts this but that statistic, with parts of the report not implemented, means there is a great deal more work to be done.  I will now deal with the broader issue of Traveller accommodation. When I went to primary school in the Mercy school in Carrick-on-Suir, I sat alongside a Traveller in my first year, which was known as low babies. That Traveller remained in school with me up until fifth class in primary school. The family then left. They had been living in a canvass tent in the field next to the castle in Carrick-on-Suir. I wonder how that boy ever got on in life after that. What chance did he have, compared with the chances I got? I fundamentally disagree with Senator Victor Boyhan's comment that we should recentralise the responsibility for Traveller accommodation. I commend Senator Paudie Coffey for what he said. I totally agree with him when he said this was an abdication. We have 949 elected councillors. One of their responsibilities is to deal with Traveller accommodation. They must deal with the issue in the same way as they deal with other issues as elected representatives and not hand back that control to the Minister or to an official in the Department. In 2002, in my capacity in a previous job, I had an opportunity to train Traveller women for their role when they were on the Traveller accommodation committees in County Tipperary. I was a member of the council at the time. I got an insight into the issues they faced on a daily basis. Their input into the committee was extremely successful, not because of my training but because of their interest in representing their community on the committee. I met the then chairman of the council, now deceased, at a funeral and he told me about the Traveller accommodation committee meeting he had attended that day. He was bowled over by the Traveller women on the committee. I will never forget his line when he said: "I cannot handle those women." Obviously, I did not tell him that I had trained them, but it showed me that if members of the Traveller community were given an opportunity, they would engage in what we would call the mainstream. I am aware of a former councillor in Senator Paudie Coffey's county of Waterford who took up the position of chairman of the Traveller accommodation committee. When he was asked at the time why he took the position of chairman, his answer was it was to make sure there were no Travellers in his local area. He said he would keep them out of his area. If we still have that attitude, we must deal with it. The Minister has to deal with this bigotry head on. Senator Paudie Coffey also mentioned briefly but did not develop a point I will now develop regarding councils that do not spend their allocation for Traveller accommodation on an annual basis and refuse to deal with the issue. The Minister who sanctions funding for other pet projects must make it hurt if that local authority is not prepared to address Traveller accommodation. Most councils are responsible and want to deal with this issue, but there are some, to which Members have alluded, which do not want to address it and have a bigoted attitude to the Traveller community. That must stop.

I extend my sympathy to the families and people who lost loved ones and friends in the Carrickmines tragedy. I welcome the representatives of the Traveller community who are present. While the Minister has provided an outline of the €9 million for Traveller accommodation, what safeguards are in place for the councils' expenditure of this money on Traveller accommodation? It is a similar question to that asked by many others today, but I think it is the key to the matter. Does one penalise a council that does not spend its allocation? Is it feasible, as Senator Denis Landy suggested, to link it to moneys being spent on other projects? I do not know the answer but this is the nub of the matter. If what happened in previous years is a gauge, the best part of €2 million will not be spent on Traveller accommodation this year. It is a fair concern that the money will not be spent. An issue that keep recurring is whether responsibility for Traveller accommodation should remain with the county councils or, as Senator Victor Boyhan suggested, be centralised. I veer in the direction of local responsibility. As has been pointed out, responsibility should rest with the council and in the first instance, the Traveller accommodation committees, together with the chairperson, elected representatives and council staff should spend the money. I think centralisation could be a problem. Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor made a helpful and important suggestion to have a building inspectorate oversee projects and works to ensure they are done to a standard, as it is not good enough to send out a message that sub-standard work would suffice. When Senator Paudie Coffey served as the Minister of State in the previous Government, money was spent on projects in Athlone and different areas and one could see the benefits of it. These projects were respected. I call on the Minister to try to force, in whatever way possible, the spending in these communities of the allocation of €9 million.

I welcome the Minister. I also welcome the report and thank him for putting in place the machinery to it carry out because I have no doubt that lives will be saved because of the inspections and the fire safety matters that will addressed by the local authorities.We cannot have another tragedy like the one in Carrickmines. I take the opportunity to sympathise with the families at Carrickmines who suffered a great loss and tragedy. I inspected a local halting site quite recently and have to say I was not at all impressed with what I saw from either a fire safety or an accommodation point of view. I have no doubt but that the local authority will address the fire safety issues by carrying out the inspections. The local authority has assured me it has carried out those inspections and will address the shortcomings around fire safety. Like the other Senators, I too ask the Minister to address the accommodation issue. The accommodation I have seen in the halting site in my local constituency in Castlebar is inadequate and poor and needs to be addressed urgently. I am surprised to hear local authorities are sending back some of the funding that has been earmarked for Traveller accommodation over the years. I ask that the Minister address that issue. No local authority should be returning funding for the provision of Traveller accommodation to the Department. In the halting site in Castlebar I have seen the accommodation at first hand. In some areas, it was a fire trap. In some cases they had the walls painted with oil paint, which is highly inflammable. I hope the council in this case will address that issue. I acknowledge the local authority has to be invited in to do all the inspections but I hope all the inspections were carried out. I hope the Minister will address the many issues raised here about Traveller accommodation. From what I have seen, I believe it is the poorest accommodation of any group of people throughout the country. While the €9 million is welcome, it is totally inadequate to address the Traveller accommodation issue in the short term.

I thank Senator Colette Kelleher who took the initiative to call for this debate. I thank the Minister for agreeing and being here. I welcome the members of the Traveller community who are present to witness this today.  I want to focus my comments on the big challenge that faces us. Many of the issues around cutbacks to Traveller accommodation programmes, overcrowding and a lack of cohesion in checking fire safety standards are due to a lack of political leadership across the State. Let us be honest about it - it has been said today - very few elected representatives are fighting proactively in partnership with the Traveller community to facilitate the cultural rights that are important to both the Traveller community and to all of us in terms of our history. I had the privilege of being rapporteur for the justice committee in the previous Oireachtas. That committee unanimously recommended that the State recognise, not grant because it is not the State's right to grant it, the ethnicity of the Traveller people. I refer to the virus that started. In 1963 there was a Commission on Itinerancy. I want to read its terms of reference because they said it all:(1) To enquire into the problem arising from the presence in the country of itinerants in considerable numbers [Note how it refers to "itinerants", not Travellers];(2) To examine the economic, educational, health and social problems inherent in their way of life;(3) To consider what steps might be taken (a) to provide opportunities for a better way of life for itinerants,(b) to promote their absorption into the general community (c) pending such absorption, to reduce to a minimum the disadvantage to themselves and to the community resulting from their itinerant habits.No Travellers were represented on the commission which denied the ethnicity, culture and history of the Traveller people. The commission was a stain on the history of the State. It has haunted us for all the decades since. We decided that the Traveller community's history was to be denied and that it was to be absorbed into settled society and so-called civilisation. I commend Mr. John Connors and his team for the recent series on RTE. They have made a massive contribution to educating people on the real history and the real issues facing the Traveller people. Mr. Michael Collins, Ms Sindy Joyce, Ms Geraldine McDonnell and Ms Anne-Marie McDonnell, and Mr. Michael McDonagh undeniably are real leaders to the Traveller people. I will briefly go through the reasons all parties and members of our committee unanimously recommended that the State recognise Traveller ethnicity. It is massively important. It would reverse the harm done by that commission all those years ago. The remaining excuses that we identified were the likes of it not being in the best interests of Travellers, that granting Traveller ethnicity would be too costly to the State, that Traveller ethnicity is not proven, other academic reasons and the need for full consensus amongst Travellers. We saw absolutely in the evidence given to our committee that every one of those excuses was slam-dunked and rebutted completely, not least by the then Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. Those bodies are objective observers that have written extensively on this issue. The weight of academic, anthropological and sociological evidence is overwhelming. In the next while, there will be deliberations on the State recognising the ethnicity of the Traveller people. I believe that any fair and objective person who watches the documentary series laid out by Mr. Connors or who reads the all-party unanimous report that has been there for two and a half years would have to accept that this needs to happen. I thank the Acting Chairman for his patience. My final point is that we need to do this together. We need to send a collective political message. All political parties and Independents in these Houses must send a message together that the report of 1963 was a stain on the State. We need to begin a new journey together, right the wrongs, teach the history of the Traveller people in our schools and remove the denial of their history, contribution, culture and vibrancy in the State. It is not going to be easy and there are major problems to overcome. However, the recognition of ethnicity would be a massive step in that direction. I urge the Minister, with his Cabinet colleagues and others, to look at this issue and make this year - the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising - the last year in which the State denies the ethnicity of our wonderful rich cultural Traveller people.

I thank the Minister for coming. I had a speech ready but my colleague, Senator Colette Kelleher, just said it all. What she said was fantastic. I welcome the citizens of the Traveller community who are here andconvey my condolences to the families of Carrickmines. When I heard my colleague's speech, it reminded me of being born and reared in Charlemont Street. There was a halting site at the end of my street. My mother had a small shop and it was the only shop on the street that would serve the Traveller community. We got to know the Traveller community well, particularly one family with whom we became really friendly. I was a child at the time and used to play with the younger children of that family. I remember there was a fire in the caravan in which the family lived. I suppose I am only talking from my heart here, but the fire killed the mother of those beautiful four or five children and the husband was heartbroken. My colleague's speech brought back to me the devastation that family suffered. Their lives were destroyed. I welcome the report and the good work the Minister is doing. Because I believe he has a good heart, I ask him to take it as his own responsibility to look at the needs of the Traveller community and how important accommodation is. It is not much to ask. It is just a human right. That is all it is. I ask him to take on board their issues and needs. I thank him for giving me some of his time.

As such, I want to pick up on one or two themes.  I thank Senator Colette Kelleher for a very impassioned speech. I have known her for a long time and have rarely heard her speak as she did today. As such, I am certainly taking on board what she has said. I will also comment on Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn's comment. It is not often he calls for unity of purpose across political parties. Normally, I am at the sharper end of his comments. However, I agree with him on this issue. On something as fundamental as how a country treats a sector of the community, in this case the Traveller community, we should try to agree and have a real resolve to deliver what we have agreed. How can we deal with something that requires a much more comprehensive solution than has been provided to date? I will do what I can to give leadership in that regard. We will have to tease through some of those issues and it may be that we do not agree on everything. However, we will probably agree on the fundamentals. I am more than aware of what is taking place in Spring Lane in Blackpool, Cork. I have taken a personal interest in trying to resolve that issue and I am meeting the city council and others who are trying to resolve it, including the former Deputy, Kathleen Lynch. The current conditions in which families are living are not acceptable in modern Ireland. There are other similar examples in other parts of the country I am sure, but the Spring Lane issue is the one with which I am most familiar. The solutions are not easy. There have been many efforts to try to provide solutions. I tried to get involved as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We made €1 million available for Traveller community horse projects in order that we could try to put some structure on the facilitation of the Traveller community to interact with horses, which is a strong connection they have. None of that money was drawn down because we could not find political agreement. We also had real challenges in trying to find agreement within the Traveller community - let us be honest - in terms of sharing facilities and so on. Families did not want to share. Of course, leadership is needed all around from representatives and I am delighted that so many are here to listen to this debate. However, the core leadership needs to come from Government and those who have power to make decisions and allocate significant resources. We also have to give leadership at local government level. Comments were made on individual political parties. Of course, the local decision-making process has to allow people to disagree on locations and sites, but what is not acceptable is to prevent the provision of Traveller accommodation at a certain site while not having an alternative that is better and can actually provide solutions. Simply blocking solutions without having an alternative is not acceptable. When I was in Galway recently, I met a number of Traveller families who were anxious to speak to me because there is particular pressure in Galway city currently in relation to trying to find accommodation. In its absence, there are families who are simply being evicted from short-stay accommodation which is not acceptable or legal in particular areas. That is creating a lot of friction between the settled community, the Traveller community and gardaí, which is not good for anybody. This is a bigger political problem than it is anything else. We have an obligation to try to create acceptance within communities, as well as to give leadership as political parties. It is easier to do that if there is a combined approach across political parties. I hope and expect that we will have another debate when I have a little more time to go into some of the detail on some of the broader Traveller issues which have been raised here today. I was asked to focus specifically on the fire safety issues which are very current. On some of the questions as to why there has not been 100% implementation or response, there are valid reasons that is the case. In fact, the figures are a lot higher than they are in the report because the period it covers ended on 1 July. A great deal has happened since. However, there is a need for consensus building, education and awareness-raising as well as the implementation of practical measures like smoke alarms, fire blankets and so on. We need the help of representative groups for the Traveller community, many of which are represented here, to actually change approaches within the Traveller community, as well as to change attitudes within the settled community. If we can do that, we can make significant progress. My final point is on budgets. We have increased the budget significantly for next year. My understanding is that the budget was reduced because of a change in policy in order to accommodate the Traveller community through the standard social housing model to a greater extent rather than to simply allocate all money for Traveller families to Traveller-only accommodation. That switch resulted in a change of emphasis in budgets. Clearly, it has not worked. More funding is not the answer on its own given that the funding which is there already is not even being drawn down and spent. However, I accept that it is part of the equation. The commitment in a budget is, in many ways, the proof of a political commitment to get something done. That is why it is important that we have seen an increase for next year. It is also important to have a plan as to how to approach and spend the budgets that are there because the current approach is simply not working. We need to recognise that and change accordingly. I look forward to the support of other political parties if and when we decide to change the approach to get more effective results.

I acknowledge all those who have campaigned in the past weeks, months and years for this legislation on the recognition of Irish Sign Language for the deaf community. I also acknowledge the presence of pupils from Bishopstown community school. Councillor Mary Shields has brought me to many of the schools in Bishopstown in the past while. We also have students from Our Lady of Lourdes secondary school, New Ross, who have been supporting this legislation and lobbying, as all active citizens should, their public representatives on this important issue. In particular, I welcome the members of the Irish Deaf Society and the members of the deaf community to their parliament. The Bill which has been spoken about on a number of occasions will be dedicated to the memory of the McCarthy brothers. These Kerrymen who lived in Dublin died in tragic circumstances and isolated in their own community. I think we all agree with the words of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality which stated they had suffered extreme marginalisation, as do many members of the deaf community.  The best example of extreme marginalisation of those in the deaf community is to be found in an anecdote. When their advocacy funding was cut, they received a letter which informed them that they could call the Department to discuss the issue. I had to call the Department and inform it that the members of the deaf community could not call it. With much embarrassment, the Department stated they could write. The fact that they could not access their own parliament, as any other citizen accesses it, owing to the lack of legislation giving them equal rights, is a more stark example of why the Bill is necessary. When the advocacy funding was cut, we decided to organise a protest. It was, however, not to be a protest outside the Parliament, but one inside it. Needless to say, it was to be a silent protest. We asked that the members of the deaf community be allowed into the Visitors Gallery of Dáil Éireann, their parliament, and that sign language interpreters would be allowed into the Dáil Chamber to let them understand what was going on. We were told it was not possible.

I like to give praise when it is due. Senator Martin Conway will be happy to hear that the former Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, came out of the Chamber and assured them that their advocacy funding would be reinstated, as it should be. Nobody needs advocates more than those who cannot communicate with Parliament. That is a stark example, if it was needed, of the extreme marginalisation of the deaf community. The Bill is necessary not only for Parliament to understand why we need to treat all citizens of the nation equally but because it is a life and death issue. While we have procedures of sorts in place in emergency departments there is no requirement for health services to have in place procedures for members of the deaf community. With funding issues causing pressure across the health services, we need protocols in place and legislation that require the provision in emergency departments, other Departments and local authorities of services for members of the deaf community. I again praise Deputy Joan Burton who when Minister for Social Protection put in place a system in that Department which ensured interpreters are made available to members of the deaf community, most of whom, because of their circumstance, require social welfare assistance. How does one access social welfare assistance if one does not know one's rights? As a result of the actions of a particular Minister, this is no longer a problem area. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will be aware that we are breaching international law. Provision is made in the Good Friday Agreement for Ulster Scots, Irish Sign Language and British Sign Language. In Northern Ireland, Irish Sign Language and British Sign Language are underpinned by legislation. People have rights in regard to communicating with the state be that by way of Irish Sign Language, British Sign Language, the Irish language, English or Ulster Scots. In the South, we have ignored the international agreement we signed up to. We do not recognise Irish Sign Language even though we committed in the Good Friday Agreement to putting it on a legislative footing. When it comes to communications with Departments, modern technology allows this to happen without the need for interpreters. There are already in place systems and services that allow online interpretation. This means that a member of the deaf community who is in Dublin can interact effectively and efficiently with, say, Kerry County Council without an interpreter. I know that the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, is committed to this cause. This is not an easy issue. The Bill also crosses the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and RTE, the national broadcaster, which is another reason for the enactment of this legislation. There are guidelines in respect of the provision of sign language interpretation on our national airwaves and in regard to captions for programming. However, these are only guidelines and there is no consequences for not adhering to them. RTE, the national broadcaster, which receives hundreds of millions of euro in taxpayers' money does not even meet those guidelines for the most marginalised in our community. The most watched programme by the deaf community is not "Coronation Street" or any other soap opera such as "Emmerdale", it is "Ros na Rún" because it has captions and subtitles. What we are attempting to do by way of this Bill is ensure that members of the deaf community can understand what is going on in the outside world not only in terms of entertainment but in terms of news.  I was delighted to be at the launch of the report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality. I thank members of that committee, some of whom are members of this House, who following two weeks of hearings on this issue recommended that this legislation be supported by the Government. I also thank the Chairman, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, who recommended the passing of this Bill, which is a rare event in itself. The key point, repeatedly referenced in that report, is the "extreme marginalisation" of members of the deaf community. That is the issue we are addressing today. I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, was involved in many of the 1916 Rising commemorations. On the issues faced by the deaf community, the most quoted line from the Proclamation is "...cherishing all of the children of the nation equally". I will end on this anecdote. During the commemorative parade in Dublin of the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising, some members of the deaf community could not understand what the commentator was saying. While there were sign language interpretation for those on the streets, members of the deaf community who were at home could not understand what the commentator was saying. Again, it was a lack of understanding on the part of the hearing community of the issues faced by members of the deaf community. I hope the Minister of State will support the Bill not only on this Stage but also on Committee Stage when work in terms of amendments and necessary improvements to it will be dealt with. Fianna Fáil looks forward to its amendments in that regard being accepted and to working with the Government and various agencies to ensure the ambition of the Proclamation that all we cherish all of the children of the nation equally is fulfilled. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take the Bill. I also thank him for his support for this cause in the past few years.

I also welcome the members of the Irish deaf community and the many school children in the Visitors Gallery. That the Visitors Gallery is full shows how important the Bill is. It is an honour for me to second the Bill. I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Mark Daly, for his dogged commitment to the Bill which deals with an issue on which he has tirelessly campaigned for over six years. He brought the Bill before the House on two separate occasions during the lifetime of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government but on each occasion it was rejected. I am hopeful there will be a change of heart on this occasion and that the Bill will receive cross-party support today. I also pay tribute to the Irish Deaf Society which has been campaigning on this issue for over 30 years. As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, I was delighted to support our report which recommends the passage of the Bill. We were fortunate enough to have excellent contributions from members of the Irish deaf community who outlined to us in stark terms the hurdles facing their community when trying to access the health system, the justice system and the education system. They also outlined how transformative it would be if Irish Sign Language was recognised as a native and independent language. The contributions were all the more poignant when we learned a short time after these presentations to the committee of the tragic deaths of brothers of Daniel and William McCarthy in their own home. This illustrated the urgent need for the rights of members of the deaf community in Ireland to be officially recognised and to end the social isolation experienced by them. Recognition of the Bill and Irish Sign Language would allow members of the deaf community to play a full part in society, something we should all support and encourage.I call on all Members to support the Bill strongly.

I also acknowledge Councillor Mary Shields who, with others, has campaigned during the years. I am convinced that it will happen. I join Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee in acknowledging the contribution of Senator Mark Daly in dealing with this issue. He tabled the Bill twice during the lifetime of the previous Government and it is regrettable it did not at least reach Committee Stage because if that had happened we would be significantly down the road now. I am delighted to be able to say that on this occasion that it is third time lucky, the Government will not oppose the passing of this Bill on Second Stage. I am possibly stealing the thunder of the Minister of State, but it is widely known that it will not be opposed.

#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	99	All of my colleagues have been e-mailing like mad members of the deaf community to inform them that it will be passed on Second Stage. It was the best or worst kept secret, but it is the right thing to do and we are all here to do the right thing. This is a classic example of the new politics. People such as Senator Mark Daly and I who are on opposite sides in many debates are at one on this issue, as are the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, Sinn Féin and all of my good friends and colleagues on the Independent benches. We all want to see this happen. Yet again, Seanad Éireann has stood up to the plate to deliver something tangible which will really make a difference to the lives of well in excess of 5,000 citizens of the country who are among the most marginalised not because they do not have the intelligence, ability or focused determination which many of the rest of us possess but because society has not provided them with the equipment and the level playing pitch that facilitates equality. What society can call itself a society of equals, one that represents equals, when people cannot go to a public office and gain access to simple information on their entitlements? It is crazy. The one section of society which has been forward-thinking in this regard is educational institutions. I pay tribute to Trinity College Dublin, in particular, and other third level colleges which have done their duty to ensure people can obtain qualifications, degrees and diplomas, and have access to information. I agree with the Deputy Mark Daly that RTE is a thundering disgrace. It is shocking to think Ros na Rún is the only tangible option available to members of the deaf community simply because the captions necessary for them to watch other soap operas are not provided. This organisation has a public service obligation, but it is not honouring it for the deaf community. Everyone sees the interpretation of the news for three or four minutes before the main bulletin at night, but this is not enough. In a modern era on the eve of ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, a five or ten minute tick the box exercise by the national broadcaster is not something that should be acceptable. The Minister of State should be banging down the door every day of the week, telling RTE that it needs to get its act together and live up to its responsibilities in this regard. Then again, how can the Minister of State do this when the Bill is still on the books and not been passed? How can the Government, irrespective of what political party or creed it is, take on public bodies and point to their obligations and responsibilities when we as a House have not legislated properly and effectively to deal with it? In the previous term members of the deaf community attended the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I were proud members. They did so again this term, under the chairmanship of Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin. Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee is quite right - it was a very powerful interaction. They provided practical examples of how they simply could not connect or communicate because of the lack of availability of interpreters. The lack of a right to the availability of interpreters is frightening. There are approximately 40 or 50 qualified interpreters in the country and there is no continuous professional training available to them. All of this will have to change. I am clearly of the view that the Bill will pass not just through this House. When we put it up to them, Members of the other House will have little option but to pass it because, thankfully, we are in the era of new politics which can ensure the voices of small minority groups are heard. When the Bill is passed into law, the responsibility will very much fall on the State to put the necessary structures in place. Perhaps the young people from Bishopstown might consider doing a degree course in sign language interpretation because plenty of work will be available. The Bill must be passed and we all have an obligation to ensure it does, but it will not be easy. As Senator Mark Daly said, the work will begin on Committee Stage when the Government will outline the practical challenges and Senators will try to identify ways to overcome them. The fact that Seanad Éireann will pass the Bill on Second Stage today means that it agrees with the principle that we need to extend recognition to Irish Sign Language. This is a very good day not just for members of the deaf community who are citizens but also Seanad Éireann. I look forward to the rest of the debate and hope that within a short period we will see the Bill passed into law.

This is certainly a day of debate on justice and equality issues. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is very welcome. I commend Senator Mark Daly for bringing the Bill before the House again. It is clear that he has shown great commitment to this most important cause. The Bill is primarily about equality, ensuring equal opportunities for all citizens and I will lend it my full support. Recognition of Irish Sign Language by the State is something that should have occurred many years ago. Irish Sign Language is recognised in Northern Ireland but not in the Republic. The lack of recognition impacts on members of the deaf community in almost all of their interactions with the State, in education, health care provision and even the justice system, ultimately marginalising them. This is a matter which affects almost 40,000 citizens. Irish Sign Language is used by deaf people, their families, friends and colleagues. Members of the deaf community do not have the same access to public services as other citizens. Lack of access to Irish Sign Language in education, in particular, is a source of great concern. It impacts further on the employability of members of the deaf community. As such, many members of the deaf community feel marginalised, economically and socially. This important legislation should provide improved access for members of the deaf community to education services, benefiting, in particular, the youth and, I hope, reducing their sense of marginalisation.Within the justice system, excluding criminal court proceedings, there is no automatic right of deaf people to an Irish Sign Language interpreter. This is available in Northern Ireland but not here in the Republic. As a state, we need to be able to afford this to citizens as a basic right. Without the protections in law inscribed in the Bill, deaf people will continue to face these barriers throughout their lives. I am voting in favour of the Bill as I hope it will bring about real change and equality for the deaf community in Ireland.

I also welcome the Minister of State. I acknowledge the enormous work Senator Mark Daly has done on the matter. He has my absolute support. The campaign has been run in a very professional way. I have been amazed since my entry into the Seanad by the amount of correspondence, emails, telephone calls, very strategic canvassing, working, mobilising and exercising and advocating for this position and commend all of the people involved because that is what real democracy is about.  I thought last night of drafting a few words at my kitchen table about the Bill and prepared them. Then I came in this morning to find a letter from a 17 year old student from Waterpark in Carrigaline, County Cork. I want to share some of it with the House because it crystalises and summarises everything about this issue. Dear Senator,[I] am proudly Deaf. I am 17 years old. I go to Bishopstown Community School in Cork. My first language is Irish Sign Language (ISL) and I am using it to communicate with my friends and my family since I cannot speak. I am writing this letter to ask you to pass the law for Irish Sign Language to be recognised. I think it's extremely important that we, deaf people, have our primary language which is Irish Sign Language recognised. Deaf people have fought for the bill for Irish Sign Language to be recognised for many years. My primary language is Irish Sign Language and I love learning different ... languages such as American Sign Language. In fact, ... the United States of America have already passed the law for American Sign Language (ASL) to be recognised. [In] other countries such as Finland, Finnish Sign Language is already recognised there in 1995, 21 years ago! That was before I was ... born ... My disability doesn't stop [and shouldn't stop] me reaching my goal [and my potential]. A young woman came to visit me in my school on Thursday 6th of October ... She is a Mexican deaf person who works in the White House in America as a receptionist to Barack Obama. The first deaf receptionist. This amazes me a lot. She is an inspiration to me ... Please can you pass this bill for Irish Sign Language to be passed and recognised as a third official language? I would be extremely happy. It would end the "silent war" between deaf people and the government. This would give ... people more equality and more rights. Thank you for your time and your concern to read this letter.Why would I not read it at says it all? I urge all of us to come together and unite in support of the Bill, not only here today but also as it progresses. We can pass all the legislation and Bills we want, but I appeal to the Minister for the necessary resources and funding to give effect to them.

A part of me thinks that maybe the rest of us would be wise to shut up and not say any more because Senator Victor Boyhan was right: that letter very much said it all. I have been overwhelmed and very impressed by the level of correspondence to us in the past few weeks, not least from the students of Bishopstown. I sat down, like Senator Victor Boyhan, to write a speech to fill eight minutes. However, when I reflected on and thought about the contribution the Irish Deaf Society made at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality a few weeks ago, its representatives did not work off any notes or prepared speeches or statements. All of it came from a very sincere, personal experience. I thought I would try to do the same because of the thoughtfulness we encountered at that presentation in the committee. The presentation was very profound in its simplicity. I say that because it took a presentation and an engagement like that with the deaf community for someone like me, and I am sure many others on the committee, to realise the very basic, small and sometimes minute levels to which the difficulties faced by deaf citizens go. It is about accessing hospital care, getting into shops, what TV programmes they are able to watch and access to the courts and the criminal justice system. The range therefore goes from the macro elements that are so significant and important aspects of many of our lives right down to the mundane, day-to-day things. Senator Mark Daly who has done sterling and powerful work on this campaign referred to this important year of the centenary of the 1916 Rising and the challenge that era and the Proclamation throw down to us to fulfil the aspirations contained in it that we cherish all the children of the nation equally and that we afford rights and equality to all citizens. That is what the Bill and this issue is about. It is as simple as that. It is about human rights, equality of access, equality of service, equality of aspiration and equality of ability. Reflecting on it from a personal perspective, I was trying to relate to the difficulties and the issues faced by deaf citizens. While Irish Sign Language and British Sign Language are legislatively recognised in the North, the Irish language, which is the language in which I was brought up and educated, is not afforded those legislative or legal protections. While I have the luxury - when one listens to the issues faced by members of the deaf community, it is a luxury - of being able to communicate in a second language, I do relate to the issue of not being recognised or not being afforded the same rights or entitlements based on something so personal to someone; something so deep-rooted in someone; something so simple; something that is in the first instance merely a form of communication; and something used as a tool to share one's passions, concerns, fears and love. It is as simple as that and that is all people want and that they deserve, as modest and simple a request as it is. Therefore, I commend the motion which has my full support and that of Sinn Féin. Senator Victor Boyhan made a critical point when he said we could pass all the Bills we wished. I do not doubt the sincerity of all the contributions that have been made and will be made in the time ahead, but this needs to be resourced. It needs the adequate resources to go alongside it to ensure we have not just wasted everyone's time here today; that the students, in particular those from Bishopstown who have joined us today, can take a degree of hope and faith when they leave this Chamber today; that we, as the second House, the Upper House of the Oireachtas, will work on their behalf and will stand up diligently for their rights and entitlements; and that the Bill, while in one aspect a culmination of a campaign, is I hope just the first step on another journey, that is, a journey of the deaf community having full rights, full entitlements and full recognition by the State.

Are we committed to the inclusion of people with disabilities or are we merely paying lip service to it? It is right and proper that we meet the needs of these vulnerable people. Currently, we have over 5,000 users of Irish Sign Language in the State and it is fair that public services provide them with interpretation services when questions of statutory entitlement are at issue. What do we mean by inclusion? We mean that all people with all types of disabilities are part of our society. However, living in the community is not enough. People with disabilities have the same right to participate fully in society if they choose. Without access to language, many people with hearing impairments do not have that choice. People with disabilities have a right to competence and have a right to any adaptations they need to show that competence. Above all, people with disabilities have the right to the same dignity and respect as every other citizen. Our accomplishment as a society is measured by the extent to which people with disability achieve those rights. Recognising Irish Sign Language as the third official language of the State would render our society far more equal than it is now. The Bill is important not just for people with hearing impairment. Like the marriage equality Bill, the Bill is about our maturity as a society. It is about our growing ability to embrace diversity. It is about equality. It is good for all of us. I am happy and proud to support it. I thank all those who contacted me and others so respectfully and so appropriately over the last number of weeks, especially the lovely notes that came from the students of Bishopstown community school. I also received the same letter as Senator Victor Boyhan and I have to admit it was an eye-opener.  Before I conclude and give Senator Jerry Buttimer a few minutes of my time, I have to say I think the students in Bishopstown school should have at least a week off school, or if not that, perhaps a week off homework.

This is a very important day. On Monday I had the pleasure of visiting Cork Deaf Enterprises in Ballinlough in Cork city and of speaking with the men and women of the deaf community in order to listen and understand better the struggle and the difficulties they encounter but, more importantly, that they overcome and can celebrate in the lives they live. Our job, as legislators and as Members of this House, no matter what our political ideology or hue, is to try to make life better for all citizens. As Members have referenced, it is about equal access and about working with the Government rather than the Government working against this. The important point today is that this House will not be divided and, from what I gather, we will all support the Bill. We are fortunate that in the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and before him, the former Minister of State, Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, we have people who understand the impact of disability and the importance of working together to bring change, as members of political parties or otherwise. I invite Members to visit Cork Deaf Enterprises and to talk to the people in Bishopstown community school who have been pioneers over many decades in highlighting and in bringing change for members of the deaf community. As Leader of the House, I know that it is important that we understand this legislation is not perfect. I commend Senator Mark Daly for his work in the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality. We must ensure we use this day, not as the beginning or the end, but as a staging post on the road to what we all want to see, namely, recognition of Irish Sign Language and making life better for all citizens in order that we can all enjoy and celebrate life.

I commend Senator Mark Daly for the fantastic work he has done at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on the issue of the Irish Sign Language Bill and in bringing the legislation forward. As I was not aware of this, I appreciate the education I received on this issue at the committee. I was initially appalled when I realised Irish Sign Language was not officially recognised in this country, despite the fact the deaf community use it on a daily basis to communicate with their loved ones, educators, statutory agencies and advocators. As I have said before and will say again, we are judged in this country by how we treat our fellow citizens. It is a disgrace that, in 2016, the nation does not recognise Irish Sign Language. It is imperative that we ensure Irish Sign Language receive the full recognition it deserves and that those who use it get full and equal access to information via Irish Sign Language. No child in this country should suffer at school due to the lack of teachers qualified in Irish Sign Language. We want to build a nation of well educated young people, regardless of the barriers that are in front of us. Every person who engages with Government bodies on a daily basis has a right to receive information in a way they understand and can use to communicate. It is rare that Irish Sign Language is made available in Government and statutory agencies. Senator Mark Daly has brought up the issue and we should not shy away from wanting to provide this service. By doing so, we are embracing social inclusion and equality for the deaf community. Senator John Dolan makes his apologies for not being present today because he is away in Brussels. He is working tirelessly to ensure the Government ratifies the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. To use one's own language is an important human right. The convention mentions sign language in its five articles. We should do the right thing and ratify the convention and recognise Irish sign language officially. The European Parliament has passed two resolutions calling on member states to recognise their respective national sign languages but only five EU countries have done so - Denmark, Finland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom We have not been shy in implementing what Europe has asked us to do in the past, so why have we stalled on this for such a long time? The cross-community groups of deaf-related organisations should be commended for their outstanding campaign, and we have received lovely letters in the past few weeks. We should also commend the councillors in counties Donegal and Limerick who voted to have Irish Sign Language recognised at a national level. As elected representatives, we have a duty to tear down the barriers and make equality of opportunity a national right by implementing the Bill. We will be on the right side of history for the deaf community in Ireland. If we get Irish Sign Language recognition, this will ensure more legal rights for Irish Sign Language users, better access to public services, better education for deaf children, better third level education and training for deaf adults and better interpreting, quality and monitoring. We have nothing to fear from this and we should embrace it.

I am delighted to be here on the second or third occasion it is debated and hope to see it passed. I also thank Dr. John Bosco Conama and everyone from the Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College Dublin for their work on the Bill and their ongoing dedication to fighting for equality for the deaf community. For the approximately 5,000 deaf people in Ireland, the lack of language recognition has had the effect of ingraining discrimination into their everyday lives. It has exacerbated the problems of isolation for most. We saw earlier this year a court in County Donegal proceed with a case when the defendant was deaf and had no interpreter present.We would be up in arms about that situation if it happened to one of our citizens facing court proceedings abroad where they did not understand the native language. Here we allow such an obvious violation of a person's human rights to take place. Unfortunately, there are those inequalities throughout the State, in the health system and education services. The incredibly sad deaths of Daniel and William McCarthy earlier this month, tragically brought to the fore the extent of the social isolation endured by members of the deaf community. I have spoken about this recently in Trinity College Dublin and feel the need to say it again as a community development worker. If someone like a community development worker never made the effort to communicate at all with those two brothers, in their very small community of Bluebell, what chance do others have? Their own community services did not recognise them. People who have disabilities are more likely to experience income poverty than the rest of society. Among the deaf community the statistics speak for themselves. People who are deaf have significantly lower employment expectations with only 40% in employment, well below society's average. Those who are employed are likely to be paid low wages, they are significantly less likely to go to college and in many cases have low life expectancy. As it stands, service providers are under no obligation to recognise sign language. Children who are deaf do not have the right to education through Irish Sign Language. There are no automatic rights to interpreters and the Government has continuously failed to recognise the rights of children who are deaf, under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Under Article 2 of the convention, children are entitled to access all the rights of the convention without discrimination. In Ireland, however, children who are deaf are being indirectly discriminated against as they are not guaranteed access to the curriculum through the medium of Irish Sign Language, their first language. This means that the child cannot always fully participate in and benefit from education, that his or her language and cultural needs are unmet and that he or she is hindered in achieving educational outcomes on a par with his or her hearing peers. Ireland is just one of three countries in Europe yet to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability. The Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, has given a commitment to address this and I hope he will do so without delay in order that Ireland can join the other 167 countries that have ratified the convention. Hearing people need to shift their focus from thinking of deafness as a purely medical phenomenon and we need to attempt to understand that there is a culture and a language that we have ignored and that deafness becomes problematic because of the discrimination inflicted by society. If Irish Sign Language is viewed as a minority language rather than as a disability, it will help us to understand it better. When people who are deaf gather together, for example in the deaf village in Cabra, there is no communication barrier and no discrimination. It is only when they leave that setting that their language becomes a problem or a disability because we have not catered for their inclusion. We make their language a disability. It is perhaps because those 5,000 people are spread across the State they have not been a powerful enough lobby group to make politicians care about their issues, but that should not be our motivation. We should be motivated to do the right thing. Suppressing their right to self expression is an attack on their human rights. We need to stop discriminating against these citizens and ensure they are given the same rights as everyone else. The lack of language recognition has led to the disempowering of one of the most socially excluded groups in the country. We have the chance now to take a stride forward by recognising Irish Sign Language and by ensuring all children who are deaf have access to education through sign language. We should also be teaching basic sign language to hearing children at school. This could have huge long-term benefits in terms of social inclusion for the deaf community. I welcome the Bill. The Civil Engagement group and I will be voting in favour of Irish Sign Language recognition. I urge all of our colleagues to do so too.

I also welcome those from the deaf community who join us; the young people and the signers who are interpreting for those in the Visitors Gallery. Sometimes in this Chamber one knows something special is about to happen because of the attendance of Senators, the Visitors Gallery is full and because there is something in the air. In view of the campaign which was undertaken by those who feel passionately about this, there is something in the air. This issue is about silence, empowerment and citizenship. If the Leas-Cathaoirleach will allow, I shall speak directly to the young people here who have been mentioned by other Senators. Often it is very difficult to stand up for oneself, but it can be even more difficult to stand up for others. If you were here earlier, you would have heard a conversation in the Chamber about the Traveller community. Speakers across the House spoke about the necessity to stand up and recognise the Traveller community and do better by them. If you had been in the Chamber this morning you would have heard Senators across the House speak about the issues in Aleppo and Ireland's responsibility to do something about what is happening in Syria and to open our arms and the State to those who need us most. It has been said that when it comes to issues that you feel strongly about as young people, you should ask yourself, "If not me then who, and if not now then when?" As young people, you have taken on this issue; you have brought it to the heart of the Oireachtas and you have made all of us who walked into this Chamber this afternoon know that something special is happening. You should be absolutely commended for this and you should realise the power you have. Martin Luther King said, "Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter". Much has been said about the 1916 Rising and the commemorations. Perhaps only now are we beginning to realise the depth of the wound caused by the recession in the State, which is about eight or nine years old, and the depth of the wounds it has caused to a generation of Irish people who may know nothing else but this financial crisis. We can now reimagine the type of country in which we want to live. It is about citizenship, but how can you be a citizen if you are forced to live in silence? This is not a case of Government or politicians granting something to a section of our society, because the empowerment in these situations is very important. It is about all of us, collectively, recognising the importance of citizenship. Let us realise what is happening across the world, in the United States of America and across Europe, including the United Kingdom. Politics is turning into a section of Irish society pointing fingers and blame at others and saying the reason they are unhappy is because of that group or those people. What you are doing today is allowing people to come in and be part of the common citizenship. Often, this House and politics struggles to connect outside of these walls. What you have done and what the deaf community is asking for is to become part of that common citizenship. I contend that the system should be bending over backwards to recognise a mechanism to break the silence. The Labour Party supports the Bill absolutely. I am glad that everyone in the House, across party lines, agrees - as happened this morning with the Syrian issue and as happened this afternoon with the Travellers' rights, and is happening now with regard to Irish Sign Language recognition. It brings a level of political legitimacy to the House and also gives a message to young people, old people, citizens who are in the Chamber, on the power they have. If you really want to make a change and believe in it enough, there is nothing you cannot achieve.

A few years ago, when I served on it, I brought a similar proposal to Limerick City Council. It was one of the first local authorities in the country to pass such a proposition. I welcome all of the members of the deaf community who are here and thank them for the professional campaign they have run in the past few weeks. We have had e-mails, letters and various other contacts from people throughout the country. In Limerick, we are fortunate to have a school for the deaf in Rosbrien. I have visited it many times. The Irish Deaf Society also has offices on O'Connell Street and, as late as yesterday, I spoke to one of the people who is involved in it. I was delighted to pledge my support to the Bill because recognition of Irish Sing Language has been sought for many years. It is important the Minister of State and his Department have indicated that this is being taken seriously. We all know about equality. It is a word that we have often heard, especially in more recent times. This is about having equal rights for everyone, whether one is deaf or can hear, and the sooner Irish Sign Language is recognised as a third language the better. This concerns more than 5,000 people as well as their families, supporters and those who are working on their behalf. Many people volunteer their services in the deaf community also. I pay tribute to them all. They have been involved on a professional and voluntary basis for many years. I hope the Bill will receive unanimous support.

I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath. He has served his time having worked with those with disabilities and who are marginalised in his community and throughout the country. It was tremendous when he was appointed given he also has a watching brief at the Cabinet. This is an important day for Senator Mark Daly who has pioneered this issue for a long time. As a result of the new dispensation and new politics, we are now in a position to pass legislation, regardless of whether the Government likes it. The Government has certainly proved in the past that it was not prepared to support this legislation. The Bill was countersigned by Senators Keith Swanick and Catherine Ardagh and supported by the Fianna Fáil group in Seanad Éireann. It is a step in the right direction. Senator Mark Daly, in particular, deserves credit because he has put a lot of work into this Bill, as have members of the deaf community, including Dr. John Bosco Conama from County Roscommon. Dr. Conama who works in Trinity College Dublin has pioneered the use of sign language. We have all been proud to see him on RTE providing a service to the deaf community, particularly during the "Six One News", a programme on which he served for many years. The work he is doing is very important. It is 100 years since the 1916 Rising. It is surprising that the deaf have not been recognised in their country during those 100 years of freedom. This is an historic day for the deaf community at home and abroad and I am delighted the Oireachtas television service will broadcast these proceedings on Thursday. The Bill is comprehensive. It covers every area and will assist deaf people in their dealings with the education system and the courts, as well as other public authorities and services. To be deaf is to be in a lonely place. I have met people with different disabilities. This is a serious and profound disability, but people who are deaf have achieved an enormous amount in work as well as in serving the community. In so many ways, they have been active members of their communities. This Bill will ensure they will have a real voice in the State. I urge the Government not just to pay lip-service to this - the House might excuse the pun - but to go along with the Bill proposed by Senator Mark Daly and the Seanad. As I stated this morning, this House provides a service which is second to none. It is here that the Bill is being introduced. Without Senator Mark Daly and this House, the Bill would not have been heard of because the other House would not have time to deal with it. I welcome all participants. I have read emails and text messages. I am very impressed by an e-mail from Kate Parnell and her teacher Catherine Moran from the school in New Ross in County Wexford. Ger Boyce from the Deaf Community Centre Limerick sent a text wishing this Bill success and Anthony Griffin outlined in great detail the barriers encountered. I have known first hand the barriers deaf people face in society. As one of two hearing siblings in a deaf family, I have been communicating on behalf of my family all my life, including with banks, doctors, solicitors and Departments. This started when I was too young to be even involved in such matters, never mind understand them. I had to grow up fast and see the world for how it is at too young an age. What the Bill means to the communities present has been outlined clearly. It is a proud day for them to be here. I hope they pursue the Bill through Committee Stage to Final Stage and ensure it is enacted as quickly as possible.

I received many letters and emails also. This Bill is a great achievement and I am delighted to support it. This is all about equal rights for the members of the deaf community. In particular, I want to mention their families. These families have been there through thick and thin and fought for everything. They fought for the simple things in life. They should be commended and thanked for everything they do. Today is all about the 5,000 people in the deaf community. It is about ensuring they have equal access and equal rights. We need to ensure everyone has the chance of a proper life in society. I am, therefore, delighted to support the Bill and congratulate Senator Mark Daly.

I have known him for quite a number of years and know that he has a full and personal commitment in the area of disability. I spoke to him yesterday and he indicated his absolute support for the Bill. The last time such legislation was introduced in the House, it was defeated by three votes. I am sorry and ashamed that happened. I do not think it will happen today. I do not think there will be a single voice raised against the Bill in this House. Perhaps, therefore, it is not necessary to have a vote, although it might be good to have a vote to show the support of Seanad Éireann. This debate demonstrates the relevance of Seanad Éireann as an instrument for social change.This is very often not recognised as a fact but, as Senator Terry Leyden said, this would not have happened without Senator Mark Daly and Seanad Éireann. This is a personal initiative of Senator Mark Daly. I asked him whether the Bill was provided to him by the Irish Deaf Society. He indicated it had helped, but he constructed the Bill himself with the assistance, and this is an important innovation, of a draftsperson supplied by the Oireachtas. This will help us introduce more and more legislation. The legislation is comprehensive. I will not go into it in great detail as we can do so on Committee Stage, but I should say it needs a little updating. It speaks about the level of interpretive services and states we need 18,000 hours with a maximum of 60 hours per person by 1914. I must inform the House that 1914 is well and truly past. Last night, by coincidence, I was visiting a neighbour of mine in North Great Georges Street and I discovered that Dr. Charles Orpen who started the first school for the deaf and used sign language,lived in the house in 1816 when he was running the school. It is a curious little personal memoir. I must pay tribute to the Centre for Deaf Studies at Trinity College Dublin. Senators Lynn Ruane and Mark Daly and I spoke at a very interesting meeting there. I learned a great deal from the stories of deaf people. I could not believe that until recently sign language was more or less outlawed in educational institutions. Children had their hands tied behind their backs. This is a frightful violation of the human rights of deaf people and for that, as a hearing person, I apologise. This is really shocking. There are 5,000 deaf people and 40,000 additional people who are members of families, friends or relatives. As hearing people, we do not really think about these things, but for these people sign language is not just sign language, it is their first language. It is the language they use and the language they have. As a hearing person, this had not really struck home with me. It is astonishing that service providers such as Government agencies are not required to have interpreters. Very often we see Polish translations, Rumanian translations and even Chinese translations, but we do not have translations for our own citizens. I find this very shocking. The ways in which the people are deprived of proper access to medical services, educational establishments and social services is dreadful. It is one of the hidden crimes of this society. More than 40 local authorities have passed motions accepting this legislation. In Northern Ireland, sign language is recognised. Is this not astonishing? Here is partition again. The North has it and we do not have it. There is no automatic right for deaf people to have an interpreter in court. How astonishing that a person can be in court and not actually understand what is going on in a case being prosecuted for or against him or her. I find this quite incredible. I received a note from the students of the Holy Family School for the Deaf in Cabra. They pointed out that if they have to go to hospital or to other places, they are stranded and are isolated. They also strongly support the Bill. I received an email from a very interesting young woman in her early 30s. She has been profoundly deaf since she was eight months old. She spoke about her educational experience. She did very well at maths, but she was useless at English. The reason was perfectly simple. She had an interpreter for the maths class who was able to speak sign language. This brought her on to the level of the other students. In English class, there was no assistance, so she was trapped in a world of silence and fell behind. When people's education suffers, their job prospects and social prospects also suffer so there is a continuing deprivation. Last year a man crashed into her car. The police came but there was no interpreter. She could not understand what the garda or the other motorist were saying. Again, she was absolutely stranded. She had no possibility of a really positive interaction. I received a note from somebody who was an interpreter and pay tribute to the interpreters here today and thank them for coming here. It is splendid that Seanad Éireann provided these facilities when Dáil Éireann found it could not. This shows the flexibility of Seanad Éireann. Very often there are no interpreters at parent-teacher meetings. Interpreters cost €120 to €150, which is a lot of money for somebody on a small income. The interpreter who wrote to me has been asked to go along on a pro bono basis to help out in these circumstances. She also instanced the case of a woman whose daughter had been involuntarily put into a mental institution. The mother wanted to discuss with the doctors her continuing treatment and what would happen to her, but there was no interpreter and she could not follow it. In another case, that of a woman whose parent was dying, the doctors called a family meeting. This woman looked after the parent but there was no interpreter and she could not take part in the meeting. I pay tribute to students at Bishopstown community school. They are absolutely marvellous. I received a terrific letter from them, which was really from the heart, about the number of deaf people and the fact there is only one interpreter for every 643 people. It was signed by a couple of hundred signatures. This is wonderful. It shows the genuine decent support of ordinary people for their deaf colleagues. I very much hope the Bill will pass. It will help people like Mary, a woman who was sent at five years of age to a deaf school and came back when she was 22 to a little farm in the midlands. For four years she had no social interaction whatever until somebody who had been at the school with her invited her to a party. Her parents did not want to go because they were afraid for her safety. She went and met other young people there. All of these people will be helped by the Bill. I congratulate Senator Mark Daly and the deaf community. It is a good day for Ireland that we will pass the Bill this afternoon.

From all the stories we have heard, the current situation has led to inequality and exclusion. The 5,000 people may be a minority, but they are an important minority and I am glad the Bill is being supported collaboratively around the House. I compliment all the stakeholders who campaigned for it and Senator Mark Daly who did a lot of work on it. The objective of the Bill is to allow a large group of people to lead a more equal life in the future. I understand the Minister of State has promised legislation to ensure all public bodies provide Irish Sign Language users with free interpretation when availing of their statutory entitlements. I note the report of the Oireachtas joint committee, of which many of my colleagues were members. The work of committees, because they are cross-party, allows for the collaboration about which we are speaking. Highlighting this issue by all those involved in the campaign in the House and the various advocates, organisations and school students has been of enormous benefit because many of us did not know of the disadvantages.As a former teacher, I know that funding is in place for home tuition services for hearing-impaired preschool and schoolgoing children to provide training for them, their siblings and parents. However, from what we have heard today and the discussion on the Bill, there is now an important step to be taken and I compliment and add my voice of support for it.

From the day we came in as new Senators, he was badgering for the cause and fair dues to him. He had the top-down approach. I also commend all the pupils from Bishopstown community school and all the other schools and all the other activists who have worked tirelessly to push and promote the rights of the Irish deaf community. It is a great day to be a Member of the Seanad. It is wonderful that there will be cross-party support on this issue. The sooner the Bill is resourced and processed forward, the better for the Irish deaf community. We have Irish deaf community members among so many organisations in the country. It is about time; therefore, all I say is let us get on with the Bill as soon as possible, progress it, see it through and advance equality and society for all Irish people.

It is an issue of core principle because it is one of equality and justice and it is important that we underscore that equality. I commend all those who have already been commended, particularly Senator Mark Daly and others who have put this principle on the agenda repeatedly. During times when we have been told to roll back our ambition for society, Senator Mark Daly has said "No", that this is a core question of justice and has put the issue forward time and again. Again, I am very happy to see there is support across the House for the Bill. However, it is also a matter of taking those principles and putting them into practice. Senator John Dolan, our colleague in this group, and many of the other Senators in the Civic Engagement Group have been pushing and pressing for the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I recognise that the Minister of State has also committed now to ratifying it. The Bill is a very real example of what it means when one ratifies such a treaty. It does not just mean that one signs one's name or gets applauded. It means real resources. It means the kind of detailed, practical, actual, meaningful offers and proposals set out in such detail in the Bill. This is what happens when principle is translated into practice and I hope this will set a template for that meaningful translation of principle into practice across so many areas of disability in Irish life. I want to highlight two other specific issues on participation. Before I talk about participation, I will talk about privacy. It is all Ps for me today. Privacy is something that was spoken about very eloquently by Senator David Norris also. Communication has many functions. One of the important questions is the discretion and dignity of human beings and their ability to communicate and to have their discretion and dignity respected, not to rely on ad hoc solutions or a family member to be immediately privy to all their information and not to have people stepping in - children in many cases - as interlocutors for family members when they should not have to do so. Each person has the right to communicate as an individual person and to be facilitated in that by use of his or her preferred language, in this case Irish Sign Language, ISL. We have been read many letters - I will not recite any; others have spoken of them - in which people talked about how it compromised their privacy and dignity, for example, in medical situations, not to be able to communicate themselves as themselves. I again welcome the fact that the Bill sets out such real and clear procedures surrounding the registration of those supports. What does it mean when we supply real, qualified, appropriate translation in all aspects of the State? I want to speak briefly about participation. We have heard about the participation of citizens. This is not just the services received, but also participation given by citizens. This facilitates people to give into society and to participate fully. That is why it is important we remember that the recognition of ISL is not just an issue that affects a minority. When everyone participates in society we make better decisions and get better outcomes and when a minority cannot be part of a debate in society, we all lose out - all of society. Therefore, I again welcome the Bill. My last point concerns cultural participation. It is not just a matter of functional participation. It is also about culture. When we recognise ISL, our whole culture and society will be deepened. We can all look forward to what we might hear from those who will now be putting a new language on the agenda.

We will wait until he is ready to listen. The first people I congratulate are the deaf community. I am limping because I fell down the stairs. I congratulate the deaf community because what they did was the greatest example of how communications can work in politics. They are absolutely outstanding in the way they communicated with us, emailed us, telephoned us, spoke to us, told us their needs, what was going on and the platform for the whole idea. We just had it. What they did was brilliant. Would that other aspects of our community did likewise or that we as politicians or Senators had their talent in communication; therefore, I congratulate them. They were outstanding. We could not ignore them. We did not want to ignore them but we would not have been able. They were absolutely outstanding. It is one of the reasons, as well as other reasons of equality and quality of life, that I am here to support the Bill. I must also mention Fianna Fáil colleagues. Obviously, I find it very difficult to mention them. I cannot say their names. They stick in my throat.

When it does things, it does them very well. I also thank Mr. John Cradden and Mr. Barry Dunne. They are both ex-students of mine in DCU and were absolutely wonderful and taught me as a lecturer exactly how to enunciate and teach because they used hearing aids. I had to use particular microphones when we were working together. I again thank every single person in the deaf community who communicated with us individually and collectively. It was a lesson in the art, craft and skill of what good communications can do to have an impact and to ignite people who can make a difference to one's life to go ahead and do it. I offer my congratulations and will support the Bill.

Like my colleagues, I very much welcome the pupils and members of the Irish deaf community. Similarly, I thank Senator Mark Daly for bringing the Bill to the Chamber. It is extremely important for the current and future community of deaf people in Ireland. One person who wrote to me put it quite succinctly and clearly. She said it was about respect for one's language and the celebration of a minority in a majority world. It is a very important minority. We know that there are about 5,000 people who use Irish Sign Language and it is only right and proper that the needs of this group be met. Like previous speakers, I have received a lot of correspondence and many telephone calls on this issue, about which I have spoken to many people. One particular letter expressed very clearly how important it was that Irish Sign Language be recognised. The writer, a lady who has been deaf since the age of two years when she contracted meningitis, was kept in a mainstream school by her family where she struggled terribly to follow teachers and obtained poor leaving certificate examination results. She subsequently completed a post-leaving certificate course in Dublin, which she barely passed. Her letter describes how her self-esteem and self-confidence were shattered by her inability to achieve what she believed she could achieve. She later discovered the deaf community and started to learn Irish Sign Language. Ten years later she completed a course and successfully graduated with a degree in adult education and training. It took her 16 years after taking the leaving certificate examinations to get a degree because she did not have access to Irish Sign Language. The point she makes is that she faces a constant struggle to access health services, justice and information. She describes having to constantly ask, beg and fight for access to Irish Sign Language.  This is an important day. It is vital that we treat deaf people as equal citizens by recognising Irish Sign Language and empowering them to communicate and achieve all they can. I thank those members of the deaf community who have contacted Senators. They should keep their campaign going. I will vote in favour of the Bill and hope it will proceed through the Houses as quickly as possible. I also hope resources will be provided to ensure members of the deaf community have access to proper services and an ability to achieve the best they can. I thank the Minister of State for his attendance.

I also welcome those present in the Visitors Gallery which is full and includes members of the deaf community who are in school. Our visitors from Bishopstown community school are in the part of the Visitors Gallery that is normally restricted to visiting presidents and other VIPs. The deaf community has taken a long road and spent many years in getting this far. Senator Mark Daly has pushed this issue for a long time. It sticks in my throat a little that it has taken so long to get this far. I am sure the schoolchildren present feel as if this debate has been ongoing for ages. The way the Seanad works is that two hours have been provided for this debate because it is so important. Schoolchildren probably find the first three speeches fine, but after that, I am sure they would like us to move along or perhaps shut up and do what it is we are supposed to do.  Having received many letters and postcards, I was delighted to invite our visitors to the Seanad and I am pleased that they made the effort to travel to Dublin to make their presence so strongly felt. Irish Sign Language is vital and provides a sense of belonging and identity for its users. It is not enough to say deaf people will at some stage become a little more equal or be included a little more in society. This legislation will break some of the longstanding barriers facing them and help the process of disability and equality proofing in society.  I echo the concerns expressed by previous speakers about resources. While the Bill will be passed - hip, hip, hooray - the challenge will be to ensure resource issues do not become a barrier to full implementation of the legislation. I hope the Minister of State is listening attentively because deaf people face enough barriers in their lives. I ask him to provide the necessary funding to speed up and implement the legislation. I say, "Go raibh míle maith agaibh and well done," to everybody.

I welcome the Minister of State and, in particular, the members of the deaf community and their supporters in the Visitors Gallery. It is great to see so many of them in the Chamber. I commend Senator Mark Daly for his tenacity and persistence in pursuing this issue and promoting the Bill which all Senators are happy to support. My colleague, Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, spoke for the Labour Party in expressing our support for the Bill and the principles enunciated within it. Like others, I commend members, former and current students of the centre for deaf studies in Trinity College Dublin for all their work in lobbying on this legislation and the work of many other individuals and students, in particular, the students from Bishopstown community school in Cork who took the time to write to Senators to express their support for the Bill. Senators do not often receive handwritten letters, as we did from the school's pupils.  We are all in agreement on the issues addressed in the Bill. There is an issue around interpretation for Irish Sign Language in the courts system. I pay tribute to Professor Lorraine Leeson from the centre for deaf studies in Trinity College Dublin, with whom I have worked on the issue of interpretation rights for members of the deaf community who come before the courts.  All of us will echo the words of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality which, in its recent report on the recognition of Irish Sign Language, called for prioritisation of this Bill and its enactment as soon as possible. The report stated the position of the deaf community in Ireland could only be adequately addressed through legislative action and that in the absence of legislation and enforceable legal rights, efforts to address the issue would be piecemeal and inadequate. I conclude with those words, express again my support for the Bill, thank the interpreters present and apologise to them for speaking so fast.

I also acknowledge the communications Senators received from members of the deaf community, particularly transition year students in New Ross and pupils from Bishopstown community school who join us this afternoon. This is very important legislation which aims to move us another step along the road of eradicating discrimination in society. It will bring the provisions of political and civil rights to the deaf community which counts at least 5,000 members in Ireland. The legislation will bring Ireland into the modern era and recognise a minority group in society. The purpose of the House when it was established in 1922, as subsequently provided for in the 1937 Constitution, was to protect and represent the rights of minority groups. In dealing with this issue the House is certainly living up to the obligations placed on it.  I agree with previous speakers that the legislation must be streamlined and that we must move steadfastly to enable it to proceed to Committee and Report Stages. After its passage through this and the other House which I hope will not take long, it will be necessary to provide State support to implement it.We have learned something when on this path with the Official Languages Act 2003 and the official recognition of the Irish language. Official recognition has been provided for in legislation but the State, unfortunately, falls short in living up to those provisions. There is much that can be learned in that regard.  European experts have noted in recent times the need for Ireland to move into line with other European jurisdictions. We can look across the Atlantic to Canada which 34 years ago provided the legal basis of recognition for the deaf community. We can also learn from Canada in terms of the technological supports that are provided for the deaf community.  I commend all those who have interacted with Senators to bring this legislation before the House. I wish Senator Mark Daly well in his ongoing deliberations on the legislation and hope we see Committee Stage commence shortly.

I add my voice in support of this excellent Bill and commend Senator Mark Daly for bringing it forward. I also welcome those from the coalface, the experts and the members of the deaf community who have joined us. Like others, I too was impressed to be contacted by so many people. I noticed two things, in particular. I heard from a lot of people I know who either have family or professional connections. They include people working in chaplaincy, members of the deaf community themselves and others who are involved in education. We receive so many emails and there is so much lobbying, but the content and the people who were writing to us made it impossible to ignore what we were getting. The other thing that struck me was the richness of the real-life stories, although on occasion they were also very sad. We have heard some of them today. We were reminded of cases where, for example, deaf people were badly treated in hospitals. In one case a number of years ago, a man set out to walk 50 miles home to Clifden but was killed on the way. Having been delivered by taxi to a hospital, he was not helped in the appropriate way to get transport home. That is just one of many stories. We have been reminded, of course, that it is not all doom and gloom, that there is a vibrant deaf community and that Irish Sign Language is rich and capable of expressing every kind of concept.  It is our duty to ensure what will happen, I hope, in legislation will be followed up with resources and practice. I have also heard from people who are anxious to keep the St. Joseph's centre open. We were reminded of just how difficult it can be when members of the deaf community find themselves isolated in nursing home situations and have no one they can contact. While the HSE might have a particular policy about care within the community as opposed to congregated settings, which might be very wise, it is also important to have facilities that can provide top notch attention and amenities to those in the deaf community. We need to honour and respect that viewpoint also.  I conclude with words of thanks and continuing support. I know that the Minister of State cares about this issue and we hope the Government follows up with the necessary action.

I thank Senators for their wonderful contributions and their sincere and heartfelt views. If I have the opportunity, I would love to respond to all the points raised by them. As I listened to the Senators' contributions and heard their passion for and commitment to human rights and the great sense of social justice, I thought of Martin Naughton, the great disability rights campaigner, whose funeral I attended last Saturday in Baldoyle and who was buried in An Spidéal in County Galway. I had recently appointed that great Galway man, who fought for many years for the rights of all people with disabilities, to the task force dealing with disability issues. It is relevant that people such as Martin are remembered on days like this one. May he rest in peace. The battle for disability rights goes on and the Seanad did that ethos proud today.  I am happy to have the opportunity to join in the debate on the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016. There are approximately 5,000 users - although I suspect the number is much higher - of Irish Sign Language in the State and it is fair that public services provide them with interpretation services at no cost to the user when questions of statutory entitlement are at issue. I will not oppose the Bill and, when I raised it, there was no opposition to it at the Cabinet yesterday. It is important to let people know that also.  The sponsors of the Bill, including Senator Mark Daly, have done a valuable public service by putting the need to cater for the rights of users of Irish Sign Language on our agenda in the Oireachtas. I look forward to continuing the discussion on the Bill once it has completed the necessary pre-legislative scrutiny phase. Our discussion is particularly appropriate as we move toward ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, something which was touched on by many Senators. As Members will be aware, the Government is committed to ratification of the convention and we are working on finalising the details of the necessary legislation to remove the final legislative barriers to that ratification. The Government hopes to be in a position to publish this Bill in the very near future. We also intend to ratify the convention’s optional protocol at the same time as the convention itself is ratified. I have set my heart strongly on that happening. Members will know that interpretation services for deaf people on a State-wide basis are provided by the Sign Language Interpreting Service, SLIS, which was established by the Citizens Information Board in 2007. The SLIS is a limited company with a board of directors comprising representatives of key stakeholders such as the Citizens Information Board, Deaf Hear and the deaf community. The SLIS receives State funding directly from the Citizens Information Board. In 2016 it has an allocation of €275,000. It is generally acknowledged that the SLIS does superb work in its provision of an extensive range of services. That it intends to build on its current capacity is clear from its statement of strategy document for 2015 to 2020. In particular, the service intends to increase availability of interpreting services in key areas of daily life, particularly where deaf people are exercising their rights or entitlements. We need to move on that issue.  I have to flag a number of questions about specific provisions in the Bill which I am sure will be examined carefully in the pre-legislative scrutiny process. While the central principle of the Bill is sound, it seems to take a perhaps disproportionate approach to the provision of services for users of Irish Sign Language. Even prior to the publication of the Bill, I had approved a draft of the new national disability inclusion strategy, which we are working on. It proposes the following action for public consultation: “We will propose legislation to ensure that all public bodies provide Irish Sign Language (ISL) users with free ... interpretation when availing of their statutory [entitlements]”. More work will be needed - I take on board the Senator's points made in the debate - to tease out the detail of how this will operate, but, in principle, we need an approach focused directly on statutory entitlements.We know from our experience of the Irish language and the Official Languages Act that what is really important is developing the capacity to provide services in the language of the customer's choice and that enacting legislation or a constitutional protection will not resolve the practical service delivery issues that need to be planned for. This matter needs to be examined closely. We need a pragmatic and feasible approach backed up by statutory recognition of the rights of users of Irish Sign Language but also to ensure we can guarantee the service can be delivered in practice. A number of Senators spoke about the importance of delivery and the provision of resources. I got the message.  The following are elements of the Bill at which we need to look. The preambles are not a feature of how we draft primary legislation and do not seem to be necessary. I am not sure anything useful would come from the proposal to impose an obligation on public bodies to develop three-year action plans for Irish Sign Language, as provided for in section 9. The establishment of a new public body to be named the sign language interpreting service by the Citizens Information Board rather than allowing the board to continue to develop an ISL service, as it has been doing, does not seem to be necessary. Section 18 includes a provision to offer the annual accounts of the new body for sale. It is usual practice to publish accounts online and it is difficult to see how this provision is necessary.  Section 19 provides for borrowing by the public body to be established under section 12. Allowing an Exchequer-funded public body to borrow money is manifestly not a good idea. Of particular concern is how the loans would be controlled and repaid.  Section 29 provides for a sentence of 12 months imprisonment for either offering interpretation services or teaching Irish Sign Language on a commercial basis without being registered. I accept that there is a need for proper standards, but this approach is unnecessarily punitive and will do nothing to address the real issue - the need to develop the availability of Irish Sign Language interpreters. The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has considered the proposed amendment of section 43 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as set out in Part 4 of the Bill in consultation with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, and makes the point that the proposed approach would remove an important part of the broadcasting regulatory framework from its natural and appropriate statutory focus, namely, the Broadcasting Act 2009. Section 43 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the preparation of statutory rules by the BAI which place a range of statutory obligations on broadcasters. In the case of persons who are deaf or have a hearing impairment, persons who are blind or partially sighted and persons who have a hearing impairment and are partially sighted, the BAI has adopted access rules which contain specific target percentage ranges in regard to, inter alia, sign language and subtitling with which broadcasters are required to comply. These are revised by the BAI from time to time in accordance with the provisions of the Act. In addition, sections 53 to 55, inclusive, of the Act provide for an investigation and potential enforcement action in circumstances where there has been an apparent breach of a broadcasting rule. It is noted that this latter aspect is not provided for in the proposed Bill. Furthermore, section 43(6) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for biennial reviews of the access rules to be undertaken by the BAI, thereby allowing for potential revisions to be made to the rules. In Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the proposed Bill, however, it is proposed to incorporate a number of percentage targets for the period 2017 to 2019 which appear to have been taken from the current access rules. The Bill makes no provision for any review or potential revision of these targets. As such, the Schedule would become outdated every two years, which is a matter to be reflected on.  It should also be noted that Part 1 of Schedule 1, as proposed, omits certain services such as Oireachtas TV, Irish language TV and UTV Ireland. Following on from the BAl's extensive and ongoing consultations with user groups, it is evident that the quality and reliability of access service provision is as, if not more, important than the achievement of targets which are only a quantitative measure as such. The BAI's regulatory approach facilitates a far more flexible and consultative approach that takes account of improvements in the quality, reliability and range of access service provision, for example, increased live subtitling, subtitled Irish content, etc., rather than just quantitative targets as envisaged in the proposed Bill, thereby providing a regulatory approach that delivers in a more comprehensive and nuanced way on the wishes of users and intended beneficiaries of the services.  All of these points will need to be considered carefully as the examination of the Bill moves forward in the Houses. I am happy that the Bill will move to the pre-legislative scrutiny stage and that in due course, in the light of the assessment by the Oireachtas of the Bill’s proposals, we can work together to see what amendments are needed to create the focused right to interpretation which I would welcome and to remove some of the other elements that do not seem to be appropriate, as mentioned.  The new national disability inclusion strategy I mentioned is relevant. The strategy which it is intended will be in place before the end of 2016 includes, as I stated, a specific action to create a statutory right for a person to receive free Irish Sign Language interpretation services when availing of statutory services. In taking this approach we will still need to tease out in detail several issues, including how statutory services are to be defined and whether advance booking of the service would be required. This approach will provide a more fruitful way forward in that rather than the overly elaborate approach provided for in the Bill, it will be focused on meeting real needs in a pragmatic and cost-effective way. One of the issues Senators might consider is whether it would be better to build on the existing supports provided for the provision of interpretation services by the Citizens Information Board or to establish a new pubic body, as proposed in the Bill. I welcome the contributions of all Senators to the debate, during which some very serious issues were raised. I share the sentiments expressed by Senators Lorraine Clifford-Lee and Mark Daly about the tragic deaths in Dublin of the McCarthy brothers. We need to focus our attention not only on the issue of isolation but also on the need for change in broader sections of society. As Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities, I have met approximately 3,000 people with physical, intellectual and other disabilities, as well as service providers, from whom the message is that broader society has to change and that the mindset has to change in dealing with this issue and, in that context, this legislation.  As I said, I am not opposing the Bill. For me, it is about equality and respect, but it is also about citizens' participation. I take the opportunity to thank Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin for his work on this issue. As the Deputy is not a Member of this House, perhaps his Sinn Féin colleagues who are Members of this House might bring that message to him.  Senator Billy Lawless raised the important issue of employment and also referred to the justice system. Senator Victor Boyhan spoke about the urgent need not only for the enactment of legislation but also about the provision of resources to back it up. Employment of members of the deaf community is a huge issue. There are many talented deaf people, with many of whom I have engaged. The unemployment rate among members of the deaf community is too high.  Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile spoke about the important issue of rights and equality. Senator Gabrielle McFadden has made the very good point that we must ensure we will not pay lip-service to this issue. While, in this instance, we are speaking about the needs of the deaf community, meeting the needs of all people with disabilities is an important issue. Language is important in the context of inclusion and respect within broader society.  Senator Jerry Buttimer, a former teacher, mentioned that we should look at Cork Deaf Enterprises.This is something I would like to visit as part of my portfolio.  Senator Frances Black spoke about the UN convention and the five articles. I am trying to do something about this.  Senator Lynn Ruane dealt with the issue of discrimination. She also dealt with the employment issue whereby unemployment is too high among the deaf community, which is crazy for any society when we have a lot of skilled people.  Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin dealt with the issue of empowerment and commented, as did many of us, on the campaign by the students and the Irish Deaf Society. Senators Terry Leyden and David Norris dealt with the importance of this House. When I was in opposition and an Independent Deputy, I supported the campaign to save the Seanad.

Senator John O'Mahony spoke about inequality and exclusion.  Senator Grace O'Sullivan supported the Bill and mentioned the cross-party position and that activists were involved in the campaign. Some of us come from the community and voluntary sector and it is very important for any society to have good campaigners and activists, whether for international issues, human rights issues or issues such as this legislation. Senator Alice-Mary Higgins dealt with equality and justice. This is the type of Ireland we want to build and is something on which we must build. She also touched on ratification of the UN convention. She spoke about the issue of real resources and this debate must take place all of the time. When we are in a downturn, we must focus on where we want to spend limited resources. We have to make political decisions.  Senator Alice-Mary Higgins also spoke about the important matter of participation in broader society and ithis debate. I have learned that it lifts everybody. When I was in County Donegal on Monday, I met many children with physical disabilities in Dungloe. I saw children of seven or eight years of age with major physical elements and how they participated in society. I thought about their future. I spoke to their young parents, who are still very upset about finding themselves in this very difficult situation. The issue is the interaction between the people in the preschool services and other social care services and the key word is participation. It was refreshing to see that a group of young parents of young children with disabilities are coming through the system who will not let their children be treated as second-class citizens. It is important that we send this message. Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell thanked the students, mentioned the importance of communication and how this particular legislation had been handled.  Senator Maura Hopkins pointed to the importance of this historic day in the Seanad and dealt with the issue of access to services.  Senator Máire Devine spoke about the long road and the sense of belonging and how we needed to listen when we were dealing with this legislation. Senator Ivana Bacik spoke about the court system and interpretation issues.  Senators Brian Ó Domhnaill and Rónán Mullen spoke about their great support for this legislation and the concept of respecting and having rights for all people with disabilities. I thank Senator Mark Daly and all of the other Senators for participating in the debate. Let us hope we can move on to the next phase.

This is a civil rights issue. It is about giving equal opportunity to members of the deaf community to be full citizens of the State. It is also about ending extreme marginalisation. The Minister of State has said the Bill will pass Second Stage and that this has been made possible by new politics. People give out about it but the last election changed the dynamic. Previously, this would not have seen the light of day after this speech ended but now we will go to the next Stage. The problem with new politics is we do not know what happens next. Under the confidence and supply agreement, after Second Stage the Bill should go to Committee Stage within ten weeks but under Standing Orders it is supposed to go to pre-legislative scrutiny. I am sure we will have this clarified with the assistance of the Leader of the House and the Business Committee. Ten weeks from now is 28 December. I have been known to call the Seanad back from its holidays, but I assure Members that whatever I do I will not upset Christmas. I hope that in the new year, Committee Stage will take place, depending on the result of the inquiries into pre-legislative scrutiny. This has gone through pre-legislative scrutiny. The Irish Deaf Society has taken best practice. When the Bill was put together, it was with the assistance of the Houses of the Oireachtas, under its pilot programme whereby Members of the House could get legislation drafted, with input from all sides and looking at legislation put in place in other jurisdictions. The argument for pre-legislative scrutiny may be valid and whether the ten-week timeline is the way we will go is an issue we will resolve. We are all at one on the fact we want to get this done and get it across the line. I thank the Minister of State for his support. I thank the Members for their contributions. I also thank the interpreters for their participation. I thank the members of the deaf community who are here and have been part of the campaign so far. Legislation is a journey and this is one step. I hope that with the Minister of State and all Members, we will journey on this road together.

I want to preface my remarks by saying we have an exemplary Judiciary and that in no way does anything I am suggesting seek to undermine the calibre or integrity of the Judiciary which has served the nation with distinction. The independence of the Judiciary is a central tenet of our democracy and enshrined in the Constitution. Article 35.2 of the Constitution states: “All judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law”. Judicial independence does not just apply for the benefit of judges but also for the people. It ensures public confidence in the administration of justice and without that confidence, the rule of law would be threatened. The objective of a judicial council was not set out as an objective of the Government in the current programme for Government and there is no reference to such a council in the document that guides Government policy. That is not to say it is not supportive in principle and I have spoken to a number of people in government who are sympathetic and supportive of the principle behind a judicial council. In order to safeguard public confidence in the Judiciary, I propose the motion and call on the Minister to publish a judicial council Bill without further delay. With regard to the background to the motion, in 1999 the Working Group on a Courts Commission provided a report for the then Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, now deceased, on the question of judicial conduct and ethics. This was against a backdrop of the resignation in that year of a High Court judge in what was known as the Sheedy affair. One of the recommendations of the working group was the establishment of a judicial council which would promote excellence and efficiency in the performance by judges of their judicial functions and would provide a process for investigating complaints of alleged breaches of judicial ethics. The Chief Justice established a committee to examine the general issue and it produced a report in December 2000, known as the Keane report. The report concluded that the existing structures for dealing with concerns about judicial misconduct were inadequate. It contained reasonably detailed proposals for new legislation. In 2010 the then Fianna Fáil Minister, Mr. Dermot Ahern, introduced the general scheme of a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the 2000 report, the Judicial Council Bill 2010. The general scheme of the Judicial Council Bill was published in August 2010 and took into account the recommendations of the 2000 report. The purpose of general scheme of the Bill was to establish a judicial council of all judges to promote high standards of conduct among judges and supports for judges. Central to the Bill is provision for effective remedies for complaints about judicial behaviour. The provisions include the establishment of a judicial conduct committee, with lay participation in the investigation and consideration of complaints. This is very important and I hope it will be taken on board when a new Bill is finally published. The Bill envisaged the establishment of the judicial council as an independent corporate entity with its own board. It would also facilitate the ongoing support and education of judges through the Judicial Studies Institute and by the establishment of a judicial support committee. The general scheme of the Bill proposed the establishment of a judicial council of all serving members of the Judiciary which would be independent in its functions and have its own seal. Functions of the judicial council should be to maintain and promote the following: excellence in the exercise by judges of their judicial functions; high standards of conduct among judges; the efficient and effective use of judicial resources; continued education among judges; and respect for the independence of the Judiciary. I acknowledge and stress the last point. The judicial council might consider other matters, perhaps a register of interests for judges, but that would be a matter for it. I am very conscious of the separation of powers and the issue of interference by the Executive in the workings of the Judiciary. The establishment of a judicial council is not just being called for by me but also by the Chief Justice, Mrs. Susan Denham. In an article in the October edition of the Law Society Gazette the Chief Justice said the lack of action in establishing a judicial council was a matter of real concern both for the Judiciary and the State. She added that the Judiciary had been advocating for its establishment for over 20 years. The establishment of a judicial council is long overdue. I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State with an exact timeline for the publication of a judicial council Bill. I commend the motion to the House for its careful consideration and support.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton. I concur fully with and support completely what has been said by Senator Victor Boyhan. By way of background, I was appointed Attorney General in 1999. I succeeded Mr. David Byrne as a member of the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics which had been established, as Senator Victor Boyhan said, in the wake of the Sheedy affair. I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2002 and my Department set about the preparation of legislation to give effect to the judicial council idea as recommended in the report. It was my intention at the time that we should do so in consultation with the Judiciary and I set about, through the usual channel, seeking the views of the Judiciary rather than seeking to impose on it without consultation the model recommended in the report.It is a matter of record, one about which I was reminded recently while reading about it in a newspaper, that the process never came to fruition while I was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The impatience on the part of the current Chief Justice was to be found at that time in the Department. As far as it was concerned, the reason the matter was not being dealt with as a matter of urgency lay in the Four Courts, although precisely where the blame lay in the Four Courts is a different matter. Whatever the history of the issue, the heads or scheme of a Bill were published in 2010, as Senator Victor Boyhan stated. Six years later, the need for a judicial council is as obvious now as it was then. Such an institution is badly needed to protect the Judiciary and guarantee its independence. In these circumstances, we should have an assurance from the Government that the scheme is about to be published in Bill form. There has been controversy in recent times about whether there is an arrangement in place, at Cabinet level at least, between some members of the Government and the Independent Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, that no new appointments will be made to the Bench until the Bill the Minister favours is passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas and made into law. There is no evidence that the exact scheme, as adumbrated in the programme for Government, has the support of a majority in either the other House or this House. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has tendered a Bill which is a better model and one that is more likely to produce better recommendees for appointment to the Bench. I do not know what other Senators' views are on the matter. Whether Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's Bill is progressed, whether the Government introduces a Bill or whether some kind of consultative process commences between the Government and the Deputy that gives rise to the early progressing of his draft legislation is beside the point. The real point is that there cannot and should not be a circumstance where members of the public are told by one Minister's political advisers, through the media, that there is a moratorium on the appointment of judges. I note the chairman of the Bar Council has pointed out that this is improper. It is wrong to hold up the process of appointing badly needed judges pending the delivery of legislation which has not even be drafted, let alone put before a committee for pre-legislative scrutiny. The Judiciary should not be used in this manner and the issue of appointments to the Judiciary should not be hijacked to make a political point.  If the Government has so little confidence in its members collectively to select good judges, it says more about it than anybody else. The Government is not even bound to accept recommendations made by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. If it has so little confidence in its ability to select good members from either side of the legal profession to become judges - people of quality, integrity and independence - it speaks very badly of the board.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether the suggestions made by the Minister that he has secured an agreement, understanding or decision at the Cabinet that no judicial appointments will be filled pending the passage of the Bill referred to in the programme for Government is correct. I have read newspaper editorials on the issue, about which I also wrote an article. The public is entitled to a fair, straight answer on this issue. If such an arrangement is in place, it should be repudiated because it attacks the Constitution, which states it is the duty of the Government collectively to appoint in accordance with the law. If no such an arrangement is in place, we should be told and the non-appointment to current vacancies should be explained.  I fully accept that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Independent Alliance have an appetite for reform of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. While the two Houses are putting in place reforming legislation, there is no reason the board cannot be trusted to carry out its constitutional duty to select good people to be appointed to the Bench. It is a scandal that one Minister could give the Government the impression that he has effectively put his foot on the brake to stop such appointments because he does not trust himself and his colleagues to make proper appointments.

It is great to have a busy Minister of State take time to come to the House and show respect for the Seanad and the work it does. I thank Senator Victor Boyhan for proposing the motion. He and his team put much thought into justice issues, as is reflected in the important motion before us. I listened carefully to Senator Michael McDowell outline his experience as Attorney General and subsequently as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the eight-year period between 1999 and 2007. During that period, it was not only problematic but nearly impossible to move on this issue. This shows how slowly the wheels are turning on this issue. I have no doubt that the fault lies in the Four Courts, as the Senator noted. The Department may be much maligned, but it would certainly not delay a measure by eight years. Large bodies move slowly and many traditional bodies do not want change, as was evident during the previous Government's term when the Legal Services Regulation Bill was challenged. While some of the concerns raised about that legislation were genuine, and they were addressed in the final product, as it were, they were symptomatic of a profession that is slow to embrace change, although to be fair, when it embraces change it does so fully.  I share the concern expressed by Senator Michael McDowell on media speculation that a certain Minister has an issue with the making of judicial appointments and wants specific legislation passed before any meaningful judicial appointments are made. This does not say much for the eminent judges who were appointed in the past 20 years by various Governments under what may be described as the old system. Ireland is extremely fortunate to have judges of the utmost integrity and it is appropriate that the separation of the Judiciary, Executive and Legislature is observed to the nth degree.  When legislation finally comes before the House it will introduce safeguards and proper checks and balances to ensure a procedure is in place for dealing with a member of the Judiciary who is not following the eminent traditions of the Judiciary, if one likes. Such legislation is necessary and would bring us into line with many of our European neighbours in respect of the appointment of judges. In my experience, motions of this nature in the Seanad are important because they ensure a Minister comes to the House to account for the Government's position on the subject of the motion. I am pleased to note the Government is not opposing this motion.It is a very positive statement that they agree with the principle behind the motion. We have a unique facility in Seanad Éireann by which any one of us can table a motion. The Government is then required to outline its position. I certainly look forward to what the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, will have to tell us, particularly about the timeline. We all know that the legislation is imminent. We all know that it is in the autumn legislative programme, known as the A list. If it is on the A list, it means that it is the Government's absolute intention that it should be with us prior to the Christmas recess. We are probably talking about seven or eight weeks. The Minister of State may even be in a position to tell us in which week it will come before us. He will be delighted to know that we in Seanad Éireann will have no problem initiating the Bill and putting it through this House in the first instance, as we have done with many other Bills, in the unlikely event that the Dáil schedule is packed with legislation. From where I am standing, the Dáil has plenty of time to discuss legislation because there is precious little going through it. In the event that the Dáil has a problem and there are difficulties with timetabling, we would be very happy to initiate the Bill in this Chamber. I offer many congratulations to Senator Victor Boyhan and his assistant for putting the motion together. I look forward to hearing the rest of the contributions.

Craughwell for bringing forward the motion on the establishment of a judicial council. The establishment of a judicial council is hugely important and something the Fianna Fáil Party and I fully support. As outlined by Senator Victor Boyhan, Fianna Fáil brought forward a judicial council Bill in 2010 in an attempt to ensure continued public confidence in judicial integrity. As a result, an interim judicial council was established in 2011. It was tasked with dealing with pending legislation to provide for a judicial council. Following this, the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government pledged to legislate to establish a judicial council with lay representation to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges. The pledge was not honoured and the Government reneged on yet another of its promises. I, therefore, find it difficult to believe, as the Tánaiste stated in this Chamber last week, that a Bill to provide for the establishment of a judicial council will be produced in this session. The establishment of a judicial council would go a long way to ensuring Ireland would fulfil its commitments under the Council of Europe's group of states against corruption, GRECO, report recommendations. GRECO's evaluation report published in November 2014 stated Ireland should establish a judicial council within 18 months following the adoption of the report and that it should report to the group on the actions it had taken in response to the recommendations. This deadline was extended to the end of September 2016, yet still no serious action has been taken by a Government that continues to drag its heels on the issue. The current placement of the Judicial Council Bill under all other legislation displays the demotion of its status from previous Government legislative agendas. The Judiciary and other concerned bodies have been advocating for the establishment of a judicial council for more than 20 years in an attempt to ensure the Judiciary would have a forum for the professional development of judges, a standard setter in the area of judicial ethics and a safeguard for the separation of powers. A judicial council would facilitate interactions between the Judiciary and other branches of government, supporting the independence of the Judiciary and providing a mechanism for the investigation and handling of complaints about judicial misconduct. I again commend Senators Victor Boyhan, Michael McDowell and Gerard P. Craughwell for bringing this issue before the Chamber. I hope this House can put pressure on the Government and the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to act on the GRECO recommendations and finally establish a judicial council to promote and support the continued excellence of judges in performing their judicial functions. I also wish to be associated with the comments made by Senator Michael McDowell on the lack of progress in filling vacancies in the Judiciary. As the Senator outlined, it is unacceptable for one member of the Cabinet to hold the judicial system to ransom on this issue. We need clarification from the Minister of State on the matter. He must be able to confirm or deny that this is actually happening. What steps is he going to take to fill the positions in the near future?

My party and I agree 100% with the sentiments expressed in it. It is outrageous, frankly, how long it has taken to address this issue. It is indefensible. The Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, has repeatedly raised the need to address it. We talk about ombudsmen, oversight and all the various institutions that have emerged in the past two decades. Clearly, there has been a need for judicial oversight. In terms of the separation of powers, it obviously has to be by a judicial council. There is also a need for the training of members of the Judiciary on an ongoing basis and to ensure consistency in sentencing, accountability and so on. It is absolutely vital. I argue it is fundamental to our democracy. I hope the Minister of State's comments will give some indication of a timeframe within which we will see a Bill and the issue moving forward. I want to make some related comments on the issue of judicial appointments. It is very unfortunate that there has been a perception that some members of the Judiciary were appointed not because of their ability but because of their political affiliations. That is unfortunate because I believe if someone has been a member of or an adviser to a political party, it should not rule him or her out of being appointed to the Judiciary. There is a process that is better than the one we now have . I tabled a Bill in the previous Oireachtas that laid out that there would be a shortlist of three for every judicial vacancy, that the shortlist would be given by the relevant body in place now to the Government to make a decision and the reasons would be published. There would be full accountability as to the reason each person had been appointed to the Judiciary. That would take away any perception of criticism or any question over the decisions the Judiciary would make. A problem also presents itself at Supreme Court level. One of the main tasks of the Supreme Court judges is to interpret the Constitution. Obviously, it is critical that there be a Supreme Court that is representative of society. There must be a balance of progressive and conservative and left and right within the Judiciary. If one member of the Judiciary is seen to be representative of the political establishment or to have been appointed by the political establishment, regardless of whether it is correct, it impacts on confidence in the decisions made. The Chief Justice is rightly concerned about the delays. By the way, the Bill I tabled, interestingly, recommended exactly the same system the Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, recommended. She is obviously a very respected person and has been advocating for changes to the way judicial appointments are made, for more accountability and a judicial council. We need to sort out this issue. I want to comment on the need for a sentencing council. In England and Wales there is a commendable model for a sentencing council. I know that the Minister of State is familiar with it and I am a big supporter of that system. There is a council that is significantly made up of members of the Judiciary, other experts from academia and so on. They consult the wider public on the range of sentences appropriate to a particular offence. There is still, however, a degree of flexibility. One is not saying to a member of the Judiciary that he or she must hand down a sentence of two years for a particular offence.A range of sentences is available but whatever sentence they hand down, judges must be clear on the reasons for it. The public has been consulted about what is appropriate, a range of sentencing has been put in place and it has been ensured the Judiciary is accountable. If a decision is made in the Circuit Court in County Donegal, Cork or Waterford, there must be a commonality in sentencing in order that people can have more confidence in the system. A sentencing council should be established. I published legislation on the matter and presented it to the previous Dáil and may well reintroduce it in this Seanad. The Government needs to sort out the issue of judicial appointments, introduce legislation to establish a judicial council and a sentencing council. It must be ensured the public can have full confidence in the sentencing the Judiciary is tasked with and in the training and the ongoing dialogue between judges to ensure consistency across the State. I commend the Senators for their motion which is spot on and has been well drafted. I hope it will create an impetus for the Government to act in due course.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	152	I welcome the Minister of State and thank the Senators for tabling the motion. It is important that we discuss this matter because it has been discussed for more than 16 years and we should now try to move forward. Members have outlined the delays, but it is important to recognise the changes that have been made in the courts in recent years, in particular, the establishment of a Court of Appeal, which has taken a significant workload from the Supreme Court. I recall waiting for three years for a case to be listed for hearing in the Supreme Court, as a result of which many decisions were delayed. The Court of Appeal helps the process and is dealing with cases efficiently and quickly. Recently a matter was referred by way of case stated from the High Court to the Court of Appeal because there had been two conflicting decisions in the High Court. When the matter came before a High Court judge, she referred it by way of case stated to the Court of Appeal and the matter was dealt with and a decision given in a short time, which is a welcome development. I agree that a judicial council is needed. The Chief Justice and all other members of the Judiciary have been looking for one for some time and it is important that there not be a further delay in introducing it.  I also agree with colleagues that there should not be delays in judicial appointments. It is important that at all times we have an efficient judicial system. A number of years ago there was a four-year wait to get a High Court case heard in Cork. There were 6,000 cases on a waiting list to be heard in Cork at the time. We have come a long way since. Recognition should also be given to the Courts Service, given the significant increase in commercial law work because of the downturn. This took the form of liquidations and receiverships. The courts dealt with them efficiently, despite that the fact that their workload had increased dramatically. A proper system of checks and balances is needed and a judicial council is the way forward in that regard. It has been talked about for a long period. The Judiciary is in favour of it and has given its views on how it should be dealt with. The Government is drafting a Bill which should be brought forward and dealt with at an early date. We would have no difficulty if the legislative process commenced in this House. There are enough Members who could give their views on the draft legislation and it could be processed efficiently. Given the new system of pre-legislative scrutiny, it is important that there not be further delays and that the council be established. I also agree with colleagues that we have been fortunate down the years to have had a good and fair system. People felt some judicial appointees in the past 20 or 30 years would follow a particular line, but they went down a contrary line to make sure they maintained their independence. They took a number of constitutional cases which established good law. In these cases, the legislative process had been delayed and, unfortunately, the courts had to intervene to make sure what was in place was appropriate for the times in which we lived. The courts are not in place to formulate legislation, but where the Legislature falls down, they have to make sure citizens can access services and that their constitutional rights will be protected in the process. I welcome the debate. I agree this legislation should be brought forward at the earliest date.

I also welcome the motion. My colleague, Senator Frances Black, is our spokesperson on justice and equality and would normally have contributed, but she is unable to be present.  I had the opportunity last week to participate at the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe in the election of new judges to the European Court of Human Rights. It was interesting to observe the process in action. A shortlist had been selected and scrutiny and oversight were transparent. The curricula vitae and qualifications were scrutinised fully and only a few candidates were allowed to go forward on a shortlist before we had the opportunity to vote. I do not suggest that is the system for Ireland, but it sent a great signal of confidence because people fully trusted and engaged with it to appoint judges. There is an opportunity here to instil that sense of strength, confidence and engagement. I do not impugn the processes followed in the State, but this system presents an opportunity to have something better. The Group of States against Corruption, to which Ireland subscribes, has explicitly among its 11 recommendations for Ireland, in ensuring the visible absence of corruption and sending a strong signal to others across Europe, the establishment of a judicial council. We had that signal from Europe, but we also have champions in the State on this issue. The Chief Justice, Mrs. Susan Denham, has been emphatic and strong in pleading for progress on this issue following many years of delay. She described a council "as a necessary element of the infrastructure of a modern democratic state." She has made a strong and credible case, but she has also referred to something which is more important now than at any point previously, that the council should be instrumental in promoting public confidence in the administration of justice. There is a lack of public confidence in the justice system in Ireland and many other parts of the world. People must not only experience the administration of justice as being fair and equal, but it must also be seen to be transparently so.Building and strengthening public confidence in the justice system is vital. I recognise, of course, the complete independence of the Judiciary and that, as public representatives, we have a separate and different role. However, there are things within these proposals which could serve to strengthen and underscore public confidence in the Judiciary, one of which was spoken about by Senator Victor Boyhan who referred to a judicial conduct committee with lay participation. That is a constructive and positive proposal which could help to build public confidence. Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn spoke about the idea of having a sentencing committee which might engage with NGOs and civic society. There is a huge role to be played to build public confidence and engagement in the area of training. It is an area on which I wish to focus, in particular. As an appropriate and positive way to strengthen judicial training, one area where it might be looked at I respectfully and constructively suggest is violence against women. The UN Handbook for Legislation on Violence Against Women has highlighted the importance of training and capacity building for judiciaries in areas such as this. It has also been highlighted in respect of the introduction of new legislation. For example, as Ireland ratifies the Istanbul Convention, access to justice will be part of the process. It is important that there be an appropriate, independent mechanism to facilitate that training and engagement. Recognising that it is a question for a judicial council, not us, I support the idea of having a register of interests for the Judiciary. It is a very constructive proposal. While it is not for us to determine, it would be constructive and strengthen and underscore public confidence in all udges. This is an opportunity. It is a positive and constructive step forward. Whichever Bill it comes through, whichever proposals are adopted and whatever shape it takes, what is important is hearing from the Minister about how she can respond on how this will move forward in the next year. How will she send that signal at a time when it is most needed?

It was a pleasure to work with him on the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence in the lifetime of the last Seanad and Dáil. I look forward to working with him on many of the issues on which the joint committee worked so hard in those few years. It is also worth paying tribute to the proposer and seconder of the motion, Senators Victors Boyhan and Michael McDowell. It is a motion which deserves wide support, which I understand it has received on a cross-party basis. The principle of the establishment of a judicial council has been with us for a long time. Senator Victor Boyhan kindly gave me a copy just before the debate of the Law Society Gazette article from October 2016 with the headline "Chief Justice Slams Government over Judicial Council Delay". I said to the Senator that I had the full text of the Chief Justice's speech from 26 September 2016. While the position is perhaps somewhat overstated in the headline, she was certainly very critical of the 20-year delay in enacting legislation on a judicial council. This proposal has been around for a long time and there is widespread support for it. As we know from the Chief Justice and others, the Judiciary has been to the fore in calling for this legislation. Before turning to the substance of the motion and legislation, I note that we debated the issue of judicial appointments this day last week. In that context, I spoke about the need for diversity in the Judiciary. It is something on which I have worked for a long time. In 2003 we published a report in Trinity College Dublin on gender injustice which looked at gender discrimination in the legal profession and the lack of women among senior judges. That is something that has changed since the report was published in 2003. We have seen much better representation of women among the Judiciary, albeit there are still low numbers of women represented at senior ranks in the Law Library among senior counsel and at senior ranks in the solicitors' profession also. However, the great improvements made in the numbers of women appointed to the Judiciary must be acknowledged. It is very welcome because greater diversity is to be welcomed in general. In that context, I tabled a motion in the lifetime of the last Government seeking clarity on whether the maternity leave arrangements would extend to serving judges, an issue which the then Minister acknowledged had not actually come to light previously. It had simply not arisen, given the particular demographic make-up of the Judiciary until then. It is now clearly an issue and very welcome to see that we are moving on it. I received a good response from the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and will certainly be renewing my work on the issue. Turning to the substance of the motion, the proposal for a judicial council has been with us for 20 years as the Chief Justice and others have explained. It was mooted in the 1996 report of the Constitutional Review Group which recommended that judges should regulate judicial conduct within a legislative framework embracing all courts. Part of the difficulty has been the different approach taken between judges of the Superior Courts and judges of the District Court. In accordance with Article 35 of the Constitution, there is a distinction between such judges. Looking at the language of Article 35, we see the particular problem as identified by Hogan, Whyte and others which is the lack of a definition of "incapacity" or "stated misbehaviour". Article 35.4.1o provides that a judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity and then only on resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann calling for his removal. It does refer to "his".  Part of the difficulty is how one defines "incapacity" and, in particular, "stated misbehaviour". As we know, there have been a number of instances in which there have been issues around the potential impeachment of judges, notably the Sheedy affair in 1999 and the Curtin affair. In those instances, three judges in total resigned before any action was taken or could have been taken under the Constitution. The Chief Justice and others have identified that part of the difficulty has always been the extremely difficult burden in moving an impeachment motion. It is a very onerous requirement. If we look at examples from elsewhere, as the Oireachtas Library and Research Service did in its spotlight paper of 2014, there are other jurisdictions in which different procedures are in place. Mixed systems are in place where we see processes equivalent to a judicial council having been introduced. That is the model we should follow. Others have commented on the international impetus for this. We see in the GRECO recommendations that a judicial council should be established and that Ireland should report on the action within 18 months of the GRECO report of November 2014. That 18-month period expired in April this year and was extended to September. The heads of the Bill have been published and others have spoken about them. There is momentum behind this idea, including domestically. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties and other bodies have also called for the establishment of a judicial council. There is a great deal of consensus on the issue and we simply now need to see movement on it. The motion calls on the Government to legislate and commit to the early publication of a Bill. Others have called for a timeframe. I echo those calls. We need a timeframe. The principle is clear and the consensus evident. I commend those who moved the motion for bringing it forward and keeping it on the political agenda. At a time when there is controversy surrounding judicial appointments, this is an issue about which there is no controversy and everyone is agreed on the need. We need simply to see early publication of legislation.

I also thank Senators Victor Boyhan, Michael McDowell and Gerard P. Craughwell for tabling the motion and raising this matter. I am here on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality who, unfortunately, cannot be here. She sends her apologies.  I acknowledge that the motion raises a very important and significant issue. I have listened carefully to Senators and congratulate them on the issues they have raised and the quality of the debate so far. I am happy to note that the Government has decided to accept the motion as proposed and welcomes the opportunity it provides to reflect on core issues in terms of the proper functioning of the judicial system. The motion calls on the Government to legislate for the establishment of a judicial council and commit to the early publication of a Bill to provide for its establishment. As indicated in the current legislative programme, a judicial council Bill is among those Bills which are a priority for publication this session.To be clear, that is before the next session starts in January. This session will end when the Dáil and Seanad rise in December. There is intensive work taking place to ensure the timetable will be adhered to. As colleagues have said, the value of an independent Judiciary cannot be disputed. It is fundamental to the working of our democracy and essential in upholding the rule of law on which all citizens rely, whether in the private family zone, commercial relationships, protecting against criminality or vindicating rights where the State is often the opposing party. Senators will be aware that, as matters stand, Article 35.4.1° of the Constitution provides that a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity and then only on resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann calling for his or her removal. This constitutional process has been extended by statute to the question of removal and dismissal of Circuit Court and District Court judges. Otherwise, with the exception of statutory provisions dealing with investigating and reprimanding judges of the District Court, there is no means of investigating or dealing with allegations which are not sufficiently serious to merit the invocation of the constitutional provisions. This and previous Governments have been conscious of the fact that there is a need for an alternative structure to be put in place to deal with allegations of that nature and the development of such a structure is a key driver behind the judicial council Bill. Any legislative proposal must be mindful of Article 35.2 of Bunreacht na hÉireann which, as acknowledged in the motion, provides that judges shall be independent in the exercise of their functions and subject only to the Constitution and the law. The principle of independence derives further strength from international best practice. I need only reference Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which proclaims the entitlement to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal and Articles 6 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, respectively, which also affirm the values of judicial independence and impartiality. It is well known that the judicial council Bill has had a rather long gestation period. The first key milestone was in 1999 when the Working Group on a Courts Commission reported to the then Chief Justice on the question of judicial conduct and ethics. That was against the background of the Sheedy affair, as has been referenced, the background to which need not be revisited on this occasion. Subsequently, in December 2000 the report known colloquially as the Keane report was published. As Members are aware, it found that the existing structures for dealing with concerns about judicial misconduct were inadequate as there was no mechanism in being which would allow for the investigation of instances of judicial misconduct which were not so serious as to bring the constitutional sanction into play. The report contained reasonably detailed proposals for legislation which were subsequently fleshed out in the form of a draft Bill prepared by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham who is now the Chief Justice. While that activity was happening on the domestic front, there was also activity taking place at an international level. In 2000 the United Nations Centre for Crime Prevention invited a group of chief justices from common law jurisdictions, known as the Judicial Integrity Group, to address the loss in many countries of confidence in judicial systems. The Judicial Integrity Group recognised that the principle of accountability demanded that the national judiciary should assume an active role in strengthening judicial integrity by effecting such systematic reforms as are within the judiciary’s competence and capacity. The group also recognised the need for a universally acceptable statement of judicial standards which, consistent with the principle of judicial independence, would be capable of being respected and ultimately enforced at national level without the intervention of either the executive or legislative branches of government. Following extensive consultations with other common and civil law jurisdictions, the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct emerged. The principles recognise fundamentals which are widely accepted in regional human rights instruments and in many countries, whether enshrined in domestic constitutions, statutory provisions or flowing from the common law. The core values which they reflect include independence, impartiality and integrity. Propriety, equality, competence and diligence are also acknowledged. The Bangalore Principles remind us of the need to ensure public confidence in the judicial system and in the moral authority and integrity of that system. They aim to ensure judges, both individually and collectively, respect and honour judicial office as a public trust and strive to enhance and maintain confidence in the system in which they operate. They provide guidance for judges and legislators. They also offer a framework for regulating judicial conduct. It is generally accepted, in relation to the regulation of judicial conduct, that such regulation must be undertaken by a body which consists, in the main, of members of the Judiciary. There are two reasons for this. First, regulation of this nature will ensure independence is maintained. Second, it recognises that the primary responsibility for the promotion and maintenance of high standards of judicial conduct lies with the Judiciary. As I stated, successive Governments have held the view that a structure needs to be put in place to deal with allegations of judicial misconduct and facilitate the establishment of a platform for the promotion of excellence and high standards of conduct by judges. However, despite the best efforts of many who have collaborated on this project during the years, it has not yet proved possible to publish a judicial council Bill. That is not because of any conspiracy or hidden agenda; rather, I will echo Harold Macmillan in saying, "It’s events." Drafting of the Bill has had in the past to give way to other pressing priorities, some of which arose from our troika commitments, while some concerned important social and societal issues such as the establishment of the Court of Appeal, the passage of the Children and Family Relationship Act 2015 and the marriage referendum last year. However, every effort is now being made to bring the drafting of the Bill to a timely conclusion to ensure it is published this term, before the next session starts. I will turn to specific elements of the motion. I note that its proposers have called on the Government to provide for effective remedies for complaints about judicial misconduct to include lay participation in the investigation of those complaints. In that regard, the current draft of the Bill provides for the establishment of a judicial council and board which will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges. It also provides a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct and, in this context, envisages the establishment of a judicial conduct committee with lay representation. The motion also calls on the Government to provide ways to support and improve the operation of the Judiciary by providing for judicial studies and support committees. It is intended that the Bill will make provision for such committees in order to facilitate the ongoing support and education of judges in a structured and focused manner. It may be useful at this stage to outline briefly the Bill’s main provisions, as envisaged, with the health warning that the provisions may be further developed during the ongoing drafting process. Central to the Bill’s provisions is the establishment of a judicial council of all serving members of the Judiciary and a board which will exercise, on behalf of the council, the functions conferred on it by the Bill. These functions are intended to include: the maintenance and promotion of excellence in the exercise by judges of their judicial functions; high standards of conduct among judges; the efficient and effective use of judicial resources; continuing education among judges; respect for the independence of the Judiciary; and public confidence in the Judiciary. In the area of judicial conduct, the Bill will define "judicial misconduct" and establish a judicial conduct committee comprising both judges and lay members. The committee will be independent in the performance of its functions. These functions will include the consideration and investigation of complaints, with the possibility to resolve a complaint by informal means. Additional functions will include the preparation and submission to the board of the council of draft guidelines concerning judicial conduct and ethics and the specification and publication of the procedures to be followed in investigating a complaint, including the publication of guidelines for resolving a complaint by informal means. Formal investigations will be conducted by a panel of inquiry. Such a panel will have the power to make various recommendations to the judicial conduct committee which may accept or reject them, as appropriate. Recommendations which could be made include the issue of advice to the judge concerned, recommending a course of action the judge should follow, for example, that the judge should attend a specified course, the issue of a reprimand to the judge concerned, the issue of a recommendation to the President of the court of which the judge is a member and a recommendation for procedural or organisational change. I draw the attention of Senators to the allocation in the recent budget of more than €30 million in additional funding for the courts. The increased funding brings the total gross allocation to €140 million next year. Included in the enhanced provision is capital funding of approximately €23 million. Provision is also made for expenditure of €4.5 million on information and communications technology in court houses and to upgrade and enhance ICT functionality in the courts. The additional funding will also boost staffing across the Courts Service in areas such as probate, wards of court and change management, as well as in provincial court offices, thus driving reform and alleviating delays in front-line services. The Government is mindful of the need to introduce legislation which has regard to the requirements of a modern Judiciary in a fully functioning democratic society. As indicated, publication of the judicial council Bill is a priority for the Government and I hope it will be debated in this House in the near future. I look forward to hearing the further contributions of Senators on this important matter.

I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, for his report which is very similar to what I said to him. I can see many of the same sentences and the same language in his contribution. It appears that we are all at one on the issue. I do not wish to keep emphasising it, but I was talking to a number of colleagues who had raised these issues. We know that there is no mention of a judicial council in the programme for Government. I am delighted that in recent times somebody decided, for whatever reason - I would like to think it was due to many of us raising the issue - that the Bill should be on the A list. That is great, but as the Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, has pointed out in the past, there has been promise after promise after promise. To be fair, Fine Gael has been in government for the past five years. We need a timeline. We need an absolute timeframe for the delivery of the Bill.The situation is unique in that the Judiciary is looking for this. There is no battle.  I do not propose to comment on the issue of judicial appointments other than to echo what previous speakers said in that regard. There are serious constitutional implications in what the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, might be suggesting on which we need clarification. We will have an opportunity to raise the matter again tomorrow in the Seanad and it is my intention to do so. We need clarification on whether, as has been expressed repeatedly in the past few days, a special, cast iron agreement has been made with a member or members of the Independent Alliance on appointments to the Judiciary. Justice delayed is justice denied. If there are vacancies in the Courts Service for judges, they should be filled, regardless. This is about justice, not politics or politicians.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House for this debate. It is important that we have momentum and a timeline for the publication of the Bill. What is important is that we see progress on the matter.
