          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I listened to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform this morning and it seems that the Government has an inability to plan and finish projects.  It also seems that the Minister may eventually revert with an entirely different entity.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The hallmark of the Taoiseach's Ministry for Finance and Government has been to waste money.  The Government spent €60 million on e-voting machines, €200 million on the famous PPARS computer system and €100 million on consultancy fees and site clearances for the Abbotstown development.  That amounts to €360 million, to name but three examples.  The Government that the Taoiseach leads and in which he was Minister for Finance does not seem to be able to plan——</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_4">——and carry through projects once they enter the system.  With that €360 million, the Government could have built a major portion of the national children's hospital on a greenfield site or 100 schools.  It could have dealt with many of the country's infrastructural requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">Last week, I visited Neilstown where I met the mother of a young child who can read 15 words, but whose teacher will be removed in September.  The Government says that it is trying to rectify the public finances and eliminate the national debt, but what has occurred under the Taoiseach's stewardship as the Minister for Finance and the Government's leader is a complete inability to deliver projects on time and within cost.  I have given the most famous examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">It may be the case that there could be another five Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform before what the current Minister discussed this morning sees completion.  Despite this, a man was arrested on Holy Thursday and kept in Mountjoy Prison over the weekend for not having a dog licence.  The spectrum of incompetence and money wastage is incredible.  It was appropriate for the Taoiseach to say that he wanted to get value for money, but he would not know what that was even were it to jump up and bite the Government in the face.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">As a former Minister for Finance, does the Taoiseach accept that the money spent on e-voting machines, where returning officers were given no criteria for their storage, the PPARS system and the consultancy fees wasted on the Abbotstown development and the Thornton Hall proposal is dead money?</p>

In relation to the question of money that could go to a children's hospital, I think that Fine Gael's proposal was that we should build two.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">While this decision has been noted by Government, I want in the strongest terms to say that we are fully committed to replacing the Mountjoy Prison complex with a new prison complex at Thornton Hall.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will bring his comprehensive new proposals to Government in a matter of weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">The Taoiseach did not answer the question I asked.  I asked him if he accepted, as a former Minister for Finance and as the current Taoiseach, that the money spent on e-voting machines, the PPARS computer system, consultancy for Abbotstown and a proposed development at Thornton Hall is now dead money.  It was wasted by his Government and by him, as a former Minister for Finance.  It is taxpayers' money, it is dead and gone, but the Taoiseach does not have the courage to admit that.  It is gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">If one stands in a house in Longford where a husband, wife and three sons are unemployed, it is a situation replicated all over the country.  The Taoiseach comes in here and says: "We will rectify the public finances, we are getting great value for money, we are a Government that delivers projects on time and budget, which are very necessary for the people."</p>
          <p eId="para_43">The model the Taoiseach has adopted was under the PPP system.  The urban regeneration programme and the prison are now dead.  It is perfectly obvious that major finance for major public projects is in serious difficulty.  What is the Taoiseach's plan to deliver on the interconnector, the schools building programme, the DART interconnector and other major pieces of infrastructure?  If the cost of borrowing under the PPP scheme is too high, and apparently it is, with urban regeneration and the prison gone, and other programmes to follow, does the Taoiseach have a plan?</p>

          <p eId="para_72">It is precisely because of the fact we have that asset in place that we will be able to proceed with a prison, which is needed.  The Mountjoy complex is nearly 160 years old and we need to replace it.  Therefore, we will proceed with this project in a different way, on the basis of a proposal that will come from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in the coming weeks.  There will be 400 extra places available to come into commission in the meantime at Wheatfield, Castlerea and Portlaoise.  They are already built and should be ready to come on stream during the course of this year.  It is important that we continue with a prison building programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">Regarding the PPP system itself, it will continue to be a feature of how we finance capital projects.  I was in Shannon during the week where an excellent community school was built by PPP.  There are four schools in my own constituency built by PPP.  There are excellent examples in, I believe, Tubbercurry in Sligo, where there is a similar arrangement.  There are certain times, in meeting the various criteria in which public-private partnerships have to operate, where it can be an option to go ahead.  It has worked well in many instances, including regeneration projects in this city.  There are other projects where, because of financial problems, they have not been proceeded with and we have to find other options.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">It is clear to me that we need to replace the Mountjoy complex and do so in a manner that recognises the market conditions in the building industry, the changed economic circumstances we are in today and, ultimately, protects the taxpayers' interests.  That is the basis for the decisions which have been taken.  It is the change in the marketplace, in terms of the cost of financing, that has been the main issue here, and I want to make that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">Deputy Kenny asked what would happen regarding certain other major projects.  Urban regeneration, on which we spent €190 million last year, will continue to a similar scale this year.  We will continue to roll out public transport projects, as we have been doing in this city, increase capacity and user numbers and provide a very modern and impressive stock of public transport.  Previously, our investment in our public transport system totalled a princely sum of zero when the Opposition was in office.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">The Taoiseach says the Government is getting out of the PPP arrangement for the Thornton Hall project because of concerns about value for money.  These concerns about value for money on this project are coming very late.  I suggest the Taoiseach is now desperately playing catch-up on the value for money issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">Just three weeks ago, on 22 April, my colleagues, Deputies Pat Rabbitte and Mary Upton asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, about this project.  Deputy Upton's question asked specifically if the Minister was satisfied about the capacity of the preferred bidder to deliver this project.  The Minister told her negotiations with the preferred bidder were then at an advanced stage.  A few weeks later, we are told the Irish Prison Service has discontinued that arrangement for reasons of value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">This side of the House has been telling the Government since this project was initiated that there were questions about value for money thereon.  When we raised it in 2005, for example, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. McDowell, told us, "I am confident that in five or seven years, when the full campus at Thornton Hall is completed, the public will look back on these days and be grateful for the foresight and leadership the Government has shown".</p>

          <p eId="para_85">In addition to that, we have to add in the €26 million that was paid in 2007 for the two acre former cash and carry site adjoining Mountjoy Prison in anticipation that Mountjoy would be closing down and moving out to Thornton Hall and that the Mountjoy site would be redeveloped.  The Taoiseach should remember that purchase because, as Minister for Finance, he approved the payment of the €26 million for the two acre site.  It is now locked up.  The plan was that there would be a great development of a new commercial village on the site of the old Mountjoy Prison when it moved out to Thornton Hall.  Now we are told that the plan for Thornton Hall is awaiting some new proposals from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">What is the alternative method by which the Thornton Hall project will now be advanced?

The prison will meet the functionality and requirements of a prison in a way that will provide better value for money than that which is currently available under the existing arrangements and on the basis of the current design.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">On the question of the development of Mountjoy, people opposed to Thornton Hall have held the view that Mountjoy Prison could be developed.  As we know, it is a fully operational prison.  It is not feasible to redevelop Mountjoy as a prison unless one were to find alternative location for the 1,100 people who are currently in the prison, and to bring them back following the redevelopment.  That is not a feasible option.  We are still committed, upon the completion of a new prison at Thornton Hall, to proceed with a development at the Mountjoy complex and to provide an excellent project there for the people of that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">In respect to what is different now to what was the case previously, discussions were taking place at an official level between the Prison Service and the consortium.  The Minister was not directly involved in those discussions.  The invitation to negotiate was on foot of the tender which was accepted in January 2007.  Therefore, a series of discussions had to take place in terms of lining up the finance, the cost of that finance, the financial package and to see whether there was a prospect within the rules of negotiating an acceptable outcome in terms of the financing of the project.  That was not possible because it was complicated by the fact that the cost of financing such projects is more expensive in the aftermath of the financial and banking crisis we have seen in recent months than was the case previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">The bottom line in any event was that based on legal advice and the proper way to proceed people would have been put on notice to put their final positions.  Those that were put were considered and the Prison Service made a decision to end the negotiations with the preferred bidder.  The Minister has indicated that a revised proposal will be submitted to the Government.  I accept that will involve some delay as the project will not now proceed in the timely fashion one would have hoped because of the inability to find a sustainable financial package from the point of view of the State that would represent the value for money we would expect.  Therefore, we will proceed in this way.  Thornton Hall will be utilised for the purpose for which it was purchased.  It was purchased in the main out of moneys from the prison estate itself, from the sale of 18 acres in Shanganagh for 150 acres in Thornton Hall.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">The Taoiseach made a couple of references to the prudence of the financial arrangements for Thornton Hall and he explained how it was purchased from the sale of the land in Shanganagh.  I know the land in Shanganagh, it is in my constituency.  There was a prison there for juvenile boys and the Government closed it down although it is not the kind of facility that deserved to be closed down, especially in these times.  The Taoiseach should stop pretending that there has been a big saving to the State in this regard.  The land was sold to the local authority.  It is one arm of the public purse selling to another.  The Taoiseach should not pretend there were big savings on the purchase of Thornton Hall.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">On the discontinuation of the arrangement with the preferred bidder, why was that suddenly brought to a halt when only a couple of weeks ago the — I was going to say the Taoiseach, he probably has aspirations in that direction — Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform told us the negotiations were at an advanced stage. Twelve months ago to the day, one of the principals involved in the consortium pulled out of the PPP arrangement for urban renewal in Dublin.  I recall raising the issue with the Taoiseach at that time.  My colleagues, Deputies Costello, Shortall and Upton raised with the Government at that time the implications for Thornton Hall.  The Taoiseach told us everything was fine.  It was flagged well in advance that there was a problem with the project yet it has come suddenly to a halt.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">The Taoiseach has told us a lot about the process by which the decision was arrived at but I want to know what is now going to happen with Thornton Hall.  He told us he is going to build something on the site.</p>

            <p eId="para_140">I recently met with the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board during my Saint Patrick's Day visit to the United States.  The body provides a structure through which the thinking of the most senior and successful leaders of corporate Irish-America can be conveyed directly, and at the highest level, to the Government.  My Department maintains contact with the body primarily through the Irish Embassy in Washington, as well as through visits and meetings.</p>

            <p eId="para_141">On 5 May, President Obama proposed major changes to tax rules for American companies operating in Ireland, and the Government is aware of this.  The White House identified Bermuda, Ireland and the Netherlands as low tax countries that account for nearly one third of all foreign profits reported by US corporations in 2003.  The President believes that the current rules that encourage US companies to take advantage of low tax regimes overseas need to be overhauled.  Has the Government carried out an assessment of the major American companies based in Ireland and how they might be affected by this statement from Washington, in view of the great number of people that these companies employ here?  Has the Taoiseach asked any of his Ministers to make direct contact with the directors of those corporations here to see how they are assessing the impact of President Obama's comments?  Has he directed the Irish ambassador in Washington or his staff to make contact with the White House about how Ireland might potentially lose serious revenue?</p>
            <p eId="para_142">When the Taoiseach visited the US recently, he launched a review of Irish-US relations, which proposed the establishment of a new Irish-American leadership council.  What progress has been made on that?  Have any further meetings taken place?  Is there a scheme in mind or a structure to deal with the review of the relations between Ireland and the US?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_117">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_143">I raised the tax deferral issue with President Obama when I met him on Saint Patrick's Day.  At that time, the President confirmed that this was an issue not to be resolved overnight.  He was mindful of the possible impact on Ireland, but he would act with caution and would be ready to discuss any potential unintended consequences.  The Tánaiste also met with senior members of the US Administration to discuss the issue, including the Treasury Secretary, Mr. Geithner, in a visit to Washington on 20 and 21 April.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">The proposals published on 4 May now go to the US Congress for consideration and these have potentially wide ranging effects on investments made by US companies worldwide.  The US will be anxious not to hurt its global competitiveness.  A senior IDA executive is working with our embassy in Washington to monitor and engage with the issue.  Senior officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs, the IDA and the Revenue Commissioners have been meeting regularly on US tax policy issues.  The Government will continue to ensure that the message of the positive experience of US companies based in Ireland and competing in Europe feeds into the deliberations of the Obama Administration and of the US Congress.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">One of the cornerstones of America's success has been its leading role as a global trading nation.  The US National Bureau for Economic Research has estimated that every dollar invested abroad by American multinational companies generates $3.50 in investment back in the US.  American companies have invested in Ireland not out of sentiment but because they have seen excellent returns.  These investments generate profits which protect and create jobs and investment in both Ireland and the US.  They help to develop the centres of management excellence, the active networks and the deep pools of knowledge that are essential to economic recovery in both countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">The Irish-American leadership council has not yet been set up, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs is working on it.  We are also looking at bringing a major seminar to Ireland in September, which will be a timely occasion to proceed with that initiative.  Our embassy, staff and ambassador will be maintaining a close liaison with the various committees of the House of Representatives who will be dealing with the Obama proposals, including the ways and means committee.  We expect Congressman Richie Neal to be the vice chairman.  He has been an outstanding friend to Ireland over many years and on many issues.  We also have a number of contacts in Congress that will enable us to monitor closely congressional thinking on these matters.  As I stated, this is a process that will continue for some months, if not years.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, would he consider it appropriate that the Minister of State liaise directly with the directors of American corporations in Ireland?  Has the Taoiseach received any expressions of concern from American plants in Ireland which repatriate their profits and as such would be subject to the changed rules proposed from the White House?  Would he deem it appropriate that an accurate report be compiled of these firms, which employ 100,000 people in Ireland, in order to obtain from them a firsthand account of what is likely to happen?  Has the Taoiseach received any expressions of concern from such firms?</p>

            <p eId="para_148">Corporate America will be making its views known and setting out how it sees the proposal developing and evolving in terms of its meeting policy objectives.  While we must respect the right of any government to set out a taxation policy we will need to use the good relationship we enjoy with the US Administration and Congress to ensure all aspects, or any unintended adverse impacts of the tax proposal as it evolves, are taken into account.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs met a couple of weeks ago at the American Ireland Fund some industrialists from corporate America and spoke with some of their people who have an involvement in the tax issue.  It is a matter of supplementing and augmenting an effort undertaken by corporate America through its interaction with Congress.  As a country with a great deal of foreign direct investment from the United States we will be keeping a close eye on this issue with a view to persuading or influencing in a positive way the evolution of this proposal.  We must take a balanced and sensible approach to this and not make demands left, right and centre that might result in a negative impact.  We must be diplomatic, know what are the issues, focus on them as they affect us and work with others so that the overall outcome is acceptable, in particular from our point of view.</p>

            <p eId="para_149">The Taoiseach has told us about the efforts being made at official level to liaise with US legislators and the US Administration in regard to the taxation issue in the US, which I welcome.  To that end, what contacts are being made at Government level, in particular in the context of the legislation which will be considered on Capitol Hill?  In that context, would the Taoiseach consider it useful to provide briefings to the Opposition parties here on the progress of those contacts and discussions to ensure a united political front on the issue from this end?</p>
            <p eId="para_150">It appears there are a number of issues on which a common position emanating from the main political parties in this State would be helpful, including concern in regard to the changes in the US tax regime, a commitment to the retention of our current rate of corporate tax and a commitment to our future in the European Union.  There are a number of issues which I believe are of concern to US businesses located here and considering locating here.  I suggest that on these issues it is desirable a harmonious voice politically emanates from this State.  I suggest the Taoiseach arrange to have the Opposition parties briefed on the issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_151">I have no problem in principle with keeping Opposition leaders informed of any developments that are noteworthy in terms of movement of the original proposition.  I take Deputy Gilmore's point that it is important, for example, that the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland and other business groups are able to convey to their counterparts in the United States that there is a strong united front on our part to do whatever we can, consistent with proper and appropriate diplomacy and working hand-in-hand with the US Administration and Congress in a positive and constructive way, to ensure we obtain a positive outcome, as we have done in the past when certain tax issues arose and we needed to end up at a point where the Administration's objectives were to a greater or lessor extent met which, at the same time, did not have an adverse impact on arrangements here.  We can correspond with the Opposition parties and keep them updated on these issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_152">The Taoiseach referred to an upcoming conference in September.  Will he share with the House the detail of what exactly is intended?  Is it something akin or related to the Washington conference for trade and investment held in early 1997?  If it is not such an initiative should we be considering one in terms of job retention and creation in this State and of generating interest in regard to the potential and opportunities Ireland offers in terms of inward investment?  Perhaps the Taoiseach will share with the House what exactly is proposed and will provide us with a sense that is the course he is undertaking.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_153">The conference which it is intended to hold in September is a type of global economic forum bringing together people of influence and expertise from the diaspora, not alone from the US but worldwide to discuss developments in the economy over the next ten years.  It will also consider where Ireland fits into that scenario and how it can develop a strategic view of its own policy framework in terms of whether there are other ideas, initiatives or approaches we need to consider.  It will also seek to get the benefit of the ensuing expertise and insight from various people around the world so that Ireland and the Irish Government are up to speed with developments and in a position to identify where, over the next five to ten years, the drivers for growth for the Irish economy might be in terms of job creation and investment policy.  I believe it is a positive exercise which is being well received and responded to.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">The Minister for Foreign Affairs is taking up this initiative on behalf of Government and I look forward to it.  It is, in a way, a wider version of the Ireland America Advisory Board in respect of those in the United States who have been helpful to us down through the years.  Many of the heads of corporate America have been able to indicate to us the trends in technology and various important industries, including pharmaceuticals, IT and others and this has been helpful to us and the IDA in devising investment strategies and plans for some of those companies to locate here, many of which subsequently did so.</p>

            <p eId="para_155">The Taoiseach indicated that the lead Department is the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Will he indicate if the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is also directly involved?  In addition to what has been already outlined, will he indicate if it is intended in September to ensure a proactive approach on the part of the IDA and the various enterprise boards throughout the country to target potential interest while people are here, thus ensuring the conference is not just a sharing of information and a building up of a knowledge base with which to work?  People from a variety of international business interests coming here should also have as part of their itinerary in Ireland a direct engagement with those who are entrusted with promoting the potential of locating here and creating jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_156">If one considers other diasporas, including those from Israel, India and others, it is clear that we have used our diaspora in the United States and in the UK for the purpose of helping to consolidate the peace process, which was a priority and a precondition for establishing some stability and being able to engage the diaspora.  One of the great outcomes of the peace process is that we now have a united diaspora with us.  We have a diaspora that is very knowledgeable about modern Ireland.  We have a very informed public in those countries where our diaspora is located because of its involvement in peace building, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_157">We now need to broaden that approach.  We need to look at talented high achievers who may not be Irish but be of Irish extraction or have a very strong sense of Ireland.  While they may be many generations assimilated into their country of birth they still have a very strong sense of Irishness and want to contribute very positively to the success of Ireland.  That is a broader definition that we need to corral into constructive purpose.  This initiative provides an opportunity to identify many people in dispersed fields of activity who can come to Ireland, sit down on the basis of a very good agenda and work through these issues to help the Government to improve its thinking as to where strategically Ireland can go and where the opportunities might emerge.</p>
            <p eId="para_158">The Minister for Foreign Affairs is organising that initiative for Government and is working across Departments and agencies, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  All of that is being pulled together under his leadership.</p>

            <p eId="para_159">Irish commentators and many significant Irish players in the US have expressed their deep concern that major multinational companies, which have invested in Ireland and collectively employ thousands of people here, may need to seriously consider withdrawing from operating in the country.  Has that concern been raised with the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers?  I do not doubt the integrity of either the officials or the conference the Minister is planning.  However, is it not the case that other countries in this predicament may be using professional lobbyists in America to make their case to the Congress and Senate?  Will the Government consider operating with these professional people in America to make the strongest possible case to the US Administration regarding the concerns of our Government and people in this respect?</p>

            <p eId="para_160">As things stand there are no indications that there is about to be a major outflow of American companies from the country.  There are issues that will now need to be addressed and on which we will need to work.  No kind of exodus is about to begin.  Thankfully we have seen second and third stage investments here in higher end manufacturing and in research and development, which will deepen the roots of these multinational institutions in Ireland for the foreseeable future because of the quality of the people we have available to work.  The research and development regime we have built up encourages Ireland to continue to be a location for such investment.  Ireland still stays very competitive in these areas.  We will continue to adapt our policies to meet those requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_164">There are not people lining up to leave Ireland.  I have said the opposite.  There are people who have been in Ireland and who are investing in Ireland and continue to invest in Ireland.  There has been an increase in the first quarter of this year compared with last year, despite the difficulty of the country's economy contracting by 8% this year.  The level of foreign direct investment in the first quarter has increased compared with the first quarter in 2008.  That is an indication of the wider competitiveness issues that apply in terms of the personnel available, the high-end manufacturing and the value that is added by these types of investments and the fact that Ireland remains an excellent location for such investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">On the point about lobbyists, we use our diplomatic channels and our agencies to put the case on behalf of the State.  They have been doing a fine job in that respect.  There are occasions when some tax specialist needs to be employed to assist.  It may be a tax specialist involved with IDA Ireland, which is the case here.  He is located in the embassy in Washington at present to assist and augment and monitor developments from site and to acquaint himself in a personal way with those to whom he needs to be able to speak and with whom he needs to build up a rapport.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">I do not buy into the argument that the best way to make a case is to get a professional lobbyist.  The best way to make our case is by having people on the ground of competence and ability, who have contacts and are doing their work as good diplomats.  We also augment that with other expertise as required.  That is the sensible approach.  Where certain specialities are required they can be bought in for a limited period of time.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_167">I agree that one of the major causes of concern stems from what President Obama is saying about possible changes in tax laws.  As the Taoiseach outlined, the issue of competitiveness is also very important.  I was in Silicon Valley in March 2008.  The Minister was there at that time.  A senior IDA Ireland official, who was on the delegation with me, said that Irish competitiveness was a major factor in selling Ireland.  He gave the example that the total cost of employing a person in Ireland at that time was $28 per hour.  The total cost of employing somebody in Silicon Valley was $26 per hour.  It was cheaper to employ somebody in Silicon Valley than in Ireland at that time.  In Poland it cost $6 per hour.  That was last March 12 months.  He also emphasised that energy costs were the highest in the competing destinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">I returned there this March — at my own expense.  The chief executive of the chamber of commerce in San José advised us that we were the first Irish group she had met in months.  The Chinese and Indians were queuing up outside her door.  There were three delegations from different cities in China waiting to meet her that morning.  Representatives of one Chinese city were even taking the unit next door to her in order to carry out their lobbying in Silicon Valley.  Apart from the attitude of President Obama to the tax laws, there are other issues that we also need to address.</p>
            <p eId="para_169">There is a very energetic network operating in Silicon Valley, the Irish Technology Leadership Group.  The group presented an award to the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin in March 2008.  It brought over a large number of chief executives to Dublin and the Minister addressed the meeting in Trinity College.  It is bringing chief executives to Northern Ireland in October.  The proposed forum to be held in September will be in competition with what it is trying to do in Northern Ireland.  We need to be careful to explain to these people, who are spending the money from their own pockets, that there will not be a conflict between both conferences.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_170">I assure the Deputy that there is no competition or problem.  The more delegations that come, both North and South, the more we welcome them.  If we get 20 of them in the same month, all the better as far I am concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_171">I am aware of the Irish Technology Leadership Group and have met its representatives who are doing very good work.  They have made a commitment to also working on the Northern side, which is perfectly fine.  The IDA's record as a State agency speaks for itself.  I do not claim everything was got right on every occasion but much more was done correctly than wrongly in regard to this country's foreign direct investment policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_172">We have also become the tenth largest investor in the United States.  Overseas investment between our countries is a two-way flow and Irish companies employ more than 82,000 people across all 50 of the United States.  That statistic is not well known.  Last year alone, more than 27 companies opened offices in the United States and more than 40 Irish companies have a presence in New York.</p>
            <p eId="para_173">The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland relative to the size of the economy is one of the highest in the world.  More than 1,000 multinational companies operate in Ireland, including many of the leaders in information technology and software, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, life sciences and international financial services.</p>

            <p eId="para_177">US businesses form the biggest component of these investments.  More than 450 US companies operate in Ireland and they have invested over $55 billion in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_178">In regard to competitiveness issues, significant adjustments are clearly being made to labour cost competitiveness in the context of this downturn.  The European Commission and others have commented on the flexibility displayed by the Irish workforce in taking wage cuts across many sectors not only in the interest of maintaining the maximum level of employment as we go through this downturn and its reduced orders and real economic effects, but also in response to the need to address the competitiveness question.  It is also clear that labour cost competitiveness is not the full picture when it comes to competitiveness.  Ireland's ability to compete also relates to the quality of our people, the output of our work and the higher productivity available here.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">In regard to why people invest, certain sectors of American industry, such as low end manufacturing, are no longer interested in coming to Ireland because they can find better locations at home in the United States or in South America and other parts of the world.  For some time, Ireland's strategy has been to enter the area of high value manufacturing because that is where the best wages are provided for our people.  That strategy has worked very well for us.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">Jobs churn in every country or society that matures and develops.  Thankfully we are all earning better wages now than we did 25 years ago because the jobs of that period are now located elsewhere.  The jobs now available could never have been contemplated without the various changes that have taken place and the investments made in education and research and development.  I have been told in New York by certain industries that they could not consider Ireland as a location once they learned our average industrial wage.  However, other companies, including the leaders in several sectors of the modern economy, have located here and many spin off jobs arise from their investments as Irish entrepreneurs feed into the supply chains and begin to internationalise their businesses.  This is reflected in the two-way trade that now takes place between the United States and Ireland not only in volume or value terms, but also in the cross-investments in US companies by Irish entrepreneurs to the tune of directly employing 82,000 over there.</p>

            <p eId="para_186">I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">My advisers are Joe Lennon, programme manager; Gerry Steadman, special adviser; Brian Murphy, special adviser; Declan Ryan, special adviser; Peter Clinch, special adviser; and Oliver O'Connor, special adviser to the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">The programme manager at my Department is the principal special adviser appointed by the Government.  The role and duties of special advisers are described in section 11 of the Public Service Management Act 1997.  In summary, these comprise providing advice, monitoring, facilitating and securing the achievement of Government objectives that relate to the Department as requested and performing such other functions as may be directed.  Under the direction of the programme manager, the primary function of the special advisers is to monitor, facilitate and help secure the achievement of Government objectives and to ensure effective co-ordination in the implementation of the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">I appointed Mr. Pádraig Slyne as special adviser to the Chief Whip.   I also appointed three non-established civil servants to the Office of the Government Chief Whip, one of whom is based in the Whip's private office and two in his Finglas constituency office, where they are work sharers.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">In addition, I appointed Mr. Eoghan Ó Neachtain as Government press secretary and two deputy Government press secretaries, Mr. Mark Costigan and Mr. John Downing.  They are supported by two non-established civil servants.  The Government press secretary and press officers provide a public information service on Government policy the national and international media on behalf of myself, my Department and the Government and promote a co-ordinated approach to media matters across all Departments.  The central task of the deputy Government press secretaries is to assist the Government press secretary in communicating to the media the decisions of Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_191">The personal assistants and personal secretaries in my Department have a range of duties including providing administrative assistance in the constituency office, protocol division and the Office of the Government Chief Whip.  The Green Party programme manager, although based in Government Buildings, is not a member of staff of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">Special advisers are tasked with giving me advice and keeping me informed on a wide range of issues, including business, financial, economic, political, environmental, administrative and media matters and performing such other functions as may be directed by me from time to time.  In addition, a number of my advisers have specific responsibilities for speech drafting.  My programme manager meets other ministerial advisers on a weekly basis and reports to me on progress thereon.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">Special advisers are appointed by Government decision under section 11 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 and with reference to Department of Finance directions on ministerial staff appointments.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">On the recommendation of the Attorney General, Mr. Paul Gallagher, Mr. Francis Kieran was appointed as special assistant to the Attorney General to act as a liaison between his office, myself and other Departments on matters relevant to the programme for Government and to keep the Attorney General informed on items arising in the Oireachtas or media which could impinge on or be relevant to his role.  The position of Attorney General is not a political position and as such Mr. Kieran does not provide political advice.</p>

            <p eId="para_195">The Government spent €6.2 million in 2008 on special advisers, media advisers and other personally appointed staff.  Given the commitment to reduce public service pay by 3%, does the Taoiseach agree that it is time to examine the scale of appointments of special advisers to Ministers and Ministers of State?</p>
            <p eId="para_196">The Minister for Health and Children is in second place to the Taoiseach, having spent over €514,000 in 2008 on personal appointments and special advisers.  The Taoiseach's predecessor defended the number of advisers to the Minister on the basis that she was the leader of the minority party in Government.  Given that is no longer the case, I ask the Taoiseach to comment on whether this is still appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_197">Why is the Minister's former programme manager now paid for by the Department of the Taoiseach?  His title has been changed to "special adviser to the Minister for Health and Children".  Is this some kind of creative accountancy or what is the reason for it?  Given that the Minister also has a press officer in the Government information service, why is this necessary at a time when wards are being closed and people are complaining about a variety of health service issues?  Substantial sums of money are obviously involved, so the Taoiseach might like to comment.</p>

I believe that, because it is such an important Department which is undergoing major reforms, there is plenty of work to be done by him on behalf of the Government and the Minister for Health and Children and he is attached to my office on the basis that only a limited number of advisers can be appointed to any particular ministerial post.  There is no such limit in my Department.</p>

Were requests made by his Department to the Minister for Finance to sanction the filling of vacancies in his political staff since the Government circular issued on 27 March?  In reply to previous questions on this issue, the Taoiseach told us there would be a 10% reduction in the costs of ministerial offices and offices of Ministers of State.

Unemployment has increased by almost 90% on what it was this time last year.  The health service is on its knees throughout the country and law and order is out of control.  What experience or qualifications have special advisers?  Were they interviewed for the positions they hold?  In the past Fianna Fáil appointed people with no experience and there was a jobs for the boys culture within the organisation.

            <p eId="para_217">Are all of the programme managers paid out of the Votes of individual Ministers?  In other words, is the programme manager for the Minister for Foreign Affairs paid out of that Department's Vote?  I recall the time the programme manager concept was introduced and, at its core, it has had an impact on freeing up the business being done by Ministers.  Why is the programme manager for the Minister for Health Children paid for by the Department of the Taoiseach?  Is there a specific reason for that if every other programme manager is paid for out of individual Votes?  The Department of Health and Children has another press officer attached to the Government Information Service.  Why is this when Professor Drumm has a battery of media staff and spin doctors to continually send out streams of information about what is happening or not happening, as the case might be, in the HSE?</p>

            <p eId="para_218">The health matters of Government have to be communicated to the public and dealt with in the normal way.  The Department of Health and Children has its requirements in that regard as well and the person concerned does an excellent job.  He is highly respected by the profession with whom he deals.  As I said in regard to Mr. O'Connor, health is a huge issue for the Government and future Governments and they need someone with the expertise and ability to fashion the reforms that are necessary and ongoing.  The reason the programme manager is paid for by my Department is that there is no limit on the number of advisers attached to my Department.</p>

There clearly is a need for the Government to take action in this respect.  It is not only about dealing with the financial institutions, but also about dealing with the reality that is affecting ordinary people in their daily lives.  Until this issue is tackled there will be a continuing serious deterioration in people's confidence that politics can address their core difficulties.  I urge the Taoiseach to offer some hope in this respect and I would appreciate his reply.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">As regards the specific question from the Leader of the Opposition, there is no section of the Finance Bill, as published, relating to VAT.  Three ministerial amendments relating to one item on VAT are now being introduced.  This requires a new Part 3 on VAT to be introduced between sections 18 and 19 of the Bill as published.  The part on VAT normally follows that on excise in the Finance Acts.  The amendments relate to a VAT on property anti-avoidance provisions and insert a new part into the Finance Bill containing three sections.  These form a package of measures which amend sections 7 and 7B of the VAT Act to close off a loophole in the VAT on property legislation, which has been used to avoid paying VAT in certain circumstances.  The avoidance mechanism relied on misinterpreting a particular provision in the VAT Act, which was designed to prevent double taxation.</p>

In consultation with the Attorney General's office and other Departments, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has examined the convention and identified what legislation in the criminal law area is required to give effect to its provisions.  The Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 provides for certain necessary measures.  The remaining legislative requirements concerning bribery of foreign public officials and protection for whistleblowers will be dealt with in the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2008 which completed Second Stage in the Dáil on 30 October 2008 and is due to commence Committee Stage shortly.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform expects that once the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill is enacted it should be possible to proceed to ratify the convention.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">The report that will be officially published at 2.30 p.m. by the Ryan commission, which started as the Laffoy commission, will pierce through the culture of secrecy which for decades has covered up the extent of abuse, both physical and sexual, of young people in institutions throughout the State.  In this context, I join with other Deputies in asking for time to be set aside next week to debate these reports and the recommendations emerging from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The commission has been sitting for nine years and what we will read in today's reports depicts events that happened in the past.  What is relevant to today's Order Paper is that the culture of secrecy in this area continues at the behest of the State and its failures to provide transparency and illuminate the light of what is happening in our child care services.  I will ask the Taoiseach to address a number of matters, all of which are proper to the Order of Business.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">No. 72<i>a</i> on today’s Dáil Order Paper proposes that the Monageer report, which has been censored to such a degree that even recommendations are censored, be forthwith referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in full and uncensored so the committee can consider its publication and consider received submissions on recommendations.  Will the Taoiseach take this motion tomorrow morning in Government time without debate?  The Minister for Health and Children, subsequent to my raising this, has publicly gone on the record outside the House to indicate that she may consider such procedure, giving the Government an opportunity to lift the veil of secrecy from that report.</p>

What is the Government doing to obtain from the HSE the reports on our child protection services covering the years 2007 and 2008?  The reports should have been published by now; the 2007 report is a year and a half late.  Since 1991, there is a statutory obligation under the relevant legislation on children to publish these reports.  They should have been laid before the House by now.

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_368">The report being published today is to be welcomed.  It fulfils the Government's intention in setting up the commission that the story of the residents was told.  Inevitably, the report will show up failings of the State and others in providing care and protection to these children.  The then Taoiseach's apology in 1999 was an admission of failings on the part of the State, and the report now tells that story.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">I acknowledge the work done by the members of the commission and the members of the confidential committee and particularly that of the chairperson, Judge Sean Ryan, and his predecessor, Judge Mary Laffoy.  I acknowledge the co-operation of many with the work of the commission, particularly the former residents for whom it must have been a difficult and traumatic experience.  The commission was one of range of measures put in place by the Government to address the effects of abuse.  These included the Residential Institutions Redress Board, the Education Finance Board, the national counselling service, the funding of survivor groups and funding of an information and tracing service.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">The State has already indicated at the public hearings of the commission its regret for certain inadequacies in discharging its function relating to the industrial and reformatory school system.  Areas identified were funding, inspections, handling of complaints and education and training.  Apart from the findings, the report might contain recommendations to alleviate or address the effects of the abuse suffered by those attending the commission and to prevent any further incidents of institutional abuse.  Such recommendations will have to be taken on board by the State, particularly with regard to procedures and guidelines for child protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I understand the report comprises 3,500 pages.  Relevant Departments will require time to consider the contents and the recommendations.  The Government will carefully study the findings and recommendations to ensure they are fully considered in light of current practices and to ensure our children enjoy the highest standards of care and protection.  It is also important to mention that while the Government can put in place procedures and measures for the protection of our children, we all as a society must be alert to the dangers that exist, be vigilant as to what is happening in our communities and have the courage to intervene when the well-being of a child is at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The Whips can discuss this matter.  Everybody will have an opportunity to consider this thorough and comprehensive report.  I thank everybody who was involved in producing it.  It will show what lessons must be learned and acknowledge the great failings of the State and many others in the care of children who were held in a custodial manner for many years at a time when the criminal justice system was totally different, thankfully, from the one I hope we have now.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">With regard to the matters raised by Deputy Shatter, efforts are being made by the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, to find out if there is a way the legal advice issues can be dealt with so an Oireachtas committee can continue to consider the report.  That process is ongoing between the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, and the chairman of the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">I am not aware of the position regarding the report on child protection services.  I will check it out.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">The Monageer report was with the Government for six months before it was published.  It should have been possible to go back and check procedures.  The procedure now proposed by Fine Gael is the procedure used in 1996 to publish the report into the tragic death of Kelly Fitzgerald.  The legal advice obtained never addresses this issue.  On the very day we are piercing the veil of secrecy over the abuse of children in institutions in this State we should not be maintaining secrecy over a report published about the tragic death of a family and particularly the deaths of two children who died at the hands of at least one of their parents.  Could the Government regard this as a priority?</p>
          <p eId="para_376">With regard to the HSE, I have raised the two reports in this House in the past and afforded time for them to be published.  Our current child protection services are broken.  The apology given by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is meaningless in the context of children currently at risk——</p>

He tries to conjunct an issue which we all agree was appalling — the vista that will emerge with respect to a bygone time which is, thankfully, no longer with us — and which relates to institutional facilitation of abuse with another tragedy which took place in recent times.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, has been anxious to put the facts of that case to the fullest extent possible in the public domain for discussion.  There is no veil of secrecy involved.  It is a question of the protection of rights, something the Deputy would be very quick to defend in his own profession,——</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_535">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I am pleased to have this opportunity to introduce the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 to the House.  The Bill contains a range of different measures which it is appropriate to address by way of legislation at this time to further improve the overall criminal justice system and update existing statutes in some areas where it is decided there is a need to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">I will first address the issue of firearms.  I am determined to ensure that a gun culture is not allowed to form in this State.  That determination has shaped my thinking in shaping this Bill, a substantial and important part of which is devoted to the licensing of firearms and associated issues.  In total, there are 17 firearms and offensive weapons related sections which can be grouped into the following categories: public safety and control issues; technical matters; and efficiency and modernisation measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">I will deal first with the sections which deal with matters of public safety and control.  Section 28<b> </b>addresses the licensing of handguns.  For more than 30 years prior to 2004, all handguns were effectively banned in this jurisdiction.  Following a series of judicial decisions, however, almost 2,000 handguns have been licensed in the past five years.  This has come to pass without Government, Oireachtas or public policy decision and has resulted in an unacceptable new trend in the growth of handgun ownership which the House should now end.  It would be disturbing if the assumption that a positive outcome for some shooting interest groups in some judicial review cases on licensing matters was somehow seen as an accretion of rights.  This is flawed logic and I want to dispel any notions that there are any inherent rights to be considered here.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I am aware that some people have a strongly held view that once they are of good character and make the necessary secure arrangements for the storage of their firearms, they should be free to have firearms of any kind licensed to them.  I do not agree with this view as it would constitute an unacceptable position where our gun laws could mirror those of countries such as those of the United States.  If the current position were to continue unchecked, this scenario would be realised.  We cannot allow this to happen.  It is my duty as Minister to call "Stop" and address the current specific issues and longer-term strategic issues at the heart of thismatter.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I would never be satisfied with circumstances in which firearms were freely available or, as in some jurisdictions, a notification system were in place under which one purchases a firearm and informs the authorities afterwards.  I was conscious of the remarks made by Mr. Justice Peter Charleton in the High Court last July that a reasonable person is entitled to feel alarmed at the proliferation of handguns.  I am aware, too, of calls made by many Members of the Oireachtas from parties on both sides to address this matter.  It was against this background that I directed my Department and the Garda Síochána to carry out an urgent and intensive review of the firearms law.  Following from that review, my proposals for reform in this area include a ban on issuing new licences for handguns, although there will be limited exceptions for handguns designed for use in connection with competitions governed by International Olympic Committee regulations.  As I announced at that time, those who already have licences can, when they are due for renewal, apply to have them renewed albeit under the new licensing procedure where the safety of the community will be paramount.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_543">I will deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">In the wake of my announcement in November last I received a number of representations, both for and against the handgun ban, but I especially note the endorsement by the chief inspector of the Garda Síochána Inspectorate who draws on her own very considerable experience of policing in the United States.  She was quoted as saying that many guns used in the commission of crime in the United States are guns that have been stolen from their rightful owners.  A number of handguns here have been stolen from licence holders.  Those guns, by definition, are immediately in criminal hands.  I stress that it is not only the possibility of licensed firearms falling into the hands of criminals which concerns me.  There are other issues involved and, in particular, I regard the growth of a handgun culture as not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">The International Action Network on Small Arms reported at the time of the announcement:  "Unlike the UK, which imposed the ban in response to the Dunblane school shooting in 1996, the Irish government decided to act before a major tragedy involving handguns occurs".  It is right that we take this action now rather than endure a tragedy at some point in the future when people would rightly ask us, as politicians, why we did nothing in advance to prevent it, particularly in view of the recent statement by Mr. Justice Charleton in the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">I also intend, in section 29, to prohibit the form of target shooting known as practical or dynamic shooting.  This type of shooting involves firearms being used in simulated combat or combat training and is anathema to most target shooters.  In so far as it is akin to police and military tactical training it is an undesirable activity not rooted in any tradition in Ireland and one which should not have any place in our society.  I am informed that the majority of mainstream shooting organisations in Ireland have disassociated themselves from it, and this speaks volumes.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Section 31 brings under tighter control the importation of firearms and ammunition by specifying that such importation may only be made by a registered firearms dealer on foot of an importation licence having being granted by my Department.  As well as assuring greater control, this measure also anticipates the EU weapons directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">In Irish law firearms are already divided into two categories, those being non-restricted and restricted.  The Bill proposes a measure to increase the sophistication of our ability to categorise firearms.  It introduces the concept of a prohibited firearm, and section 25 proposes that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should have the residual powers to be able to declare certain firearms and ammunition to be prohibited.  I will, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner, keep the situation on firearms licensing under review in the interests of public safety.  This residual power will, in particular, allow me to address any issues which arise threatening the safety of the community.  It is important to stress that my proposals will not impinge adversely on the activities of the vast majority of licensed firearms holders in this country.  I recognise that those firearms holders pursue their legitimate interests in a law abiding way and I am anxious to have a well regulated sector in which those interests can be successfully pursued, in co-operation with the relevant authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Section 35 regulates the sale and use of realistic imitation firearms, including devices known as airsoft.  These items are practically indistinguishable from real firearms and have on occasion been used to intimidate, to rob and in anti-social behaviour.  There is also a very real possibility of a tragic incident occurring should armed members of the Garda Síochána be called out in response to reports of a person carrying or brandishing one of these realistic imitation firearms.  I will be making their possession in a public place a serious offence.  The relevant associations have been involved in an ongoing dialogue with my Department and these proposals to regulate and control airsoft activities should come as no surprise.  Some of the measures in this section were requested by those who play airsoft in order to protect their activity from irresponsible and casual purchasers.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">I turn now to my proposals to limit knife crime.  There are two sections relating to knives and bladed or sharply-pointed weapons.  Although the number of murders — the most serious crime committed involving knives — fell from 37 to 15 last year there is no room for complacency.  The overall number of crimes committed using knives is a matter of great concern to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">In any discussion about offensive weapons, there is one aspect of the problem we must confront.  Items used as offensive weapons are often items which are in legitimate, everyday, mundane usage.  This makes it almost impossible to distinguish by legal definition between knives which have a legitimate use and those the sale of which might be undesirable.  Even if this was to be attempted it would prove futile in practice as quite ordinary kitchen knives or tools, the sale of which could not be prohibited, could be just as lethal in the wrong hands as anything which might be prohibited and are all too often the weapons used to cause death or serious injury.  That is why the law must concentrate on the circumstances in which these items are in a person's possession.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Last year I requested the Garda Commissioner to conduct a review of the provisions of the existing legislation, in the context of the increased use of offensive weapons in assaults and murders.  The purpose of the review was to identify aspects of the legislation that may require strengthening from an enforcement perspective.  I also asked him to look at international trends.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">There are two sections contained in this Bill on the control of weapons arising from these fatal stabbings.  I propose, in section 34, to increase the maximum prison sentence for possessing a knife in a public place from one year to five years<b> </b>and, in section 36, to extend the power of search without warrant in circumstances where a member of An Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds to suspect a person is carrying any article for unlawful purposes. I also intend to create a new firearms and offensive weapons order to deal with the issue of samurai swords.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">A number of the sections — sections 23, 24, 30, 32, 33, 37, 38 and 39 -<b> </b>are purely technical amendments which themselves are of no great policy significance.  These technical amendments, along with the efficiency and modernisation measures contained in sections 26, 27 and 28, will permit the transformation to a comprehensive and efficient firearms licensing regime, including making the changes necessary for the implementation of the final outstanding sections of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 to be commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Section 26 provides for the changeover from the current one year system where all licences expire on 31 July to a new three-year system with phased expiry so that the work involved in applying the new regime can be spread out over a 12 month period.  Section 28 provides for the outsourced collection of the over 230,000 firearms certificate fees and will free up a significant amount of Garda time as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The new three-year licence for firearms is a big and a welcome step forward in terms of efficiency and customer service.  With this step-change comes logical improvements in how we license firearms including secure storage, taking up references from applicants and acquiring consent to make medical inquiries where that may be necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">On the question of how this legislation will impact on the shooting sports community, there has been an unprecedented level of consultation with shooting groups during the development of the Bill.  Consultations have been intensive and productive.  My predecessor established the firearms consultative panel comprising of the shooting interest groups, the Garda Síochána and members of my Department to assist with the introduction of the firearms licensing regime provided for under the Criminal Justice Act 2006 and this panel has met on a regular basis for the past 18 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">My Department also held a firearms conference in May 2008 with over 100 delegates from shooting interest groups, Departments and An Garda Síochána in attendance.  In February 2009 my Department — in conjunction with Countryside Alliance Ireland, as sponsor — held a further seminar focused on forthcoming legislation regulating shooting clubs and ranges.  As a result of this inclusion and active participation, the proposals in the Bill will not come as a surprise to the legitimate and responsible hunters and target shooters of the country.  I believe that the contents of the Bill will be accepted and even welcomed by many of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Section 27 allows the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or the Minister to issue guidelines on the practical application of the Firearms Acts.  I understand that the Garda Commissioner, as head of the licensing authority, proposes to introduce guidelines which will be publicly available.  These guidelines will attempt to address one of the main criticisms of the current licensing system, namely a lack of uniformity in the application of the Firearms Acts and the processing of applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">In addition to these guidelines, the Garda Síochána established a firearms policy unit in 2008.  This has helped to ensure that the Commissioner's policies on firearms licensing are clearly understood and standardised throughout the force and has also been invaluable in resolving problems and complaints regarding applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">I should give notice to the House that I may consider further minor amendments on Committee Stage to clarify certain matters relating to range certification and to clarify that restricted firearms may only be held by a named person on the certificate.  I am also considering extending the requirement for tax clearance certification to dealers in realistic imitation firearms.  There will also be a minor typographical amendment to section 31 on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">The firearms legislation stretches back more than 80 years and across five main Acts and has been criticised by commentators from the legal profession as being difficult to interpret.  The Law Reform Commission has scheduled a restatement of the Firearms Act that will help to alleviate this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Part 1 of the Bill contains the standard preliminary features of all legislative proposals, including the Short Title, the interpretation section and the provision that the Exchequer will bear the costs of administering the Bill when enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">On the substantive provisions, Part 2 contains amendments to the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005.  The European Arrest Warrant Act gave effect to the EU framework decision on the European arrest warrant, EAW, and replaced extradition arrangements between member states with a system of surrender based on arrest warrants issued by their judicial authorities.  The amendments proposed in this Part are necessary to deal with issues that have arisen in the administration and implementation of the Act.  As the House will be aware, the Act has been in operation for more than five years and there is a better understanding here and across all member states of how the EAW system works.  The proposed amendments are timely and will enhance the operation of the EAW system while safeguarding the rights of persons whose surrender is sought on foot of such warrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Section 4 amends section 2 of the European Arrest Warrant Act by inserting a number of definitions used in the substantive sections of the Bill.  It also deletes the definition of "facsimile copy".  This is consequential on an amendment to section 12 of the Act, which concerns transmission of documents and which I shall deal with later.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Section 5 deletes sections 4(2) and 4(3) of the 2003 Act.  These subsections were inserted at the time to accommodate declarations made by Austria, Italy and France pursuant to Article 32 of the framework decision that requests for surrender sent to those states for offences committed before the dates specified in the declarations would be dealt with under the old extradition arrangements rather than the EAW system.  An unintended effect of the subsections is that Ireland cannot accept EAWs from these countries relating to acts committed before the dates specified in the declarations.  This section is being amended to remedy that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Section 6 amends section 10 of the Act by deleting the word "duly", which can be interpreted as meaning that the validity of a European arrest warrant could be inquired into by an Irish court.  This goes against the principle of mutual recognition on which the EAW system is based.  Section 10 is also amended by the deletion of text that limits the scope of EAWs where a custodial sentence has been imposed and the person has fled from the issuing state.  This is not a formal requirement of the framework decision and is being deleted to simplify the procedure in such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Section 7 amends subsection 11(1A) of the Act and clarifies that there is no requirement for domestic arrest warrants to recite each of the offences in respect of which surrender is sought.  It is sufficient for an arrest warrant to have been issued by a judicial authority in the issuing state for just one of the offences to which the EAW relates.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Section 8 contains a number of amendments to section 12 of the Act, which deals with the transmission of documents.  It provides that EAWs and any other documents required may be transmitted by any means capable of producing a written record under conditions allowing the central authority in the state to establish its authenticity.  It is intended to allow for the use of modern means of telecommunication, including e-mail.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Section 10 substitutes section 14 of the Act.  The current text of section 14 was intended to give effect to part of Article 9(3) of the framework decision on the EAW, which provides, in general terms, that an alert in the Schengen Information System, SIS, will be equivalent to a European arrest warrant.  The SIS is one of the elements of the Schengen <i>acquis</i> to which Ireland opted to participate.  It consists of a database allowing designated authorities in participating states to have access to information on persons and property for specified purposes.  However, to date, the technical, administrative and legal infrastructure necessary to participate in the system have not been in place and section 14 has, therefore, had no practical effect.  The original system is in the process of being upgraded on foot of a Council decision in June 2007 to establish a second generation of the system.  The new section 14 anticipates Ireland’s participation in the upgraded system and provides for arrest on foot of an alert for arrest and surrender entered in the system.  The section sets out the procedure to be followed following such an arrest and provides that a person will be released if a European arrest warrant is not received within the time specified by the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Section 11 amends section 15 of the Act, which deals with consent to surrender.  Subsection (<i>c</i>) restricts the grounds of appeal to the Supreme Court to cases certified by either the High Court or the Attorney General as involving a point of law of exceptional public importance.  This is an important restriction in order to prevent the lodging of frivolous or vexatious appeals, the only purpose of which is to delay surrender.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Subsection (<i>e</i>) clarifies that where a person has either lodged an appeal to the Supreme Court against an order for his or her surrender or has made a complaint under Article 40.4.2° of the Constitution, a <i>habeas corpus</i> application, he or she will not be surrendered while the appeal or complaint is pending.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Subsection (<i>f</i>) provides that, where surrender does not take place within the period specified, the High Court may remand a person for a further period in order to enable the surrender to take place, unless it considers that it would be unjust or oppressive to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Subsection (<i>g</i>) inserts a new text at section 15(9), which provides that the High Court may remand a person in custody or on bail, pending the hearing of an appeal to the Supreme Court.  The provision for the withdrawal of consent to surrender in the original section 15(9) has been removed.  I am satisfied that this is appropriate, having regard to the requirements of the section that the High Court must be satisfied that consent is both voluntary and informed and that the person has had an opportunity to receive legal advice before consenting.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Section 12 amends section 16 of the Act, which deals with contested applications for surrender.  Subsections (<i>d</i>) to (<i>f</i>), inclusive, insert provisions that bar the surrender of a person while an appeal to the Supreme Court or a <i>habeas corpus</i> application is pending, limit the right of appeal and provide for the extension of the period of remand where necessary in order for surrender to take place.  Subsection (<i>g</i>) enables the High Court to remand a person in custody or on bail where an appeal to the Supreme Court has been lodged.  All of these amendments are similar to the amendments that I have just described regarding section 15.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Section 13 amends section 18 of the Act to provide that postponement of proceedings will be "until the final determination of those proceedings", as the existing wording of the section does not reflect all possible outcomes of proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Section 14 amends section 29 of the Act, which sets out the procedure for dealing with two or more EAWs received in respect of the same person from different issuing states.  This does not, however, cover the situation where two or more warrants are received from different judicial authorities in the same member state.  The amended section allows numerous warrants to be received in respect of a person, whatever the source.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Section 15 amends section 33 of the Act, which deals with the issue of EAWs by an Irish court.  It allows a court to issue a European arrest warrant once satisfied that a domestic warrant is in existence for the person and that the Garda Síochána believes that the person is not in the State.  It also makes it clear that such a warrant can be issued where a person has been or is liable to be sentenced to imprisonment or detention.  This is in accordance with the framework decision and other provisions of the Act that provide for execution of EAWs where the penalty is detention.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Section 16 amends section 34 of the Act and provides that a European arrest warrant issued in the State may, rather than shall, be transmitted by the central authority, thus providing for transmission of warrants via the SIS.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Section 17 deletes section 40 of the principal Act, which was intended to apply as a bar to surrender in a narrow set of circumstances where delay in proceedings was an issue.  As the question of delay is a matter more appropriately dealt with by the courts in the issuing state, the provision has been removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Section 18 amends section 45 of the Act, as amended, and inserts three new sections.  Subsection 18(<i>a</i>) substitutes section 45.  This is a technical amendment to correct duplication in the numbering of the subsections.  Subsection 18(<i>b</i>) inserts new sections 45A, 45B and 45C into the Act.  They deal with identification procedures, transfers of persons to the state from which surrendered and technical flaws in applications for surrender, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">Section 45A provides for identification procedures.  A key requirement under the European Arrest Warrant Act is that the court must be satisfied that the person before it is the person named in the European arrest warrant it is considering.  I understand fingerprints, palm prints and photographs of a requested person are often sent by requesting states to assist with identification.  The Garda Síochána has no power to take similar material from the arrested person for comparison with the material received.  This new section addresses that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The section authorises the Garda Síochána to photograph, fingerprint and palm print persons arrested under the Act for the purpose of verifying the person's identity.  Reasonable force may be used to take this material, subject to the appropriate authorisation and the other safeguards specified which are in line with similar provisions in criminal justice legislation.  The section also creates an offence of obstructing a garda in the execution of powers under this section.  It also provides for the admissibility in evidence of identification material sent with a European arrest warrant to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Section 45B provides a mechanism for the transfer, after trial, of persons who have been surrendered to Ireland on foot of a European arrest warrant to the state which surrendered them in order to serve the sentence imposed by the Irish court.  The background to this is that under Article 5.3 of the framework decision on the European Arrest Warrant, where a person whose surrender is sought is a national or resident of the executing state, surrender may be subject to the condition that the person is returned, after the trial, to the executing state to serve any sentence imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">We had not previously legislated to give effect to this provision of the framework decision and, while this has not caused any problems to date, I am of the opinion that it is important that we have this procedure in place.  The procedure set out in the section is similar to that in the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act.  It is a fundamental requirement of the section that the person consent to the transfer.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">Section 45C is a new section and provides that applications for surrender will not be refused due to minor or technical defects in the European arrest warrant.  It goes against the principle of mutual recognition that requests for surrender from our European partners should be refused on purely technical grounds.  An important safeguard for the requested person is that the section will not be applied where the court considers its application could lead to an injustice.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Section 22<b> </b>amends section 27 of the Extradition Act 1965 which deals with provisional arrest.  I have already dealt with arrest without warrant on foot of an alert under the SIS system  This amendment reflects the fact that there are countries participating in SIS where the European arrest warrant does not apply.  It is a requirement of states participating in the system that an alert for extradition entered on the system be treated as a request for provisional arrest for extradition.  The section also provides for definitions of certain terms related to the Schengen information system.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Part 3 of the Bill contains a number of provisions relating to Ireland's participation in the Schengen Convention.  The convention is an agreement among certain European states which allows for the abolition of border controls among the participating states.  It also includes provisions on common policy on visa matters, the harmonisation of external border controls and cross-border police and judicial co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Ireland has successfully applied to participate in the measures that relate to police co-operation, mutual assistance in criminal matters, extradition, drugs co-operation and the Schengen information system.  The information system is an electronic alert system which facilitates the exchange of information between police and customs authorities within the Schengen system.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The relevant articles of the convention will come into effect in Ireland only after a range of technical and legislative measures have been put in place.  The Bill provides for a number of these measures and defines the principal Schengen terms.  Specifically, it contains a provision enabling the Garda and customs officers to exchange information with other Schengen member states and a provision designating the data protection commissioner as the supervisory authority for data held in the Schengen information system.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Part 5 deals with a range of miscellaneous matters which have been identified as requiring amendment for a variety of reasons.  Section 40, for example, amends the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1857 to allow a District Court a longer period of time to state a case following a request to do so.<b> </b>Section 41 also provides for a change to the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1857.<i> </i> It sets out the procedures to be followed in serving relevant documents to other parties involved in an appeal by way of case stated.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Section 42<b> </b>amends the Criminal Justice Act 1984 to allow for staff of the Garda Technical Bureau to certify that material being referred to in court is the work of the bureau, rather than requiring oral testimony to be given regarding such material in every case.  I should put the House on notice that in light of advice provided on this section by advisory counsel, I may propose a modification to this section on Committee Stage to set out the various functions of the work of the Garda technical bureau which will be covered by the provision.  I also intend, on Committee Stage, to propose the repeal of section 4(6) of the 1984 Act to eliminate a possible inconsistency which has been identified with regulations dealing with the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Section 43 amends sections 5 and 9 of the Bail Act 1997.  These amendments are of a technical nature.  Section 5 deals with the payment into court of bail money.  The amendment clarifies that, for instance, in cases where the person who has been granted bail is remanded in custody until the bail money is raised, payment of the money to be given to the prison governor may be regarded as payment into court.  This avoids the need to hold the person until the court is again sitting and also avoids having to bring the person to the court in order to pay the money.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Section 9 is concerned with the estreatment of recognisances and the forfeiture of money into court.  The amendments aim to improve the drafting, by amalgamating subsections (1) and (2), and subsection (12) now makes clear that the order for committal to prison for non-payment of an estreated amount may be made in respect of the surety as well as against the person who was granted the bail.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">I may wish to amend section 9 on Committee Stage, to further address a technical aspect, to clarify that in the case of a child who fails to comply with an estreatment order, the non-compliance will be dealt with in accordance with section 110 of the Children Act.  That section provides that a child may not be imprisoned for non-payment of a fine, but may instead be subject to the sanctions listed in that section, including community based sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Section 44 amends section 15 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, by inserting an additional offence.  It is proposed that a person commits an offence if he or she is in possession without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, of any article made or adapted for use in the course of or in connection with the commission of a number of offences under the 2001 Act, including theft and burglary.  An example would be the possession, even in a person's home, of devices to attach to ATMs.  A defence regarding the new offence is provided for.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Section 45<b>, </b>the final section of the Bill, proposes a minor technical amendment to the 2001 Act.  I am also considering an amendment on Committee Stage that would further clarify the operation of section 99 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 regarding suspended sentences.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 will complete the process of reform regarding firearms legislation, which began with the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  I am also taking the opportunity to introduce some further necessary changes to ban the widespread licensing of handguns and the development of undesirable shooting practices.  This Bill will improve, in practical terms, the operation of the European arrest warrant system.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">It also gives powers to the Garda Síochána and the staff of the Revenue Commissioners to exchange information with other states who are party to SIS.  Some of the other changes envisaged in this Bill are technical in nature but it is nonetheless important for the criminal justice system that they are legislated for and that the proposed technical amendments are dealt with to the satisfaction of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">I apologise for the confusion regarding the distribution of my script.  I understand there was a problem with the photocopier, but copies are now available.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_433">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_601">This is part of the Government's package to reduce crime, with particular reference to gun and knife crime.  It is in line with what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated last year, namely, that one of the main priorities set for the Garda Síochána was to target gun crime in 2009 through a range of measures.  I assume the Bill constitutes these.  It was listed as one of the five priority bills in the legislative programme for summer 2008.  We now have it.  I am not sure of the extent to which that would halt the vicious cycle of crime and gangland murder in particular in this city, in Limerick and other parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The Bill changes the licensing system and goes as far as to state that no new licences will be issued for handguns, with very limited exceptions, such as for use by those involved in Olympic sports only.  A new three year licensing system is to be introduced for firearms.  Existing handgun licences will be subject to the new rigorous licensing procedures where their renewal is sought.  I welcome the amendments to the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, which have been identified as being necessary to improve the operation of the legislation and to deal with issues that have come to light in the administration of the European arrest warrant, EAW, system.  We discussed those in committee.  I do not see any difficulty with those changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The Minister has proposed a number of modest amendments to the Bail Act 1997, one of which will clarify that any money paid under recognisance to a prison governor, for example, or any other designated person, shall be deemed to be a payment into court.  There are real problems with bail and if this is the extent of the Minister's reform then we cannot expect a resolution to many of the problems relating to the bail regime, which in spite of the legislation that followed the referendum approximately 13 years ago, is still one of the most lax in the western world.  In conjunction with the Courts Service and the Garda Síochána, we have still not set about ensuring there is a minimum time lapse between the arrest, charging and cautioning of an individual and that individual being brought to court.  That is where the bail problem lies, namely, the inordinate and lengthy delay between a person's arrest and coming to trial.  As a result, thousands of crimes, some of them very serious, are being committed by persons granted bail by the courts.  I do not accept what the Minister has said on numerous occasions, that bail is exclusively a matter for the courts.  We, as legislators, have a role to play in setting out the terms and conditions under which persons may be granted bail by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The Bill also includes permission to exchange information through the Schengen information system, SIS, when it is operational.  There will be cost implications in that regard to which the Minister has not adverted.  Perhaps our participation in the Schengen information system may have to be paused in the same way as Thornton Hall and a range of other issues have been abandoned in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The Bill also makes provision for the certification of evidence on the part of certain staff of the Garda technical bureau so that it may not be necessary to appear in court to confirm orally the status of particular pieces of evidence in all cases.  I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The provisions on handguns are perhaps the most controversial element of the Bill.  The Minister repeated what he said on numerous occasions, that we now have a handgun culture.  I am not so sure that we do, but the Minister says we have and he is basing his legislative changes on this handgun culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">In July 2008, <i>The Irish Times</i> reported on comments made by Mr. Justice Peter Charleton.  I read his comments.  He is one of a number of judges to deal with the matter of handguns.  He said that reasonable people are “entitled to feel alarmed” about the large increase in the number of guns licensed in Ireland.  He stated that there is “a pressing need” for drawing together into a clear law the multiple “piecemeal” rules on the control of firearms here, and the increasing numbers of weapons licensed for personal use, 1,600 in 2007.  He went on to say that this was “exactly the opposite” to what happened in Britain where handguns had been banned in line with the recommendations of the Dunblane inquiry.  I am not so sure that the actions that followed the Dunblane inquiry in Britain had the effect of reducing gangland crime, gun murders or activities involving handguns across the water.  If the Minister has evidence to the contrary, which I am sure his officials can supply, I would be happy to hear from him as to the success of the recommendations of the Dunblane inquiry, upon which some of these legislative measures are based.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">I accept that the statistics appear to warrant some concern.  In 2007,  the number of incidents involving a firearm amounted to 1,188, compared to 1,250 in 2006, and 1,259 in 2005.  The number of murders involving a firearm was 21 in 2008, some 18 in 2007, some 27 in 2006, and 23 in 2005.  The number of stolen firearms is a matter of some dispute.  A total of 27 handguns have been reported stolen since 2005 and 30% of those were recovered.  The figures in this regard in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána and the Central Statistics Office differ.  The Minister should clarify matters by informing the House of the situation regarding stolen handguns or whether there is any evidence to suggest that stolen handguns have been used in recent atrocities or robberies with violence.  The Minister probably has the data for 2008 on the number of incidents involving firearms and the number of firearms stolen.  The statistics should help not only to form Government opinion but public opinion as to the handgun culture referred to by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">I agree that the safety and security of firearms is paramount.  There is a significant duty of care and a heavy burden to be imposed on anybody licensed to carry a firearm.  I include a farmer with a shotgun to an extent not that much less than a person licensed to carry a handgun.  A simple regulation which the Minister could have imposed, and which I urge him to consider, is that all firearms, irrespective of their class, must be housed in a safe at all times when not in use.  Safe and secure storage appliances can be purchased for a couple of hundred euro.  All firearms and ammunition should be stored in a safe by the licensee when not in use.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">There is a concern at the number of firearms that are licensed.  The total number of licensed firearms in the State is approximately 233,000.  It is interesting to note that between 2004 and 2006 the number of firearms issued remained static at approximately 220,000 but between 2007 and 2008 the numbers jumped to 233,000.  That might not seem like a large percentage but it is an additional 12,000 firearms in the State in a three-year period.  I note the Minister's comments on what Mr. Justice Charleton said.  The judge referred to the increase in the number of firearms since 1972 when there was a ban on firearms because of the Northern situation.  The reality is that pre-1972 there were far more guns licensed than is the case today.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">I am concerned also at the major inconsistencies that currently exist on the granting of handgun licences in particular.  Those inconsistencies emerged through parliamentary questions tabled in the main by my colleague, Deputy Deasy.  It is apparent that some Garda districts granted no licences for handguns while others in more sparsely populated areas have been much more liberal, issuing between 50 and 100 licences per year.  The Minister has stated that there are now approximately 1,800 handguns licensed, which was not as a result of a considered or deliberate public policy decision.  The reason for the variation was that each superintendent in each district could make an independent decision on the certification of a handgun.  There were no guidelines available to the superintendent.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">I am pleased the Bill makes provision for strict guidelines for the issuing of firearm certificates.  However, I am not sure if I accept the Minister's thesis that we have a handgun culture in this country.  The consumerism of the Celtic tiger era gave rise to a phenomenon of the "deckland man" purchasing hot tubs for relaxation, as David McWiliams put it, but I am not sure if we can then say that there was a hot tub culture just because 1,000 hot tubs were purchased in a given area.  I do not believe that we have a hot tub culture, no more than I accept we have a handgun culture.  That is not to say there is no problem, but it is not alarming as the Minister appears to suggest.  It suits his hard man image, but the Minister will be judged by his results.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I am concerned that the Minister is focusing entirely on legally held firearms, which shifts the attention away from the far more serious problem caused by illegal firearms across the State.  It is common knowledge that criminal gangs have easy access to dangerous firearms and there is evidence to suggest that they travel overseas to avail of top-of-the-range training facilities.  I raised this with a delegation of Czech MPs who visited the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights last year.  They accepted that firearms ranges were being run so liberally that it was possible for people to engage in highly sophisticated firearms training and target practice without showing any form of identification.  It was widely reported that criminal gang figures from this country were engaging in such training at a cost of approximately €50 per session, and availing of the reduced air fares to travel from Dublin.  They could travel to places like the Czech Republic, engage in such training, come back to this State and carry out gangland atrocities.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I ask the Minister to urge his European colleagues to deal with this issue, so that we can ensure a certain harmonisation of our laws and then criminals form this country will no longer be able to engage in such sophisticated weapons training within the EU.  However, I ask him to direct his attention in the first instance towards the serious matter of illegal firearms as part of a broader effort to tackle criminality in Ireland.  Every consignment of drugs that come into this country illegally usually contains a box of illegal firearms.  This is the issue that should be addressed in the first instance, rather than a crackdown on legally held guns, as evidence must still be adduced to show that legally held firearms have been involved in criminal acts in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">We should also be in a position to account for stolen handguns and for those that have been recovered, particularly those that may have been stolen from members of the Garda Síochána or members of the Defence Forces.  In reply to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister showed that the figures were quite small in terms of misplaced or stolen firearms belonging to these State organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">I am concerned at the Minister's use of the Bill as a blunt instrument to focus the attention of the Government towards firearms and weaponry.  In November last year, Fine Gael published the Criminal Justice (Violent Crime Prevention) Bill to tighten up loopholes around sentencing, automatic remission and penalties for possession of blades and firearms.  In relation to firearms, we proposed two specific measures, one of which was the mandatory reporting of loss or theft of any firearms or ammunition.  Any licensee who failed to report such a loss or theft could be subject, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to a fine; on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to a fine or both.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The second measure was to increase substantially the penalty for possession of an unlawful firearm: on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or both.  These are tough penalties but I believe this reflects the seriousness of the matter at hand.  I will discuss these amendments in more detail with the Minister on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I note from previous statements that the Minister proposed to review the legislation regarding the licensing of guns on an annual basis, but there appears to be no provision in the Bill, so this could be addressed on Committee Stage also.  It is worth noting and commenting on the low level of prosecution and convictions secured from incidents recorded involving firearms.  In 2004, only 38% of 1,224 incidents had proceedings commenced of which 19% resulted in a conviction.  In 2006, this figure had been reduced to 10.8%.  I realise in some cases proceedings may be ongoing, but the low conviction rate is a cause for concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Both the Minister and his predecessor are on record stating that there was no need to introduce legislation that would specifically ban samurai<b> </b>swords.  I have raised this matter time and again with him.  I am pleased he has identified the sword issue as being a particular problem, and I support his provision on this.  The penalties for possession of a knife have been increased in the Bill.  A person guilty of the offence can, on summary conviction, be fined up to €5,000 or imprisoned for up to 12 months.  For conviction on indictment, a person can be fined and-or imprisoned for up to five years.  I accept what he is doing to increase the penalties, but I am not sure if enough is being done to enforce the law sufficiently on knife crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">While the number of murders committed involving knives declined last year, the number of offences for possession of a knife is dramatically rising.  In just five years, there has been a 72% increase in offences relating to possession of offensive weapons, mainly knives, which have led to proceedings.  However, only 32% of cases have led to conviction.  What is the difficulty there?  Is there a problem with evidence?  Why is our conviction rate so low?  Three out of ten knife crime offenders are under 20, so it is vital that second level students are targeted directly through their schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The Minister launched a knife awareness campaign this February with a budget of €200,000 and promised a series of road shows to visit schools and an nationwide advertising campaign.  As part of the campaign, the Minister promised to build a presence on social networking sites such as Bebo, Facebook and Twitter, in order to deliver the campaign message to his target audience.  This was the new approach to tackle knife crime.  This approach has failed miserably.</p>

        <b>Deputy Michael Creed</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</b>
         the way he proposes to protect and increase jobs in the food industry in view of the threats posed to employment in the sector by the major multiples, some of whom are increasing their dependance on UK suppliers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_434">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_623">The agrifood sector is Ireland's most important indigenous sector, providing hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout every county at producer and processor level.  The sector was never more important to the Irish economy than it is now.  We are justifiably proud of our reputation as "Ireland the Food Island" and, notwithstanding current economic difficulties, the Government is continuing to invest hundreds of millions of euro at farm and processor levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">As a food producing country, it is essential that we have a robust food industry that provides an outlet for our producers and adds value to the primary product.  Irish food, drink and horticulture exports last year were worth in excess of €8 billion.  I share Bord Bia's view that the industry has the potential to boost annual export returns by more than 20%, thus reaching €10 billion by 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">The sector generates output of €20 billion annually.  It has been and continues to be supported at primary, processing, research and marketing levels through a range of measures undertaken in line with the strategy set out in the agri-vision 2015 report.  The food industry is vital to our economic future, in particular at this time in terms of employment, value-added and export earnings.  While it is undoubtedly facing challenges it has in the past demonstrated its resilience and capacity to adapt to competitive challenges and to build business in emerging and changing markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">Building on the natural advantages of food production in Ireland and applying the highest standards of food safety, the sector has been transformed into a sophisticated industry well capable of competing on worldwide markets.  In more recent times, mainly because of the depreciation of sterling and general contraction of demand, the competitive pressures on the sector have become more acute.  The Government is conscious of the factors impacting on the industry and is actively engaged in identifying ways in which we can continue to assist the sector's development and growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">While it is essential that we continue to identify and build new export markets for our food and beverages, it is equally important that we have a strong domestic market for Irish food and drink.  A strong domestic presence is an essential factor in developing export markets.  In this regard, we need an Irish retail sector that maintains a strong commitment to sourcing and providing a comprehensive range of familiar Irish products and brands.  Ultimately, of course, it is a matter for consumers if they wish to support quality Irish food products, indigenous Irish suppliers and Irish jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">I strongly agree with the Tánaiste that retailers must strike a reasonable balance between granting price reductions to consumers, a practice with which none of us would disagree, and giving to suppliers and producers a fair return, which is essential to the maintenance of thousands of Irish jobs and the survival of primary producers.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">While the relationship between the food industry and the retail trade is essentially a matter for those parties, there are specific provisions in competition law that extend to business relationships, including relationships between suppliers and retailers.  These provisions prohibit various anti-competitive practices, including price-fixing, abusing a dominant position, requesting "hello" money and imposing resale price maintenance.  In that specific regard, the House will be aware that the Tánaiste has requested the Competition Authority to conduct a study of the retail import-distribution sector in regard to how competition is working in the sector and whether there are any practices or methods of competition that are affecting the supply of goods or services.  The Tánaiste recently received the authority's report and is currently examining its conclusions and intends to publish it shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">The Government appreciates fully the value of the food sector to the Irish economy, not least in terms of the employment provided and is committed to its ongoing support in terms of investment and innovation.  The record of investment proves this beyond doubt.  We will continue to work with the industry to address the ongoing competitive pressures and to ensure that it continues to produce high-quality food product that is more than capable of competing with any comparable product at home or abroad.  At the same time, the retail sector has a key role to play in supporting Irish jobs through its sourcing and provision of quality Irish products and brands.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
            <p eId="para_632">I asked the Minister what steps the Government proposes to take in light of the threat posed.  Members will have heard yesterday the outpouring of anger by Irish farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">A survey which I conducted last August shows a 220% mark-up by the multiplies for beef and a 177% mark-up for milk for which farmers were at that time getting 31 cent a litre and are now getting only 21 cent a litre.  Does the Government have a strategy to deal with this?  The retail sector is like the wild west; there is absolute mayhem where Irish suppliers are being led like lambs to the slaughter by the multiples.  Many of the multiples, in particular Tesco, are outsourcing products for their supermarket shelves.  Does the Government have a job retention strategy for the primary producers and those involved in the retail sector?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_436" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_634">I share Deputy Creed's concerns.  Indeed, I heard him express in other fora his concerns in regard to the returns to primary producers and, in many instances, processors.  I want to reiterate that while recent reductions in prices will undoubtedly be welcomed by consumers and will help to address the difference in price between here and Northern Ireland, the Government appreciates and is conscious of the concerns expressed in regard to the possible implications for employment in this country, in particular if changes in supply change arrangements reduce the level of purchases by retailers from Irish producers.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">The Tánaiste and I have met with and outlined to the major multiplies the fact that our primary producers and processors, be they small, medium or large enterprises, need a fair return on the products they supply.  Among these small, medium and large enterprises are world-class leaders in food production systems, be it in the area of beef, dairy or any other food product.  These enterprises have invested considerably in recent years, as has the taxpayer, in terms of providing new facilities and ensuring that our industry is at the cutting edge of technology.  Some of the world leaders, in terms of international brands, are located here.  They deserve the absolute support of the multiples who are trading in our country.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelCreed" eId="spk_437">
            <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
            <p eId="para_636">We all agree with that.  The problem is that those quality products are not getting space on the multiples' shelves because of imported product from the UK.  I reiterate, does the Government have a strategy to deal with this?  In particular, will the Minister agree with the suggestion I made on radio this morning, which the Minister indicated earlier he heard, that, as in the case of the UK, we introduce a code of conduct for retailers and suppliers, enforced by an agency equivalent to the Office of Fair Trading by way of a merger of the Competition Authority and Consumers Association of Ireland? This would ensure fair treatment.  Currently, we have excessive profiteering by Tesco which had a 9% margin in2008-09.  To put this in context, the global turnover of Tesco is more than 1.5 times the GDP of the State.  It is making approximately €20,000 per second globally and did not get to that position by pussy-footing around the place.  I fear Tesco is running rings around the Government and that unless something is done urgently thousands of jobs will be lost in the quality firms to which the Minister referred and at the farm gate.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_438" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_637">I referred in my earlier remarks to the questions posed by Deputy Creed in regard to the primary producers and processors.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">I discussed yesterday with the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, and my officials the operation of the UK code, which I understand has been subject to ongoing criticism, in particular by suppliers in terms of its effectiveness.  The Tánaiste told the House yesterday that the Competition Authority has reported to her on how competition in the retail import distribution sector is working.  She also stated that her officials are analysing the report and that she will publish it shortly.  The Minister of State and I, with the officials, are engaging with the Tánaiste on the content of that report.  If, following our consideration of the report, decisions need to be taken or regulations need to be implemented, the Deputy can rest assured the Government will do so urgently.  We are particularly conscious of the threat to jobs and income for the primary producer and the threat to jobs in our primary processors.  The industry has gone from a commodity-based industry to a sophisticated food industry and it deserves every credit in that regard.</p>

        <b>Deputy Seán Sherlock</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</b>
         the supports which will be given to the dairy sector and dairy farmers in view of the reduction in milk prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_439" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_640">The EU Common Agricultural Policy provides a range of measures that can be used to assist the dairy market.  In the health check negotiations last year there was pressure to remove or weaken these considerably.  At the time I fought hard to keep the key market instruments in place and these are now being used to help support the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">Dairy farmers' incomes are made up of the market price paid for milk and direct income support from the EU.  Supply and demand have a major bearing on the price paid for milk.  World market prices determine the returns received by dairy processors and this is reflected in the price paid to farmers.  Export refunds and internal subsidies were suspended by the EU in 2007 as prices were at exceptionally high levels.  As the market situation deteriorated towards the end of 2008, I called on the Commissioner to reintroduce support measures to help stabilise markets.  The Commission initially responded last November by bringing forward the operation of the private storage scheme for butter.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">In January, the Commissioner announced the reintroduction of refunds to support the export of dairy products outside the EU.  This was an important step and signalled an intention by the Commission to put a floor under the market.  In March, the intervention schemes for butter and skimmed milk powder were opened, thus allowing the purchase of product up to set limits at a fixed price.  At that time I met with the Commissioner to discuss the market situation and stressed the importance of continuing to accept butter and skimmed milk powder into intervention at levels close to the intervention purchase price.  I am pleased that the Commission has continued to buy butter and skimmed milk powder into intervention at prices close to the fixed price.  I also called for the continued use of export refunds at viable levels to move significant quantities of product from the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">I raised this issue with my colleagues at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in April.  I drew attention to the serious difficulties on the milk market where the severe slump in demand has led to a dramatic fall in milk prices.  I urged the Commission to continue using the existing measures to support the market and to consider introducing additional methods where appropriate.  Milk will feature on the agenda of the Agriculture Council next Monday and I will once again reiterate my views to the Commission and to the Council of Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">The EU Commission's actions in utilising available support measures have helped to stabilise the market.  However, as the milk price is greatly influenced by the forces of supply and demand, support schemes have a limited effect on milk prices.  The short-term outlook for the dairy sector remains uncertain and I continue to monitor closely the Commission's management of the dairy market.  In this regard I will again discuss the matter next week with my colleagues in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_440">
            <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_645">I thank the Minister for his response.  The Minister is not giving us much solace on the responses to the downward trajectory in global milk prices.  Is there scope within the European Commission and will the Minister ask at next week's Agriculture and Fisheries Council for a dairy adjustment scheme to be implemented under EU legislation through the use of unused EU funding?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_441" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_646">Apart from the €7 million that I allocated to sheep farmers, which will be distributed in December, we do not have access to the unused funds until 2010.  One of the areas identified as a potential recipient is the dairy sector.  However, that is not applicable until 2010.  The European Union has not yet outlined to us the specific schemes on which we will be able to draw down unused funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">The Deputy referred to the problem of demand and supply.  Consumers worldwide do not have the level of income to purchase sufficient dairy products.  Dairy prices rose to a very high level in 2007.  Subsequently, there was increased production in third countries, including the United States.  There were currency fluctuations that militated against us in the European Union.  The dollar was strong at one stage and weak at another.  New Zealand has also had the opportunity to change the value of its currency.  All of those factors have had an impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">Last year, I fought very tenaciously for the European Union to retain the market mechanism measures, particularly aid to private storage, intervention and export refunds.  In the early days of negotiations of the health check of the Common Agricultural Policy there was little or no support for the retention of such measures.  In the final day of the negotiation we got some support from other countries.  Were those measures not in place now, the sector would be in even more difficulty than it finds itself in.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_442">
            <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_649">Will the aid to private storage continue indefinitely or does it have a definitive timeline?  Quotas will be abolished in 2015.  Notwithstanding that we cannot foretell what will happen in global markets, the Government must take responsibility for the question that is on every farmer's lips.  Will farmers be able to produce milk after 2015, notwithstanding the current difficulties?  It would appear the Government has no coherent policy regarding the potential loss of many farms and an outflow from farming because we do not know what will happen in 2015.  There is no sense of direction from the Government in terms of planning for that eventuality.  Farmers need to get such a sense.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_443" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_650">The provision of additional quota does not in any way contribute to current difficulties because Europe will be more than 4% to 5% under quota this year.  Quotas will be abolished in 2015.  We have argued for increased quotas so that there will not be a hard landing in 2015.  For the primary producers and processors the dairy sector is very sophisticated and has the potential to grow.  The best estimates available to us from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations are that there will be increased demand for dairy products in future.  We believe there is a bright future for the dairy industry even though very serious problems face our dairy farmers and processors today.  If the health check measures were unravelled, we might not have the market management measures to support us.  That would be an outright catastrophe.  We fought, practically alone until the final day, to retain those measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">A meeting of the management committee took place today and just before I came in I was advised that further product will go into intervention and to export refunds also.</p>

            <p eId="para_653">The seafood development measure contained in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 is divided between the EU co-funded operational programme and the national seafood development operational programme.  The EU co-funded operational programme has already commenced and has funded the 2008 decommissioning scheme which has allowed 46 boats to be decommissioned with grant aid totalling €36.6 million already paid or in the process of being paid over 2008 and 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">The National Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013 was advertised for public consultation in October 2008.

            <p eId="para_655">This Department and its agencies, working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, developed a plan to deliver compliance with the EU birds and habitat directives for wild fisheries and aquaculture over a determined timeframe.  This plan was submitted to DG Environment for consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">A meeting between representatives of this Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and agencies, and DG Environment took place in Brussels on 13 May 2009 to discuss the plan with a view to securing DG Environment's support for the approach set down in the plan.  DG Environment advised that it was, in principle, favourably disposed towards Ireland's plan subject to a positive response to the issues raised and further clarifications from the Irish authorities on the details of the plan.  When these matters have been satisfactorily addressed, DG Environment expects to be in a position to respond formally on the plan at an early date.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">This Department is also in discussion with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to inform it of the significant progress made on managing sea lice levels on salmon farms.  I am hopeful that the concerns raised have been satisfactorily addressed and that we will be in a position to adopt the national operational programme for fisheries in the near future.  The delay in the launch of the national seafood development operational programme has not held up grant-aiding aquaculture developments in 2009 as the European Commission has agreed to the continuation of grant aid under the 2000 to 2006 operational programme until 30 June 2009.  A provision of €5 million has been made for aquaculture development in the Agriculture Vote for 2009 and I have approved the spending of €4.5 million of this for aquaculture projects in both the BMW, and south and east regions under the 2000 to 2006 operational programme which will assist the continued operation of aquaculture projects in these areas and the employment that they support.</p>

            <p eId="para_658">There is potential for significant job creation in the seafood sector and in particular in the shellfish sector.  While I note what the Minister of State said in his latter comments, I can give examples of companies with development programmes and grant approval which cannot be paid those grants and therefore cannot progress with investment and job creation in the sector because of the delay in approving the national seafood development operational programme.  We are now in 2009 — two years into the programme.  Owing to ideological wrangling between the Green Party Ministers, Deputies Eamon Ryan and John Gormley, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Tony Killeen, jobs are not being created and are even being lost.  Market opportunities particularly in France and Italy are being lost.  I ask the Minister of State to put a deadline on the matter.  When will we see the interdepartmental ideological wrangling between Fianna Fáil and the Green Party come to an end so that the sector can fulfil its potential and create desperately needed jobs?</p>

            <p eId="para_659">It would be inaccurate to describe the situation as wrangling between the parties of Government.  A December 2007 European Court of Justice judgment on Natura sites impacts very negatively on the situation we are trying to address.  I welcome the level of co-operation that has been possible between this Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which has enabled us to present a lengthy document to the European Commission to advance all these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">The initial response from the Environment Directorate General to our meeting of 13 May was positive, subject to clarification of a number of points, and we are confident in our ability to deliver.  I concur with Deputy Creed in regard to job creation potential and want to ensure that is realised at the earliest opportunity.</p>

I can give an example of a company in County Waterford which is ready to double its workforce in this sector provided it receives the grant aid for which it has been approved but cannot be paid because of the Department's failure to get sanction from Brussels.

            <p eId="para_669">My Department's contribution to the fallen animals scheme ceased with effect from Tuesday, 14 April 2009 as a result of budgetary constraints and in reflection of the greatly reduced incidence of BSE in this country.  However, I provided continued financial support for the collection of certain dead animals, notably bovines over 48 months of age, for sampling as required under the ongoing national BSE surveillance programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">The disposal of dead farm animals is subject to EU regulations, notably EC Regulation No. 1774 of 2002.  These regulations require that animals which die on-farm must generally be disposed of through approved knackeries and rendering plants.  With the ending of the fallen animals scheme the cost of collection and rendering for animals not covered by the new scheme is now a matter for negotiation between the individual collectors or rendering plants and their customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">Within the boundaries of legal requirements, my Department is making every effort to facilitate measures enabling reduction of costs in the rendering and collection system, such as allowing cross-Border trade, permitting direct delivery by farmers to authorised plants, considering removal of some costs currently built into the rendering process and encouraging indigenous use of meat and bone meal for energy. Farmers may continue to use the existing collection network or, alternatively, may transport dead animals by prior arrangement to approved knackeries provided the carcasses are transported in leak-proof covered containers or vehicles.  Burial of fallen animals is only permissible under licence in remote areas, that is, islands and listed mountain or bogland areas.  Farmers who wish to bury animals on-farm should apply to their local district veterinary offices for burial licences.  It is also a legal requirement on all keepers of bovine animals to notify my Department of movements of all live or dead bovines off their holdings.</p>

            <p eId="para_675">We have entered discussions on the scheme with all farming bodies.  I have met representatives from each of the three main organisations at least once and my officials have met them on a number of occasions.  They agree that the costs had to be taken out of the system.  The scheme was introduced to deal with the severe difficulties we were experiencing in respect of BSE and it was never intended to put it on a permanent basis.  Significant amounts of taxpayer funding has been spent on it and, thankfully, the incidence of disease in this country has reduced dramatically.  I commend the officials in my Department and the farming community on achieving our current high level of disease prevention.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">The costs were excessive and had to be reduced.  They already have been reduced substantially.

Between new born and three months, the differential can be as high as €13.</p>

We have also issued draft proposals to the renderers regarding the possibility of collecting carcasses directly.  If they are in a position to collect, we will be able to allow individual farmers to bring products to renderers as well as to knackeries.  That increased level of competition will bring about price reductions.  The farming community generally recognises that the cost for the State was prohibitive.</p>

         the detailed analysis conducted by his Department on the crisis in the dairy industry; the measures he proposes to ensure a price to farmers for milk above the cost of production; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [20645/09]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_463" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_682">Other than the introductory paragraph, my response to this question is much the same as that given to Question No. 43.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">My Department carries out analysis of the dairy sector on an ongoing basis.  The causes of the current predicament are widely known at this stage.  The past year has been challenging for the EU dairy sector.  During 2008 international dairy markets fell from the record high levels they had reached in 2007 and there was increased volatility in the second half of the year.  Global supply increased in response to high prices and demand contracted during 2008 due to the economic slump.  We are operating in a changed policy framework where world market forces have a major influence on the price paid for milk.  This is particularly relevant to dairy producing countries such as Ireland which export the majority of product.</p>
            <p eId="para_684">Ultimately, the market is the source of income achieved through competitiveness, efficiency and innovation.  In an open market it is not my role to fix or guarantee prices for farmers.  However, it is my role to ensure that the available support measures are utilised by the Commission during periods of market turbulence.  Most EU market support measures were suspended since 2007 as prices were at such high levels.  When the situation deteriorated last year I called on the Commissioner to reintroduce market supports and to use them effectively.  The Commission has taken steps in recent months to address the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">For the remainder of my response I refer Deputy Creed to the reply given to Question No. 43.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelCreed" eId="spk_464">
            <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
            <p eId="para_686">The Minister makes much of the fact that market support measures were retained in the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy as an instrument for dealing with price fluctuations.  We are currently experiencing the most severe of price fluctuations.  Whereas farmers received in the region of 40 cents per litre of milk in 2007, they are now receiving 20 cents per litre.  Teagasc estimates that the cost of producing milk is approximately 26 cents per litre.  It is clear that the political objective behind retaining market support measures to deal with these fluctuations is not being met in the sense that farmers are still being asked to supply milk for less than the cost of production.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">What has been the quantifiable return to dairy farmers in cent per litre of all the initiatives to which the Minister refers, including export refunds, aid to private storage and intervention?  It is probably negligible in the sense that the price of milk has not increased above what is perceived as the current global market price.  A large number of farmers will be forced out of the sector if a price of 20 cent per litre is maintained.  Of necessity, this group will not comprise only small dairy farmers.  It is noticeable that those who are hurting most currently have labour units on their farms and they are feeling the pinch more.  What is the possibility of a more substantial level of support being provided by Europe, given Fianna Fáil's alliance with the liberals, who traditionally have been hostile to the CAP and who count Commissioner Fischer Boel as a member?  What is the potential of adding 5 cent or 6 cent a litre in order that farmers can at least break even?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_465" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_688">I fully appreciate the concerns expressed by Deputies Creed and Sherlock and other colleagues on both sides of the House regarding the serious difficulties facing the dairy sector.  I am aware of these difficulties having spoken to farmers and processors in the various sectors.  We have argued with the Commissioner at Union level that we need to use the market mechanism measures effectively regarding the quantities produced and the price paid.  If we do not remove product from the market, normal supply and demand will maintain the downward pressure on prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">I only became aware of the outcome of this morning's meeting as I entered the House and I did not have time to include it in the reply to Deputy Sherlock.  A total of 7,686 tonnes of butter were accepted for intervention, including 2,103 tonnes of Irish butter or approximately 28%.  A total of 22,789 tonnes of skimmed milk powder were taken into intervention, including 5,674 tonnes from Ireland or approximately 25%.  The Commission maintained the refund level in regard to export refunds for both.  It is important that quantities taken into intervention were purchased.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">The Council of Ministers is due to meet next Monday and I will put forward the case strongly again to the Commissioner and the Commission about the need to continue to use the market mechanism measures as the most effective way to deal with price and the quantities taken in under all management measures.</p>

            <p eId="para_691">This is the fourth month in a row I have heard this line during Question Time.  The reality is farmers are turning in cows morning and evening at a loss.  Does the Department have the will and the Minister the political commitment?  Is Europe sympathetic to the case he makes to seek a meaningful response to this crisis, which will deliver a price of at least 25 cent or 26 cent a litre?  While it may not be easily quantifiable, I would like departmental officials to exercise their minds on what is the tangible benefit of what has been achieved to date?  In other words, what price would farmers be paid if these support measures had not been taken?</p>
            <p eId="para_692">They are meaningless to farmers.  We witnessed the anger of potato farmers towards Tesco yesterday and last week we witnessed the anger towards Tipperary Co-operative Creamery Limited and in Tullamore.  I have sympathy for directors of co-operatives because they must take financial decisions, as they cannot trade recklessly.  However, they need support so they can pay a price to farmers that exceeds the price of production.  Can the Minister deliver that at European level?</p>

            <p eId="para_693">Quantifying the value of the supports in place is not straightforward.  The one way to increase prices is to remove product from the market.  The Deputy correctly said the processors have not had it all their own way because they are not achieving prices on the world market, according to the dairy board and individual processors.  At the April Council meeting, I specifically tabled an item on support for the dairy industry and ten other member states, including significant member states, supported us regarding the need for the Commission to give the best possible support to the dairy industry.  I will raise the issue again next Monday and I hope even more member states will support us because, unfortunately, the position has not improved in the meantime.</p>

            <p eId="para_696">I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 51 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">My Department's contribution to the fallen animals scheme ceased with effect from Tuesday, 14 April 2009.  This was as a result of budgetary constraints and also reflects the greatly reduced incidence of BSE in this country.

            <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
            <p eId="para_700">The fallen animals scheme represented poor value for the taxpayer and it facilitated the emergence of a cartel, which overcharged and excessively profiteered on the disposal of dead animals.  The proof of this is the substantially lower prices paid in Northern Ireland for the disposal of animals.  Will the Minister ensure that all impediments to licensed bona fide operators from Northern Ireland are removed in order that they can compete aggressively for business in the Republic and be licensed, provided they meet all the requirements, and that the Department adopts a proactive approach in this regard?  Competition will drive prices down significantly.  A number of these operators are being licensed but the Department needs to be proactive on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">Sampling will still be required for animals aged over 48 months because of BSE.  The cost associated with having personnel to carry out the sampling is substantial.  I understand on the basis of a reply I received to a previous parliamentary question that the Department invested considerable funds training non-veterinary staff to FETAC level 5 to carry out post-mortem inspections of animals in meat factories but it never subsequently availed of the staff it trained.  The cost of producing samples of animals aged over 48 months is excessive.  It is a simple procedure, which involves scooping out brain matter, putting it in a test tube, closing the cap and sending it to the laboratory for testing.  Significant savings could also be made in this area if the Minister had the will to tackle the issue.  Has he plans in this regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_702">With regard to sending material to Northern Ireland, ten knackeries have been approved by the Department and, to date, six licences have issued to companies in the North.  Some product has been transported to Northern Ireland for rendering.  I also understand that another knackery intends to start sending material to Northern Ireland shortly.  Applications that were submitted by enterprises to the Department were processed and turned around very quickly.  I can assure the Deputy that if any <i> bona fide</i> operator seeks a licence, there will be no delay in issuing such a licence once all the criteria are met.  We will make sure of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_703">The other point concerned testing.  We are still subsidising the collection, segregation and preparation for sampling adult bovine animals — those are fallen animals over 48 months of age — and the preparation for sampling of certain categories of sheep and goats.  We have provided for that in this year's Estimate.  In dealing with this matter, we will be reducing costs in all respects.  As regards our surveillance programme with the EU, we will ensure that every aspect of the collection of fallen animals over 48 months will meet with all the conditions we applied in the past as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">Another important issue concerns meat and bonemeal.  Together with my ministerial colleagues, Deputy John Gormley and Deputy Eamon Ryan, I have been engaging with relevant plants to ensure they will take up the opportunity of meat and bonemeal for the production of energy.  It is ridiculous that over the years we exported such product to places like Germany.  We want to see greater momentum given to that enterprise in this country.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Trevor Sargent)</from>
            <p eId="para_706">Energy crops are relatively new to Irish farmers and are being considered as an alternative to more conventional farm enterprises.  The total area of energy crops in Ireland has increased steadily since 2003, supported by incentives introduced by the Government to stimulate cultivation and subsidies to increase the use of bio-fuel in the Irish transport market.  In addition, the decoupling of direct payments from production has afforded farmers greater freedom to switch to alternative enterprises, such as energy crops, without reducing the value of their existing single farm payment entitlements.  The main possibilities for growing energy crops in Ireland are oilseed rape, hemp, willow and miscanthus.  The number of hectares planted increased from 137 hectares in 2003 to 8,700 hectares in 2007 and declined to 4,100 hectares in 2008.  I have arranged to provide the Deputy with the full details of the crops planted since 2003.  As they are tabulated it makes sense to provide them in that format.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">The market for energy crops is still in its infancy in Ireland.  The increase in production in 2007 is mainly attributable to strong demand for oilseeds in the pure plant oil and bio-diesel markets.  The cultivation of miscanthus and willow also showed a marked increase in 2007 following the introduction of grants by the Department to aid establishment costs.  The decline in energy crop cultivation in 2008 reflected the sharp rise in cereal production in Ireland in response to soaring grain prices.  The demand for grain encouraged Irish tillage farmers to plant more wheat at the expense of oilseeds.  The total area sown to oilseed declined from just under 8,000 hectares in 2007 to some 3,000 hectares in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">The outlook for energy crops in 2009 should be roughly similar to 2008 with overall production estimated to be in the region of 4,500 hectares.  Adverse weather conditions affected the autumn planting of oilseeds and production is not expected to increase beyond the 2008 figure of 3,000 hectares.  The cultivation of miscanthus and to a lesser extent willow is expected to reach 1,400 hectares in line with pre-planting approvals issued by the Department under the bio-energy scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">The willingness of farmers to convert land to energy crops depends on a number of factors including profitability at farm level.  Production can only be sustained in the long-term if energy crops generate comparable returns to more traditional outlets in the food and animal feed sector.  My Department has a number of incentives in place to improve the profitability of growing energy crops.  Under the bio-energy scheme, farmers who diversify into willow and miscanthus can receive establishment grants worth €1,450 per hectare to offset up to 50% of the initial set-up costs.  The overall area planted under the scheme should exceed 3,000 ha by the end of 2009, which marks the completion of the three-year scheme.  The Department has commenced a review of the bio-energy scheme to assess the need for a further scheme in future.  In addition to establishment grants, farmers can also qualify for EU and national premiums worth €125 per hectare on areas sown with energy crops.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">I should also mention the importance of incentives to create demand for bio-fuel feedstocks.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is providing over €200 million in excise relief up to 2010 to increase the use of bio-fuel on the Irish transport market.  Plans have also been announced to introduce a new bio-fuel obligation scheme, which will ensure that a percentage target of transport fuels used in the State must consist of bio-fuels.  The obligation will apply to fuel companies and will be a key component in achieving the EU target of 10% penetration of renewable energy in transport by 2020.</p>

            <p eId="para_712">I am amazed at the Minister of State's reply.  The question asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the number of hectares planted in the production of bio-fuels in each of the past six years, the breakdown of the crops planted and the number of hectares of each that he expects to be planted in 2009.  In response to a similar question on 20 May 2008, the Minister provided a table of the number of hectares planted with crops for bio-energy purposes for each of the last six years.  It was as follows: 2003, 137 hectares; 2004, 732; 2005, 2,590; 2006, 4,456.</p>

            <p eId="para_721">For example, there has been a good take-up in miscanthus, more so than willow.  Anecdotally, it seems people felt that miscanthus was less of a long-term commitment and that it could be grubbed up.  However, the horticultural experts tell me that it is quite difficult to do so.  Once one has miscanthus one has it for a while.  One needs to be used to it and be sure of what one is doing.  Willow is easier to get rid of but because it seems more wood-like, people think it is more permanent.  These are questions that people are facing up to.  Edenderry has been carrying out an experiment on co-firing with miscanthus on a larger scale to see whether there is a market there.  It appears, however, that has not been as successful as was expected.  Perhaps willow, which has not been so widely taken up, would be more effective in that regard because it has the scope for use as wood pellets and wood chips.  In addition, it has more well-established uses.  We are in new territory.</p>

            <p eId="para_727">As the acreage is dropping, the figures speak for themselves.  There is no doubt about it, but why is it dropping?  The political drive to get renewable energy into the system by making it viable is the key point because it is not considered viable.  The Minister of State referred to the viability of miscanthus versus willow.  There was a huge uptake in forestry when grants and incentives were there, but it has slowed down.  It is a permanent 30-year cycle, so it has nothing to do with that.  We hope to have a bio-energy initiative with Bord na Móna and Coillte.  Until such time as landowners are convinced that growing renewable energy crops is viable, they will not do it.  Is it possible to take from these figures what is glaringly obvious — that it is not viable?  Does the Government propose to redirect policy towards it?</p>

          <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_488" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Trevor Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_728">There are factors that have a bearing on the uptake and one, as Deputy Sherlock stated, is its economic viability.  The recession has had many knock-on effects, one of which is the reduction in the price of oil.  The viability of planting and processing a crop and getting a return for the labour means that naturally it will be difficult to compete with a product which has been lying in the ground collecting solar energy over millions of years and just needs to be pumped out and refined to be ready for use.  The economic issues will change as oil becomes more expensive and the phase we are in at present is that we need to put the infrastructure in place, even though it is more costly at present, so that when oil becomes unaffordable we will have an infrastructure that can be expanded and the skills to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">We are in a difficult period because we have to fund this transition and getting money to fund such a transition is difficult in a recession.  We are not at the ideal by a long shot; we need to appraise the viability in the current economic circumstances and consider how this fuel will be used.  There have been experiments on turning miscanthus into briquettes to try to compete with the wood-chip element in the renewable bio-energy sector and apparently they have been reasonably successful — I have not seen the details.  This is the level of trial taking place at present and it is part of the bio-energy action plan which aims to increase the use of bio-energy in the heat, CHP and transport markets to 2020.  We work with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_731">Decisions on marketing campaigns are primarily a matter for Bord Bia.  In this case I understand that Bord Bia considered that a fresh approach was needed to raise customer awareness and transparency on the origin of food and supplier information when eating out.  Féile Bia membership, which peaked at 1,500 food service outlets, had decreased in recent years to very low levels of participants.  In addition, questions had been raised about its effectiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">The Just Ask campaign aims to encourage and empower consumers, when eating out, to ask for information on where the food on their plate, particularly meat, comes from and to encourage restaurants to provide this information on their menus.  The marketing activities for the Just Ask campaign, which was launched in March, include targeted national and local radio and press advertising, on-line and print media activities and promotions targeting chefs directly.  Research to date carried out by Bord Bia shows that over a third of the target group interviewed are aware of the Just Ask campaign and say it would encourage them to ask where their meats are coming from when eating out.  That would indicate that Bord Bia's public awareness campaign is having a good impact at an early stage.</p>

This is not the only reason for the change and I hope Deputy Sherlock agrees with that.  We were getting less and less buy-in to the Féile Bia scheme and we needed a reality check; we could not blindly continue with the Féile Bia scheme when of the 81 applications received in 2008 only seven restaurants met the criteria.  It needed to be examined and reviewed and the outcome of that review has been a better value for money scheme.</p>

On the one hand there was Féile Bia, which was in Irish, but, on the other, it was not as widely applied throughout the country as it should have been and it was becoming increasingly irrelevant.  The Just Ask scheme is a fresh approach and, as I indicated, it is receiving good support from the public.</p>

            <p eId="para_757">While the Just Ask campaign is primarily about meat, it is about all produce.  The important question of labelling is dealt with by the Food Safety Authority primarily.  Bord Bia has no remit to promote non-Irish food; at the same time it is not the authority that deals with control of labelling and this must be clarified.  The Just Ask campaign is about Irish produce but it requires people to ask, as the name suggests.</p>

We see Bord Bia quality assurance signs on chicken, beef and fish.  Those items that do not have it are conspicuous.  I pride myself on becoming informed in restaurants and outlets.  The Féile Bia scheme was not completely useless.  I do not know why "Just Ask" could not have been added to the existing scheme.  There was familiarity and an information campaign was required: why was this not done?  We were half way there.  If it was not working effectively it should have been improved rather than completely rejigged.</p>

            <p eId="para_759">We have had discussions such as this previously and undoubtedly we will have them again.  Much of the non-Irish produce coming into Ireland was going to catering.  It is important to make a fresh start, which this is.  The emphasis is on the new campaign, Just Ask, by which the public is mandated to establish where food comes from and who produces it.  Restaurants are being urged to provide that information so people will not have to ask as many questions.  It is important to point out that Bord Bia does not promote non-Irish produce, and the suggestion that the organisation might apply its funding to promoting products from outside Ireland carrying an Irish label is false.  It is equally important to note that Bord Bia does not, nor is it required to, promote products from any other origin.  Suggestions of that nature are misleading to consumers, as they have been in the media, and are extremely damaging to an industry that has come under enormous pressure in a difficult marketing environment.  Bord Bia is about promoting Irish produce.</p>

            <p eId="para_761">I was delighted to hear the president of the IFA, Mr. Padraig Walshe, on the radio this morning asking people to buy Irish produce.  The reason Mr. Walshe can do that but neither I nor the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, can is that the use of State money for the guaranteed Irish campaign is not allowed under EU rules. I have met representatives of the Restaurants Association of Ireland and others to make that point.  It is a case of horses for courses.  The Government and Bord Bia, the agency with the remit in this area, have a responsibility to provide the type of quality assurance required but in the case of a guaranteed Irish scheme, such as was mentioned by the Deputy, we can go so far but no further.  We can promote EU produce but a guaranteed Irish campaign would require non-taxpayers' money.  Thankfully, there is a willingness on the part of stakeholders such as the IFA and the Restaurants Association to put private money behind such campaigns.  Once we have the quality assurance and the guaranteed Irish assurance from those who can do it, we can combine the two to get the message across that buying Irish means buying the best quality.  That is the ultimate result.</p>

          <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_519" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Tony Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_764">The Commission is currently conducting a review of disadvantaged areas across the Community, having been mandated by the Council of Ministers to conduct the review.  The object of the exercise is to establish a Community-wide system, which will allow comparisons between regions on the basis of eight bio-physical criteria rather than the socio-economic criteria which were used when defining the current disadvantaged areas.  This is a very important issue for Ireland as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland's total land area.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">From an economic perspective the disadvantaged areas scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions in Ireland.  I can fully understand and appreciate the current proposal to move from the existing socio-economic criteria for defining disadvantaged areas to a system of definition based on physical and climatic criteria.  However, despite the significant progress made between officials of the Commission, the Joint Research Centre and my own Department in addressing the scope of the new criteria, there are still areas which need further attention to ensure the new criteria may accurately reflect the reality of farming in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">If, as seems to be the case, physical characteristics will be used to classify disadvantaged areas, the crucial one from our point of view is soil drainage, taking into account the impact of water logging.  While the proposed criteria include climate, it appears only to provide for the impact of drought on farming activities in the EU.  In my view, there is also need to provide for the climate in north-western Europe and the impact of heavy rainfall on soil moisture conditions and the adverse impact this has on farming activities for long periods of the year, resulting in the land being unsuitable for grazing or machinery traffic — what is referred to technically as trafficability.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">The other important criteria from Ireland's viewpoint are soil and slope.  Currently there is insufficient information available to classify areas using the soil characteristics of texture/stoniness and rooting depth.  The lack of detailed data across all member states is recognised by the Commission in this communication and, as the Commission is already aware, a comprehensive soil classification survey is currently being undertaken in Ireland, following completion of which the required information will be available.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">The Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, has raised his concerns regarding the criteria at the Council of Ministers and has argued strongly for due recognition to be given to the restrictions which our climate places on farming activities for long periods of the year.  Our officials have had numerous meetings with Commission officials and, currently, a series of working groups involving all member states, together with Commission officials and officials of the Joint Research Centre, under the chairmanship of the Czech Presidency, is ongoing.  I remain committed to working closely with the Commission to progress work in this area in order that the necessary analysis is completed, allowing appropriate proposals to be brought forward to Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_769">In the budget last October, Fianna Fáil's mask slipped in respect of its continuing commitment to the disadvantaged areas scheme.  There was a significant reduction in payments to farmers.  I believe the word "review" is code for a reduction in further funding for the scheme.  Is last October's budget the thin end of the wedge?  What is the commitment of Fianna Fáil to the disadvantaged areas scheme as a policy instrument to retain the maximum number of people and farm families working on the land?  Will the Minister publish and place in the Oireachtas Library all the documentation that has been the subject of negotiation with the Department on the criteria that have been published by the Commission?  Doing so would provide clarity on what is informing the Government's position in these negotiations.  Is it a financial issue or is it, as the Minister might want us to believe, based on the criteria outlined by the Commission?  Will he place all the details about this matter in the Oireachtas Library?</p>

            <p eId="para_770">The best illustration of the commitment of the Government to ensuring that Ireland continues to benefit from the disadvantaged areas scheme is the work being done at Council level by the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, and departmental officials to ensure that the new criteria — there is some justification for the new criteria — are such that the reality of farming conditions in Ireland is taken fully into account.  I can assure the Deputy there is an absolute commitment to the advantages that exist in terms of income to farm families — I mentioned that 100,000 Irish farm families benefit from this scheme — and to ensuring the maximum number continue to be in a position to avail of it.  However, this is an EU review which many people, including many Irish people and farming organisations, consider to be long overdue.  There is a very good case from an Irish perspective for bringing forward criteria which are similar or even-handed across Europe and which take account of not only regional disparities but also the reality of soil conditions, the difficulties imposed by slope and the huge difficulties imposed on Irish farmers by the high level of rainfall.</p>

            <p eId="para_772">That issue does not arise at this stage.  What is currently under way is an examination of the criteria for judging the areas to be included.  Having closely examined them I am of the view that, assuming we can succeed in having the climatic and soil conditions which apply in Ireland kept to the forefront, the outcome will be advantageous for Ireland.  This review is an attempt to ensure similar criteria are in operation throughout the European Union.  In the case of Ireland, issues such as climate, rainfall levels, wet-weather logging of soil and the lack of accessibility for long periods of the year make farming conditions particularly challenging.  The review process is examining the criteria that ought to apply to the disadvantaged area scheme with the objective of ensuring they are more evenly applied across the entire Community.  From our perspective, there are considerable advantages in this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_773">I support the Minister of State's argument regarding rainfall and land conditions.  In my own immediate area, all the animals continue to be housed, even though it is 20 May, at considerable expense to farmers.  It is vital that funding is available to assist them.  However, the Department has weakened its own position in lowering the funding available to commercial farmers.  While 100,000 farmers will receive assistance, commercial farmers are subject to a substantial decrease in support.  Will the Minister of State review this situation?  It will be easier for him to argue the case in Brussels if he is seen to be sincere in his objectives.  Withdrawing funding from commercial farmers will not help his case.</p>

            <from>Deputy Tony Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_774">An important proof of our commitment in this area is the fact that we have one of the most generously funded disadvantaged schemes in the European Union.  There is an acknowledgement at European level that our commitment to the scheme supports our views on the matter.  I take Deputy Crawford's point regarding commercial farmers.  However, the true importance of this scheme is that it provides a source of income for 100,000 farming families working in the worst land area conditions in the State.  Our aim is to ensure these families continue to benefit from the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">Every Deputy is aware of particular individuals who claim they were unfairly excluded from the most recent review in regard to disadvantaged areas.  We will make the case in regard to soil conditions and other criteria.  It is important to bear in mind that the review process is at a relatively early stage.  Criteria are being reviewed with a view to coming forward with a scheme at European level.  At this stage, the onus is on us to ensure that criteria which are important from an Irish perspective continue to be part of the consideration of this important matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Tony Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_777">The Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, is the fisheries policy of the European Union.  It was first put in place in 1983 and has been subject to reviews every ten years, the most recent in 2002.  The next review is formally scheduled for 2012.  On 21 April 2009, the European Commission published a Green Paper on future reform of the CFP in order to launch a consultation with member states and stakeholders and to initiate a broad public debate on future CFP reform.  A summary of this consultation process will be published in 2010.  It will be followed by a legislative proposal to the Council and the European Parliament to be adopted in 2011, with a view to its entering into force in 2012.  It is clear that every aspect of the CFP is up for review and will require detailed attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">An exchange of views on the Green Paper will take place at the next Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 25 May 2009.  The Green paper identifies five structural failings of the current policy, namely, fleet over-capacity, imprecise policy objectives, a decision-making system that is focused on the short term, a framework that does not give sufficient responsibility to industry, and a culture of poor compliance.  It goes on to focus on improving the management of EU fisheries, and issues such as supporting coastal communities, relative stability and marketing are raised.  Other areas covered include aquaculture, financial support and externalities.  I welcome the Commission's Green Paper on the reform of the CFP and acknowledge the importance of the process we are embarking on, which will culminate in the shaping of the strategic blueprint for the European fishing industry for the next decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">In the current economic climate, we need a policy that simplifies and reduces the administrative burden and, at the same time, strengthens and supports the industry's capacity to maximise employment in coastal communities dependent on fishing.  This will be a key objective for Ireland.  We will pursue initiatives that deliver and sustain jobs in coastal communities rather than those that promote the concentration of wealth and delivery of excessive profits for a small number of large international businesses.  The Minister, Deputy Smith, has already outlined these priorities for Ireland at last month's Agriculture and Fisheries Council and he intends to address them in greater details at next week's Council on 25 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">It is critical that we have a broad and in-depth review of the policy that takes account of the views of all interested stakeholders.  The CFP review has been on the agenda at several formal and informal meetings with industry, most recently at the Sea Fisheries Consultative Council meeting on 7 May.  The Federation of Irish Fishermen, FIF, has indicated its intention to pursue a process to develop its position in the matter and I await the result of its deliberations.  I intend to engage in a parallel process of consultations with all stakeholders, including the FIF, to inform Ireland's position on the review.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_793">I propose to take the questions together.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">There is no question of not proceeding with a prison development at Thornton Hall.  The rationale for replacing the Mountjoy Prison complex has been well set out, fully accepted by the Government and acknowledged in the House, including by the Taoiseach this morning.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">Today, more than 1,100 prisoners are being held in cramped conditions in the Mountjoy Prison complex, which the Government is committed to replacing with a prison at Thornton Hall.  This initiative was always intended to be a longer-term project and it is for this very reason that we have moved to increase prison accommodation in recent years.  In the short term, the issue of increasing bed capacity in our prisons will be addressed by the provision of an additional 400 prison spaces this summer.  Excluding these spaces, which have been built and are ready for commissioning, the Department has, since 1997, added close to 1,400 spaces to the prison estate.  Our record shows significant investment in the criminal justice system, not least in the prison system.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">The money spent to date on the Thornton Hall project is not wasted expenditure.  The site will be used for the new prison and in any event, the cost of acquiring it — €29.9 million — was effectively met by the sale of prison lands at Shanganagh, County Dublin.  The Thornton Hall site is an excellent location for a major prison development as it is located fewer than ten miles from the city centre, approximately three miles from Dublin Airport and is accessible from the M2.  It is large enough to allow the development of a major prison complex with a range of facilities and to establish a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> around the complex to stop drugs and other illicit goods being thrown into the prison, while having sufficient capacity for future expansion.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">An additional 8.7 acres have been acquired to provide a dedicated access road to the main prison site.  This was done following representations from the local community which reflected concern about the effect of increased traffic generated by the prison development.  The cost of the additional land was €1.3 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">A total of €10.3 million was expended to the end of March 2009 on professional fees and preliminary site works, including surveys, landscaping, security, site preparation and maintenance of the property.  As is the case in all major infrastructural projects, comprehensive geological, engineering and archaeological surveys were conducted at the site.  The work covered by this expenditure is not wasted as it is required, irrespective of which tenderer is eventually selected to develop the prison complex at Thornton Hall.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">Public private partnerships continue to be suitable for certain types of projects, including in the justice area.  They allow us to bring forward major long-term infrastructural projects while spreading the financial impact on Exchequer expenditure over a 20 or 25-year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">On the decision taken by the Irish Prison Service to break off negotiations with the preferred bidder, the Léargas consortium, to design, build, maintain and finance the project, the negotiations with the preferred bidder were lengthy and complex and conducted in good faith.  I am disappointed they did not lead to a successful outcome.  The banking crisis gave rise to complications and delay.  While my Department was aware that the crisis would have an effect on the availability and cost of finance, the question was to what extent this would be the case and whether this effect could be offset by reductions in construction costs.  These negotiations came to a head recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">Léargas was formally asked to submit its final financial offer to the project.  Following a detailed evaluation of this offer by the Irish Prison Service and its advisers, the offer was deemed not to be affordable.  This was because the figures quoted were significantly higher then the original quotation which resulted in Léargas being chosen as the preferred bidder.  Increases in the cost of finance were a significant factor and no significant reduction in construction costs was put forward to offset the increased costs of finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_802">As I have stated on many occasions, including in the House, other options are available and we will now pursue these options.  While Thornton Hall will proceed, we must find a more affordable solution for the taxpayer who must secure better value, taking into account developments in prices in the construction industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">I confirm that it is my intention to bring comprehensive new proposals to the Government in a matter of weeks on how we can proceed with building a new, modern, regime-orientated prison complex at Thornton Hall.  I am confident my revised plans will meet the twin objective of giving us modern accommodation and best protecting taxpayers' interests.  Following consideration by the Government, I will make a public announcement on the matter.  While the project will proceed, if we have to suffer a delay to ensure we secure a more affordable and cost effective solution, that will be the only responsible approach to take.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">An area of 20 acres was set aside as a potential site for the development of a new Central Mental Hospital.  Although adjacent to the prison site, it is not directly linked to the prison development.  A decision regarding its future is a matter primarily for the Health Service Executive and Department of Health and Children.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_805">The Minister indicated that the Thornton Hall project was always a long-term project.  I put it to him that the phrase "long-term" has a much different meaning now than it had on the previous occasion we addressed this issue.  The Minister uses the phrase as if the latest development was not a setback.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">Is the Minister prepared to stand over spending in excess of €40 million of taxpayers' money to date on this project?  Does he regard a price of €29.9 million for 150 acres as good and reasonable value in the circumstances?  Will he provide full and detailed particulars of the costs of the project to date?  Will he confirm that legal and specialist consultancy fees amount to in excess of €6 million?  Will he provide a full breakdown of moneys expended over and above the €29.9 million figure, which is a matter of record?  Will he address specifically the €11 million in additional expenditure on the project?</p>
            <p eId="para_807">In the context of moneys, what are the ongoing maintenance costs of the Thornton Hall site?  Will we have another fiasco along the lines of the electronic voting machines, with annual costs having to be met?  I understand millions of euro have been spent at the site on landscaping and fencing to deny access to people who wish to shoot pheasants.  To what ongoing maintenance costs has the Minister signed up?</p>
            <p eId="para_808">In terms of the options available to the Minister, will he outline his short-term plans to address the chronic overcrowding in our prisons which has rendered Mountjoy Prison a dangerous and inhumane place?</p>

            <p eId="para_811">One does not provide potentially 2,200 prison spaces for the next year or two.  The project was always intended to be what Mountjoy Prison was when it was built, namely, a prison for the next 100 years.  Thornton Hall will be the most modern prison in the world when it is built.  The Government will not resile from its plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">As I stated, the overall costs to date are €41.6 million.  Site acquisition costs, which amounted to €29.9 million, were effectively met from the sale of lands at Shanganagh Prison.  As the Taoiseach noted this morning, we made effective use of the prison building suite to get rid of prisons which had become obsolete.  In the case of Shanganagh Prison, a cohort of prisoners was not available to serve sentences in an open prison designed for juvenile offenders.</p>

            <p eId="para_814">The optimum prison capacity is for 400 or more prisoners.  In the past ten or 12 years, the Irish Prison Service has sought to concentrate resources on larger prisons rather than having prisons spread throughout the country.  It was €29.9 million on the site and €1.3 million in additional costs — €31.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">On the value of the site, it is interesting to note that a local auctioneer who was interviewed by RTE radio at the time of the purchase confirmed that he would not have been able to identify a similar site closer to Dublin for less money.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_817">There has been much discussion in this House, at the Committee of Public Accounts and elsewhere on the purchase of the site.  The Irish Prison Service could have gone under the counter and not admitted the purchase price of this site.  The prison service could have engaged an auctioneer to work on its behalf and buy the land, without being open and transparent.  However, it genuinely felt that being a State agency, it was correct to indicate to those from whom it was being purchased and those in the locality exactly what was intended for the site and not buy it surreptitiously.  It deserves credit for that.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">On the additional costs, there were professional fees related to archaeological issues and all the necessary surveys.  There was an environmental impact assessment, EIA, of the site.  As the Taoiseach stated this morning, there were High Court actions.  There were two High Court actions from people who objected to the proposal for the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">The site and preparations surveys cost €2.7 million.  Landscaping costs, of which many are making a big issue, came to €0.4 million.  Security costs come to €0.5 million.  The total spent up to May 2009 is €41.6 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">It is nonsensical to state that we got nothing for our money.  We got 150 acres out in Thornton Hall——</p>

            <p eId="para_824">It is a site that, despite what Deputy Rabbitte stated on radio this morning, is in a rural area, and that is contiguous to Dublin, to the populations and to all of the major routes in and out of Dublin on the north side.</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_546">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_825">Why does the Minister keep referring to trading Shanganagh for €30 million and spending it on a farm that was worth €6 million, as if that makes it all right?  How does trading Shanganagh make it all right?  On the auctioneers whom he quoted on the radio, there were several of them who stated that it should have been bought for approximately €6 million.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that it cost more than twice what it ought to have cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">On telling us that the Prison Service should have bought it quietly, I should have thought that is exactly what it should have done.  Going around stating one has €30 million to spend on a site, what does one expect will happen but one will get a site for €30 million?  From the point of view of the vendor, this was the biggest claim jump since the Yukon, and now it has collapsed.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">I ask the Minister to tell us why it collapsed.  He spoke of bankability.  He spoke of the banking crisis and it not being off-set by reductions in building costs.  What does he mean by that?  He told the House as recently as 22 April that everything was on course.  For whom is the banking crisis the issue here?  Is it for the preferred bidder?</p>
            <p eId="para_828">Why does he presume that if this preferred bidder is to be replaced by another, that the other preferred bidder will not have these bankability problems and will not have the problems of construction costs?  The Minister did not explain to the House why a different builder can go ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">When the Minister states he has other options am I correct in assuming that he is referring to other options for the construction of a prison on this same site?</p>

            <p eId="para_832">The other options refer to other options at Thornton Hall and nowhere else on the building of a prison.  The principal conclusion of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the purchase of the site was that if we had engaged an agent to acquire the site on our behalf without stating who we were and for what purpose it was intended, we would have acquired the site for a reduced price.  At the time the Prison Service and my Department rejected that view on the grounds that Government agencies had to act in an open and transparent manner.  To have proceeded in a covert manner would have left the Minister, the Department and the Government open to allegations that the State had acted illegally by acquiring agriculturally zoned lands at a particular price and then conferring a commercial advantage by means of legislation introduced to facilitate the prison development.</p>

            <p eId="para_837">On the issue of the Mountjoy site, that was not purchased by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the prison service.  It was purchased by the OPW in the context that in moving the entire Mountjoy complex out to Thornton Hall there would be a major redevelopment in the inner city Mountjoy location.</p>

            <p eId="para_839">I heard it was in the region of €23 million.  That was purchased by the OPW in the context of a future development of the Mountjoy site for housing, for retail and to make it a centre of excellence in the middle of, originally, what was a reasonably depressed area because of the presence of the prison.  That was something to enhance that area.  The intention is, as the Taoiseach stated, to continue with that project of enhancing the Mountjoy complex once the prisoners are out in Thornton Hall.</p>

            <p eId="para_841">I go back to the point made.  The preferred bidder was accepted on the basis of a particular price.  In the intervening period, particularly in the context of the global financial turmoil and the difficulty in getting finance, it was accepted that the cost of financing this and another project would increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">On the reason the negotiations collapsed, as I stated many times in this House, I was not privy to the discussions.  Obviously, I was informed as to the progress.  No more than the Deputies, I was agitating to get this matter brought to finality so that we could get on with building the prison.  There was an imperative in that there is overcrowding in our prisons.  Despite the 400 places already built and ready for occupation in order to take care of the short-term issue in the next couple of years, I accept there is an imperative.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">Even if the State was over a barrel on this matter, we were not going to pay out a blank cheque.  It is the case that the annual cost, what is called the annual unitary cost, of this went up by more than 30% since 2007 to date.  Although most of that was due to the cost of finance, it was not off-set by a concurrent reduction in construction costs.</p>

There is one in my constituency where the prices have come in 10% to 20% under what was originally indicated two or three years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">Given that this project, and the way it was framed in the context of the initial bid increasing by 30%, became unaffordable from the taxpayers' point of view, in effect, we will consider other options.  As Deputies must accept, I have always told the House that, while we had a preferred bidder with whom our people were discussing the matter, we would go to the other options were that process to be unsuccessful.  In the coming weeks, I will revert to the Government to determine how to proceed.  We will consider PPPs and the use of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, as the latter could be used for this type of project.</p>

            <p eId="para_847">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for taking my question, but I am deeply disappointed that the Government is not in a position to reply.  The Minister stated that he was not responsible and my question to the Government on the Central Mental Hospital at Thornton Hall has been ignored.  Where does collective responsibility enter into it?  I am surprised that the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, is not present, since this is an issue for him.  The Government has chosen to ignore what the Ceann Comhairle and I agreed was an issue arising from changes in the Thornton Hall project.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">In transferring the Central Mental Hospital to a location adjacent to a prison, the Government is ignoring the human rights of people with mental illness.  To locate a mental illness therapeutic facility beside a prison stigmatises and discriminates against its patients.  Not only was the proposal roundly rejected by the Central Mental Hospital's families, carers and patients, the voluntary organisations, the Mental Health Commission, the hospital's clinical director and the Irish Human Rights Commission, it flies in the face of the core values and principles enshrined in the report on the mental health services, A Vision for Change, the recommendations of which have been accepted by the Government as policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">Informing the Minister is pointless given the circumstances, but we were informed that a reason for moving the Central Mental Hospital from the lands in Dundrum was their value to the State.  In changed circumstances, their value has been reduced considerably.  For the reasons that I have outlined, the decision to locate the hospital beside a prison should be revisited.</p>

A site in Dundrum will always be a substantial asset.  As the Deputy knows, the original intention was to move the Central Mental Hospital to Thornton Hall and to keep it separate from the prison with its own entrance, although still on the overall site.  Extra land was purchased for this purpose.  The decision——</p>

            <p eId="para_853">I note with some relief the Minister's acknowledgement that there is an alternative to PPPs.  On the indication of the possible use of the NPRF for major public capital works, my colleagues and I would have argued for this time after time.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">Yesterday's announcement regarding Thornton Hall comes hot on the heels of the collapse of regeneration plans for some of Dublin's most marginalised communities.  The common denominator between the PPP arrangements for the regeneration of St. Michael's Estate, O'Devaney Gardens, Sean McDermott Street, Dominick Street and Thornton Hall is Mr. Bernard McNamara.  Irrespective of the fact that the Minister rejects the charge and despite the proven unreliability of PPPs with this particular developer, which is knowledge that the Government has had for 12 months, it is arguable that the Government has wasted approximately €11 million on site security and preparatory works on top of the original expenditure of some €30 million for a site that, as other Deputies have indicated, was only worth in the order of €6 million at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">I am concerned about whether Thornton Hall will ever be used for a prison and I strongly oppose any idea of co-location with a relocated Central Mental Hospital.  The latter would be an outrageous proposition with which to proceed.  I join Deputy Neville in using this opportunity to appeal for a complete reappraisal of that proposition.</p>

            <p eId="para_865">To the best of my recollection, approximately 4,000 people are in prison at any one time, some 0.4% of whom are there for the non-payment of fines.  They have refused every exhortation and have probably been obstinate in paying the fines.  They are not there because of an inability to pay.  Rather, they have adopted a principled position to go to prison instead of paying the fines.  We cannot get away from that situation no matter what legislation we pass.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">I have outlined the case as regards the purchase.  The €10 million over and above the land's purchase would have been spent regardless of which consortium or option we chose.  It was necessary to expend that money.  It is not dead money.  What was done will obviously fit into any subsequent options that are looked at by me.  Regarding time scales, I will come back to the Government in a number of weeks and hopefully we will make an announcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">Our intention would be to have this out for tender sooner rather than later, so that interested parties would have a good period of time over the summer months, when perhaps the building industry is somewhat more dormant than normal, and such parties would have an opportunity to tender.  We may then be able to come back to it towards the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">I do not want to be prescriptive regarding time-scales because this is a major project.  There is a difference of hundreds of millions of euro between the original price and that which was finally suggested and we did not accept.  We must be given some credit, in that if we had responded and agreed to the type of costs, namely, a 30% increase, people in this House and outside would, rightly, query, particularly in the context of the economic situation generally in this country, why we would go ahead with such a project.

It may very well be that we will look, as the Taoiseach indicated this morning on Leaders' Questions, at perhaps phasing it in over time.  Ultimately, we will build and finish a prison in the type of large scale envisaged in the original proposal.  I do not know who mentioned a cost of €6 million, it was not Deputy Flanagan.

            <p eId="para_882">The Minister invites me to agree with him that whatever about the preferred bidder, he had other options.  He never said anything of the kind.  He never communicated to this House that there was any doubt about the preferred bidder.  When the same preferred bidder pulled out from housing projects, I asked the Minister repeatedly if he had satisfied himself about its capacity to deliver.  All the Minister did was give me lectures about how he would not be seen on the same side of the street as a developer.  I do not know what the Minister has against developers, but it was a very odd thing to say.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">I want to ask the Minister a question and would be greatly pleased if he would do me the courtesy of listening to it.  He has told the House most of the 30% increase in cost is due to the cost of finance.  If this bidder had a difficulty with the cost of finance, how does the Minister propose to tell the House that another preferred bidder would not have exactly the same difficulty with the cost of sourcing money?</p>
            <p eId="para_884">Did I hear the Minister say that the difference between the original price and the price the preferred bidder was now trying to extract was hundreds of millions of euro?  That is what I wrote down, namely, that the difference is hundreds of millions of euro.  How much will this project cost us?  I would like the Minister to clarify that.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">I again put the question to the Minister that has been put by my colleagues.  Is it not time to re-think whether the notion of the American-style super prison is what we require?  It is especially the case that we need to re-think it if one is talking about the difference between the price in 2007 and now being hundred of millions of euro.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">How can the Minister ask this House, having regard to electronic voting, PPARS and the collapse of Thornton Hall, to have confidence in the Government?  If this Government was tasked with building a duck pond, the ducks would drown.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_887">Regarding the Deputy's assertion that I did not indicate at any stage there were any difficulties with this, as I said many times, I was not privy to, nor did I take part in, any of the negotiations.  I was informed by my officials as to how the discussions were going.  No more than anyone in this House, I was agitating to ensure this would be built as soon as possible so we could have the available prison spaces.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">On 9 October 2008 I said, in response to parliamentary questions asked by Deputies James Reilly and Leo Varadkar, that in the current fiscal situation facing the country it is important that we all strive to reduce costs, live within our budgets and avoid any cost increases, that the bidder must meet all the criteria, including the financial criteria, in the tender and although a preferred tenderer was selected, there were other tenderers and other viable options which could still be considered if for any reason the negotiations referred to were not successfully concluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">On 29 October, in response to a question asked by Deputy Charles Flanagan, I said there were other tenderers and options which could still be considered.  In November, I said the same to Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh.  I said on numerous occasions that it had to reach certain affordability criteria.  There is a long list and I can give it to the Deputy if required.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">Regarding the issue of hundreds of millions of euro, this is a major project.  We would have been guilty of a dereliction of duty if we were to agree to a proposal where the cost of finance, which it is accepted would be an issue with other bidders, would be a substantial issue regarding the overall cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">Where there was not a <i>quid pro quo</i> regarding a significant reduction in the construction costs, and when we see in other projects that the reduction in costs of tenders can be 10% or 20% across any building project in which the Government is involved, we believe we should, in effect, cut off the negotiations because this was unaffordable in its current form and we would look again at the other viable options.  As I said earlier, it may be that we will consider the possibility of funding this through PPPs or the pension reserve fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">A number of other ancillary services within the prison might not necessarily be required in the future.  For instance, there was provision for a juvenile block for Oberstown House.  We can reconsider a number of the details of the original proposal that would ultimately reduce the cost but still get us the net result of having a substantial prison facility on the Thornton Hall site that would deal with the prison population for approximately 15 to 20 years hence.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_893">The Minister claimed in his response to me that the sum of approximately €11 million that had been expended in the period since the purchase of Thornton Hall was all moneys employed as part of future investment for the project, and that it was not wasted money.  Whatever has been expended, if the footprint of what was proposed is not to proceed, surely in terms of site security and whatever other development works, a significant element of it will not have any forward application.  It is a sustainable argument that moneys have been expended unnecessarily over the period, if at the end of the day the whole thing goes pear-shaped and the money is wasted.  It will join the litany of many other areas of wastage by this Government in the past decade plus.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">The Minister made reference to alternative funding mechanisms.  I emphasise this is not to in any way commend an approach to Thornton Hall by any alternative means.  I record again my opposition to the proposition in principle, both in regard to the so-called super prison and to the transfer of the Central Mental Hospital.  The Minister has indicated that there are realistic alternatives to the employment of PPPs in terms of funding public capital works.  That is the first time I have heard such talk for some time, if at all previously.  I commend that approach for appropriate public capital works in the future.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund is just such a mechanism for funding these works into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">Will the Minister employ that mechanism to fund the essential major refurbishment works necessary in existing prison facilities, having ensured that the current prison numbers are reduced appropriately in line with earlier arguments.  I refer to the detainment of persons for the non-payment of fines, many of whom, despite what the Minister said, are in prison because they cannot afford to make repayments.  People are in prison because they are unable or incapable of meeting debt repayments to various financial institutions, a number of whom are clearly from each and every one of our constituencies.  I refer also to those I mentioned previously, immigrants who are unnecessarily detained in prison environments due to technical matters relevant to their presence in this jurisdiction.  Surely, those are the steps and measures that must be taken?  The National Pensions Reserve Fund is a means of funding the necessary works to address the already inadequate prison conditions that are in use today.</p>

            <p eId="para_896">I wish to scotch the myth of this being a super prison.  It is eight separate facilities within an overall site.  It was designed in such a way that all of the separate facilities could share services and provide value for money due to the economies of scale involved.  That goes back to the point I made earlier, that it is better to have sizeable prisons rather than a plethora of smaller prisons around the country with separate systems and staff.  It is preferable to have economies of scale and that was the principle behind the project.  It is not like an American super-style prison, it was to be designed and built in the most modern way according to best international practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">On the use of PPPs, it is still a viable option because under it the State, and therefore the taxpayer, would not have paid a penny until such time as the prison was handed over.  The unitary annual costs would not begin until the prison was handed over.  That would be a benefit from the point of view of the Exchequer.</p>

I have already had discussions with the Minister for Finance about the use of the National Pensions Reserve Fund for the overall building programme.  This Government stands on its record, in that since 1997 we have increased the number of prison places by 1,300, in total contrast to what happened previously when no places were added for many years.  We are now adding another 400 places before the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_902">I wish to get the Minister to focus once again on the figures.  If the difference is hundreds of millions, and the difference is 30%, then the full cost of the project must be more than three times hundreds of millions.  I do not think the public or the taxpayer has ever heard that figure before today.  It seems to me to be the best argument for rethinking the entire project.  I put it to the Minister again, now that the collapse has taken place, is it not an opportunity to go back to the drawing board?  If the Minister has 400 places coming on-stream then there is a breathing space for us to work this out.  It is unthinkable that we should have to pay the kind of money that is now being talked about to fund this project.  Regardless of whatever happens to the site in the future, the Prison Service acquired it.  The Minister's Green Party colleagues in Government opposed the purchase bitterly at the time.  Perhaps they would have some use for it but for us to pile hundreds of millions on top of it——</p>

That was not the case in respect of this particular tenderer and that is why ultimately it was not affordable.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">On the hundreds of millions and the 30% increase, one cannot build a prison with eight facilities to the highest international standards, do justice to all the issues of maintaining the human rights and dignity of prisoners and make sure they have the appropriate conditions without spending a huge amount of money.  That is why I have said on many occasions that this is and was always a long-term project.  It is not something that will take care of the prison system requirements for the next two to three years, which is why in the interim we have been extending Wheatfield, Portlaoise and Castlerea prisons.  They are the three locations where the 400 prison places have been made available and will come on-stream in the coming months.  We were not taking everything for granted and waiting for Thornton Hall to come on-stream in the next year or two, even in 2005 when it was originally purchased.  We should be given credit for not only dealing with the short term, but also for the long term and for future generations.  Since Mountjoy was built, no Government has thought about this in the long term.  We should be given credit for that.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_602">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_909">I referred to the Minister's knife awareness campaign before the debate adjourned, which was announced last February with a great fanfare of publicity, a budget of €200,000, a promise of a series of road shows, schools visits, and a nationwide advertising campaign.  As part of the campaign, the Minister promised to build a presence on the social networking sites.  This was the new message delivery approach from the Minister, but it has failed.  The campaign's Bebo site has been viewed only 329 times since January and not one person engaged in the on-line poll.  The campaign's Facebook site has 39 members, while the campaign on Twitter has a following of 16 members.  There are 170,000 people in this country aged between 18 and 20.  The dedicated campaign website <i>www.howbigdoyoufeel.ie</i> has not been updated and only refers to one public meeting that took place before the Minister even launched the campaign.  The social networking sites reveal no details of the public meetings, no details of the road shows, and it would appear that no campaigning has taken place at all.  Community gardaí could be working on this issue on the ground, but the national campaign is not working, even though it needs to be to enforce the seriousness of knife crime.  This is an area where the Minister has not shown himself to be proactive.  There has been total failure to meet the target audience, and a form of action is needed to address the sharp rise in knife crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">I am pleased the Minister has finally decided to outlaw the use of the samurai sword, which is a vicious implement.  I cannot think of any other reason that a samurai sword would be brandished, other than to inflict injury on individuals.  The swords are used as a macho badge of honour by males in this city and beyond.  It is still possible to walk into a shop in this city, purchase a samurai sword and any array of deadly weapons for less than €100.  The easy availability of these swords has facilitated some vicious crimes in recent years.  One example was the brutal attack in a Finglas pub in 2008, when a man's hand was sliced off in full view of the other customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">Section 18 deals with the European arrest warrant, and it makes provision for arrest without warrant.  If I understand it correctly, this provision will only become operational once the Schengen information system is put in place.  It may be some time before this occurs.  An important aspect of the Bill is the provision that allows the Garda Síochána the power to take fingerprints, photographs, and palm prints of persons arrested for comparison purposes with the European arrest warrant.  Until now, the Garda Síochána could not do this and it will make the process more efficient.  It is important that while the changes may enhance the operation of the European arrest warrant regime, we need at the same time to safeguard the rights of people whose surrender is sought on foot of the warrant.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">Part 3 deals with the Schengen information system.  Can the Minister advise us on our involvement in this?  The European Commission indicated in 2007 that the central system would be ready by the end of 2008, but we are now mid-way into 2009.  I know further issues emerged that need to be addressed before the system can become operational, but much of this Bill is dependent on the operation of the Schengen information system and our involvement therein.  I would have thought that central to this involvement is the setting up of the DNA database here, which will be a key factor in improving the abysmal conviction rate in this country for serious crime.  It is fundamental that all member states of the EU should maintain a DNA database and participate in sharing information on this.  The Minister has indicated his intention to publish the legislation during this session, and I look forward to it.   However, as in the Thornton Hall debacle, there are cost implications here.  For example, how prepared is our "Pulse" system for participation in such an EU friendly database?</p>
          <p eId="para_913">There are additional provisions in the Bill that I will not go into.  This debate was scheduled to start earlier and there is further justice legislation to be dealt with, so I will come back to these issues on Committee Stage.  They include the matter of firearms dealers with valid tax clearance certificates, the issue of imitation guns and the restriction of imitation sporting guns by using colour codes.  I notice the Minister appears to have changed his mind on the issue of credit card skimming.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">I welcome this Bill.  The most controversial aspect is related to the handgun issue.  It is important that we acknowledge that there is a fairly rigorous regime in place already for the sporting use of such guns.  When the Minister speaks of handgun culture and avoiding a Dunblane type situation here, he needs to acknowledge that there is a fairly secure regime already in operation and that genuine sports shooters acknowledge that there must be a robust licensing system in place for club membership rules.  A regime can be put together that is transparent and subject to appropriate Garda vetting and examination.  I look forward to resuming the debate on these matters on Committee Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_603">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_915">In so far as it updates the criminal law, the Labour Party supports this Bill.  We also support bringing into effect the Council decision on the establishment and operation of the Schengen information system.  Whereas the greater part of the Bill is concerned with the European arrest warrant system, and with amending the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, I suspect that the sections concerned with amending the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2006 will be most promoted for public attention.  The public reaction, which is not surprising given the frequency of the resort to the use of illegal weapons in our society, will be to welcome any measures that promise to tackle gun crime.  On closer scrutiny, whereas the Bill reforms the law in the matter of the possession of firearms, the link to restricting the weapons available to criminal gangs is harder to find.  I will return to this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">I accept the conclusions of the experts and of those at the coalface that this Bill will tighten up and improve the operation of the European arrest warrant system and surrender procedures.  However, I am bound to admit that I do not have available to me the knowledge or backup to evaluate in detail the procedures being put in place under the amendments.  I do not believe the procedures put in place by the Oireachtas generally are adequate to scrutinise some of the measures that originate in Europe.  Perhaps, as we search for a modern day role for Seanad Éireann, that House could be provided with the meaningful role of scrutinising measures referred by Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">A number of miscellaneous issues tacked on to the Bill appear broadly acceptable.  However, Committee Stage will offer an opportunity to examine them in greater detail.  In addition, the Minister has promised a number of additional amendments, the shape of which we do not yet know and as such we will have to wait until we have sight of them before commenting.  On the point I made earlier in regard to research and backup, I take this opportunity to state that the Oireachtas Library and Research Service made contact this morning with a digest on this Bill, which is quite helpful and should be acknowledged.  The Bill has been moved through the House with some speed.  I believe we should acknowledge that service from the library.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">I return now to the supposition I made when drafting my contribution on this Bill.  Notwithstanding the fact that the greater part of the Bill is taken up with the European arrest warrant system and the new procedures, including the miscellaneous matters to which the Minister referred at the end of his speech, it is the measures to deal with firearms that are being promulgated.  The Minister tore into his Second Stage speech at speed, a copy of which we did not have, and had envisaged all types of horrors by the time we caught up with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">Many people outside this House will be under the impression, from what the Minister said, that the Bill deals with the incidents of resort to violent weapons we have seen in recent years, particularly firearms, on the streets of some urban areas of Ireland and will clamp down on the availability of weapons to criminal gangs.  That is the impression people will have.  We will need to tease out this matter in more detail on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">When I heard the Minister's first statement my reaction was similar to that of most citizens, namely, any measure that restricts access by the criminal fraternity to firearms is a good measure.  It goes without saying that anybody committed to the rule of law would not be against measures to reasonably control guns.  Every week, almost without exception, we awake to the loss of life as a result of the use of guns by feuding criminal gangs.  The subliminal message from the Minister was that his new legislative proposals will tackle the availability of weapons to criminal gangs.  The more one examines the Bill, the more one finds the Minister's proposals will have virtually no impact on the use of or access to firearms by criminal gangs.  Rather, it will have significant impact on law-abiding citizens who are members of gun clubs and hold licensed weapons in supervised conditions.  The evidence is that criminals do not get their hands on guns used by such clubs.  We have the Minister's word on this in response to parliamentary questions.  Sporting and gun clubs are not the source of guns for criminal gangs.  The Minister's replies to parliamentary questions show that there is no credible evidence to link legally held handguns with crime of any kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">The Minister, as recently as 22 April, in response to a question on the subject to my colleague, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, made clear that it was not possible to say precisely how many formerly legally held handguns have been used in criminal offences.  The Minister in his speech today, a copy of which I did not have at the time — the Minister will be aware we have had little time to read it given we have been dealing with another Bill in committee — stated that a number of handguns have been stolen from licence holders.  These guns by definition are immediately in criminal hands.  This is an important issue.  There is a hell of a difference between that response and the answers we have been given up to now.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">A relatively small number — I am advised the figure is approximately 1% — of firearms in the country are legally held handguns in the possession of sporting clubs in rigorously prescribed conditions, the licence holders of which have been vetted by the Garda Síochána.  These particular firearms are held for the purpose of participation in legitimate legal sporting disciplines and international competition.  Some individuals have more than one licensed handgun because different sporting disciplines require the use of different types and calibre of handgun.  Taking all this into consideration, it is estimated that we are probably dealing with approximately 500 to 600 individual handgun licence holders and not the proliferation of handguns suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">The question is whether there is any evidence that some of these pistols find their way into the hands of the criminal fraternity.  The Minister, as recently as 22 April, in the parliamentary question to which I referred earlier, told the Dáil that 31 handguns had been recorded as stolen since 2004 and that: "[I]t is not possible to say precisely how many formerly legally held handguns had been used in criminal offences."  It appears there is no evidence to show that legally held handguns or stolen legally held handguns have been used in the commission of any crime.  I am open to correction from the Minister on that point.  There is no evidence that I can find, including from the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">The Labour Party fully supports the law being brought up to date in the matter of the licensing of firearms, their security and their use.  We do not, however, support measures purportedly introduced to tackle crime being used to put legitimate sports clubs out of business.  The sport of handgun target shooting in Ireland is not insignificant and is a dimension of indigenous rural business in some counties.  If there was evidence that handguns used in any of the 40 plus shooting ranges were finding their way into the hands of criminals using firearms in our estates and on our streets, the Labour Party would support the banning of handguns.  However, no such evidence exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">On closer scrutiny of this part of the Bill it would appear that the manner of framing critical sections is a knee-jerk reaction by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform following recent terrible shooting tragedies, particularly in Limerick.  The spin being put out by agents of the Minister is to the effect that he is taking tough action on gun control which will help put the feuding gangs out of business.  On closer scrutiny it is clear that the principal casualties of the Bill will be law abiding citizens who use licensed handguns for legitimate sporting purposes after submitting to rigorous assessment by the Garda Síochána.  This part of the Bill therefore requires a fundamental rethink and revision.  The Minister is smiling and I am always happy to put a smile on his face, but I refer him to some typical correspondence——</p>

          <p eId="para_934">I do not know why the Minister is getting so defensive here.  I am merely putting to him during the Second Stage debate the representations we are getting.  For example, I received a letter from a citizen — I could give the Minister his name if he wanted as I do not suspect there is any secrecy about it.  He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_935">I have participated in the shooting sports since 1990, representing my country Internationally on many occasions, most recently the World Hand Gun Championships in Indonesia in 2008.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_936">This bill will have no effect on the increase in serious crime in Ireland, as has already been acknowledged by Minister Ahern.  The only persons who will be affected will be the law abiding citizens of this State.  The Bill is grossly unjustified, unfair, and will not have the effect the Minister is seeking.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_937">The banning of licenced handguns in particular is an effort to seek a solution to a problem that does not exist.  Every licenced owner of a firearm in the State has been vetted by An Gardai Siochana, and in particular persons who posses hand guns.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_938">There has been NO alarming increase in hand gun licences since 2004.  The Ministers is incorrect in his extrapolation of the increase over the coming years.  As a member of a shooting club with a membership of 150 persons, those of us who are interested in competing with hand guns already have a licensed hand gun.  As with every new item that comes to the market, there is always an increase of acquisition in the beginning.  In fact, there are far fewer licenced hand guns in the State today then there were in 1972, when hand guns were last licensed [for the reasons we know].</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_939">I must also protest in the strongest terms the comparison between Irish shooters and the situation in the United States.  [The Minister made that comparison today.]  There is not a "hand gun culture" among Irish shooters, as the Minister repeatedly states.  If there are 1,800 Porsche cars in the country do we also have a Porsche culture?  There is, however a passion for our sport.  The Minister would be far more accurate in comparing us to our neighbours in the rest of the European Union.  Every other EU country, bar the United Kingdom, recognise the shooting sports as a valid sport, and also recognise hand guns as valid sporting tools.  Only this year both the Danish and Swedish Ministries of Justice recognised Practical Shooting as a legitimate and safe sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">The letter continues for another page.  To be honest, I know very little about it, but that is what he states.  Apparently there are approximately 40 ranges around the country and he says that shooters are very serious upstanding citizens, vetted by the Garda Síochána.  It is an expensive sport and they are not the kinds of chaps who leave their guns lying around.  Most critically of all there is no evidence I can point to that suggests the criminal gangs that are marauding in urban parts of Ireland are sourcing their weapons from these law-abiding citizens, who are in those shooting clubs.  I would like the Minister to address that issue.  If he has information to the contrary, I will withdraw my opposition and happily go along with the provisions in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">The big point that really jolted me this morning when the Minister was speaking was when he said that we have a gun culture.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_613">
          <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_942">No.  I am trying to prevent a gun culture becoming the norm in society.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_614">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_943">I agree with the Minister entirely on that.  However, I honestly believe that language loses its meaning if we suggest that is what we have.  Is there a country in the entire EU that is more rigorous about the licensing of firearms than ours?  I do not believe there is.  I am very happy to modernise the law and tighten it up further.  However, until the Minister persuades me to the contrary, I have very serious reservations about the impact on respectable law-abiding citizens engaged in a sport, which does not attract me personally.  It is a sport that is recognised internationally and shooters compete internationally.  The Bill contains provisions about prohibiting certain kinds of weapons and provisions about slowing down the renewal of licences, which they believe will cause them gradually to go out of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">Laws are cheap and so is the publicity Ministers can get.  However, we also need investment in the service that enforces those laws.  Garda numbers were set to reach almost 15,000 by the end of 2009.  However, because of early retirements and drastically reduced recruitment this figure will not now be reached.  Reforms are desperately needed in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring the numbers back up.  We desperately need gardaí walking the beat, visible on public transport and visiting schools.  We need gardaí visible in communities they know and serving people they know in order to make a real impact on crime and anti-social behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">It is also to be regretted that the Minister has ignored the opportunity presented by the introduction of this legislation to respond to High Court criticism of the hotchpotch nature of our law on firearms as it stands.  The court as recently as 4 July 2008 criticised the piecemeal spreading over multiple pieces of legislation of the statutory rules for the control of firearms.  It stated that it was undesirable and that codification in this area was almost as pressing as it is, for example, in the area of sexual violence.  Instead the Bill proposes to make further extensive amendments to our firearms control laws and will exacerbate the piecemeal and fragmented nature of this important area of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">Fragmented laws and untracked amendments can result in errors on the part of both the prosecution authorities and defence lawyers and the subsequent misapplication of the law by the courts.  This is apparent from a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal given on 24 March where the court declined to follow a previous decision that was based on the interpretation of a statutory provision that had been effectively repealed and replaced at the time the decision was pronounced.  The Minister ought to be bringing before the House today proposals for the necessary reform of the Firearms Acts into a single, comprehensive, updated and consolidated code.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">Sometimes I am amazed that practitioners of the law in various parts of the country who have to rely on the <i>Law Society Gazette</i> are able to stay abreast of developments given the <i>ad hoc</i>  manner in which amendments were made over the years.  We are adding to that problem with this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">I am sure the Minister genuinely wants to control firearms but his subliminal message about those who raise questions regarding his approach to the matter is that they are not on the side of the angels.  I share the Minister's objective of putting crime bosses and gangs out of business, but no matter how hard I look, I cannot find evidence that thugs and gangsters are sourcing weapons from law abiding citizens with licences to hold handguns.  Certainly, firearms are stolen from members of the farming community because the use of shotguns is unsurprising in rural Ireland and they are not generally protected in the same fashion as weapons held by gun clubs.  From my observation, such thefts are a fairly minor occurrence.  It appears more common that crime bosses purchase guns from the same sources outside the country who supply them with drugs.  We should not give the impression that we are dealing with that scourge.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">As has been noted previously, the present gun control regime is much more rigorous than was the case prior to 1972 because of the decisions which had to be made on foot of circumstances in Northern Ireland.  If the Minister is prepared to accept amendments preventing legitimate handgun holders from being put out of business, this Bill will be welcome in terms of further tightening these controls.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">I concur with Deputy Charles Flanagan regarding knife crime.  I am not sure if he mentioned the 16 responses on Twitter.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, receives more responses to his articles in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  Perhaps he should be diverted from his other duties in order to write articles on this subject in that newspaper because he could thereby reach a larger audience than the cyberspace initiatives of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">The Minister spoke about extensive consultation and claimed that nobody will be surprised by the content of the Bill.  I was informed that the consultative panel was not shown what some of its members regard as controversial proposals.  Again, therefore, his claims of extensive consultation diverges by 180° with the views of people who believe they should have been consulted on and allowed reasonable time for responding to measures to which they take exception.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">He adduced in support of his argument the remarks made by Mr. Justice Charlton.  However, one can find other judges who take differing views.  I tend to agree with the Minister that we ought not to mistake this for an accretion of rights by the persons concerned but, nonetheless, judges differ when responsible people resort to the courts in this matter.  It is not surprising that a member of the Bench would remark that ordinary people are alarmed by the difficulties we face in regard to gun crime.  Violent incidents occur almost every weekend and the contention between bosses for supremacy and the profits flowing from the drugs trade is often settled by guns.  I have yet to be shown a jurisdiction in which the clamping down on legitimate licensed firearms holders diminishes the flow of guns to criminal gangs.  That is the only point I am raising with the Minister and if he can provide evidence of such a connection or that the Bill will help to address the issue, I will accept his proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">It is important that the Minister confirms he is not alleging the existence of a gun culture in this country.  We certainly have a problem but this involves illegal guns.  That is a horse of an entirely different colour and any measures the Minister can devise to clamp down on those who possess illegal weapons will have the full support of the Labour Party.  Even his own figures are not sufficient evidence to support the contention that stolen licensed handguns are being used in the terrible crimes being committed in many parts of urban Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_615">
          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_954">I welcome the opportunity to address the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 and the provisions which the Minister and his Department are bringing before the House on an ongoing basis to deal with the cultural and historical issues in our society which affect the lives of many people.  While some in this House dispute the effectiveness of this legislation in regard to crime, there is little doubt it will impact on the culture of gun crime.  Supply is a separate issue and Deputy Rabbitte has reminded us that the procurement of short arms is part of the illicit trade in drugs.  Coming as I do from County Clare, Limerick city is in close proximity to much of my constituency.  I do not want to single out that city because other cities suffer similar problems involving violent crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">The general availability of firearms has upped the ante in the way these thugs, criminals and scumbags are treating their own lives, the lives of their families and the community at large.  It is incumbent on all of us, as legislators, to find solutions.  This is not only about banning the use of certain firearms and seizing illegally held firearms.  It is about trying to change that culture.  The legislation helps towards developing a different culture in society by demonstrating to the next generation that the use of guns will not be tolerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">I have great sympathy for many of the people to whom Deputy Rabbitte referred.  They are law abiding citizens who are involved in a sport, in which they clearly participate in a safe and practical way.  I met a number of those involved and I visited one of their firing ranges.  It operates to a high standard and they can be trusted.  The concern in some quarters is that when we become successful in removing the illegal firearms that are in circulation and become better at ensuring we prevent small arms entering the State, criminals will begin to focus on legally held firearms.  Several gun dealers have been the subject of successful break-ins and this issue needs to be examined relatively closely to ensure that, as we improve in the detection and removal of illegal firearms from society, legally held firearms are not accessible by criminals.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">It is vital that we change this culture.  Depending on where we come from or on our experience, we can all acknowledge the ravages of gun crime, which builds on the illicit trade in drugs.  There would not be the same proliferation of illegal handguns if we did not have the scourge of the illicit drugs trade.  Unfortunately, the younger generation of drug dealers and drug traffickers have little regard for life to the extent that over relatively small issues such as a debt or a perceived insult, they are prepared themselves or through their associates to dispense with human life.  It is outrageous that this has been allowed to happen and that it was not tackled much earlier through the education system so that this culture would be changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">While the legislation may not resolve any issue overnight, it will feed into the development of a culture in which society will have a much different attitude to the use of guns for sport and recreation.  In some cases, people possess weapons to reflect their desire to own and have access to a firearm, which is licensed.  We need to examine further legislation to facilitate those who are committed to sport, who are law abiding in all respects and who have ideas about safeguards, although it is not possible to do so in this Bill.  Discussion is needed with the various groups affected to examine ways in which the sport can continue and new people can enter the sport in a way that does not alter the Government's efforts to bring about a change in culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">The publicity surrounding the Bill is welcome in heightening awareness about issues relating to violent gun crime.  Anything that keeps this issue to the fore is necessary and welcome and we need to make our best effort to continue to highlight the issue in the House.  I am also cognisant that the Bill does not only deal with the prohibition and licensing of weapons but also the Schengen system of information exchange between European authorities.  While we are not as familiar with the more obvious benefits of the Schengen regime because the State and Britain opted out of the element of the agreement dealing with the common travel area, it is important that there be good co-operation between police forces, particularly in the transfer of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">It is welcome that the Government is building on that agreement through this legislation because much of our gun crime relates to the international drugs trade.  The media regularly report on leading Irish criminal actors who have found refuge in southern Europe and it is important the State continues its efforts to ensure that the correct amount of information is transferred between the various authorities and, where possible, that these individuals are pursued, regardless of where they reside in European, and the full rigours of the law are applied to them.  It makes a mockery of our judicial system and the rule of law when criminal elements can bask in the sun at the southern tip of Europe.  While I recognise there is co-operation at all levels within Europe, it is disappointing for everybody that these people can evade the law in this jurisdiction and continue to bask in the glory of their ill gotten gains while peddling their trade in a sunny climate.  It is necessary for all legislators to ensure we work towards eliminating that element of the criminal fraternity.  We must continue to build on the experience and difficulties associated with extradition and European arrest warrants.  I hope the House can ensure such grotesque displays of arrogance and evasion of the law are brought to an end as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">Like Deputy Rabbitte, I acknowledge the work of the Bills Office in preparing the supporting documentation for this legislation.  It was compiled quickly and it is extremely comprehensive.  Good information on the background to various different laws referenced in the Bill, some of which will be amended, is outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">I refer to the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau, which are not addressed directly in the legislation.  While the bureau's officials have been successful in targeting various criminal elements who have made considerable sums of money and continue to display it in a particularly arrogant way, it is important they are given whatever additional powers are needed.  The perception is that the CAB has gone away but it has been working extremely diligently and effectively.  The bureau is no longer as relevant to the media because there is only so many times a house, boat or car can be seized and it does not receive the same level of publicity it received in the early stages, but we must recognise the work done by its officials.  It is apparent to me that certain criminal elements are purchasing land in rural areas and moving out of the city to develop what would be their summer residences.  They succeed in getting planning permission and thus bring their criminal activities to rural areas.  There may be a role for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in developing some sort of scheme in our planning laws or guidelines that would — in certain circumstances, depending on the views of the local authority — require Garda clearance to allow certain individuals to proceed with the planning application.  It may be cumbersome to do so, but it is certainly worth looking at.  In many rural areas, gardaí are frustrated that some criminal elements can come to establish significant bases where it is much more difficult for law enforcers to continue surveillance and keep a general eye on them.  It is a particular problem in the county I represent because of our proximity to where a number of these gangs are based.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">I am happy to see that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Michael Finneran, is in the House, as this is something relevant on which he may want to work with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Hopefully, it would help to block at every possible opportunity the ability of these people to relocate.  They have developed their ill-gotten gains from the drugs trade, so they should be prevented in every possible respect from continuing their efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">I recognise the work of the Minister and his Department in attempting to keep to the fore these difficult issues in society, as well as developing a more favourable culture devoid of the need to have guns in circulation.  While we may never get to a point where we come to grips totally with the criminal fraternity who peddle drugs and guns, at least we could get on top of it.  Clearly, however, we have not reached that stage yet.  Last week we saw what happened in Lucan and the great work the gardaí did in that encounter.  It shows the kind of risks involved and the significant threat to gardaí who do such a wonderful job in protecting society.  Great credit is due to them.  Obviously there are people who are prepared, even when confronted by armed gardaí, to open fire rather than be subjected to the rigours of the law.  There is an ongoing battle there which we need to deal with.  The gardaí need our efforts and the assistance of this House in providing not just the necessary legislative framework but also particular legislative elements.  These will allow them to counteract this threat to the State not just for the current generation but also to develop a society that is more in tune with what we want.  It will also ensure that this element is removed for good by an emerging culture that will not tolerate what has gone on heretofore.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_616">
          <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_965">This Bill makes several amendments to the operation of the system of information exchange between European authorities, alters the law relating to European arrest warrants and makes significant changes to firearms licensing regulations.  These matters have been outlined by previous speakers also.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">It is almost inevitable that the focus of discussion will be directed towards the issue of handguns.  This is a topic that has caused widespread outrage, both from those who rightly condemn the illegal and often fatal use of such weapons and from those who view the issue from another perspective, such as sport and the perceived right to own a gun.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">Best estimates indicate that there are approximately 20 licensed firearms per 1,000 people in the Republic.  New Zealand, which has a similar population to ours, has approximately 760,000 legally held rifles and shotguns.  Approximately 4% of households in the United Kingdom possess some form of legal firearm with a national legally held armoury of long guns of approximately 4 million weapons.  Before the legislation passed in the aftermath of Dunblane in 1996, there were approximately 200,000 licensed handguns in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">We must also consider the overall picture concerning illegal weapons held in Ireland.  These are split into two categories: grey and black guns.  Grey guns are those not held in compliance with firearms regulations.  This may be due to ignorance of legal obligations or an attempt to save licensing costs.  These weapons are frequently in poor condition and are rarely used.  Some of them are antiquated and people hang them on their walls as ornaments.  A substantial armoury of bolt-action weapons dating from before the Second World War is thought to make up the bulk of these weapons.  While they are held illegally, they are not generally suitable for criminal activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">Of far more significance is the number of black firearms.  These are imported weapons expressly for use for criminal purposes.  There are no reliable estimates of the number of black firearms in Ireland, but they are known to be considerable.  The Minister has not provided any estimate of the number of such weapons held here and I do not believe he knows how many there are.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">To date, legislation on the control of firearms here has been piecemeal.  The steady rise in the licensing of weapons for personal use is indicative that immediate corrective action must be taken.  Approximately 1,800 pistol licenses were granted last year, with a worrying inconsistency in the numbers granted from district to district.  Garda superintendents have been operating in isolation without universal guidelines to direct their decisions.  This Bill will enable a more rigorous system to be put in place from August this year.  I am disappointed, however, that it took the remarks made in the High Court last July to force the Minister to carry out what he termed an urgent and intensive review of firearms legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Fine Gael has been calling for a long time for the Government to address this problem.  Over the past 20 years, our spokespersons are on record as having called for such legislation.  Across America and Europe, we have seen the horror of random shootings of innocent people — the victims of perpetrators of unsound mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">The new guidelines will allow Garda superintendents to inquire into the medical history of applicants and seek character references.  Such provisions are very important.  This, allied with certain minimum standards for the storage of firearms, will provide a framework for the safer issuing of firearms licences.  Such measures are of the utmost importance to us all.  Communities are scared of those who hold firearms and, from time to time, we hear dreadful stories after tragic events.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">Unless firearms are controlled, we could see a situation here akin to that in the United States where the right to own a gun has, in many states, outweighed the risk to life posed by an unregulated gun sector.  There may be a historic precedent in the US for such gun ownership.  However, unless we take appropriate measures here in the short-term, we could lose control of what is already, essentially, an <i>ad hoc</i> approach to gun regulation.  One of the most disturbing aspects of the Bill is the fact that the Minister is focusing to a marked degree on legally held firearms, with the result that the spotlight is being removed from the issue of illegal firearms.  The Minister does not need me to remind him that criminality and gangland crime are rampant but apparently what he does need is strong urging from this side of the House to tackle the problem head on.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">Fine Gael is the party of law and order and since the foundation of the State our policy has been to deal with criminals.  We do not want people victimised and imprisoned in their own homes as we have witnessed.  I was canvassing with people in my area last week and at 9 p.m. I had to wait almost 15 minutes for an elderly lady to take down barricades of stools and tables from the door of her house before she could open it when she heard who was there.  This is not a proper way for our elderly citizens to live.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">There seems to be a lack of consistency in the Minister's approach to this serious matter, which I want to see addressed.  The Minister promises tough measures to tackle crime but his proposal to review legislation on the licensing of guns on an annual basis does not even feature in the Bill.  A total of 12,000 new firearms licences were issued between 2007 and 2008, bringing the total number in the State to 233,000.  The previous figure of 221,000 remained static between 2004 and 2006 but with regard to the increased number issued from 2007 to 2008 there was a resultant 500% increase in the number of pistol and handgun licences issued since 2003, with an increase in the number of rifle licences of 20%.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">I would like to see the legislation containing greater provision for the use of handguns by sporting clubs.  Surely, it would have made sense for the granting of licences in such cases to be directed at sporting organisations rather than individuals.  Strict guidelines enforced on clubs for the custody of such firearms, on which continued operation of the sporting facilities would depend, would be easier to enforce than strictures on individuals.  Handgun shooting is an internationally recognised sport.  At a time when the Government is withdrawing capital funding from clubs and sporting organisations across many disciplines, it is imperative that unnecessary restrictions do not hamper Ireland's participation in world class events.  A Longford man, Derek Burnett, whom we all know very well, represented Ireland at the Beijing Olympics.  This was a source of great pride to the people of County Longford and to the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">With gangland crime spiralling out of control and rural crime rates rising, the Minister's attention needs to be focused on illegally held guns.  To date, one of his more dubious solutions to tackling gangland crime has been to rob Peter to pay Paul by taking a much needed Garda presence out of rural communities and transferring it to urban areas.  The recruitment of the promised extra gardaí would have eliminated the need for such counter-productive juggling.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">Removing a Garda presence from rural communities, such as my area of Longford-Westmeath, opens the door to urban criminals who are being given an invitation to crime as the Government exports the problem of criminal activity form cities to rural communities.  I am glad a rural Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, is sitting across from me.  He knows the effect this is having on the midlands as he is from Roscommon.  He knows first-hand the problems rural people encounter on a daily basis with regard to criminal activity and criminals coming from Dublin and attacking them in their homes and communities.  I have seen this first-hand in my area of Longford-Westmeath where local people are being threatened and terrorised by gangs driving from Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">Last week in my parish, an old age pensioner was forced to hand over €200 at knife point to a criminal.  He was terrorised and could do nothing else but hand over what he had in the house to the criminal.  This is not right in any society.  Three weeks ago, my next-door neighbour came down the stairs of her home to be confronted by criminals in the living room.  It took some persuasion to get them out of the house on that evening.  She was a very brave woman to confront them and compliments must go to her.  This is why we need a strong Garda presence in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">Fighting urban gangland crime by withdrawing an essential Garda presence in rural areas is extremely short-sighted and of deep concern to those in the midlands and the entire country.  The proposed closure of the valuable one-man Garda stations in Castletowngeoghegan, Ballinahown, Ballymore, Glasson, Multyfarnham, Rathowen and Aughnacliff in County Westmeath and many areas in County Longford, which are already under-manned, will lead to increased violence, crime and vandalism.  The biggest mistake ever made by a Government was to close the small rural Garda stations.  When I attended primary school I knew who was the garda serving my area; today nobody has a clue who serves a particular area.  The gardaí used to be in constant consultation with the community and had a great insight into what was happening in the area.  There was far less crime then than there is today.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">In a time of increasing crime, which as we all know is escalating in proportion to the recession, it is imperative that the Minister does not cut essential Garda numbers in places which already have a skeleton staff.  Centralising Garda personnel may be seen as a cost-cutting measure for a shamefully undermanned cash-strapped force to cope with gangland activities.  In some parts of the country criminals are better equipped than the Garda Síochána and I am sorry to have to say this but it is a fact.  However, the cost will be borne by counties such as Longford and Westmeath, where remote areas will see the closure of single officer stations and the increased breakdown of law and order combined with a lack of security for residents.  I pointed out a few instances of this in my patch of County Longford and it is widespread throughout our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">While the Bill will increase the penalty in the existing Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990, the law needs considerable strengthening.  In November last year, Fine Gael published the Criminal Justice (Violent Crime Prevention) Bill to clear up areas relating to sentencing, automatic remission and penalties for possession of firearms and blades.  Specific proposals on firearms included the mandatory reporting of the loss or theft of any firearm or ammunition, with penalties for failure to comply extending to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or a fine, and on conviction on indictment to imprisonment of a term not exceeding five years or a fine or both; and possession of a firearm to carry a penalty on conviction on indictment of a fine not exceeding €50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or both.  The Private Members' Bill in which these proposals were put forward by Fine Gael was rejected by the Government.  I hope it will take on board some of the proposals in our Criminal Justice (Violent Crime Prevention) Bill, which came before the House last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">While this Bill increases the penalties for knife crime, the problem is enforcement.  The number of offences of possession of a knife rose dramatically in the past five years, with a 72% increase in offences relating to the possession of offensive weapons, mainly knives.  Of these, only 32% resulted in convictions.  This is a very low conviction rate and it must be addressed.  It is another reason that additional Garda manpower is needed throughout the country and particularly in rural areas.  I understand that the number of Garda recruits in Templemore at present is smaller than it has been in two decades.  This is an indictment of a Government that promised zero tolerance when Deputy Bertie Ahern took office as Taoiseach.  Why is this?  Given the alarming escalation in the number of stabbings and associated fatalities in the UK, the Government should be putting in place every possible preventative measure to ensure that copycat crimes of this nature do not become a feature of urban youth gangs.  The appalling and senseless loss of life among young people, many still in school, that has become such a regular occurrence in the UK should shock the Government into the strongest action possible.  However, the annual conviction rate in this country has remained static at 36% to 38%.  How can this be changed?</p>
          <p eId="para_984">I do not believe the way to tackle knife crime lies in targeting the social networking websites.  My colleague, Deputy Charles Flanagan, dealt with this earlier.  Utilising sites such as Bebo and Facebook is a wasted gesture aimed at getting cheap publicity.  The Minister is fond of smiling and laughing; he appeared to be in good humour when he was in the Chamber earlier.  He should re-examine this approach.  He is also fond of the limelight and probably read the article about him in this month's issue of <i>Phoenix </i>magazine.  However, only the most naïve would believe that users of these network sites would access them to receive a message from the Government or its Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">This is a serious issue that requires serious and well formulated, decisive action — without spin.  There has been far too much spin on the part of this Government over the years, and much of it has got us into the current mess.  However, I am delighted the Minister has decided finally to outlaw samurai swords.  They are dangerous and a dreadful threat to life.  I support the Bill.  It was listed as one of the five priority Bills last summer so it is not before time that it has come before the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanKenneally" eId="spk_617">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_986">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Every effort must be made to tighten up the criminal justice system and tip the scales in favour of the law abiding citizen, who is increasingly fearful of walking down a main street in Ireland at present for fear of being caught in the crossfire between rival gangs or as an innocent bystander at the occurrence of a criminal activity.  This is an exaggeration in the case of some towns, but for many larger centres of population it is too much of a reality to ignore.  If there are ways of putting pressure on criminals, I believe we must seize them with willing hands.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">In welcoming this measure, I wish to focus on the provisions in the Bill regarding European arrest warrants and the official approval for the possession of firearms.  The introduction of European arrest warrants is a typical example of the success of the European ideal, in that it has almost eliminated the necessity for extradition treaties or proceedings between countries in Europe.  This is a much easier way of dealing with criminals, who are now more mobile than ever.  If we still had to go through complicated extradition proceedings, it is possible that some European countries could become a safe haven for criminals from other jurisdictions, including Ireland.  Anything that is done to simplify the movement of criminals between European countries which have just legal systems is to be welcomed.  Traditionally, it took up to nine months to have a person extradited from another country.  This has now been reduced to just six weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">There is also the simple yet hallowed principle that "justice delayed is justice denied".  If the accused is found innocent, the speedier the passage to that conclusion, the better.  Likewise, when dealing with a person who is eventually convicted of a crime, the sooner he or she is taken out of circulation, the better.  Extradition has always been complicated and time consuming, as well as being a slow and expensive procedure, and if the provisions of section 7 speed up and streamline the process of moving a person accused of serious crime from one European jurisdiction to another, I support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">I am glad that section 8 recognises the logic of using modern technology to transmit necessary information from one jurisdiction to another.  I applaud the Minister for trying to break through the barrier of tradition, which looks suspiciously at any attempt to modernise the system.  I am all too conscious that the justice system, with its power over liberty and legal rights, should not endanger those in any way, but it should be possible for computer and technology experts to be able to build in adequate safeguards to operate the system.  In the current climate, every effort should be made to cut costs where safely possible and without encroaching unnecessarily on people's rights and liberty.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">An important element of the procedure is that member states can no longer frustrate the extradition of their citizens to another member state.  As the European elections draw near, euro-sceptics are again raising this issue.  I wonder if Declan Ganley and Libertas fall into that category, as they take a less than enthusiastic view of the current situation.  Many provisions of this Bill are technical but they constitute a genuine and honest effort to make the system flow more freely.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">I also welcome the provision in section 10 of the power for a garda to arrest without warrant a person he believes to be part of a Schengen information system, SIS, alert.  This was provided for under the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, but is dealt with in far more detail in this Bill.  It makes adequate provision for the accused and arrested person to have their case heard with all due speed.  Section 45 authorises gardaí to photograph and fingerprint persons arrested under the original Act, to enable them to verify a person's identity.  Until now, gardaí had no power to do this.  However, we must be realistic about the nature of the time in which we live, the violent nature of criminals, even in Ireland, and the fact that cheap flights allow criminals to flit around Europe with relative ease.  I am aware that the concept of photographing and fingerprinting suspects raises the hackles of the civil rights lobby but even with the introduction of the particularly demanding US identification procedures, there has not been a rash of complaints about the system.  We must be cognisant of what is happening elsewhere in the world as well as having regard to the conditions in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">In recent days, there was further evidence of the expansion of violent crime in this country.  Last week, gardaí confronted armed raiders who were in the process of committing a crime.  A shotgun was being held to the head of a security guard and it was obvious that his life was in danger.  To think otherwise is to exclude oneself from the real world.  Luckily, gardaí were on the alert and on the scene in a very short time.  As a result of the obvious threat to the welfare if not the life of the captive, and after what appears to have been adequate and proper warning on the part of the gardaí, the raiders were fired on.  As a result, one person died and another was wounded.  The Garda Ombudsman Commission is investigating and has yet to report.  In the absence of shrill condemnation of Garda violence, we can accept that there was legitimate threat to innocent life and liberty.  I regret, as does anyone with any sensitivity and feeling, the loss of life in this case.  However, we must have regard for the particular circumstances and the type of reckless adventure in which the raiders were engaged.  I commend the gardaí involved on their vigilance and courage and hope they do not suffer any psychological problems as a result of their legitimate actions.  I reiterate that I regret the loss of life in this case.  However, we must have equal regard to the seriousness of the situation that presented to the gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">Given the widespread disregard for the rights of people to walk the streets, carry on commerce and live a normal life, such an event was waiting to happen.  I hope lessons can be learned from the incident and that those planning a similar adventure may think again.  The Garda has set down a marker in showing it is on top of the criminal threat, that its intelligence is reliable and that it can respond quickly and efficiently.  In particular, its effectiveness in bringing large numbers of serious criminals to justice in Limerick is to be commended.  However, when one gang member is taken off the streets, there is invariably another to take his place.  With the help of the provisions in the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009, I am confident the success rate in the prevention and solving of crimes will rise dramatically.  In addition, we have the Schengen information system, SIS, a provision which attempts to tip the balance back in favour of law and order and away from the criminal fraternity.  It offers a course that is very favourable to this country and which puts further pressure on those involved in criminal activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">Part 4 deals with the licensing of firearms.  I am in favour of limiting the spread of firearms where possible, without unduly impinging on the right of reasonable people to operate within the framework of legitimate hunting and gun clubs, using weapons approved by the Garda.  We have an unhappy history with firearms in this State.  Far too often, they have been used in anger against law-abiding people and members of the Garda, with serious or fatal consequences.  The greater the number of firearms, the greater the possibility of injury or death either as a consequence of an accident or through their deliberate use.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">I have no desire to be a killjoy or to take away any legitimate right to own and use a firearm, whether for the containment of vermin, for example, or for legitimate and controlled leisure activities.  In the late 1960s, all handguns and high-calibre rifles were confiscated by the State and taken into secure storage until such time as the political and security climate would allow for their general use.  That point was reached some years ago but since then, there has been a staggering proliferation in the ownership of handguns.  Some of this is accounted for by those persons whose weapons were previously confiscated returning those weapons to usage in order to resume their former pastimes.  However, from a situation in 2003 where there was only one legally held weapon of this type, the number has now mushroomed to some 1,800, according to the most recently published data.  As I said, the more guns there are in circulation, the greater the possibility of their being used illegally.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">I recently saw a report on the evening news about a man in north Leinster who entered a school armed with a knife in search of a boy with whom he had some history of conflict.  Upon his conviction, the sentencing judge commented that we are lucky in this State that we have not had a more serious incident involving guns in schools.  The judge observed that in other jurisdictions, the law has been too liberal in this regard and that we have enough problems in this State without replicating the most dangerous aspects of life in other countries by facilitating through our laws the proliferation of firearms.  The problem is that the law as it stands is open to varying interpretations and is applied with varying degrees of flexibility in different parts of the State.  For instance, Wexford is seen as a liberal county in regard to firearms licensing.  District officers in various parts of the State may have a different emphasis, resulting in disparity between regimes in these districts.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">At a recent appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts, the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Fachtna Murphy, argued that he could not offer guidelines to his superintendents in this area because individual courts were overruling the recommendations of the Garda not to provide licences for handguns.  Gardaí find themselves having to issue licences for Glock handguns, the type frequently used in murders in this State, at a time when criminals are using them to further their own ends.  This is unacceptable.  We must have definitive guidelines for the issue of firearms, particularly handguns.  As the judge remarked in the case to which I referred, we are fortunate that there has not as yet been a serious shooting incident in a school.  However, European and American norms are arriving here in every other strand of life.  I hope that in making guns so freely available, we are not facilitating another Columbine or Hungerford.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">According to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, 53,000 rifles and 77,000 shotguns are licensed in the State.  Taken in conjunction with the unusually large number of handguns, this works out at one weapon for every 17 people.  It is little wonder we are seeing an increase in murders involving firearms.  Some gun owners are far too careless with their weapons.  The Garda has warned that criminals are targeting households with gun dogs in the fairly certain knowledge that weapons are held in those homes.  We are all aware that members of legitimate gun clubs want to use their firearms for purely recreational purposes.  In principle, I have no difficulty with that.  However, with a gun comes a great responsibility.  The Garda is well placed to establish whether people are willing to discharge their responsibilities, whether they will be careful users of the weapon, protecting it and storing it properly, or whether they might have criminal intent.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">I have had representations from members of clubs who are training for the Olympic Games and are genuinely afraid that their activities will be curtailed.  I ask the Minister to take this concern into account in this legislation.  For example, I received a letter today from a person in Dublin on this matter.  The correspondent explained that he has participated in shooting sports since 1990, representing his country internationally on many occasions, most recently at the world handgun championships in Indonesia in 2008.  There are many people representing Ireland in such disciplines.  When it comes to winning gold medals in Olympic Games or other competitions, there are few disciplines where we have the opportunity to compete at the same level as athletes in other countries.  However, the various shooting disciplines offer such an opportunity.  These are sports we should encourage rather than discourage.  I am confident the legislation could be tweaked  to allow superintendents to issue licences to such persons on condition that they have adequate secure storage for the firearms and that their homes are fitted with alarms.  If such regulations were in place, any concerns in this regard would be allayed.  These people only want to use their firearms for legitimate purposes.  While I support the Bill, I am strongly of the view that there should be a concession for those who use handguns solely for the purpose of competition.  The numbers involved are small but we must not curtail their activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">I am pleased that the popular paint ball centres, stage props and starting guns will be permitted on licence from a superintendent under the imitation firearms prohibitions.  It has been suggested that legally held firearms for hunting and other recreational purposes should be stored in a Garda station and only taken out and returned at weekends.  This would not be practical due to constraints on Garda time, particularly in rural Garda stations.  I cannot envisage a procession of hunters into a Garda station on Friday evenings and again on Monday mornings to withdraw and deposit their legally held weapons.  That would expose owners to even more risk, identifying them to potential thieves as gun owners.  The new restrictions on holding firearms are sad but necessary.  After the Northern Troubles had been resolved, we believed we could resume normal life and guns could be used for sport and recreation.  The criminal threat has made this impossible.  We see the parallel between the paramilitary threat of previous decades and the present threat from criminal gangs.  Unfortunately, just as special provisions were necessary for the control of political violence in the past, so too they are required to control the current criminal threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">Section 42 amends the Criminal Justice Act 1984 to allow for staff of the Garda technical bureau to certify that material which is being referred to in court is the result of work carried out by the Garda technical bureau and is sufficient evidence of the facts stated, thereby obviating the need for Garda technical bureau staff to give oral evidence in court of such matters in every circumstance.  Will the Minister clarify whether this provision refers to evidence which, in the normal course of events, would not give rise to a requirement for cross-examination on the basis that the person who has given the evidence is making statements of fact only?  If that is the case, I fully support the provision as it will ensure that valuable Garda time is not wasted by requiring gardaí to wait for God knows how long before being able to make statements of fact in court.  In such circumstances, the time of Garda witnesses would be better utilised by deploying them on the streets fighting crime and acting as a source of comfort to citizens.  This is also true of other gardaí who spend hours hanging around courtrooms waiting to give evidence in cases involving the most minor of offences.  There must be better ways of dealing with Garda evidence in court.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position regarding section 42.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">Notwithstanding the reservations I have expressed regarding the provisions on firearms used for recreational purposes, for example, in gun clubs, I am pleased with the contents of the Bill.  I wholeheartedly support the legislation and commend the Minister on introducing it.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_618">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_1003">Ar dtús, gabhaim buíochas leis na hoifigí sa rannóg a thug comhairle dúinn ar cad atá sa Bhille atá os ár gcomhair inniu.  Déanfaidh mé ar dtús déileáil leis an chuid den Bhille a bhaineann leis an European arrest warrant, na leasuithe atá molta sa Bhille seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">Several years ago, Sinn Féin called a division when the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, which was introduced to implement an EU framework decision was rushed through the House at short notice after a mere hour of ill-informed debate, from which my party was excluded.  Criminals actively make use of borders to avoid prosecution and punishment.  While we must work together in Europe and beyond to ensure criminals are brought to justice, there is a right and a wrong way to achieve this objective.  The European arrest warrant is the latter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">During the discussion on the legislation implementing the framework decision, the Irish Human Rights Commission concluded that the framework decision was based on a flawed presumption of effective and equivalent protections of accused persons' rights between European Union member states.  It also stated that the 2003 Act was likely to diminish constitutional protections in the area of extradition.  The then Minister, in his wisdom, ignored the principal conclusions and recommendations of the commission and decided, so to speak, not to give it the time of day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Given the Irish Human Rights Commission's role in this State, specifically its function in exercising oversight of legislation that is likely to impinge on the human rights of citizens, why was the Bill before us not submitted to the commission for its observations?  While this legislation may be practical and logical in the Minister's eyes, given its implications, whether good or bad, it should be referred to the human rights commission to allow it to be examined from a different perspective and to ensure it does not further erode the human rights foundations of society.  The decision not to submit the Bill to the commission is a disgraceful example of the Minister's bad attitude to a body established under the Good Friday Agreement and charged with promoting the fundamental human rights of all in this State.  It also follows his decision to slash funding for the Irish Human Rights Commission in the 2009 budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to refer the Bill to the Irish Human Rights Commission for its consideration.  This step should have been taken when the heads of the Bill were agreed.  The commission may find that the legislation is in order, although I doubt that will be the outcome of its deliberations, especially with regard to the European arrest warrant system.  That the House is again addressing this system so soon after the enactment of the European Arrest Warrant Act was introduced suggests that either the House or the European Union did not get the legislation right in the first instance.  The Act was rushed and it has since become clear that practical matters which have made the European arrest warrant either unworkable or subject to major court challenges need to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">Sinn Féin and the Irish Human Rights Commission were not alone in voicing criticism of the European arrest warrant system.  It has also been heavily criticised by international human rights organisations, including Human Rights Watch, which specifically cited the lack of fair trial guarantees in the European arrest warrant proposal as possibly violating human rights norms.  Certain rights are unacceptably negated by the arrest warrant system and I am not convinced the safeguards introduced in the 2003 Act were adequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">My party's concerns about the European arrest warrant include: the abolition of the dual criminality requirement for a list of 32 crimes in the absence of harmonised laws relating to a number of these offences; the inclusion of the term "terrorism" on the positive list in the context of an excessively broad European Union common definition; the removal of the traditional categoric exemptions from extradition, including political offences; the limits on the so-called specialty rule; and the fact that the appeal process is unclear.  The Bill before us exacerbates these shortcomings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">My party is strongly opposed to this section of the Bill.  It is a pity that I might find myself opposing this Bill, which is three Bills in one, albeit three separate parts, at the conclusion of Second Stage because I do not believe in this section.  I will return to the section to do with firearms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">I oppose the Bill and I oppose the agenda which is akin to an EU federalist agenda.  The Government should not have backed the framework decision in the first place.  The 2003 Act was rammed through all Stages at break-neck speed and with little room for manoeuvre for this Parliament that such a significant development in our justice system should have undergone. There should have been proper scrutiny. There also should have been a proper chance to amend it to ensure that it could be implemented practically and that it could guarantee the rights of the accused persons or the rights to fair trial procedures, and guarantee that human rights would not be abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">The 2003 Act and this amending legislation is irredeemably flawed and, therefore, unsupportable.  The introduction of the EU arrest warrant moved us from a formal extradition relationship between sovereign Governments in a EU context to a new inter-court system analogous to the interaction between a federation of states.  My party believes the EU arrest warrant contributes to the development of a super-state architecture, a federal state system as opposed to the partnership approach taken up to now where countries signed up to bilateral agreements between the sovereign Governments recognising the different peculiarities on a one-by-one basis of different criminal systems that have grown up in each nation state in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">I object in principle to the federal super-state structure.  My party is not alone in that objection.  In fact, the most recent referendum would indicate that the majority of the population shares our opposition to the creation of that super-state structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">I will point out some of my concerns about particular provisions of Part 2.  Sections 11 and 13 limit the avenues for appeal and extend the duration for which a person can be detained where a surrender is not effected within the specified timeframes.  In addition, the Bill removes the existing provision for withdrawal of consent to surrender.  These all constitute regressive steps.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">A host of sections simply modernises the recognised means of inter-state communication beyond fax to include mechanisms such as e-mail.  That, in itself, is welcome.  It is a modernisation and there are many other sections of the law that should be modernised in the same way.  However, section 10 provides that an alert on the Schengen information system will be the equivalent to an EU arrest warrant.  That might be fine but, given the Schengen information system and the equivalence of the alert, it will give a garda an automatic power of arrest without warrant and then the High Court can remand the person in custody for 14 days prior to the production of the EU arrest warrant to which the alert relates, if a warrant exists at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">Given that we are recognising new technology in the first part by stating that an alert would be equivalent to an EU arrest warrant and that the inter-state communication can move beyond fax, I cannot see the circumstances arising where we would have to wait 14 days for the production of an arrest warrant, which could be e-mailed within seconds if required.  Obviously, with weekends and public holidays taken into account, and perhaps time to find a judge, there might be a need to allow for a day or two, but the Bill allows for holding somebody in custody for 14 days until the production of a warrant, which should be available in the first instances before any alert appears on the Schengen information system.  If it appears there, then it should be attached to the alert so that it can be downloaded by the Garda or an officer in another country.  This would mean that the warrant is available and can be executed, and then that the person can apply for legal aid or whatever to prevent his or her extradition or the full implementation of the arrest warrant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">The scope for error under the Schengen information system has significant implications for this.  People do not understand the seriousness of this information system.  One should not forget that the scope for error of which we speak is that somebody could be deprived of his or her liberty for up to 14 days.  When the Schengen information system was operating across just 13 countries there were 125,000 input or access points for the different security or police apparatus in those 13 states.  If, as is intended, the principle of convergence, that is, the automated access to all data stored without oversight/authorisation requirements, is extended across the 27 member states some of which are very large, and potentially across the new common security area with the United States in the future, which has also been madly proposed by some, the number of access points will be much greater.  If there were 125,000 input or access points for 13 states and this doubled that number, there would be a quarter of a million.  With a quarter of a million such points, one can see the scale and the opportunities for mistakes to be made.  We need to ensure that there are rigorous protections and mechanisms put in place to prevent mistakes, and also that the duration of time for which somebody may lose his or her liberty is reduced to ensure that people who are innocent, or whose names have been tagged unbeknownst to them for no reason at all, do not end up in front of a court or losing 14 days of their lives.  Obviously, the greater number of access points ensures that there is a greater chance that data will be lost, stolen or otherwise illegally accessed, and a greater chance that inaccurate alerts will be recorded on the system causing, under this Bill, wrongful arrest and even detention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">I will turn now to the other section of the Bill, a section which we dealt with not so long ago.  Even with our considerable scrutiny of the 2006 legislation on firearms, we still did not manage to get it right.  The previous legislation was given very little time and was rushed through, and we got it totally wrong.  On this occasion the amendments being suggested are practical ones.  They recognise some of the points raised on Committee and Report Stages and tidy up the practice that has since emerged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">The Minister opened his speech and contextualised his introduction of the firearms provisions by specifically stating that his determination is to ensure that a gun culture not be allowed to form in the State.  I welcome the Bill's firearms provisions, but it is important not to overstate their significance.  This section of the Bill is about prudent gun control, but it will regrettably not reduce gun crime.  It will not tackle the dangerous gun culture that already exists in segments of society, a sub-culture, the growth of which is evidenced by the increased access to weapons by lower level criminals and the exposure of guns to teenagers as young as 12 and 13 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">Speaking in the House last December on the fatal shooting of Aidan Kane in East Wall, I called for legislation to be introduced to tighten gun control laws.  I had just learned from a response to a parliamentary question that I had tabled that 1,200 legally held firearms had fallen into the hands of criminals in the preceding five years.  This shocking figure has no doubt grown since.  It highlighted the need for legislation to tighten up the laws regarding the licensing of firearms.  For this reason, I welcome the relevant provisions in the Bill.  At the time, I asked how many of the legally held firearms had been used in the commission of crimes, but the information was not forthcoming.  That there is no database to record each legally held weapon, ballistics reports and so on is a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">I also emphasised the need for security to be tightened up at our ports, as large numbers of firearms continue to enter the country alongside the vast quantities of illicit drugs entering the market that fuel gangland crime.  The State has just one X-ray machine to detect illegal drugs and weapons entering the State through the ports in trucks and containers.  The container scanner's location at any given time allows major drugs importers to decide on which port to use to smuggle their drugs or to at least hedge their bets and minimise the risk of seizure.  I call on the Government to ensure that all major commercial ports with high volumes of haulier traffic have a permanent X-ray container scanner in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">In my constituency in particular, a large number of weapons are in the hands of several drugs gangs, resulting in more than 13 deaths in one feud alone.  Most of that weaponry seems to have entered the State with drugs shipments.  I appeal to the Government to go beyond what is recommended in the Bill, but we will tease out some of the points on Committee Stage.  I welcome this aspect of the Bill, but I cannot support the provisions on the European arrest warrant.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_1025">I gladly support legislation that seeks to limit gun and knife crime, which can lead to appalling tragedies, sometimes with attacks on targeted victims, other times on randomly chosen ones.  While most guns used in crimes are illegally obtained, a gun should only be legally obtainable in restricted circumstances for a clear and justified purpose instead of being permitted to any citizen in good standing who would like one.  As the Minister implied, we do not want to see the "right to bear arms" culture that obtains in the United States of America, the needless opportunities created for high school shoot-outs, which have occurred in several countries but which we have so far been mercifully spared, and domestic tragedies, of which we have recently seen a few.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">I appreciate that there are legitimate sporting uses in connection with country activities.  I welcome the Minister's statement on consultation with the relevant bodies in this regard.  A ban on handguns with limited exceptions will be reintroduced, that is, the possession of a handgun in all normal circumstances will be illegal.  I note that this measure has the endorsement of the chief inspector, Ms Kathleen O'Toole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">Imitation firearms pose dangers.  Their circumstances and verisimilitudes must be circumscribed, not least in the interests of anyone who might be tempted to use one.  In certain circumstances, someone holding an imitation gun that others believe to be real might be in danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">I welcome the reduction in knife deaths from 37 in 2007 to 15 in 2008.  Three years ago, my daughter attended a going away party mainly involving employees of a well known US multinational in Dublin.  While walking home, one party-goer intervened to stop a young man beating up a young woman.  The intervention appeared to have succeeded, but the man ran into a house, fetched a knife and stabbed the mediator, who died of his wounds later that night.  I witnessed a small part of the devastating and traumatic effect this had on family and friends.  It not just destroys lives, but ruins the lives of those with whom they were close.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">As the Minister pointed out, it is impossible to ban knives, but they should not be found or carried in public places.  People high on drugs and alcohol, often aggressive, are not always fully responsible for their actions.  However, it is a basic requirement in any civilised society that people be secure and free from attack regardless of age, gender, colour or creed.  There should be no doubt about the serious consequences of causing or threatening serious bodily harm.  Carrying weapons in a public place relates to this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">It is important that intimidation and harassment, sometimes accompanied by weapons, be tackled.  Not too long ago, Tipperary town saw serious incidents, but I am glad to say that, after a certain interval, the law was applied with emphasis and will take its course.  People must never get the impression that they are immune from the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">Persons convicted under this legislation could end up in Thornton Hall.  I applaud the Department's decision to break off negotiations where it seems that the other party was looking for too much.  When I was a Senator and Mr. Michael McDowell was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I was critical of the high price being paid for farmland, even if for prison use.  I am highly critical of the excessive reverence that has grown up in society for the rights of private property where it is required for the common good.  No one should be allowed to make large fortunes in order to provide facilities.  I am half-tempted to say God be with the days of land bonds under our Constitution or at least limited existing use compensation with perhaps a small added margin.  Like the former Taoiseach, I am with the spirit of the Kenny report.  Part of the reason we have suffered from a property bubble has been too much willingness on all our parts to pay inflated compensation for the acquisition of property, creating, in some cases, large windfall profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">We need to learn lessons for the future and adopt stricter and more rigorous norms to protect tax-paying citizens.  Like the president of SIPTU, Jack O'Connor, I would like to see us move, to the extent we have adopted them, from neo-liberal values to those of a social market economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">I am glad this State is implementing more of the Schengen agreement.  I am always surprised to hear a representative of Sinn Féin utter the catch-cry of Mrs. Thatcher in her Bruges speech about the phantom federal super-state.  One would think Sinn Féin would be fairly unlikely disciples, but apparently not.  I have always regretted that all-Ireland considerations and the free travel area have forced us to opt out of being full Schengen members, although arguably we have a mini-Schengen with the UK.  I certainly favour maximum participation in Schengen to the extent compatible with that restraint.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">In the era of cheap travel and modern communications, sunshine life and apartments on the Costa Del Sol and similar places, and equally, the use of Ireland as a quiet place to shelter some of those wanted in other jurisdictions, the streamlining of the European arrest warrant is needed.  I was particularly interested in section 18 amending section 45 of the 2003 Act, with the addition of paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>).  On paragraph (<i>c</i>), the Minister’s summary states that applications for surrender will not be refused due to minor or technical defects in the European arrest warrant, subject to the saver “when it could lead to an injustice”.  It would be wonderful if such a clause could be applied <i>pari passu</i> to much of our domestic legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">How often have we seen certain District Court judges reject with unseemly glee charges, particularly those regarding motoring offences, because of some minor technical defect?  We had an extremely long-winded impeachment procedure in these Houses because a warrant was marginally out of date.  The older I get, the more impatient I become with captious judges and lawyers who string out and frustrate the course of justice and enormously increase its cost by such devices or technical objections.  If we can override technical defects in the application of the European arrest warrant, why can we not apply the same spirit here in other domestic legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">I support the Bill and congratulate the Minister on his focus on remedying defects in the law which may contribute to the scale of the senseless loss of life we suffer from.</p>

        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_622">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_1037">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this issue.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, for cutting his time short.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">The issue of gun culture is extremely important.  As the Minister of State mentioned, given our history of gun culture here, especially North of the Border, we need to make sure there are stringent controls.  For 30 years we saw what free access to guns did to our nation, especially to the six Northern counties and the Border counties.  Only the other day, the commemoration of the Dublin-Monaghan Bombing, which was part of the culture of using all sorts of tactics, was marked.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">I support sporting organisations that have a proud record and compliment them on how they run their business and insist on their laws being upheld.  They act very responsibly.  There have been some questions in recent times about why more handguns are licensed in some areas than in others.  One simply has to look at how that happens.  It happens where there are shooting ranges and sporting activities.  It does not happen for the wrong reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">I welcome the Minister's agreement that, in the main, the licences already issued will be retained, subject to the law and strict supervision.  That is only right.  However, the real problem is that we must ensure there is not a gun culture.  I was interested to see the comments of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman commissioner, who has a background in the USA and said many guns used in the commission of crime in the United States have been stolen from their rightful owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">When one understands the situation in the United States and how guns have been available there, one has to question if we are dealing with a situation which is somewhat different.  A number of handguns here have been stolen from licensed holders and those guns, by definition, are immediately in criminal hands.  I wonder if the Minister, in his conclusion, can give some idea of how many guns which have been stolen have been used, because my understanding is that it is very few.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">I have talked at length to several of the people involved in gun clubs and they are very conscious of the dangerous weapon they hold in their hands.  They assure me, in no uncertain terms, that they want to retain their rights and work strictly within the law.  There is no question about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">I welcome the fact that in his speech, the Minister emphasised that there was a great deal of consultation in recent times, at an intensive and productive level.  The firearms consultative panel was established, comprising shooting interest groups, the Garda Síochána and members of the Department, with the introduction of a firearms licensing regime, provided for under the Criminal Justice Act 2006, and has met on a regular basis in the past 18 months.  It has satisfied some of the great anxieties of gun clubs and I welcome that.  The Minister said his Department also held a firearms conference in 2008, where more than 100 delegates from shooting interest groups, Departments and the Garda were in attendance.  In February 2009, his Department, in conjunction with the Countryside Alliance, held a seminar.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">I welcome all that and encourage the Minister to work with legitimate groups to make sure their rightful activities are allowed to continue in a constructive way.  I note he mentioned in his speech those individuals going to the Special Olympics would have a possible right to get guns.  They would need to have access to training to be eligible for that sort of thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">I listened with interest to our Sinn Féin colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, advising that there needs to be curtailment of the importation of guns and drugs.  I commend the Garda and the other authorities that intercepted the massive amounts of drugs in Cork and other places.  Guns were found in some of those drugs hauls.  It is vital that we control the drug barons who are responsible for spreading drug use in towns and villages.  I question who is ultimately benefitting from some of that funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">We have had a rash of murders, especially in Limerick and in Dublin.  That shows how dangerous guns can be if they get into the wrong hands.  One cannot but recall the brilliant proposal by a predecessor of the Minister, Mr. McDowell, for a gun amnesty.  He outlined that people would have to bring in their guns and explain about them.  Such schemes do not work.  One must provide a way for people to leave guns in without drawing attention to themselves.  Otherwise, they will not get involved at all.  It is important that we get as many illegally held guns out of the system as possible, as they are the ones that will be used to cause the damage and create mayhem and murder.  They are the guns that will be used to rob banks and do damage to the future of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">One cannot help recalling some of the serious robberies or attempted robberies that took place.  I congratulate the Garda once again on its involvement.  Some incidents resulted in a sad end in that deaths occurred but at least it was not a garda who died.  That brings me to the valid point in the Minister's speech about imitation guns.  It is important that they be controlled as well as actual guns because things can happen in a split second and we cannot allow imitation guns to create a danger or to put lives at risk.  It might be amusing for a person to walk around with an imitation gun but it would not be a joke if it were mistaken for a real gun and a shot were fired in response to it that resulted in a person losing his or her life.  Imitation guns can also be used to scare elderly people in their homes.  In addition, they can be used to rob people or to cause them serious hassle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">The previous speaker, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, mentioned that he was annoyed that the land at Thornton Hall cost as much as it did.  He is not the only one who was annoyed at that.  I hope that whatever comes out of the Minister's new proposal for Thornton Hall he will be able to make a better job of it than his predecessors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">The developing knife culture is another issue of concern.  It is unfortunate that it is so widespread.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, reminded us of a case where a young lady was being beaten up and a passerby intervened.  Another individual ran into a house and took out an ordinary knife to attack that person, which resulted in a fatal injury.  As the Minister rightly said, that caused serious problems for the immediate family and those involved.  That case emphasised the fact that an ordinary knife can be a deadly weapon.  It shows how difficult it is to control knife culture.  There is a danger that young people in particular are carrying certain types of knives in their pockets.  We have seen that problem manifested recently in Kerry and other areas where people have died as a result of knife attacks.  In one case, what initially started off as a happy occasion turned into a disaster.  We must utilise whatever laws we can to curtail that type of incident.  I welcome the measures in the Bill aimed at tackling the knife culture.  I am encouraged by the fact that the Minister has included that provision in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">Fine Gael has a strong attitude to the control of illegal guns, knives and other weapons.  I have no doubt that in the main we will support the Bill.  My party spokesman may wish to amend certain sections but I hope that can be dealt with in a constructive manner on Committee Stage so that the Bill will be as foolproof as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">In the United States we have seen mass murders take place in many schools.  We have seen what can happen if a gun culture is allowed to take hold.  I welcome the Minister's initial statement that he wants to ensure that a gun culture is not allowed in this State.  That was the case in the northern part of this country for far too long and it was destructive.  As one who lived through that and had many friends involved in all the wrong ways, I wish to ensure that guns are only held by those who are entitled to have them, namely, gun clubs and licensed holders, the Garda and the Army.  That is the way it should be.  Public safety and control issues are paramount.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">The Minister indicated that the number of murders involving firearms had reduced in the past 12 months.  I find that difficult to believe but I hope it is true.  I welcome the co-operation between the authorities here and other European countries.  At a local level the Minister and I appreciate better than most the tremendous co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI in the efforts to deal with the Paul Quinn affair.  That incident shows how important it is to have co-operation.  It is equally important to have co-operation between various countries to control drugs and arms.  I welcome the provisions of the Bill that will eventually lead to a Europe-wide approach to ensuring that arms are not for the use of criminals but those who are legally entitled to use them.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_624">
          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_1054">I welcome the publication of this Private Members' Bill and I congratulate Deputy Flanagan on the work he has done on it.  It is worthy of support.  Deputy Pat Rabbitte summed up the basis of the Bill last night when he stated that this is a growth industry for the times in which we live.  People find themselves indebted for whatever reason and in some cases they are extremely vulnerable, stressed and unable to discharge debts, not because of recklessness on their part but because of the economic circumstances in which they find themselves.  Only a small number of debtors plunged themselves knowingly and recklessly into these circumstances.  In so far as recklessness is involved, it is not merely on the side of the consumer, but is frequently shared by the lender where moneys are recklessly lent in circumstances where questions might reasonably have been raised about ability to repay.  Honest, decent, law abiding citizens find themselves in these circumstances, and one has heard the case being made that they are being subjected to debt collection methods of which the House could not approve.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">It is important to speak about the culture surrounding instances where people find themselves subjected to inordinate amounts of debt.  It has been stated previously that the level of financial literacy in this country still leaves a lot to be desired.  If I look at the socio-economic group that finds itself largely at the mercy of debt collectors, I note they are invariably persons who may not have a degree of financial literacy that would pervade throughout all of the socio-economic strata.  In 1997, the OECD conducted an international audit literacy survey.  It found that 25% of Irish adults have difficulties with simple everyday numeracy and literacy tasks, such as adding up a bill, understanding a payslip or filling in a building society form.  The National Adult Literacy Association and MABS have done much work in this regard, but it is important that if this Bill is taken on board, we should look at the overall context of people getting themselves into increasing debt.  A proportion of those people will find themselves in that situation because they may not have read the fine print.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">It should be acknowledged that IFSRA has done much work in making the language of financial services much clearer for people, and the campaign for plain English has achieved much in that respect.  However, there are people who are still getting into debt, either through debt collection agencies or debt collectors, and a portion of that is due to an inability to understand the process on which they embarked in the first instance.  That must be borne in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">When it comes to the issuance of a licence for the purposes of undertaking debt collection, it is important that something is built into the legislation that protects the consumer.  The licence holder should be made take cognisance of a certain set of criteria.  Although they are not dealt with specifically within the legislation, perhaps they could be dealt with in section 5 and section 6.  Where debt is being collected, it should be collected where there is an assignment of wages.  This is referred to in the Bill.  There must be safeguards to prevent an assignment of wages from adversely affecting the debtor's ability to maintain a basic standard of living for themselves and their family.  In particular, the level of an assignment should not undermine the debtor's access to the basics such as food, clothing, housing and basic utilities, so there is a social inclusion component built into the Bill in order for people to have their basic rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">There also needs to be more regulation of the costs of debt collection in order to protect the debtor and his or her family.  There are often penalty charges for late payment built into debt, and the interest payments on that alone are significant and sometimes can be a multiple of the original debt.  That is something that should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">In welcoming the Bill, we also need to look at whether or not there is a basic EU model.  Deputy Rabbitte stated last night that there does not appear to be a regulatory framework for debt collectors across the EU.  My research tells me that there is no such framework but I am open to correction on that.  We need to have some kind of overarching regulation of debt collection, so that every citizen knows his or her rights and entitlements.  There should be an effective right of redress in the Bill for the debtor in respect of harassment, excess debt recovery costs and the wrongful removal of goods.  If a regulator is empowered to look at this issue, there should be some framework to give a right of redress to the debtor.  If we look at the nature of most unregulated debt, it is very often at the hands of moneylenders.  It remains a difficulty as to how we can regulate moneylenders who operate in the black market, but for those who are incorporated and are collecting debt, then harassment issues should allow for a certain right of redress on the part of the debtor where actions are proven to be excessive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">The defaulting consumer should have a statutory right to be advised on who is authorised to collect the debt so that there is complete transparency in the process.  It could be argued that the use of multiple debt collection agencies to collect debts simultaneously should be prohibited.  We dealt with the Fines Bill last week in the House.  We are witnessing a sea change in Government thinking, so that we are trying to keep people out of prison and facilitate them by allowing for payment of fines by instalment.  That is to be welcomed.  It could be argued that a similar type of facility should exist for people who find themselves in debt; they should not be subjected to the same offences.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1063">As we all know, the economic climate has changed radically during the past year or so, causing great difficulties for many people in meeting financial obligations.  Like other Members, I, too, have received representations from constituents seeking help and assistance in re-organising their finances.  The pressure on families who cannot meet their repayments is real and palpable and is causing great anxiety.  I believe the Bill proposed by Deputy Charles Flanagan is an attempt to relieve this anxiety and pressure.  While it is well meaning, it does not take into account legislation on this issue already on the Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">The proposal to establish a debt collection regulator is not a wise one and would require extra finance and staffing for the Financial Regulator and Garda Síochána.  According to the Bill, everyone, including debt collection agencies, garage owners, the ESB, Bord Gáis, plumbers and carpenters, would, to collect debts, have to obtain a licence, get clearance from the Garda and obtain a tax clearance certificate.  This is so over the top as to be unworkable.  In addition, Deputy Flanagan's failure to define in the Bill what constitutes "a debt collector" is sloppy drafting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">The recapitalisation scheme introduced in February 2009 includes a new code of conduct  to assuage public concern in regard to action by debt collectors on mortgage arrears.  I believe banks and building societies are dealing sympathetically with people encountering difficulties in this area.  Concern in regard to strong arm tactics and intimidation of persons owing money has been highlighted in the newspapers and elsewhere.  As I stated earlier, Deputy Flanagan's Bill is an attempt to counteract such behaviour.  However, the Deputy has failed to acknowledge that the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Persons Act 1997 deals with issues such as assault, intimidation of the demand of money with menace.  Section 11 of that Act provides that it is an offence to make demands for payment of debts under threat.  It is clear that collection of debts by threat or harassment is not legal and every person so threatened should report the matter to the Garda Síochana.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">I am interested to know if Deputy Flanagan speaks against Fine Gael policy in seeking the establishment of another quango.  Any person in debt should contact his or her relevant bank or building society and should not leave such matters on the long finger.  He or she should also contact the Money Advice and Budgetary Service, MABS, of the Department of Social and Family Affairs which has and continues to provide a crucial service for people in financial difficulty needing help and advice.  It has proved itself to be the best way of achieving a good result for debtor and creditor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">I believe the Bill is considerably lacking.  However, I thank Deputy Flanagan for bringing it before the House as it provides Members with an opportunity to set out the laws in this area and to state what agencies are available to assist people in difficulty.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnCreganFF" eId="spk_628">
          <from>Deputy John Cregan</from>
          <p eId="para_1068">I, too, congratulate Deputy Flanagan on bringing forward this Bill which deals with an issue we all have to deal with in our constituencies from time to time.  There is tremendous merit in the House discussing this issue at this point in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">As other speakers have said, many people have been significantly affected by the difficult economic situation in which we find ourselves.  People are experiencing great difficulties and the situation may worsen rather than improve in the coming months.  The adverse situation, which occurred very quickly, could not have been anticipated by people who undertook financial commitments in good faith.  To their credit, most people who enter into contractual arrangements, take out mortgages or avail of services intend to repay the debt in due course.  Unfortunately, in the current economic climate many people are unable to meet those commitments.  In this regard, the use of heavy handed tactics and intimidation is wrong.  As I stated, many people find themselves in a situation not of their own making and are at their wits end to make ends meet.  Often, at the end of the week or month they do not have the financial resources to meet the commitments which they set out from day one to meet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">It would be remiss of me not to mention that there are people who neglect their responsibility to meet commitments despite their having the financial resources to do so.  We should not forget that there are people who choose to walk away from their commitments.  Businesses that provide services and goods are entitled to have debts repaid to them as they, in turn, must pay debts.  It is important people respect this and accept the obligation on them to meet their personal commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">Much of the public concern in regard to the operation of debt collection relates to mortgage debt.  There are arrangements in place to deal with this issue.  The recapitalisation of the banks, an issue about which we have heard so much and on which we have spoken at length, includes a code of conduct for mortgage arrears, which has been issued by the Financial Regulator and came into force on 27 February 2009.  The new code applies to the recovery of debt in respect of mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State.  It is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator, including so-called sub-prime lenders.  Under the code, where a borrower is in difficulty, the lender shall make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and, consideration should be given on a case-by-case basis to alternatives such as deferral of payments, extension of the term of the mortgage, change of mortgage or capitalising arrears and interest.  Also, lenders may not commence legal action for repossession until after six months from the time arrears first arise.  I welcome the code which I hope will provide people with an opportunity to repay their debts in an easy manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">As mentioned by other speakers there are laws on the Statute Book dealing with this issue.  The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 deals with assault, intimidation and demanding money with menace.  This legislation is in place for the benefit of those who need it.  I reiterate that any person who feels threatened or harassed by another person or group of persons in the context of debt recovery should contact the Garda Síochána.  It is unlawful for any creditor to seek to recover moneys owed in such a fashion.  There are well defined procedures, judicial and non-judicial, for the recovery of debt.  I believe there exists already ample law in respect of this issue.  However, such matters must be brought to the attention of the Garda Síochána and should include evidence in support of the claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">While I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue, provided by Deputy Flanagan's introduction of this Bill, I do not believe the legislation is practical or that it would serve any great purpose.  I encourage people to use the laws already in place to deal with this issue.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_629">
          <from>Deputy Charlie O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_1074">I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Protection of Debtors) Bill 2009.  Like my colleagues, I compliment Deputy Charles Flanagan on introducing this Bill.  I regret Deputy Flanagan is not in the House as I was going to remind him of our conversation a few weeks ago, in the midst of the economic challenges, in which it was stated that what we need is a happy week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">I thank my colleagues, particularly Deputy O'Hanlon who has allowed me speak before him, for facilitating me.  I am not usually parochial, but there is a group from an Cosán in Tallaght in the Visitors Gallery.  I am anxious to spend some time with them as they go on the tour.  I will refer to Tallaght later.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">I agree with what other colleagues have said on the subject matter of the Bill.  We should recognise that we are in different times.  I am old enough to remember a Dublin of far off times when there was much talk about difficulties associated with money lending and debt collecting.  As Deputy Cregan and others have said, we still need to be very careful, given the times we are in, to recognise the difficulties people are facing.  It is not just in Dublin and certainly not just in Dublin South West.  It can be all over the country as other colleagues can confirm.  From recent media coverage we know of criminal involvement in debt collection.  The Government must keep a close eye on that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">The contributions so far have covered personal debt and the difficulties it causes for people.  I recently came across a case in my constituency of a company struggling to retain jobs and maintain its business.  It found it was owed large amounts of money by other companies, including a hotel which became insolvent.  It is important to understand the challenges associated with debt collection.  There are many different sides to that.  I am glad to see the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, covering for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Minister of State will know that I want to congratulate him on his efforts, particularly his work on the drugs programme.  I will continue to maintain contact with him in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has had a very busy day.  He has been dealing with the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  Like me he will have noted today's shocking report on child abuse in the Dublin diocese.  Like other colleagues I am upset and shocked by the report.  I know the Minister will remain focused.  As far as the business before the House tonight is concerned, the Minister will understand that from all sides of the House and certainly from the Fianna Fáil benches we want to tell him there are challenges to be faced.  There is a need for legislation and I hope the Minister will introduce it.  I also hope he will pay particular attention to co-operation with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, in respect of MABS.  In his speech the Minister of State placed particular emphasis on the need to support that money advice service.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service has offices throughout the country, including in Tallaght.  A few weeks ago, I took the opportunity to bring the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, to see the good work being carried out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">With the economy being challenged, very difficult times ahead and people losing their jobs there is a so-called new poor.  People will say the poor were always with us but there now a new poor.  As I go about my business throughout my constituency in Dublin South West, on the doorsteps in Tallaght and elsewhere people are telling me that for the first time they have to deal with these difficulties.  For the first time they are out of work.  For the first time they are facing the difficulties that fall under the remit of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">I look forward to supporting the Government's approach on the Bill.  However, the Minister should take account of the concerns being expressed on all sides.  Deputy Charles Flanagan has initiated a very important debate and I hope we would all continue to support that.  I look forward to doing that.  I hope to be back in the House at 8.30 p.m. to vote.  Meanwhile I will spend some time with my Tallaght friends and also my little granddaughter who is watching.</p>

        <speech by="#NiallBlaneyIND" eId="spk_630">
          <from>Deputy Niall Blaney</from>
          <p eId="para_1081">I add my voice to the debate here this evening on the Private Members' Bill proposed by Deputy Charles Flanagan to address the issue of debt collection and the regulation of debt collectors.  It is strange the Deputy is not in the Chamber to hear the views expressed on the Bill.  If a Minister introduced a Bill, a number of Deputies on the other side would be very quick to highlight it he or she were not present to listen to the views expressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">All of us in this House are well aware of the increasing financial strain that some people are enduring.  There is undoubtedly unanimous understanding for those that find themselves in that situation.  The current economic turbulence throughout the world has made it difficult for some businesses to survive and for some ordinary individuals to keep their heads above water financially.  This has been aggravated by the availability of credit in recent years.  Many have been living beyond their means and unfortunately, some are now experiencing an inability to meet loan repayments.  Any support that can be provided to such people is very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">I welcome the arrival of Deputy Charles Flanagan now.  I commend the huge strides that have been made in assisting people in such situations by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, which provides ongoing assistance to people who find themselves in financial difficulty and come forward seeking advice and help.  Its contribution is invaluable.  However, given that its work is limited to those who come forward to seek help, I would urge anybody in financial difficulty to come forward to be assisted by MABS.  It is foolish for any individual or business to ignore financial trouble as help is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">I welcome any proposal in this House on the matter and I commend Deputy Flanagan on his contribution.  Unfortunately, the proposed Bill is flawed to say the least.  The intended purpose of the Bill is to regulate the issuing of licenses to conduct debt collection activities.  This in effect means that those who wish to administer the collection of debt would need to register with the Financial Regulator and be vetted by the Garda Síochána in order to obtain a licence to collect debt.  They would also need to obtain a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.  The regulator would need the power to refuse, revoke or suspend licenses at any time, and would be obliged to investigate complaints made by any debtor against a licensee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">This Bill falls down in many respects.  As the Financial Regulator's remit is confined to financial services, it is not its duty to regulate debt collection.  Adding this type of responsibility to the remit of the Financial Regulator would generate all types of difficulty, not least a serious impact on its expertise and resources.  There would of course be serious financial implications in this type of activity for the Financial Regulator and the Garda Síochána.  Given the current economic circumstances, this would not be good news.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">On deeper analysis of the proposed Bill, it is difficult to ascertain if a person or company operating on their own account would be included in this proposal.  That is ludicrous.  Would every individual and business that operates a credit system need to be licensed as debt collectors?  It is obvious that inadequate thought and planning have gone into the Bill as these are very serious flaws.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">Arrangements on debt collection already exist.  The recapitalisation programme announced earlier this year includes a new code of conduct for mortgage arrears which has already come into force.  This new code ensures that financial lenders make every possible effort to facilitate those who fall into arrears with their mortgages.  It is not in the best interest of any of the parties concerned to use a heavy-handed approach and this new code ensures this does not happen.  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has indicated to the House that he intends to table a Report Stage amendment to the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006 to ensure that all repossession or sale proceedings on housing loan mortgages be taken in the Circuit Court.  This is to counteract a trend that has recently emerged whereby such proceedings are taken to the High Court, which causes undue financial and personal burden for those involved and encourages them to enter a defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">My advice to those who find themselves in uncontrollable debt is to seek the help that exists.  Businesses are finding it difficult to survive at this juncture and imposing legalities upon them regarding obtaining payment for goods and services is certainly not the solution.  There are various options available to those who find themselves in a position of having to call in debt and there is help for those who find themselves in debt.  The Bill proposes bureaucracy in what is an already difficult environment.  It does not provide any solutions to the issue of debt collection.</p>

          <p eId="para_1090">While a thorough debate is needed on these issues, the Bill before us is not the way to proceed.  It is well intentioned but would be difficult to implement in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">The Bill proposes a licensing arrangement for the recovery of consumer and commercial debt and would provide for the establishment of a debt collection regulator.  This is an attempt to establish yet another State body or quango.  I dare say if this side of the House proposed a debt collection regulator, several Members on the Opposition's front bench would be jumping up and down both in this Chamber and on television before the night was out to accuse us of establishing another quango.  That sort of inconsistency is displayed by the Deputies opposite every second week when they propose further quangos despite repeated calls for their abolition.</p>

          <p eId="para_1094">It would be a separate operation within the auspices of the Financial Regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">My main difficulty with the Bill is its failure to define "debt collector".  If it was confined to specific areas we could deal with this failure but, as has been mentioned previously, certain people with criminal connections are collecting debts.  In recent weeks I have heard a first-hand account from a person visited regarding a debt by a notorious figure with gangland connections who has been given a name associated with a species of reptile.  After being told a complicated story about property and being owed money by somebody else, the aforementioned gentleman offered to work for the debtor in collecting the next debt.  I am aware of another person who engaged that individual and found him suitable for collecting straightforward debts of a couple of thousand euro but unable to deal with more complicated matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">I recently heard reports on the radio regarding customers who had paid deposits of several thousand euro to a large furniture shop in Dublin which subsequently went into liquidation or ceased trading.  They knew this was happening and in theory they were owed money or goods.  They charged into the shop to seize the goods and loaded them into their cars and vans because they believed they would not be paid the debts they were owed.  We have all heard about cases in which subcontractors on building sites have not been paid and are owed money.  Some have had to enter the sites to seize or recover the goods they had provided.  That is a difficult area.  I am concerned that people who are abusing their positions are unlikely to come into the transparent area of registration.  The Bill could, however, create difficulties for corner shops which are owed money by local customers, not to mention Bord Gáis and other organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">This issue of banks and seizures of houses has been raised.  Thankfully that has not occurred on an extensive basis despite widespread coverage of the issue.  I am concerned about the actions of local authorities in this regard because I have found they are sometimes overly aggressive in threatening people who have fallen behind in repaying loans because of job losses.  The Government's request to financial institutions for a moratorium of 12 months where people have lost their jobs does not appear to have been heeded by local authorities.  While I welcome this debate, much more work is needed before we can pass this Bill into law.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoryOHanlon" eId="spk_635">
          <from>Deputy Rory O’Hanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1098">I join my colleagues on this side of the House in commending Deputy Charles Flanagan on the time and effort he put into preparing this Bill particularly given the fact that one does not have all the resources one would wish when in Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">Many businesses are facing problems in the context of the current world recession and individuals are finding it increasingly difficult to make mortgage repayments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">The Bill would require debt collectors to register with a new branch of the Financial Regulator.  This represents a totally new departure in the regulation of debt collection and would result in increases to the regulator's workload, staff complement and budget.  The new regulator would be obliged to investigate all complaints made to it.  The Bill would also add to the workload of the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">It has already been pointed that the Bill does not define "debtor" with the result that anybody intending to collect a debt would have to register.  This would affect Eircom, Bord Gáis, professional people, small shops and anyone else who delivers goods and services because debt collection is normal to all businesses.  The Bill could be costly even while failing to achieve its objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">Mortgages have become a major issue for many people.  The recapitalisation programme announced in February includes a code which insists that lenders make every effort to find a reasonable solution to this problem.  AIB and the Bank of Ireland have agreed that they will not attempt to seize main residences for a period of 12 months and sub-prime lenders will not do so for a period of six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">I pay tribute to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, which does not receive the recognition it deserves.  For many years it has been a tremendous source of support to people who find themselves unable to meet their commitments.  My county is particularly fortunate in having a very active MABS office with professional and dedicated staff who give tremendous support to those who find themselves in financial difficulties.  I am aware that MABS advertises widely but we should make greater efforts to ensure its free, confidential and independent services are more widely known.  It is important that people in financial difficulty seek support sooner rather than later.  MABS works closely with credit institutions and utility companies.  If more resources become available I would like to see an increase in MABS staff numbers rather then the establishment of a new body because the former's workload has increased considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">I again commend Deputy Charles Flanagan on his work in preparing this Bill.  However, while it is a worthy subject for debate it is not suitable as it currently stands.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_636">
          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1105">I wish to share time with Deputies Michael Ring, Jim O'Keeffe, John O'Mahony and Paul Connaughton.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I congratulate Deputy Charles Flanagan on introducing this important legislation.  The purpose of the Bill is to regulate debt collectors in order that there is control over them and to ensure that they are registered with the Financial Regulator and vetted by the Garda before they can operate as a debt collection agent in Ireland.  The State has no system of debt regulation unlike most EU countries and, as a result, anyone can set up a debt collection agency.  There are no rules on how they should operate.  Debts can also be sold on without the creditor's knowledge.  With more people owing more money, debt collection will become a more profitable business for some.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">Individuals should honour their debt obligations.  However, debtors and members of the public should be protected in law from debt collection methods that overstep the bounds of acceptable pressure.  Debt collection can involve the exertion of pressure on the debtor.  The media have reported on examples of the tactics employed by debt collectors to retrieve funds owing.  There is also evidence that persons with a criminal background are operating in this industry and, as a result, some debtors feel intimidated, harassed and threatened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">I refer to those with mental illness who are particularly affected by debt and who must be handled in a compassionate fashion.  There is a greater likelihood they will accrue debt than normal people.  A recent study in the UK — the money would not provided to conduct a similar study in Ireland — found that in times of recession a significant issue is the worsening of conditions for those with mental health problems.  The report showed that 50% of respondents went without food or heating at certain times of the week.  The research found that people with mental health problems are three times more likely to be in debt, as they live on low incomes and are unable to work due to difficulties obtaining a job because of the stigma surrounding their ill-health.  A total of 71% of those with mental health problems debt ran out of money every week or most weeks, 87% relied on credit to pay for food and everyday costs, 56% had gone without food due to the debt, 21% had gone without heating and 92% reported not being able to socialise because of the pressure of the debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">It is important that debt collection agency staff receive mental health awareness training.  If one does not have an organised debt collection controller, as proposed by Deputy Flanagan, it is difficult to ensure that this will happen.  Debt collectors and banks should adopt a system whereby customers can choose to have their accounts monitored for erratic spending to better protect their finances.  Irish personal debt stands at a staggering €172 billion and it is a significant burden on our mental health.  Money worries do not only keep people awake at night as they also cause high levels of stress, depression and, in some cases, lead to self-harm and suicide.  At a time people are anxious about their finances, debt depression is a real and growing concern.  People living with mental health problems are particularly vulnerable to being trapped in a cycle of debt and poverty with many unable to work due to ill-health.  People are becoming dependent on credit to pay for everyday essentials.  Those on lower incomes are more likely to obtain credit from lenders who charge astronomical interest rates.  It is a worrying trend, as people are left facing a debit mountain for which they have no means to repay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">If we are to tackle this massive inequality and help people who are struggling with mental health problems and debt, we need action from the Government, the HSE, banks, debt collection agencies and other creditors.  Changes in practice such as waiving fees when a customer has been unwell and introducing mental health awareness training for bank staff would make all the difference.  Creditors have a duty to help by not hounding their customers, especially when they are coping with serious health problems.  People with bipolar disorder, which can cause them to spend extravagantly during a manic phase, or schizophrenia are four times more likely to be in debt than the rest of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">According to the survey I mentioned, fewer than one in three with problem debt informed the organisation to which they owed money of their mental health problems because they did not think they would be understood or believed.  A total of 83% of those who informed their creditors continued to be harassed about their debt payments.  The Government must give leadership in this area to ensure resources are available to the psychiatric services to deal with this fall out from the current economic crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">The debt collection industry in Ireland comprises a small but wide spectrum of operators ranging from solicitors to known criminals.  There are no official statistics for the number of debt collection agencies in operation but, according to RTE, there are approximately 50 such agencies.  An article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> in April revealed that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1113">gardaí in the midlands gave security advice to a businessman after he complained that the criminal called to his home seeking money in a manner that made the man "ill at ease".</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1114">The criminal is regarded as a notorious gangland figure; he has dozens of convictions. The businessman owed a creditor a significant amount of money but was unable to pay it and received a visit from the notorious criminal.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1115">The debt collection business is thriving but he is by no means the only convicted criminal branching out into this area. There is evidence that, as the economic downturn continues, several criminal gangs have become involved in the industry. As many small companies fold, there is an emerging trend of frustrated creditors hiring criminals when they are unable to collect debts.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1116">Often the creditors claim they cannot afford to wait for the outcome of court proceedings as their own businesses are in jeopardy. This is most common in the construction and property sectors, which have been badly hit by the recession.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1117">Some criminals acting as debt collectors have threatened physical violence and damage to property. Eastern European gangs and Russian mafia are also suspected of getting involved in the business, particularly in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">According to Deputy Charles Flanagan, "There are disturbing reports of threats, intimidation, destruction of property and even physical assaults on people owing substantial debts".  The main function of the debt collection regulator is to issue licences to suitable applicants once they have supplied all relevant documentation, including certificate of clearance from An Garda Síochána and a tax clearance certificate by the Revenue Commissioners.  A licence will issue on a two yearly basis.  It is the right of the regulator to refuse, revoke or suspend a licence at any time.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_1119">I compliment Deputy Flanagan on introducing the Bill, which is badly needed if we believe media reports on how individuals and businesses have been targeted by people collecting debt on behalf of banks and other institutions.  The Bill is timely and the Government parties should not vote against it.  I hope they will accept it and bring forward the necessary amendments on Committee Stage.  The Bill is necessary and well thought out. People are looking for this kind of legislation.  The State must always regulate financial matters concerning debt collectors and debtors.  The law must be in place for the person to whom the money is owed, but also for the person who is in difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">Deputy Neville is correct in saying that many people are currently in a very serious economic situation.  I heard from someone recently who is under a lot of pressure because the sheriff has set a date for his home to be vacated.  However, while the sheriff, the debt collector and the bank get paid, there is no help at all for people who find themselves in such difficult situations.  They must get rid of their belongings and seek alternative accommodation if their homes are seized.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">The time has come for this kind of legislation.  In a civilised country we cannot have the Mafia, criminals and gangsters collecting money on behalf of individuals by threatening and upsetting people.  In some cases, these people may break up someone's home and threaten to injure them the next time they come.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">Deputy Neville is also correct in saying that sane people who have never been mentally ill can be very badly affected when they find themselves in this kind of difficulty.  I have seen it happen.  It affects them mentally as well as affecting their families and homes, but there is no back-up support for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">I compliment Deputy Charles Flanagan on introducing this Bill which is very necessary.  The number of people in economic difficulties will grow because of the economic crisis, but we cannot have criminals collecting money by threatening people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">I want to tell the banking institutions, local authorities and all State agencies that these are difficult times for many people.  If people find themselves in financial difficulties, rather than posting them nasty letters and threatening to send the sheriff to repossess their homes, they should sit down to work out how such matters can be resolved.  Currently, the banks are depending on taxpayers and the State to bail them out, yet at the same time the banks are putting pressure on small businesses and family homes.  Families are under severe pressure in this country at present.  There is no doubt, however, that the banks created many of the problems by giving money to those who could not repay it.  The banks did not do their work properly, yet they are now pressurising people to pay back money they should never have been given in the first place.  None the less, when the banks and other financial institutions got into difficulty we did not send in the Russian Mafia to deal with them, although perhaps we should have.  The way they behaved caused problems in this economy and law-abiding, tax-paying citizens and the State have had to bail them out.  The bankers went away with big bonuses, but poor people are being pressurised by gangsters trying to take money off them that they do not have.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">I compliment Deputy Flanagan and hope the Government will accept the Bill.  I hope the Minister will also make the necessary amendments to it.  We cannot have criminals and gangsters administering the law.  We must have law and order for everybody — the poor and weak as well as the rich.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_638">
          <from>Deputy Jim O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1126">The first question to be addressed is whether we have a debt problem in this country.  I am sure no one will deny that at this stage.  The figures speak for themselves.  The ratio of personal debt to disposable income has more than trebled over the past 12 years.  The figure was 48% of disposable net income in 1995 and is more than 170% now.   That is the issue but is the Government in denial about that problem?</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">I will cite some other figures to bring the message home.  We remember the parables from the Gospels long ago.  I am going to tell the parable of the people who are sent to jail because they cannot pay their debts.  I tabled a question some time ago to the Minister on the number of committal orders over the years, either for non-payment of debt or fines.  The Minister was only able to give me the figures from recent days, but they were startling.  In 2007, 1,335 people were committed to prison for non-payment of fines.  One may say that is an outrageous figure, although I will not go into the details.  In 2008, however, the figure increased by 50% to 2,154.  In 2007, the number of people committed to prison for non-payment of debt and committal orders was 201, and the figure rose to 276 last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">These figures highlight the fact that there is a serious problem.  I have always contended that people do not go to prison if they can afford to avoid it.  Most of the people in prison should not be there, and certainly not just because they are poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">Deputy Flanagan's Bill refers to modern collection methods that have been developed in recent times.  We have seen vultures and vipers who threaten vulnerable people, but are we going to do anything about them?  Will we really continue to allow vulnerable people to be exposed to these strong-arm tactics?  It is easy for the Minister of State to say, as he did in a recent reply, that they can go to the Garda but he is three steps removed from reality.  Does he not know that they are unable to go to the Garda because they are fearful and worried the strong-arm tactics will become worse and that they will be knee-capped?  Many of those involved in the strong-arm tactics have past experience of knee-capping methods.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">The real question is what can we do about it.  Deputy Flanagan has made an honest effort but I do not believe the Government can be proud of its reaction to that effort.  I am not saying Deputy Flanagan's Bill is 100% right.  Any Bill produced with the limited resources available to the Opposition cannot be 100% correct.  We do not have the facilities of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel or the Attorney General's office.  However, it is a decent Bill that is worthy of fair consideration, yet it has not received that from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, damned it with faint praise.  He said it was worthy of debate.  A serious reaction would have been to agree Second Stage, put it into Committee and deal with the kind of issues he dealt with in his speech, which I thought were mealy-mouthed.  His approach was nit-picking.  He said there was nothing in the criteria for specific mention of previous convictions, but the bailiff is the problem.  That is utterly ridiculous.  He talked about the cost but the measure would be self-financing because if someone was seeking a licence, the person would have to pay for it.  One could fix the licence fee to cover administrative costs.  The Minister of State also referred to significant financial and staffing resources, but that is a smokescreen for inaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">The view of the Department of Finance is so ridiculous as to hardly be worthy of mention, but I will mention it anyway.  We were told that the Minister is of the view "that the collection of debts as an activity is not necessarily comprehended in respect of the provision of financial services".  What in the name of God does that mean?  That is no way to address a serious Bill such as this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">There is a serious flaw in the system which must be addressed, but the Government is in denial about the problem.  It has not given this worthy effort a fair hearing and it deserves to be condemned for that.  Its attitude to the banking system was that everything was fine, the fundamentals were sound and the regulatory system was fine.  They were proved to be wrong and they will be proved wrong again on this matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_639">
          <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
          <p eId="para_1134">I am glad to contribute to this debate.  Like other speakers, I compliment Deputy Flanagan on bringing this Bill before the House.  I have listened to a plethora of Government Deputies, although the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran has not yet spoken.  Perhaps I am a little naive as I have been a Member of the House for only a couple of years but for the past six months I have listened to Members on the Government benches asking us whether we would like to make suggestions on the budget and on what should be done, yet many suggestions from Fine Gael and other Opposition parties have been dismissed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">The other question asked from the Government benches is what would we do.  I see the Bill as a very honest effort on behalf of Deputy Charles Flanagan; he is reacting to a situation that we all see in our offices and our constituencies where people are in debt and are being forced to pay back what they owe by an increasing criminal element, even though they have lost their jobs or their businesses have gone to the wall.  This has been well catalogued.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">It is hard to believe that in 2009 this is the reaction we are getting from the Government.  Perhaps in some ways it reflects what it has done and how it has run the country.  In 2009, it is unbelievable to think there are no structures in place to regulate debt collectors at a time when personal debt of disposal income has more than trebled in the past number of years.  It is also unbelievable that the Government has never introduced some form of regulation or has no plans to do so at a time when we hear horror stories of criminal elements taking the law into their own hands and intimidating, threatening, harassing and beating up people who are in arrears with their payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">Everyone has obligations.  Nobody is suggesting that debts do not have to be repaid.  However, that can be done in a way in which everyone has their rights upheld and no one is allowed to take the law into their own hands.  The timing of the Bill could not be more appropriate, with thousands of families driven to desperate methods to obtain loans from moneylenders who charge exorbitant rates of interest and then come down heavy if the loans are not repaid.  The problem has multiplied in the past 12 to 18 months with the downturn in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">Businesses are going to the wall and people are losing their jobs and in many respects everyone is a victim.  We have all heard stories of properties being vandalised and destroyed, people being terrorised in the middle of the night and acid being thrown on cars parked outside houses.  In a society where respect for human life is decreasing all the time somebody must prevent the rules of the gangland taking over.  It is well documented that the criminal element is infiltrating this business.  Regulation protects the law-abiding people working in this industry.  Many people in the debt collection business are law abiding, they are above board and they provide a reputable service that is in demand in modern society.  They have nothing to worry about from this Bill because they tick all the right boxes.  The Bill gets the balance right between exerting pressure on people to repay their debts and not resorting to heavy-handed and illegal methods, which in certain instances can cause unbelievable stress on individuals and families where suicide is contemplated.  We have unfortunately seen this in recent high-profile cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">I want to refer to an area that is technically outside the remit of the Bill, which is that debtors are committed to prison for non-payment of debts or fines.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe also spoke about this matter and I do not need to repeat the many figures he provided.  These people are kept in prison for an average of 20 days but on release the debt remains.  All that is achieved is the cost to the Stage, averaged at approximately €2,000 per week, without solving the problem of the unpaid debts and adding to the scandal of our already overcrowded prisons, a matter brought into sharp focus yesterday with the news that the new prison complex at Thornton Hall has been put on hold despite the millions of euro of taxpayers money already spent on the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">What is needed is an overall and comprehensive package of measures to help all sides in this very important issue, namely, those in debt, those owed the money and those charged with collecting the debt.  The Bill is an important plank in this package and I commend it to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnCurranFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_640">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy John Curran)</from>
          <p eId="para_1141">I will respond on behalf of the Government to Deputy Charles Flanagan's proposed Private Members' Bill.  I will begin by responding to one point raised by Deputy O'Mahony, where he made reference to those in prison for the non-payment of fines.  This issue is being dealt with specifically in the Fines Bill.  It is an appropriate point to make and Deputy O'Mahony was correct to do so but I wish to point out that it is being dealt with as it would be remiss not to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">Deputy Charles Flanagan's proposal has been commended by the Government for the humane concerns that clearly lie behind it.  I commend the Deputy for the efforts involved in bringing forward the proposal and the objectives are understandable.  However, it was pointed out that the legislation as drafted is flawed.  Last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, pointed out some of these flaws.  There is no definition of debt collector; there are no criteria specified in regard to deciding who might be a fit and proper person and there is no provision in regard to any business collecting its own debts to its own account.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">If Deputy Charles Flanagan's proposal was enacted, this last consideration would mean that every business person, company and partnership would first have to be registered as a licensed debt collector to continue its normal business.  This would be a near impossible bureaucratic task but it is what is proposed in the Bill.  This is a particularly serious flaw in the approach set out by Deputy Flanagan.  It would seem to require every person and company involved in a business activity, be it the sale of goods or services, to have to seek licensing as a debt collector before it could seek to recover moneys owing to it in the normal course of business.  This would apply from the biggest company to the smallest shop or self-employed tradesperson.  Is this seriously what the Deputy has in mind because it would appear to be the main consequence of this proposal?  It would appear to be a somewhat bizarre, cumbersome and bureaucratic approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">Related to this point is the fact that the draft Bill does not define a debt collector.  This deficiency was also commented on by Deputy Rabbitte last night.  Effectively, it makes the intended scope of the Bill unlimited, which clearly would not be desirable.  Deputy Flanagan's proposal would require significant financial and staffing resources for the Financial Regulator and for the Garda Síochána in terms of potential vetting of applicants.  Last night, my colleague stated that in the context of scarce resources available to the Government at this time this would not represent the best use of such resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">During this debate Deputy Charles Flanagan made some very serious accusations concerning criminal activity in debt collection and the private security industry.  The Government does not protect criminals, rather it pursues them relentlessly within the law.  The Government attaches the highest priority to tackling organised crime and bringing those involved in such activities to justice.  In this regard, among the main priorities set out by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the Garda Síochána in 2009 are to target gun crime, organised crime and drug related crime through a range of measures including the use of the Garda specialist units and targeted operations such as Operation Anvil.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">Deputy Flanagan made more wild accusations concerning the activities of the Private Security Authority and I welcome the opportunity to set out some details of the work of that authority.  The authority has licensed 850 contractors and more than 22,600 individuals to operate in the security industry in Ireland.  Prior to any licence being issued by the authority, the applicant is vetted by the Garda Síochána.  The authority is in contact with the central vetting unit on a daily basis and an excellent working relationship exists between both bodies.  The vetting of applicants is an integral part of the licensing system provided for in the Private Security Services Act 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">In the case of those applicants who have resided outside of the State for a period of six months or more, a criminal record certificate from the foreign jurisdiction is required.  Once again, it is a condition of licensing that this requirement is fulfilled prior to a licence being issued.  The authority does not and never has issued licences based solely on a foreign criminal record certificate.  The authority also has in place robust procedures for dealing with domestic and foreign criminal record checks.  These procedures include the assessment of the information received against the authority's guidelines on criminality, with applications being refused where convictions are deemed relevant in accordance with the guidelines.  The criminal record checking and criminality guidelines are continually monitored and validated to ensure these systems operate as effectively as possible.  In addition to the criminal record checks, all applicants for a licence must provide evidence of having attained the relevant standard or qualification.  In the case of contractors, they are required to comply with a National Standards Authority of Ireland approved standard.  Applicants seeking an individual licence are required to obtain a FETAC recognised qualification.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">The licensing regime is also supported by a resolute enforcement strategy undertaken by the authority's dedicated enforcement team.  To date, the authority has brought successful criminal prosecutions against 21 unlicensed operators, while over 600 consumers of security services have terminated contracts with unlicensed providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">The establishment of the authority has brought about a fundamental transformation of the security industry in the State.  We have observed the removal of unscrupulous security providers and the restoration of public confidence in the industry as a result of the authority's endeavours.  The introduction of a standards and training based licensing system has had many positive benefits for the industry, the wider business community and the public.  The licensing of the security industry is a significant body of work which is delivering a professional security service.  I am assured that the authority's licensing process is robust and the public can be assured that only those who meet the authority's criminality guidelines are licensed.  The improvements in the industry brought about by the establishment of the authority should be supported and commended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">With this proposal which is poorly drafted Fine Gael is seeking to create a regulatory structure which, if one interprets the draft text of the Bill, would require the licensing of every business in the country as a debt collector.  Each person or company would have to be vetted by the Garda Síochána and satisfy a quite vague fit and proper test.  Deputy Flanagan has not enlightened us on how this objective can be achieved, given its vast scope.  That is what the text of the Bill involves.  This is, unfortunately, an underdeveloped proposal.  Deputy Morgan was of a similar view last night.  He suggested focusing on other legislative proposals which deserve greater priority at this time.  He rather sensibly suggested this was an area which the select committee on finance might consider to examine the options that might be available.  These options might be effective and low cost, and not require legislative intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">Debt collection agencies seek to recover debts arising from a wide range of activities, including borrowings, utilities and so forth.  Lenders that are regulated by the Financial Regulator sometimes outsource debt collection.  In such cases, the Financial Regulator's consumer protection code requires that the regulated firm must ensure persons contracted to carry out an outsourced activity which would include debt collection comply with the requirements of the code.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">There is also some confusion concerning the offences in the Bill proposed by Deputy Flanagan.  The proposal seems to take no account of existing provisions of the criminal law in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  There is no evidence that this legislation which applies to demanding money with menaces or false representation is inadequate for its intended purpose.  No reason has been advanced as to why we should introduce special legislation specific to this area of activity.  I heard Deputy Flanagan's speech last night.  Although I support the principle of what he is trying to do, the motivation and catalyst for his proposal are a particular operation on which he elaborated and a particular debt collector.  The legislation to which I have referred should be used if that person is collecting money with menaces.  That is the appropriate approach.  It is unfair not to indicate to the House that legislation in that regard is in place and should be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">To conclude, I am not sure how effectively we can regulate what might be alleged criminal behaviour with regard to debt collection.  I appreciate the sentiments behind the Deputy's proposal but do not believe it is the correct one.</p>

          <p eId="para_1156">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  All Members have received reports of people having been intimidated by well known criminals.  There are also reports of threatening behaviour, property being vandalised and even assaults.  It is not just the individuals involved who bear the brunt of this force and thuggery.  Their neighbours also live in fear lest the wrong address is given and the perpetrators end up vandalising an adjoining property or assaulting a neighbour.  It is a very worrying aspect of the new debt collection industry.  There is an increasing number of reports that criminals, as well as the eastern European mafia, are getting involved in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">There is a need for urgent action to protect vulnerable debtors from threatening behaviour and worse by some debt collectors, first,  by vetting prospective debt collectors, licensing them and their operations and providing for a complaint mechanism for debtors and, second, by identifying those entering the country who are planning to sell their skills in threatening behaviour, vandalism and assault.  A Europol report last year described Ireland as a highly attractive destination country for criminal gangs involved in crime and the smuggling of immigrants.  It highlighted the urgent need for proper border control systems and co-ordination between the Garda Síochána and its colleague forces throughout the European Union.  There must also be co-ordination in this country between the various Departments involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">While the right of EU citizens to travel within the Union must be protected, we must also stamp out cross-border crime.  This must involve stronger co-operation and the sharing of information between EU police forces through Europol and within the country among the agencies of the State.  There is no central EU database for criminal convictions.  We believe all member states should maintain a national DNA database and share the information with other member states.  However, the Government has failed to establish such a database.  Once operational, it could prove a key factor in improving conviction rates for serious crime.  The sharing of such information must become commonplace to improve border controls.  A criminal database must be accessible across jurisdictions to ensure all information is available for the policing of borders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">It is also important to have an integrated border management system which includes both the Garda Síochána and the social welfare system.  They must be given adequate resources to screen people coming into the country and record those who are leaving.  There is an urgent need for greater co-operation between the various agencies of the State.  Our ports, for example, are also seen as a soft touch with regard to immigration checks and Garda screening.  There have been numerous reports of individuals coming to our ports because our immigration checks there are scant.  People with serious convictions in other parts of Europe are using them as a way to enter the country.  Many officials working in this area and in the area of the trafficking of human beings say our ports, including the port of Larne and, as a result, the border with Northern Ireland are seen as soft options for entering this jurisdiction or moving on to the United Kingdom.  It is vital to have co-ordination between the agencies in this jurisdiction and across Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160">The Department of Social and Family Affairs which is involved in meeting people when they arrive in the country must have a more proactive approach in conjunction with the Garda on the information collated for issuing PPS numbers.  Under the current system, it is relatively easy for migrants who are sought in other countries on criminal charges to obtain a PPS number from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The required technology and training must be put in place to ensure PPS numbers are denied to persons using false documentation or those who are being sought for serious criminal offences in other countries.  Surely there can be greater co-ordination, whereby if the Garda does not identify a person at our ports or airports or if a person comes across our unpoliced border with Northern Ireland, the social welfare system could be used as a safety net to identify these individuals and ensure they are brought to the attention of the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">The social welfare system, even with the limited technology currently available to it, has identified people using false documentation to obtain a PPS number.  Citizens of the State or persons from outside the State who use false documentation to obtain a PPS number are doing so to exploit some part of the system.  It is not in our interests that such activity should continue.  It is a weakness within the current system.  The Bill proposed by Deputy Charles Flanagan would act as a safety net in regard to this particular industry through the licensing of people who are working or seek to work within the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">It is important that we get our act together at European level regarding the co-ordination and sharing of information, but it is also imperative that we get our act together in this State.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has spoken about the introduction of an Irish border information system.  This proposal is long on promises and short on delivery.  There is a major problem in regard to communication between the Garda and the criminal justice system, on the one hand, and the Minister on the other in identifying individuals who are citizens of the European Union and who potentially represent a threat to public policy or public security in this jurisdiction.  There must be a formal mechanism of exchange between the Garda and the Department on the criminal activity of such individuals.  The courts must be empowered to refer specific cases to the Department where the judge, in the process of sentencing, has identified an individual who should be brought to the attention of the Minister.  Discretion must ultimately rest with the latter as to how such information should be acted upon.  These matters must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">That type of information co-ordination and communication is not currently being provided.  Different arms of the State are collecting information but not communicating that information to each other.  As a result, there is no identification of individuals, whether citizens of this State, citizens of the European Union or otherwise, who should be brought to the attention of the Minister and potentially removed from the State.  There is no formal system whereby the Garda or border control officials convey information on Irish citizens to the Department of Social and Family Affairs where such information should rightly be brought to its attention.  That type of information sharing is not happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">This legislation provides an additional safety net in identifying those persons who are slipping with ease through our current border check system.  As a positive step forward, I am disappointed that the Government proposes to reject it.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_644">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_1165">I thank Members on all sides of the House who spoke on this Bill.  In particular, I acknowledge the support of the Labour Party.  I regret that while all Government speakers acknowledged and commended the merit and principle of the Bill, none indicated a willingness to go so far as to allow it a Second Reading.  This is a consequence of the Whip system that obtains in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">I have received a large volume of correspondence and telephone calls on this matter and have interviewed people at my constituency office in recent months.  Since the publication of the legislation, I have been inundated with information from people throughout the State.  One e-mail I received in recent days from an individual suffering from the activities of debt collectors is particularly relevant:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1167">I am writing to you nearing my wits end.  I am involved in the construction industry and ran a successful business until six months ago.  I provided substantial employment, paid all my bills and taxes and worked very hard to achieve my simple goals.  I never made a fortune in development, far from it.  The truth is I got into the business too late in that the money had been made a few years before.  Not alone am I at risk of losing my home, my reputation and all I have worked for — and I mean worked, most of the time doing 18 to 20-hour days, seven days a week — but now I am faced with a different problem, a far greater one, that is, debt collectors.  I would like to ask how these people can operate a legitimate business.  They terrorise people with their calling to your door with hired thugs, calling to your place of work, calling to your family.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1168">I recognise that I owe money.  As you can understand, I cannot find work and a lot of money is owed to me.  But I am going about it the right way by going though the courts.  All I want to say is that the issue of criminals running debt collection businesses must be raised at the highest level before it is too late, not just for me but for others in my situation.  I like to think of myself as a businessman, a hard working one at that, providing for myself and my family and providing revenue for this State.  What have these criminal heavies ever done except the obvious?  I am just a hard-working man trying to make a living and I need redress under the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">There has been criticism of this legislation from Members on the other side of the House in their claim that it will install a new burden in terms of an additional regulatory mechanism or quango.  That is not the case.  What I have proposed is deliberately designed to be part of the existing State agency structure.  There have been claims that this new regulatory framework will cost millions of euro, involve thousands of personnel and impinge on the work of the Garda Síochána.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The proposed mechanism would be self-financing.  Every person who successfully applies for a licence would be obliged to pay a licence fee, along the lines referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, in reference to the Private Security Authority.  I can only conclude that the only reason the Government proposes to deny the Bill a Second Reading and a subsequent line-by-line scrutiny in committee arises from narrow party political concerns.  That is greatly regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">Why are we out of step as far as a regulatory framework is concerned?  There are European Union-wide regulations in operation in all other member states.  The Bill has received the support of bodies engaged at the coalface with those who are suffering as a result of straitened financial circumstances.  It has received the support of the free legal advice centres and the Combat Poverty Agency.  The Irish Institute of Credit Management has said it would be satisfied to have its members regulated in order to distinguish legitimate collection agents from the "less salubrious" practices of others.  Moneylenders, mortgage managers, credit investment and insurance intermediaries, bank finance houses and credit unions are all regulated, most of them by the Financial Regulator.  There is every reason that those engaged in the debt collection business, who are acting on behalf of these institutions or have purchased debts from them, should be regulated.  The failure to do so has given rise to the serious difficulties of which we are aware throughout the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">I accept this legislation may not be perfect.  I acknowledge that we on this side of the House do not have the advice of the Office of the Attorney General and a plethora of parliamentary draftsmen who can spend months — or years, in some cases — working through the legislative process.  That is no reason to deny the Bill a Second Reading.  If the Bill were to reach Committee Stage, we could draw on the wisdom not only of Members on this side of the House, but also on that of the Government and its advisers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">If the Government proceeds to throw out this legislation, we will have a situation where there are no rules, no regulation, no standards, no licensing system and no control in this area.  That is an invitation to criminal heavies to continue their business in debt collection and to put further pressure on hard-pressed individuals and families.  This is a lost opportunity.  I am certain the House will have no choice but to revisit this issue at a future date.  It is regrettable that narrow party political interests on the part of Fianna Fáil have hindered this legislation.  There is little point in mentioning the Green Party as it has had no involvement in this Bill, no more than it seems to have any involvement in the workings of this House on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">This was a bad day's work.  The Bill presented the House with an opportunity to address this issue, which I have no doubt we will have to deal with in future.  We cannot allow the situation which obtains to continue.  We do not have a system of regulations or licensing and we cannot have a free-for-all.  Evidence is emerging from across the country that people are being harassed and intimidated by shadowy heavies engaged in the debt collection business who are able to do so with impunity owing to a lack of regulation.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
            <p eId="para_1303">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise an important issue for the constituency of Wexford, that is, the future of accident and emergency services at Wexford General Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">I do not often seek to raise matters on the Adjournment.  I do it only when matters are of critical importance to my constituency.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, but I regret that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is not here to answer a simple and straightforward question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">First, let me give some background to Wexford General Hospital.  Wexford General Hospital is one of the busiest hospitals in the country.  It has a broad range of specialties, including one of the busiest maternity units in the country.  It caters for a population in County Wexford of 140,000 permanent residents and perhaps double that number during the summer months.  It is an unusual hospital in that its peak activity is in the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306">It is the only acute accident and emergency 24-hour service geographically between Loughlinstown in south County Dublin near Bray and Waterford General Hospital.  That swathe of population between south Dublin and Waterford, the populous counties of Wicklow and Wexford, are serviced by Wexford General Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">I have repeatedly asked about the future of the accident and emergency services in Wexford General Hospital because I have been informed directly by the staff involved that preparations are far advanced for the termination of the 24-hour accident and emergency service by the end of this year.  Nurses have been told not to look for night time rostering at the end of this year and emergency ambulance personnel are being added to and upskilled to provide a different type of service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">When I have asked the HSE directly — I am fearful that the Minister of State has been provided with the same script to deliver to this House tonight — it states that there are no plans yet agreed or drawn up on any service or hospital in the south east.  I simply do not believe that because the facts on the ground are quite different.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">The people of Wexford deserve to know whether plans are being put in train by this expert group that is looking at the realignment of services across the south east, and whether a decision has already been made to end the permanent 24-hour accident and emergency cover operated by Wexford General Hospital.  If that is happening, it is the beginning of the end of the full facilities to be provided by this essential and critical hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">I want a clear and unambiguous answer from the Minister tonight.  The HSE, overblown and all as it is, is still subject to the Department of Health and Children and policy is ultimately determined by the Minister.  The simple question to which I want an answer tonight is this.  What is the future for 24-hour, 365-day accident and emergency cover in Wexford General Hospital?  Please, do not give me obscurantist answers about surveys, analyses, committees or commissions.  What is happening and what is the Department of Health and Children's policy?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children (Deputy Áine Brady)</from>
            <p eId="para_1311">I thank Deputy Howlin and I will be taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">Wexford General Hospital provides comprehensive acute services to the local population of 130,000 and to the thousands of tourists who visit Wexford each year.  The hospital benefits from a committed workforce that, during 2009, will treat an estimated 63,900 patients.  More than half of these will present as emergency department attendances.  In addition, an estimated 56,730 will attend the hospital on an outpatient basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">Wexford General Hospital has strong partnerships with colleagues working in primary, community and continuing care sectors and aims to provide patients with fully integrated services.  In line with the National Service Plan 2009 and in accordance with the HSE transformation programme, the HSE will be reviewing the current configuration of acute hospital services in the south east.  A steering group has been put in place to this end and is tasked with developing a plan for hospital reconfiguration that will deliver optimal, cost effective, easily and readily accessible and high quality services through centres of excellence.  The membership of the steering group comprises the four clinical directors, one from each hospital, and the hospital network manager.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">All hospitals in the south eastern hospital group, consisting of Wexford General Hospital, Waterford Regional Hospital, South Tipperary General Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, will be included in the plan for the revised model of care.  In this regard, no decisions regarding the roles of services in any hospitals will be taken until this plan has been completed through a process of broad based consultation within the services.</p>

            <p eId="para_1318">We have had reports from Horwath, Wrixon, Teamwork and Professor John Higgins and today's <i>Irish Examiner</i> claims that all acute services other than those provided at Cork University Hospital, CUH, will be done away with.  Subsequently, a HSE press release stated that Kerry General Hospital will be excluded from the process.  What will be the position of acute services in hospitals other than Kerry General Hospital and CUH from 9 June?</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">The people of the region have been through the mill, given the obfuscation on simple questions on the future locations of acute services for the countless thousands served by hospitals in, for example, Mallow, Bantry and Cork.  We want a little bit of decency and for people to tell us their intentions with regard to acute services.  Mallow General Hospital is efficient and at the top of its league in terms of cleanliness and the other HIQA statistics.  It needs its acute services, given its catchment area of more than 150,000 people.</p>

            <from>Deputy Bernard Allen</from>
            <p eId="para_1320">I congratulate the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on publishing the details of a report that effectively downgrades all of our acute hospitals and enhances the role of CUH.  The report, prepared by faceless consultants of whose credentials I am not aware, raises many challenges to the future viability of a number of Cork hospitals, including three in Cork city, namely, Mercy University Hospital, South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital and St. Mary’s Orthopaedic Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321">I have managed to get a copy of the report, which starts by stating that it, as an independent report, identifies the optimum configuration of hospital-based services.  Has this report cost as much as others?  The McKinsey report cost €1 million and one consultant charged €10,000 per day to prepare it.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I looked for a copy of it recently, but I have not received it yet.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">In response to questions put to Professor Brendan Drumm at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, he said: "The truth is that one could write an awful lot of them oneself" — by which he meant reports.  He went on to say: "They are not rocket science but the problem is that it is hard to get buy-in to the proposed change unless there is independent validation of it."  Basically, he said that he was prepared to give a significant amount of taxpayers' money to external private consultants to produce reports that recommended what he wanted.  He then claimed that they were independent and that he was required to implement them without any real internal or public debate, no matter how good or bad the recommendations.  Is this a failure of leadership or Machiavelli at his most devious?</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">I question the ability of some of the consultants in question.  Those who penned their names to the most recent report under discussion are Horwath Consulting Ireland Limited of Clanwilliam Court, Dublin 2, and its partner, Teamwork Management Services Limited from the top floor of some office block in Bolton.  I have served the people of Cork city for almost 30 years in the House and I can table proposals that will protect the best interests of the members of the public who I represent instead of the vested interests that are trying to change the face of acute hospital services in the southern region and to override the public's needs and wishes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1324">I assure the Acting Chairman and the Minister of State that these proposals to downgrade hospitals that have served generations will be fought tooth and nail.  Will the Minister of State assure the House that the Government and its Deputies who represent Cork will not stand over these types of proposal to victimise the members of the public who are dependent on these hospitals, which have given so much service?</p>

          <speech by="#AineBrady" eId="spk_651" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Áine Brady</from>
            <p eId="para_1325">I will reply to this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">The HSE southern area commissioned Horwath Consulting Ireland Limited and Teamwork Management Services Limited to review the current configuration of acute hospital services in the region, which encompasses counties Cork and Kerry.  The HSE southern area is considering the outcome of this review and the recommendations made with the objective of securing clinically safe and sustainable acute hospital services for the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">It is important to emphasise that the Teamwork report represents an input into decisions about the future service arrangements and it will not be the only means by which decisions about reorganisation are informed.  Patient safety considerations will be paramount in determining the future configuration of services, especially where complex care is concerned.  It is widely recognised that treating a low volume of cases in higher volume specialties is not conducive to optimal patient care.  To ensure the best possible outcomes for patients, clinicians must be able to maintain their specialist skills by treating a sufficient number of cases.  It is more difficult for specialists to maintain their skills in smaller hospitals when treating a low volume of patients.  This has implications for how we organise acute services generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">It is important to note that the total spend on health care in counties Cork and Kerry is approximately €1.4 billion.  The HSE is conscious of the need to ensure that these resources are spent in the most effective and efficient way.  In addition to the need to ensure patient safety, the need to ensure efficiency will also inform the reconfiguration exercise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329">John Higgins, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at University College Cork, has been appointed by the HSE as director of the reconfiguration of acute services in the Cork and Kerry region.  Professor Higgins has commenced a comprehensive consultation plan with the counties' people.  This process involves face-to-face meetings in various locations across both counties, with hospital staff and management, clinicians, patient groups, hospital representative and fundraiser groups and public representatives.  A particular focus of the consultation process has been engagement with general practitioners across the Cork and Kerry region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">Following the consultation process, the HSE expects to be in a position by mid-June to indicate the general terms of its proposals for the future configuration of the services in the region, with the objective of putting in place a single health care system for counties Cork and Kerry and the development of a new governance structure for the hospitals and community services.  The consultants' report will be published at the same time.  The HSE will then commence a detailed planning process leading to the implementation phase beginning in the autumn of this year.  It has emphasised that no hospital will close, but that every hospital must fundamentally change how and what services it delivers.  The precise details of the changes to existing arrangements and the timetable for these will be developed in consultation with all the relevant interests in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">Cork and Kerry present specific demographic and geographic challenges in delivering safe health care.  However, the HSE has clearly indicated with regard to Kerry General Hospital that the key current acute services, including accident and emergency, obstetrics, intensive care, acute surgery and acute medicine, will be maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery of the best quality health services possible, in the safest, most efficient and effective way.  The reconfiguration of the acute hospital services in the HSE south region which is being planned at present will be progressed in accordance with these principles.</p>

            <p eId="para_1335">We were told it was 9 June.  The Minister of State's reply states it is mid June.  I would like to seek a clarification on that.</p>

          <speech by="#LucindaCreighton" eId="spk_655">
            <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</from>
            <p eId="para_1336">I listened with interest to the previous comments, which I assume are those of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, regarding the Government being committed to ensuring the best quality health services possible are delivered in the most efficient and effective way possible.  I find it quite extraordinary, in the context of those comments, that it is proposed to scrap proposals to redevelop the old Meath Hospital, which would have made provision for adequate and suitable primary care facilities for the Dublin 8 and Dublin 2 areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">I find it extraordinary because, as I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, and I know, the future of health services in this country is through primary care.  We have an acute system which is creaking.  Every political party agrees with the paramount need for the delivery of primary care services.  We have been promised this since well before 2002.  In fact, this was one of the key promises of Fianna Fáil in the run-up to the 2002 general election and many votes were garnered in the Dublin 8 area on foot of such promises.  The same promises were made in 2007 and, yet again, are not being delivered on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1338">There is now an official decision from the HSE not to deliver on the funding that was committed, earmarked and ring-fenced specifically for the Meath Hospital.  To give a picture of the current level of primary care, to say it is inadequate would be an understatement.  There are two small teams providing primary care services in the south inner city area, comprising a community nursing unit with 54 beds, which is inadequate, and the Irish Wheelchair Association, which also operates from the Meath Hospital.  There is also a social inclusion service.  It is a very modest level of primary care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1339">What has been promised, and what the funding was earmarked for, were an additional 100 beds for a community nursing unit on the site of the Meath Hospital, at a cost of €20 million, a new mental health day care facility, which would have made a tremendous difference to the people in the area who are crying out for any form of mental health services, new disability services, in particular respite apartments for family care, which would be very far-reaching but, unfortunately, will not be delivered, and a new primary care network with a new primary care team and a purpose-built facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1340">In addition, there was a commitment for 50 units of sheltered housing on the site, which would have had a tremendous impact on the local community but this has also now been scrapped by Dublin City Council.  There is a requirement for €40 million.  As I said, €30 million was earmarked by the HSE, but a number of local Deputies and councillors were called to a meeting recently and told it would not be available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">This issue is very important for this area, for a number of reasons.  Day care services in this area would have allowed local residents to get treatment locally, without having to travel and, very importantly, without clogging up major hospitals, such as St. James's Hospital, which are already under tremendous pressure.  We know the difficulties that exist with acute beds in such hospitals.  They are being occupied by people who do not require acute treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1342">This development would certainly have eased the pressure in the south east inner city area.  A community nursing unit would have taken a significant amount of pressure off acute beds in hospitals such as St. James's Hospital.  Sheltered housing would have allowed elderly people in the area to remain in their community when they have reached a stage in their lives when they deserve to be in care near their families, with the support of their families around them.  It would have allowed people to get treatment locally and would have been an important signal to the people of the inner city that they are not being forgotten or neglected and are not bottom of the list of priorities, which is how they often feel.  It is myopic to sacrifice this type of investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">Everybody is talking about cuts in the HSE and health services and they are required, although we argue they should be found in other areas, particularly in administration in the HSE.  However, this short-term saving will have long-term consequences because it will put increasing pressure on our major hospitals and acute beds, and will not do anything to serve the long-term interests of these communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, to take that message back to the Department of Health and Children and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</p>

          <speech by="#AineBrady" eId="spk_656" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Áine Brady</from>
            <p eId="para_1345">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to developing community-based services at local level.  Government policy on older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate. This policy approach is renewed and developed in the current partnership agreement, Towards 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_1346">The Government's objective of continued development of community-based services for older persons is reflected in the funding given to the system in recent times.  Since 2006, more than €500 million in additional funding has been invested in long-term care supports for older people.  This includes the largest ever investment of more than €200 million to develop community care services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1347">As the Deputy is aware the Health Act 2004 provides the Health Service Executive with responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.  As a statutory body, the provision of these services, including progressing community services at local level, is therefore an operational matter for the executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1348">The HSE is committed, through its national service and capital plans, to deliver services within its Vote provided by the Oireachtas.  The HSE at present provides or supports the following services on the Meath Hospital site, including two primary care teams, the south inner city partnership, a community nursing unit, comprising 54 beds and day care, the Irish Wheelchair Association and a social inclusion service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1349">When the Meath Hospital moved to Tallaght, various proposals were evolved and considered for the Meath Hospital site.  However, none of these proposals ever proceeded beyond initial consideration and this is still the position.  No decision, therefore, has been taken to either allocate to or withdraw funding from the old Meath Hospital site.</p>

            <p eId="para_1351">Any proposals on the infrastructural development on this site would, in the first instance, have to be put forward by the HSE as part of its agreed capital programme for 2009 or beyond.  This would have to take account of priorities determined nationally by the executive, including decisions regarding new community facilities coming on stream or the replacement or up-grading of long-term residential facilities generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1352">Such initiatives have to be in line with agreed capital envelopes and identify any additional revenue or staffing implications arising from this particular project.  It is only in this context that the proposed re-development of the Meath Hospital site, whether on a phased basis or otherwise, can be progressed.  I understand that officials from the HSE local health office and HSE estates met local public representatives on 21 April last and apprised them of the situation on this issue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary O’Rourke</from>
            <p eId="para_1353">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his permission to raise this matter.  This eel business has been shamefully handled from the very beginning.  Without any consultation of depth, a group of officials decided that they would obey the call contained in a European directive that sought a 40% reduction in eel fishing.  They decided they would offer 100%.  Let us imagine getting a directive from Europe, which one decides not alone to obey but to more than double the provisions.  Their decision, in effect, was to kill off the eel fishing industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1354">I am acutely disappointed, not at the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, who is a delight to deal with and meet at any stage.  My words of a castigatory nature are not against her good self.  I know the Minister of State is aware of that.  My disappointment is due to the fact that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who voted in the Chamber tonight, did not see fit to explain why he had allowed this shameful neglect, this utterly shameful, despicable action by him and his officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1355">When I drew the matter to his attention one evening he replied that only a few people in short-term jobs were affected.  In the acute economic disarray in which we find ourselves, those jobs are the only economic mainstay of many a family in this country.  There is a significant number of eel fishermen in the midlands.  Eel fishing rights have been passed down from grandfather to father to son.  There is to be no compensation.  Their rights were wiped out overnight with absolutely no compensation yet nobody is creating a fuss.  Nobody is worked up about it.  Why is that the case?  It is the case simply because they think they will get away with it.  Then we wonder why people did not support the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  One of the main reasons was to do with turbary rights, about which at least the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has seen sense and some turf cutters have regained their rights.  The rights of people handed down through generations to fish for eels in their designated waterway has been shamelessly whipped away from them with no academic or research study to back this up.</p>

            <p eId="para_1372">I have a long interest in eel fishing through family members and the Barrow catchment where I live.  I know a huge number of eel fishermen who have lived for generations in small lock houses along the Barrow who catch a few eels.  They catch brown eels in the summer in fyke nets and silver eels in winter in the first floods.  The most amazing scene in County Carlow or County Kilkenny where I had the privilege to be elected is to see those eels in the first big floods of autumn slithering across our fields into small streams to reach the major catchments on their voyage to the Sargasso Sea.</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">The approach to the eel ban is fundamentally flawed.  We could have an eel ban forever in this country and it would not solve the problem because the problem is outside of Irish waters.  We need a Europe-wide study on what is happening to the elvers.  They are the small glass eels that have not yet reached maturity.  They come back into our rivers and streams to breed and then travel back down the rivers in the autumn to their spawning grounds in the Sargasso Sea.  They are not there anymore, yet they are being sold in vacuum packs in the French and Spanish markets and are being caught by the Japanese and the Chinese.  In spite of that we are imposing a total ban in this country without looking at the cause and the effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">I am disappointed that we did not get the scientific evidence or have a proper consultation process with the eel fishermen.  I would have liked the senior Minister and the Ministers of State to meet with the eel fishermen to discuss the proposed ban.  Let us consider what is happening in Holland where the Government is investing €1 million to help progress an eel fishery.  The intention is to release the silver eels into the sea and then invest a further €300,000 to buy elvers to put into the catchments in the hope that they will escape through the rivers and back into the sea.  What we are doing in this country is fundamentally flawed and flies in the face of scientific reason.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">If we are to take ourselves seriously and act on directives from the European Union we must have the scientific evidence to back up such a ban.  It is a knee-jerk reaction and I hope we can have consultation and above all, compensation, for the approximately 500 fishermen affected.  On my own catchment there are fewer than 50 fishermen.  Eel fishing is a long tradition and eel fishermen are conservationists.  I am a conservationist and I am a member of a conservationist party but what we have done in terms of the eel ban flies in the face of scientific interest.  I look forward to a reversal of the decision at the soonest possible opportunity in order to protect the eel, implement conservation measures and to protect the incomes of eel fishermen.  We will not do it alone, we need all of our 27 European Union partners to come together to find out why the elvers are not returning.  The problem is not in the Irish waters, it is outside of it and that is where we must begin our research.</p>

            <from>Deputy Áine Brady</from>
            <p eId="para_1376">I thank Deputies O'Rourke and White for raising this important issue and for their wonderful contributions.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">Earlier this decade, scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, indicated that the European eel stock is now outside safe biological limits.  It advised that a recovery plan be developed for the whole stock of European eel as a matter of urgency and that exploitation and other human activities affecting the stock be reduced to as close to zero as possible.  The EU brought forward a Council regulation to establish a new framework for the recovery and sustainable use of the stock of European eel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1378">As required under the regulation, Ireland submitted a Government approved draft eel management plan to the Commission for approval earlier this year.  Given the perilous state of eel stocks in Ireland, as demonstrated in the assessment contained in the plan, and consideration by management of other factors, such as protection costs, the implementation of the data collection regulation and the eel regulation's traceability requirements, four main management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement in Irish waters were identified.  Those are a cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market, ensuring upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers, the improvement of water quality in eel habitats, and the mitigation of the impact of hydropower, including the introduction by the ESB of a comprehensive silver eel trap and transport plan on the Shannon and Erne rivers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1379">The Irish eel fishery harvested approximately 100 tonnes per annum and there are up to 150 fishermen who held a maximum of 296 licences, not all of which were actively fished.  Catches have been declining over recent years because of the status of stocks.  Eel fishing is not a full-time occupation and is restricted to certain months of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1380">Last week the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources signed by-laws to give effect to the national eel management plan put in place to protect our dwindling eel stocks.  The by-laws closed the commercial and recreational eel fishery until June 2012.  The decision to cease the eel fishery was taken to support a recovery of the stock in the shortest time possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">Under the regulation, all aspects of the plan must be reviewed in 2012.  This review will consider whether the eel fishery and market could be reopened in any river basin district in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of stocks.  At that stage, the by-laws will be reviewed.  However, when the last 20 years of poor recruitment of juvenile eels is taken into account, it is likely that the adult eel stock in Irish waters will continue to decline for at least the next decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">The ESB, as part of its implementation of the eel plan, will advertise for tenders next week to undertake trap and transport operations.  Ambitious targets have been set within the plan, including the transport of at least 40 tonnes of eel around the turbines at Ardnacrusha and Ballyshannon.  The Minister is also alert to the concerns and the impact the necessary conservation measures will have on commercial eel fishermen.  Experienced eel fishermen would be in a very strong position to tender competitively for the provision of the trap and transport operations for ESB.  The Minister encourages them in their efforts to form the appropriate co-operatives or other ventures to best compete for these contracts.  There will also be a limited amount of fishing associated with the research and monitoring to be carried out under the plan.  This will be in the region of 150 man days spread over seven water bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">The low recruitment of juvenile eels in 2009 appears to be the worst yet and gives rise to serious concern for the future of the eel. We owe it to future generations to do whatever we can to save this vulnerable species, not only for its own sake but also to protect ecological biodiversity.  To do otherwise would consign our remaining stock, challenged by so many pressures from ocean changes due to global warming to habitat degradation to parasites and disease to possible extinction.</p>

         asked the

         the rate REPS 4 payments will be when payments are made in October-December 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1385">At the time of the Supplementary Budget, in April, I indicated that, given the pressures on the public finances and having considered other alternatives, I had decided to reverse the seventeen per cent increase in REPS 4 payments.  The effect of this decision is to bring REPS 4 payment levels back to the current REPS 3 levels.  This reduced level of payment will be applied to REPS 4 payments made in respect of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">Given that the closing date for the 2009 REPS scheme passed on Friday last, 15th May, my Department is now in the process of determining the final number of applications.  While the majority of applications were prepared on eREPS, use of that system did not become compulsory until February and, by then, a substantial number of plans had been prepared manually or on other systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">The first instalment of 75 per cent will be paid as soon as all administrative checks have been completed and I anticipate that this will be around October next.  The remaining 25 per cent will be paid as soon as all on-the-spot inspections have been completed, which should be in December.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">REPS has been particularly successful in meeting environmental imperatives and consumer demands for environmentally-friendly food production and the necessity to reduce the payment levels reflect its success and the participation levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">In view of the decision to reduce the payment levels, my Department has indicated our willingness to examine the obligations imposed on participating farmers and, only last week, my officials met with the farming organisations to discuss this particular issue.  I should say, however, that the undertakings in the REPS 4 scheme have been agreed with the European Commission and any changes to those undertakings can be introduced only with the approval of the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">By 31st December 2008, my Department had received 12,146 REPS 4 applications.  As of today, payments have issued to 9,332 applicants and a further 418 cases have been approved for payment in the coming days.</p>

            <p eId="para_1392">Under the Health Check agreement  €120 million in additional modulation funds will be allocated to Ireland's Rural Development Programme over a four year period beginning in 2010. This funding may only be spent on measures addressing the new and ongoing challenges of climate change adaptation and mitigation, renewable energies, water management, biodiversity, innovation measures relating to these areas and the restructuring of the dairy sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1393">I requested submissions on the measures to be funded by modulation from the bodies consulted on the initial draft of the Rural Development Programme. Almost forty submissions were received and they cover a broad area including agri environment measures, energy crops, forestry, the dairy sector and environmental projects in rural communities. Any measures to be funded must fit in with existing measures in the RD Regulation and must be clearly linked to the new challenges.  The additional modulation must be co-financed from national funds at the rate of 25%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">I am currently considering how these funds can be used to optimum effect to develop Irish agriculture within the terms laid down in the EU regulations and also taking account of the current budgetary constraints. All submissions received have been examined carefully and will be a useful input to my decisions on these matters. The revised Rural Development Strategy and Programme must be submitted to the Commission by 15 July 2009 and the funds will become available in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_1401">While the relationship between the food industry and the retail trade is essentially a matter between the parties themselves, there are specific provisions in competition law that extend to business relationships, including relationships between suppliers and retailers.  These provisions prohibit various anti-competitive practices, including price-fixing, abusing a dominant position, requesting "hello" money and imposing resale price maintenance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1402">In that specific regard, the House will be aware that the Tánaiste has requested the Competition Authority to conduct a study of the retail import/distribution sector as to how competition is working in the sector and whether there are any practices or methods of competition that are affecting the supply of goods or services.  The Tánaiste has recently received the Authority's report and is currently examining its conclusions and intends to publish the report shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1403">The Government appreciates fully the value of the food sector to the Irish economy, not least in terms of the employment provided, and is committed to its ongoing support in terms of investment and innovation.  We will continue to work with the industry to address the ongoing competitive pressures and to ensure that the industry continues to produce high-quality food product that is more than capable of competing with any comparable product at home or abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_1405">The implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

            <p eId="para_1416">The Common Agricultural Policy of the EU provides a range of measures that can be utilised to assist the European dairy market.  Those measures have been modified over recent years, in the Mid Term Review of the CAP in 2003 and in the Health Check last year.  In those negotiations I argued strongly in favour of keeping the critical market instruments in place and of using them effectively.  These measures are now being used to help the sector at this difficult time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">Most of the support schemes had been suspended from 2007 as prices were at record high levels.  When the situation deteriorated in 2008 I called on the Commissioner to reintroduce appropriate market supports.  The Commission has acted over recent months to address the situation.  They initially responded last November by bringing forward the operation of the private storage scheme for butter.  Following that, in January, the Commissioner announced the re-introduction of refunds for export of dairy products outside the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_1418">In March the Intervention schemes for butter and skimmed milk powder were opened.  I met with the Commissioner to discuss the market situation and stressed the importance of continuing to accept butter and SMP into intervention at effective levels.  Since the intervention limits were reached the Commission has continued to buy butter and SMP into intervention at prices close to the fixed price under the tendering system.  I also called for the continued use of export refunds at viable levels to move significant quantities of product from the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_1419">Apart from pressing the EU Commission I have also raised the matter with my colleagues at the Council of Agriculture Ministers, most recently at the April meeting.  I drew attention to the serious difficulties on the milk market where the severe slump in demand has led to a dramatic fall in prices.  There was considerable support around the table and I will continue to build on that in the coming weeks. Milk will feature again on the agenda of the Agriculture Council and I will once again reiterate my views to the Commission and the Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">The EU Commission actions in implementing the available support measures have helped to stabilise the market.  However, I will continue to monitor the situation and intervene again with the Commissioner as the market circumstances evolve, including at next week's Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels.</p>

            <p eId="para_1422">The introduction of electronic identification (EID) for sheep was agreed at EU level in late 2003. At that time, it was agreed to defer the implementation date until January 2008. The Council revisited this issue in December 2007 when it was agreed that the deadline for the compulsory introduction of EID should be definitively set for 31 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">I am of the view that the introduction of compulsory electronic identification (EID) of sheep should not have been decided on until it could be clearly demonstrated that its introduction would have clear benefits for all farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">I have also used every opportunity in EU discussions, both at Council and at bilateral level, to seek the introduction of EID on a voluntary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">However there is no appetite amongst the majority of Member States or the Commission for any further deferral of the deadline of 31 December 2009, or for the introduction of EID on a voluntary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">My Department is in the process of consulting stakeholders on the state of play in relation to EID in sheep.  I am anxious that all Irish concerns are taken into account in whatever system is finally implemented. These discussions are taking place without prejudice to my continuing view that EID should be introduced on a voluntary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">I should also point out that under the EU legislation, EID will not apply to sheep born before January 2010, nor generally will there be a need to retag existing sheep.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">Furthermore provision is made whereby lambs intended for slaughter and less than 12 months old can be permanently excluded from the EID requirement. If this provision is applied by Ireland, it will reduce the number of animals affected by EID substantively. In these circumstances, the introduction of sheep EID will be confined largely to new or  replacement breeding stock and will take a number of years to impact fully on the sector.</p>

I was instrumental in securing this agreement and in addition I successfully negotiated for the use of the National Reserve element of these funds from 2009. In this regard I have already announced that the available monies for 2009 which amount to approximately €7millon will be paid to hill sheep farmers as a once off payment in 2009 in the form of an Uplands Sheep Payment. This payment will benefit approximately 14,000 hill sheep farmers.</p>

The Monitoring Committee for the Rural Development Programme which includes representatives from all the farming organisations will also be consulted. As in the case of the unspent funds, decisions on spending will be taken on the basis of the regulatory requirements and with the aim of achieving the optimum outcome for the development of Irish agriculture.</p>

            <p eId="para_1441">The current position in regard to the WTO negotiations is that talks are stalled following the failure to reach agreement at the Ministerial meeting last July and the decision to defer indefinitely a second Ministerial meeting planned for last December.  The G20 meeting in April provided no new momentum for the negotiations and nor did it set a date for a conclusion of the talks this year.  The prospects for agreement are uncertain, however, it is difficult to see serious negotiations restarting until later this year at the earliest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">Several initiatives are underway to anticipate and prepare for the more competitive environment facing the agri-food sector in expectation of a WTO deal at some point in the future and to address other challenges facing the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">Strategies for the development of a consumer focused, competitive and sustainable agri-food sector capable of meeting the challenges of more liberalised markets and broader societal demands both at home and abroad are set out in the Agri-vision 2015 report and the Cawley Report.  These strategies identify the delivery of safe, high quality, nutritious food, produced in a sustainable manner in high value markets as the optimum road for the future of the Irish food industry in the light of the changes which have already taken place or are anticipated over the next number of years and span the entire food chain from primary production through processing to market access which is key to developing export potential.</p>

            <p eId="para_1445">Bord Bia, recently published a Strategy to boost food exports for the period 2009-2011.  The strategy comprises six key priorities to be addressed including enhancing the industry's position on its home market to capitalise on the potential for growth and expansion of exports with a particular emphasis on the Eurozone markets. During 2009 Bord Bia will implement a comprehensive set of promotional programmes and services, which have been developed in consultation with industry bearing in mind the impact of the sterling differential on competitiveness.</p>

I wholeheartedly welcomed this comprehensive and wide ranging Strategy Document with its emphasis on environmental sustainability, safety and quality of EU aquaculture production.  I pointed out that the strategy, with  meaningful stakeholder inclusion, has the potential to provide the appropriate framework for the sustainable development of the EU aquaculture sector.  In the current global economic environment I believe we can further develop the Irish Aquaculture Industry in a sustainable manner to maximise the undoubted potential that exists.</p>

A further 40 per cent will be paid in early January 2010 and the remaining 20 per cent in January 2011.  I have also announced that a special ex-gratia payment not exceeding 3.5 per cent of the value of the deferred amount will be made to farmers whose Farm Waste Management grants have been partially deferred.  This payment will be made in January 2011 along with the final instalment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">It is intended that the first instalment of 40 per cent will have been paid by my Department in respect of all approved claims by end-June 2009 and my Department keeps its staffing arrangements in local offices under constant review in order to ensure that payments continue to flow in a timely manner to farmers under the Scheme.  In addition, revised arrangements have been introduced by my Department to expedite the approval procedures involved.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1480">A contingency plan for the control of bluetongue disease has been drawn up, as required under EU legislation.  Operational details in the plan include the drawing of control, protection and surveillance zones around the infected holding, with associated movement restrictions within and between these zones, the confining of animals indoors, the control and eradication of the vector by use of insecticides, entomological surveillance (light traps) and vaccination over a period of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">All involved in the livestock sector have an obligation in the national interest to ensure that Ireland remains bluetongue free. The highest risk of the introduction of bluetongue into Ireland is via an imported animal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">In this regard I have a threefold message for all importers. Firstly, they should not import any animals from bluetongue affected areas. By so doing they are putting their farms and the entire industry in jeopardy. Certain types of imports are permitted but while the controls in place under the EU legislation reduce the risk of bluetongue spread, they cannot guarantee freedom from the risk of introducing infection. This is further complicated by the presence of various strains of bluetongue virus on the Continent. Vaccinating against one particular strain does not protect an animal from another strain which may be circulating.</p>
            <p eId="para_1483">Secondly, if cattle and sheep importers choose to ignore this advice and import animals from bluetongue affected areas on the Continent, a two test regime for these animals will apply following their import into Ireland. The first test is at the importers expense, to be carried out by his private Veterinary practitioner and is to take place on the farm of destination on day 1 post import. The second test takes place on day 7 post import also on the farm, and is carried out by Veterinarians from my Department's local office. The introduction of this second test may allow earlier detection of an infected animal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">Thirdly — should the results of these tests show that the imported animal is bluetongue virus positive, it will be immediately slaughtered without compensation. Importers should be aware of the financial exposure as well as the disease risk they are facing both to their own herd and to the national herd.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">Similar measures are in place in Northern Ireland which is also bluetongue free.  All bluetongue disease information can be found on the dedicated page of my Department's website: www.bluetongue.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">In summary, I am satisfied that we have appropriate contingency arrangements in place to deal with an outbreak of bluetongue. However, I believe that we must continue to focus on keeping the disease out of Ireland. In this context I would hope that no-one would import animals from bluetongue affected areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1511">I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 109 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512">The recent statistics from the Central Statistics Office indicate the difficulties faced by the sheep industry.  The decline in the Irish sheep sector is not an isolated phenomenon. Similar declines are evident in most of the sheep-producing countries of Europe.  The Sheep Industry Development Strategy Group recognised the problems facing the industry and put forward a series of recommendations to address them.   Some considerable progress has been made by my Department in implementing the Group's recommendations which are within its remit. These include: A new company called ‘Sheep Ireland' which will take over the Department's current breed improvement programme has been established to develop a new programme.  An interim Sheep Board, comprising representatives of farming organisations and breeders has been established to oversee this process, with the Irish Cattle Breeders Federation (ICBF) providing the technical and professional service required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1513">My Department secured European Commission approval for a new supplementary measure in REPS 4 promoting mixed grazing of cattle and sheep. Under this supplementary measure a farmer can qualify for a top up on his or her basic REPS payment. A trial to examine the feasibility of mechanical carcass classification for lamb was conducted last year. The results of this trial are being analysed. It is hoped that the system will allow for the accurate and objective mechanical classification of lamb carcasses and will gain universal industry support. This would aid greatly in price transparency, which is a prerequisite for efforts to improve quality and respond to the needs of the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme was established in 2007. This Scheme which is operated by Bord Bia, now has over 7000 participants and it is hoped to increase the participation rate during the current year. Bord Bia has intensified its efforts to promote lamb on home and export markets. Together with its UK and French counterparts it is part of a generic promotion campaign on the important French market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1515">Teagasc have developed a comprehensive plan to restructure their sheep support services, including a programme for Technology Evaluation and Transfer farms, which include hill and lowland areas. This approach will provide an opportunity to develop a dialogue with sheep farmers about the application of the latest management practices to their enterprises and to identify research and development needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">The actions being taken by my Department and the state agencies under its aegis are in addition to those being taken by the Industry. I am satisfied that taken together, all of these actions will in the long term, be of significant benefit to the sheep sector.  It should also be pointed out that this sector benefits significantly from the main schemes operated by my Department — the Single Farm Payment, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and REPS. I was also conscious of the needs of the sheep sector in deciding that the €7 million available from the National Reserve in 2009, should be used on the sector. That funding will be used on a new Uplands Sheep Payment this year, which is expected to benefit approximately 14,000 hill sheep farmers.    In addition, Bord Bia will spend up to €1 million on the promotion of sheep and lamb at home and abroad in 2009, and Teagasc has allocated almost €1.5 million for sheep research.</p>
            <p eId="para_1517">You will also be aware that under the final agreement on the Health Check of the CAP, Ireland will have access to additional funds of the order of €25 million annually from unspent CAP funds from 2010.  In accordance with the requirements of the regulation, these funds can be used to address specific disadvantages affecting farmers in the dairy, beef and veal, sheep and goat and other sectors. My main priority in allocating these funds is to ensure that they are used in the most efficient and effective manner for the development of Irish agriculture.  Having consulted widely with all stakeholders, I am currently examining all proposals received, including those for the sheep sector and I hope to make an announcement in relation to the use of these funds in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1519">The EU Regulation relating to rural development programmes, which sets out the framework for schemes such as the Suckler Welfare Scheme, requires that commitments must be for a period of 5 to 7 years. While the Suckler Welfare Scheme is fully funded by the Exchequer, approval to proceed was required under the EU State Aids regime. The objectives of the Scheme are to improve animal welfare standards, breeding practices and the quality of the national beef herd. The State Aid application for the Scheme was prepared by my Department and approved by the EU Commission on the basis that a 5 year programme was a realistic and credible timescale for the realization of these objectives.

The disease, if confirmed, in dogs at the establishment in question would be a matter, in the first instance, for the breeder involved and his private veterinary practitioner. With regard to dog welfare regulation, the position is that my Department is drafting an Animal Health and Welfare Bill which aims to update existing legislation in the area of health and welfare to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals, is properlyprotected. My Department has no direct responsibility in regulating dog-breeding establishments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1526">A first policy debate on the future of CAP after 2013 took place at the Informal Agriculture Council in September last year.  While a large majority of Member States favoured maintaining a strong EU agriculture policy, there were marked differences in emphasis from different Member States.  The French Presidency took discussions forward and the Czech Presidency has continued the debate in the first months of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">Notwithstanding discussions to date, concrete proposals have yet to emerge on the shape of EU agriculture policy beyond 2013.  Among the ideas emerging are: demands from some Member States for a lower budget share for agriculture and for eventual dismantling of CAP; demands from new Member States for "re-balancing" of Member States' shares of agricultural funding; Increased calls for changes to the Single Payment system to move from the historic model and to apply a "flatter" model of direct payments; Calls for a greater focus on pillar 2 and introduction of more specific selection criteria and indicators to measure the effectiveness, outputs and impacts of rural development programmes; Continuing pressures to reduce supply and market management mechanisms with a greater reliance on crisis management.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">I am examining the options and possibilities being put forward with a view to determining what policies will serve Irish agriculture best in the years to come and I will be consulting fully with stakeholders on this starting later in the year.  In this connection and following on from the very successful Agri-food 2010 and Agri-Vision 2015 initiatives, I have already decided that it is necessary to prepare an updated national strategy for the agri-food sector to adapt to forthcoming challenges, to maintain and improve its competitiveness and to underline its vital role in Ireland's economy.  Currently my Department is engaged in preparatory analysis for this process, following which the consultation process with stakeholders will commence in the latter part of the year.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1538">I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 93, 94, 102, 115, 117 and 126 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">Dairy farmers incomes are made up of the market price paid for milk and direct income support from the EU.  Market forces of supply and demand have a major influence on the price paid for milk.  World market prices determine the returns received by dairy processors and this is reflected in the price paid to farmers.  In an open market it is not my role to predict or guarantee a minimum price for milk.  However, the EU Common Agriculture Policy provides a range of measures that can be used to assist the dairy market.  In the Health Check negotiations last year there was pressure to remove or weaken these considerably.  At the time I fought hard to keep the key market instruments in place and these are now being used to help support the market.  The Health Check also granted additional quota to all Member States, but that has no bearing on the current situation.  Indeed, milk production in the EU is below the level it was before the quota increase in 2008 took effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1540">In the EU, export refunds and internal subsidies had been suspended since 2007 as prices were at record high levels.  As the market situation deteriorated towards the end of 2008 I called on the Commissioner to reintroduce support measures in order to help stabilise the dairy market.  The Commission initially responded last November by bringing forward the operation of the private storage scheme for butter.  In January the Commissioner announced the reintroduction of refunds for export of dairy products outside the EU.  This was an important step and signalled an intention by the Commission to put a floor under the market.  In March the intervention schemes for butter and skimmed milk powder were opened which allowed the purchase of product up to set limits at a fixed price.  Around that time I met with the Commissioner to discuss the market situation and stressed the importance of continuing to accept butter and SMP into intervention at effective levels.  I am pleased that the Commission has continued to buy butter and SMP into intervention at prices close to the fixed price under the tendering system.  I also called for the continued use of export refunds at viable levels to move significant quantities of product from the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">At the Council of Agriculture Ministers in April I raised this issue again with my colleagues.  I drew attention to the serious difficulties on the milk market where the severe slump in demand has led to a dramatic fall in milk prices.  I urged the Commission to continue using the existing measures to support the market and to consider introducing additional methods where appropriate.  I received considerable support from my fellow ministers and I will draw on that in the coming weeks.  Milk will feature again on the agenda of the Agriculture Council and I will once again reiterate my views to the Commission and the Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">The EU Commission's actions in utilising available support measures have helped to stabilise the market.  However, as the milk price is greatly influenced by market forces of supply and demand, support schemes have a limited effect on milk prices.  It is also important that the issue of disposal of EU intervention stocks is managed carefully.  I will be taking this matter up with the Commissioner at the appropriate time.  The short term outlook for the dairy sector remains uncertain and I will continue to monitor closely the Commission's management of the dairy market.</p>

            <p eId="para_1546">Since it was first introduced in 1994, the REP scheme has been highly effective in encouraging farmers in their role as custodians of our environment.

            <p eId="para_1556">The original Government decision on the decentralisation of my Department was that some 600 headquarters staff would move to Portlaoise; that some 90 staff in the fisheries areas would move to Clonakilty; that the local offices in Cork city would move to Fermoy; and that the laboratories in Cork and Limerick would move to Macroom.  The decision regarding State agencies was that Bord Bia would move to Enniscorthy and Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) would move to Clonakilty.  Following the decentralisation announcement in the budget, the moves to Portlaoise and Clonakilty (including BIM) were approved by Government to proceed.  The moves to Fermoy, Macroom and Enniscorthy have been deferred pending a review in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">To aid continuity of business and maintenance of service delivery to stakeholders, my Department's original Decentralisation Implementation Plan allowed for a phased movement to Portlaoise.  The 2005, 2006 and 2007 advance phases of decentralisation to Portlaoise were completed on schedule.  Since the programme began there has been an increase in Portlaoise of some 300 posts across a wide variety of divisions, bringing the total there to almost 500 posts.  Over 130 of the increase of 300 originally worked in my Department.  The move of the administrative staff of the fisheries areas to Clonakilty, comprising some 85 posts, is complete.  The Department's permanent building in Clogheen, Clonakilty, has just recently been completed and occupied.  To date, the Department has met its targets as set out in its original Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">The date for completion of the original plan was 2008, which at the time coincided with the initial estimate of availability of the permanent accommodation.  The site purchase in Portlaoise was completed in 2007 and the Office of Public Works subsequently announced a preferred tender as part of a public private partnership, including other Government offices in Mullingar and Carlow.  Planning permission for the new building was granted during 2008 and the OPW is actively pursuing the matter with a view to a contract being placed ‘at the earliest possible date'.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">A revision to the Department's Decentralisation Implementation Plan is now being considered, to reflect the changes to the timetable and the progress so far, as well as the evolving operating environment; completion of the programme depends on the confirmation of the date of the availability of the permanent accommodation.  An additional advance phase has been agreed and is currently under way.  Arrangements for support to Ministers in Dublin, post-decentralisation, are being considered but have not yet been finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1583">Significant progress has been made regarding this initiative since the beginning of the year. Animal Health Ireland is now a legal entity with its own Board of Directors, having recently been incorporated as a company limited by guarantee.  A specialist recruitment company has been engaged by Animal Health Ireland to proceed with the recruitment of a Chief Executive Officer for the organization a process that is now underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_1584">Animal Health Ireland hosted a very well attended information seminar for its stakeholders on the 6th March 2009, at which issues such as the current situation regarding non-regulatory diseases in Ireland and in competitor countries were considered and a realistic assessment of the scale of the challenges ahead was made. Similar seminars  focusing on those individual diseases and conditions that come to be prioritised for action are planned for the future. The Animal Health Ireland website, which will go live within the coming days, will facilitate the communication process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1585">The Chairman and others associated with Animal Health Ireland have conducted a wide-ranging consultation with a large cross-section of stakeholders in recent weeks.  Work is underway to identify and prioritise a definitive ranking of disease priorities to be addressed by Animal Health Ireland. An extensive survey of expert opinion is due to be completed by mid-June. In addition to the expert opinion, the opinion of farmers has been sought through a survey and the deliberations of Farmer Focus Groups established by Animal Health Ireland. Technical Working Groups will be created to establish nationally-agreed protocols for the prioritised diseases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">I understand that the feedback from the stakeholder group to this initiative has been very positive and this is confirmed by their willingness to commit funds to Animal Health Ireland. I believe Animal Health Ireland provides a unique opportunity to develop an improved understanding of current practices and future trends in international best practice in the area of herd health. It affords those organisations — including farmers, producers, processors, and support/advisory service — actively participating in the project to build on the significant resources, informational infrastructure, capabilities and expertise already available within the range of organisations. It also offers an opportunity to develop a national strategy to take appropriate action in the area of non-regulatory animal health which in effect will allow industry to a large extent shape its own future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1588">The introduction of electronic identification (EID) for sheep was agreed at EU level in late 2003. At that time, it was agreed to defer the implementation date until January 2008. The Council revisited this issue in December 2007 when it was agreed that the deadline for the compulsory introduction of EID should be definitively set for 31 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">I am of the view that the introduction of compulsory electronic identification (EID) of sheep should not have been decided on until it could be clearly demonstrated that its introduction would have clear benefits for all farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1590">I have also used every opportunity in EU discussions, both at Council and at bilateral level, to seek the introduction of EID on a voluntary basis.  However there is no appetite amongst the majority of Member States or the Commission for any further deferral of the deadline of 31 December 2009, or for the introduction of EID on a voluntary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">My Department is in the process of consulting stakeholders on the state of play in relation to EID in sheep.  I am anxious that all Irish concerns are taken into account in whatever system is finally implemented. These discussions are taking place without prejudice to my continuing view that EID should be introduced on a voluntary basis.  I should also point out that under the EU legislation, EID will not apply to sheep born before January 2010, nor generally will there be a need to retag existing sheep.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">Furthermore provision is made whereby lambs intended for slaughter and less than 12 months old can be permanently excluded from the EID requirement. If this provision is applied by Ireland, it will reduce the number of animals affected by EID substantively. In these circumstances, the introduction of sheep EID will be confined largely to new or  replacement breeding stock and will take a number of years to impact fully on the sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1601">Following confirmation by the Valuation Office that it would not be in a position to supply a valuation service in respect of activities on State foreshore, my Department sought approval from the Department of Finance for the use of valuers from the private sector.  A number of applications for foreshore consents currently on hand cannot be progressed without valuation.   The Department of Finance gave my Department sanction to obtain the services of valuers from the private sector subject to conditions.  Private valuers have now been engaged by my Department to provide valuation advice on specific cases and I am confident that this will facilitate an early determination in the relevant cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_1605">Against the background of the deterioration in public finances, my approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to protect expenditure for major developmental measures in the agri-food sector. To achieve this objective, savings had to be found in other areas and I decided reluctantly to reduce expenditure under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme for 2009 by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares (84 acres). While overall expenditure will fall, almost 67,000 farmers will not suffer any reduction in their payments as a result of the introduction of the 34-hectare limit. The rates of payment which were increased by 8% in 2007 remain unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1606">The total amount available under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme in 2009 is €220 million. This represents a substantial injection of funds paid to farmers situated in the areas and the Scheme continues to be one of the best well funded Disadvantaged Areas Schemes in the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">Notwithstanding the difficulties in the public finances, the position is that in excess of €3.2 billion will be spent next year by my Department in support of agriculture, fisheries and food. It is important to get through this challenging period and continue towards achieving the full potential of our most important indigenous industry when the economy begins to grow again.</p>

            <p eId="para_1611">The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation. At present EU food labelling legislation is harmonised by Council Directive 2000/13/EC, transposed in 2002, with 8 amendments since. In January 2008, the European Commission presented its proposals to update this legislation which aims to provide a high level of consumer protection in relation to food information while ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">The draft EU proposal consolidates and updates two areas of labelling legislation, general food and nutrition. The key issues are country of origin labelling, mandatory nutrition labelling and allergen labelling. The Commission has proposed that while country of origin labelling is not mandatory, where it is used, the country of birth, rearing and slaughter of the animal must be stated, if different to the country of origin.  This proposal is currently being discussed at working group meetings. The Irish authorities submitted a position paper on the draft EU proposal to the EU commission in November 2008. In this paper, Ireland proposed that country of origin labelling be made mandatory. The Department of Health and Children has continued to pursue this request at EU Working Group meetings. The Regulation is expected to be finalised by end of 2009 at the earliest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1613">Notwithstanding the outcome of the current review on origin labelling my Department had taken steps to try to introduce origin labelling for meats other than beef, which is already subject to specific legislation since September 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614">In conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, regulations were drafted that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  The Commission's main contention is that only harmonised rules with EU-wide applicability may be applied to food labelling other than in exceptional circumstances.   In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them. Notwithstanding that additional information was provided, the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health formally adopted a negative opinion on the draft regulations in December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1615">The issue of origin labelling will continue to be pursued by Ireland at EU level in the context of the current review of the labelling Directive and in the context of the review of EU quality policy for agricultural foodstuffs. It should be noted that products carrying the Bord Bia quality assurance label provide consumers with assurance on product origin.</p>

            <p eId="para_1617">The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the fisheries policy of the European Union which was first put in place in 1983 and has been subject to reviews every 10 years, the most recent was in 2002 and the next is formally scheduled for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">On 21 April 2009 The European Commission published a Green Paper on the latest reform of the CFP in order to launch a consultation with Member States and stakeholders and to initiate a broad public debate on the future CFP reform.  A summary of this consultation process will be published in 2010.  It will be followed by a legislative proposal to the Council and the European Parliament to be adopted in 2011, with a view to its entering into force in 2012. It is clear that every aspect of the CFP is up for review and will require detailed attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">An exchange of views on the Green Paper will be held at the next Agriculture and Fisheries Council on the 25-26 May 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">I welcome the Commission's Green Paper on the reform of the CFP and acknowledge the importance of the process we are embarking on, as it will culminate in the shaping of the strategic blueprint for the European fishing industry for the next decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">In the current economic climate, we need a policy that both simplifies and reduces the administrative burden while at the same time strengthens and supports the industry's capacity to maximise employment in coastal communities dependant on fishing.  This will be a key objective for Ireland.  We will be pursuing initiatives that will help deliver and sustain jobs in coastal communities rather than those that promote the concentration of wealth and delivery of excessive profits for a few big international businesses.</p>

            <p eId="para_1653">The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.  The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation. In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.  These draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health Ministers during 2009.  The aim of the draft Regulations is to modernise and improve EU food labelling rules, so that consumers have, in a legible and understandable manner, the essential information they need to make informed purchasing choices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1654">Notwithstanding the outcome of the current review on origin labelling, my Department had taken steps to try to introduce origin labelling for meats other than beef, which is already subject to specific legislation since September 2000.</p>

While further information was submitted supporting the need for the regulations the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health formally adopted a negative opinion on the draft regulations  in December 2008.  The Commission adopted a Green paper on Agricultural Product Quality in October last as part of a drive to protect EU quality agricultural products against ‘low cost products from overseas'. One of the questions posed was whether a logo identifying European Union versus non European Union origin in terms of quality and environmental standards particular to the EU would be a useful mechanism.  A High Level Conference organised by Czech Presidency to supplement the Green Paper consultation held earlier this month, concluded that further consideration was needed on the possibility of EU/Non EU labelling.   A policy options paper based on the outcome of the conference and the 500+ submissions received on the green paper is expected from the Commission at the end of the month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1656">The issue of origin labelling will continue to be pursued by Ireland in the at EU level in the context of the review of the Labelling Directive and the review of EU quality policy for agricultural foodstuffs.

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1663">As the Deputy will be aware, I decided that unused funds from the Single Payment National Reserve would be paid to hill sheep farmers in 2009 in the form of an Uplands Sheep Payment. In reaching this decision, I recognised the difficulties, and costs including compliance costs, facing the sheep sector and was anxious to introduce a scheme immediately in order that Irish sheep farmers could benefit from these funds in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1664">During the negotiations on the CAP Health Check proposals I was one of the first Ministers to press for the use of unspent funds from national Single Farm Payment ceilings to fund measures that targeted at specific sectors in need of assistance. The outcome of the health check negotiations had been very positive for Ireland, and had once again shown the importance of EU support for Irish agriculture.</p>
            <p eId="para_1665">In relation to the Upland Sheep payment, my objective was to ensure that it was simple and low cost to administer and created no additional administrative burden for farmers. The main features of the new Uplands Sheep Payment are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">(i) Eligible applicants must have sheep recorded in the National Sheep Census for both the 2007 and 2008 calendar years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667">(ii) Applicants must be eligible for the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">(iii) Applicants must farm and declare in 2009 mountain type grazing land.</p>
            <p eId="para_1669">(iv) The mountain type grazing land must have been declared on the 2008 and 2009 Single Payment/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme application forms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1670">(v) The aid will be payable on mountain type grazing land up to a maximum of 15 hectares.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671">(vi) The rate of aid per hectare will be calculated by reference to the available National Reserve funds and the total area eligible for payment when all of the 2009 Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme applications are processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">(vii) Eligible farmers will apply for the Uplands Sheep payment when they submit their 2009 Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme application form.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">Payments are scheduled to commence on 1 December 2009, the first date that payments can commence under the EU Regulations. Based on the estimated National Reserve funds of approximately €7 million and the eligible area declared by farmers in 2008, approximately 14,000 hill sheep farmers will benefit from the 2009 payment. Based on the data available for 2008, it is estimated that the level of aid will be €35 per hectare and a maximum payment per farmer of €525.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">I must emphasise that the measure is for 2009 alone. A decision on the use of unspent CAP funds and modulation monies from 2010 onwards, will be made when further information is available on the detailed EU rules that will apply to these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">Having consulted widely with all stakeholders I am currently carefully examining all proposals received for the use of these funds including those for the sheep sector and I hope to make an announcement in relation to the use of these funds in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1683">Brucellosis is now at an historically low level in Ireland. The last confirmed case was disclosed in April 2006.  My Department applied to the European Commission on 31 March last for formal recognition of Officially Brucellosis Free status (OBF) for Ireland.  I am hopeful that a decision on our application will be taken in July at the latest.  Achievement of OBF status would allow the relaxation of some of the programme's control measures over the coming years and this will reduce the burden on farmers of testing and movement controls.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684">However, as Brucellosis continues to exist in Northern Ireland, my Department will be adopting a cautious approach to reducing controls and any change to existing controls will be based on risk assessment. Some consultations have already taken place with representatives of the farming bodies on the testing regime for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1685">With regard to possible savings arising from the attainment of Officially Brucellosis Free status, the position is that the cost of the Brucellosis eradication programme has been falling progressively over the last number of years in line with the reduction in the incidence of the disease. In particular, the cost of compensation paid by my Department to farmers in respect of Brucellosis reactors fell from €24.2m in 2002 to €280,000 in 2008. Since the cost of compensation has fallen to very low levels and, as a general rule, farmers themselves pay for Brucellosis testing, the savings for my Department will not be significant in the short-term, particularly in view of the fact that the reduction in control measures will be gradual, based on risk assessment in the context of the disease still being present on the island. However, over time there will be significant benefits to farmers in terms of reduced testing costs and the relaxation of restrictions on cattle movements and trade.</p>

            <p eId="para_1690">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. The purpose of CE is to help unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">The criteria for participating on the Community Employment programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments. In general, the Part-time Integration Option is for people of 25 or over who are receiving social welfare payments for 1 year or more, and people of 18 years or over in receipt of disability-related payments.  Those who are eligible usually participate for a period of 1 year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1692">The Part-time Job Option is for people who are 35 or over and in receipt of social welfare payments for 3 years or longer.  Under this Option those who are eligible may participate for a period of 3 years.  The 3 year option recognises the need to provide access to a part-time job for extended periods for older persons who have been unable to secure regular employment for some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">Certain groups such as travellers and refugees aged 18 or over are eligible for both options. If you qualify under the criteria but do not wish to take up the option yourself, there are certain conditions under which you can do a spousal swap.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  I have no plans to amend the eligibility criteria for participation on Community Employment Schemes, however, the operation of the Scheme is kept under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1698">In recognition of the fact that skills and labour shortages no longer exist in various sectors of employment, a number of occupations have been added to the list of those ineligible for work permits, and a significant number of job categories have been removed from the Green Card eligible list where the salary payable for the job is in the range €30,000-€59,999 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">It has been, and continues to be, Government policy to require that employers make a meaningful effort to give preference to Irish and EEA nationals in filling job vacancies. To underscore the application of this Community Preference principle, it was decided to strengthen the labour market needs test for new entrants from 1st June in order to ensure that only those vacancies that cannot genuinely be filled by nationals of EEA countries are considered for work permit applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">Government recognises the fact that those permit holders who have been living in Ireland for several years have made a real contribution to the economy, and that they too are potentially impacted by adverse labour market conditions. Therefore, the revised employment permit rules provide that, in the event of the redundancy of work permit holders, they will have up to three months from the date of the redundancy to seek alternative employment, and that where they have been made redundant from a post which is now considered ineligible for a work permit, they may continue to seek work in an ineligible category in order to ensure the best possible chance of regaining employment. In the case of Green Card holders who have been made redundant, new Green Cards will be issued in accordance with the Green Card scheme salary requirement and for jobs where there is strategic skills shortage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">New arrangements regarding work permit renewals will only apply to non-EEA nationals whose permit application was approved on or after 1 June 2009. Persons who were granted a permit prior to this date will retain the original renewal conditions.</p>

The Act does not provide for the inclusion or exclusion of any particular pension scheme in PIPS.  One of the main aims of the scheme is to support pension schemes in the greatest need.  For that reason, and having regard to a number of factors, the Government decided to offer PIPS to insolvent pension schemes of insolvent companies, that is, companies which may not be in a position to assist schemes in meeting the original pension commitment made to pensioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">It is my intention to bring forward the necessary regulations giving effect to PIPS shortly.  Once that has been done, it is open to any pension scheme that meets the criteria to apply to participate.  The principal qualifying conditions for PIPS are that the sponsoring employer must be insolvent (in accordance with the definition used in the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984) and the defined benefit pension scheme must be in deficit.</p>

            <p eId="para_1713">The decision on pass through of ECB rate reductions to customers with credit cards or personal loans is a commercial decision for the financial institution concerned.  This decision will reflect a range of different factors including funding costs, market conditions,  profitability and business strategy, the risk profile of the consumer, whether the loan is secured or unsecured as well as the competitive environment overall.  The Deputy will appreciate it is a core function of the Board and senior management of each institution to assess where the appropriate balance lies between these competing objectives particularly in ensuring the financial health and commercial viability of the relevant institution.  It is not an appropriate role for the Minister for Finance to seek to determine this decision making by financial institutions operating under competitive market conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1714">The Central Bank publish monthly statistics on interest rates, however these do not include advertised rates for consumer credit or credit cards. The latest available data relate to March 2009. This data indicates that between September 2008 and March 2009:</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">Rates on new variable-rate consumer loans fell by 3 percentage points. Rates on new fixed-rate consumer loans fell by 0.7 percentage points.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">Rates on overdrafts declined by 1.4 percentage points. (This category includes some credit card volumes, but balances and rates are not separately identified.)</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">Mortgage rates for new variable-rate customers fell 2.4 percentage points. The average rate for existing customers fell by 2 percentage points.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">As part of its consumer information role the Financial Regulator provides cost comparison surveys on its personal finance website www.itsyourmoney.ie.  The areas covered by these surveys include borrowing &amp; credit. The banking cost comparison surveys, including credit card and personal loans are maintained on an always up-to-date basis. Within these surveys, features that are important to consumers, and in particular, those which have an influence over a purchasing decision (such as cost of credit) are highlighted prominently.</p>

            <p eId="para_1722">Public servants who are members of public service pension schemes are liable to pay the pension-related deduction legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">The applicability of the new deduction to the North-South Implementation Bodies (including Waterways Ireland) arises from section 1 of the Act, by way of the definition of ‘public service body', which includes, at paragraph (i) ‘a body...that is wholly or partly funded out of money provided by the Oireachtas or from the Central Fund...and in respect of which a public service pension scheme exists or applies or may be made'.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">Those employees of North-South Bodies in receipt of ‘remuneration' as defined in Section 1 of the Act  i.e. ‘emoluments to which Chapter 4 of Part 42 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 applies' are subject to the deduction. Therefore, all Irish-taxed employees of the North-South Bodies are subject to the deduction whether they enjoy ‘core terms' or ‘reserved rights terms' under the North-South pension scheme or have other employer-supported pension arrangements or payment in lieu thereof.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">I might add that, as the Deputy may be aware, in order to ameliorate the impact of the deduction on lower paid public servants (with a partial offset by an increase on earnings above €60,000) I announced, in the Supplementary Budget of 7 April 2009, a change to the structure of the deduction which will exempt the first €15,000 of earnings.</p>

The records maintained by Revenue do not provide a basis for compiling the detailed information in relation to those primarily involved with the prevention of self-harm and suicide as sought by the Deputy.  However, a full list of bodies which have been granted charitable tax exemption under section 207 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is available on the Revenue website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1777">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for the purposes of Capital Acquisitions Tax (gift and inheritance tax), the relationship between the person who provided the gift or inheritance (the disponer) and the person who received the gift or inheritance (the beneficiary) determines the maximum tax-free threshold — known as the "group threshold" — below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">There are, in all, three separate group tax-free thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1779">Group A: €434,000 — applies where the beneficiary is a child (including certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  In certain circumstances parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance from a child.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1780">Group B: €43,400 — applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, niece, nephew, or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1781">Group C: €21,700 — applies in all other cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">When calculating whether a beneficiary has received benefits in excess of his or her group tax-free threshold, any other gifts and inheritances received by that beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same group are taken into account.  Apart from the tax-free group thresholds available to a beneficiary, the Capital Acquisitions Tax code also exempts a gift or inheritance of a dwelling-house completely from gift or inheritance tax in certain circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">The main conditions attaching to the exemption are that the beneficiary of the dwelling-house must have resided in the dwelling-house for a minimum of three years prior to the gift or inheritance and must not have an interest in any other dwelling-house.  In addition, the beneficiary must continue to occupy that dwelling-house as his or her only or main residence for a period of six years from the date of the gift or inheritance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be the subject of gift or inheritance tax when it is transferred.  The dwelling-house exemption is available to any beneficiary who meets the conditions for the exemption irrespective of whether or not they are related to the disponer of the gift or inheritance and irrespective of the value of the dwelling-house being transferred.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">The timely payment of taxes and duties by specified dates is a fundamental requirement of out tax system and is provided for in the legislation governing all taxes and duties.  Under Capital Acquisitions Tax legislation, tax is normally due within four months of the person becoming entitled to the inherited or gifted property.  However, a taxpayer has the option to pay the tax due and the interest accruing by five equal yearly instalments.  In the case of hardship or illiquidity, the legislation also allows Revenue to consider such cases on an individual basis by reference to the facts and, where appropriate, allow for the postponement of payment for such period and on such terms as may be determined in a given case.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_1791">The decision to introduce a free Preschool Year in early childhood care and education (ECCE) from January 2010, at an estimated annual cost of over €170 million, was announced as part of the package of measures provided for in the April Supplementary Budget.  As a budgetary initiative, details of the scheme were not publicly available prior to the Budget announcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">Immediately following the announcement, details regarding the scheme were communicated to the City and County Childcare Committees and the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations, all of which are funded by my Office.  The scheme was subsequently discussed with them in depth at a special seminar held on 7 May 2009.  I have also had a number of meetings with the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations since the announcement and have listened carefully to their views.  Where possible, issues raised by the sector will be taken into account in the terms and conditions governing the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">The scheme as announced already provides for a very flexible approach for childcare and playschool services, in terms of the ways in which they can provide the free preschool year.  They can opt to participate on the basis of a 50 week model or for a longer daily session over 38 weeks each year.  There is also provision for a service which cannot operate for 5 days a week to operate for 4 days over 41 weeks.  As a result, it is expected that existing service providers who wish to participate will be accommodated without difficulty.  While the provision of a free preschool year is fundamental to the scheme, it is open to services to charge for optional additional services which parents may wish to avail of.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">The introduction of a free Preschool Year in early childhood care and education has been called for by the sector for many years.  The announcement of the scheme has been strongly welcomed by the City and County Childcare Committees and the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations as a major policy development which they had long called for.  The preschool provision will be founded on the principles of Siolta, the national framework for early learning, which was developed in close consultation with the sector. I am satisfied that the introduction of the free preschool Year is the first important step in the provision of quality early years care and education.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children (Deputy Áine Brady)</from>
            <p eId="para_1807">At present, there are approximately 15,500 residents in private nursing homes. Of these, approximately 9,000 are in receipt of subvention.  A further 3,000 are in "contracted" beds in private nursing homes.  People in contract beds pay public nursing home charges and the State pays the balance of the cost.  The expenditure on nursing home subventions for residents in registered nursing homes for the year 2007 was €171m, increasing to €202m in 2008.  Furthermore, in 2007 the maximum rate of basic subvention was increased to €300 per week to help alleviate the financial burden on residents in private nursing homes pending the introduction of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">The Bill for the New Nursing Homes Support Scheme completed Committee Stage in the Dáil on 12th March 2009.  It is the Minister for Health and Children's intention to progress the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas with a view to implementing the scheme later this year.  The scheme will ensure that nursing home care is affordable for all who need it regardless of whether they choose a public or private nursing home bed.  There has been significant investment in long-term care supports for older people over the last few years and Budget 2009 provided a further €55 million specifically for the implementation of the new Nursing Homes Support Scheme this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">The Deputy will be aware that a new process of the registration and inspection of nursing homes by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) will commence from July 1st, 2009.  This will introduce an independent system of inspection of both public and private nursing homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">Residents, their families and the public need to be reassured that HIQA will be monitoring the care people receive and in this regard it is important to have an effective, robust, independent and properly resourced inspection regime for residential services for older people.   While the new regime for registration and inspection of all nursing homes will begin this year it is important to note that under the Health Act 2007 statutory responsibility is also given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services for inspecting and registering residential services for children and people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">Following analysis of the types of centres, numbers of places, etc. it was a decided to set a registration fee of €500, payable every 3 years by each nursing home together with an annual fee of €190 per place in each registered centre.  It is estimated that this will generate a minimum income of about €4.5 million which would cover the minimum annual additional funding required without putting an excessive burden on smaller residential units.  The fees as calculated cover staff costs only; non-pay costs such as accommodation and equipment are coming from the overall HIQA budget.   It is further estimated that the fee will represent an average weekly cost of €3.73 per registered place.  Finally I can confirm to the Deputy that it is intended that the Department will carry out a review of these charges in 2010.</p>

My colleague Minister Harney's policy with regard to the allocation of this funding is that it is a matter for the HSE to arrange for the delivery of the maximum range, quality and quantum of services practicable within available resources. The HSE may to do this by direct service provision or by the allocation of funding to those service providers who in its judgment provide a best fit in terms of the quality and content of the services on offer and the needs of the service user, taking into account factors such as the geographical location of the service provider and the identified service need, together with best use of existing organizational capacity, staffing and funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_1818">In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers,  the Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade with effect from 27 March 2009 to end 2010.  A HSE circular has issued which gives effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">The Government decision has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability. The HSE will be focussing on the scope that exists within the health services for reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery. The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care. It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">In addition, the employment control framework specifically exempts the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians.  The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 wtes) for the health sector. The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer and disability services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided. The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.  This moratorium relates to the public health service which includes voluntary hospitals, therefore, the moratorium and the conditions attached to it apply to the hospital in question as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_1823">The Health Service Executive is fully aware of the financial challenges being faced by Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin and is involved in ongoing discussions with hospital management regarding its 2009 financial allocation and Service Plan.  The priority is to ensure that services are maintained at an optimum level.  Each hospital funded by the HSE is required to deliver services within the financial allocation provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">The 2009 allocation to Our Lady's Children's Hospital is €139.6m. The allocation has increased by over €38m or 39% since 2004. In line with budgetary constraints across the system, the 2009 allocation is 3% below the 2008 allocation of €143.8m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">In the first three months of this year there were 2,745 treatments for children as in-patients and 3,841 treatments for children as day cases in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  This represents 244 more treatments for children than during the same period in 2008. There were also 21,252 attendances in the Out Patients' Department, an increase of 1041 over the same period last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">The HSE has advised that, based on the financial performance for the first quarter of 2009, the hospital should achieve a break even position at year end. This assessment takes account of cost saving measures totalling €6.5m which have been agreed with the hospital, and which are to be implemented over the remainder of the year. Much of the focus of the discussions between hospital management and the HSE has been on ensuring that all areas of non-pay expenditure are critically examined and that costs are reduced where possible.   It has also proven necessary to take measures to reduce activity, including the closure of a theatre and a ward from this month.  However, the hospital has confirmed that it is committed to delivering on the full level of its service plan commitments for 2009.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1851">The HSE has commissioned a number of reviews in relation to how acute hospital services should be organised, including the Teamwork/Horwath Report in relation to the Mid-West region. The Health Information and Quality Authority recently published its report on services at Ennis General Hospital. These reviews have highlighted the need for changes to be made in the provision and organisation of acute hospital services across the region, particularly in relation to accident and emergency services, critical care, and surgical services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1852">The HSE has indicated that certain changes to the present arrangements for the provision of some acute services must be made, in the interests of patient safety and also to make best use of the clinical resources available within the Mid West region.  The first phase of the re-configuration involved the reorganisation of the arrangements in Ennis and Nenagh so that these hospitals provide an urgent/minor injuries service for 12 hours a day as part of a regional Accident and Emergency structure. These hospitals will also continue to admit appropriate medical cases.Ambulance services in Clare and North Tipperary have been enhanced and an advanced 24-hour paramedic service is also in operation as part of the new arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">The plans also involve the reconfiguration of acute hospital services into a network and their better integration with primary care services across the region, with a regional centre at the Regional Hospital Limerick that will deal with complex and specialist cases.  The changing nature of health service delivery is such that smaller hospitals can meet much of the demand for less complex services, especially those that are increasingly done on a day case basis.  Day surgery and diagnostic service activity at  Ennis and Nenagh will also be significantly enhanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">I am satisfied that the measures being taken by the HSE are necessary and appropriate in order to ensure the provision of safe and effective health services to the people of the Mid West region. My Department has asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the detailed operational issues raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1891">As the Deputy will be aware I have responsibility for the implementation of the new scheme to provide a free Preschool year of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) which was announced recently by the Minister of Finance.  The Early Childcare Supplement (ECS) will be withdrawn at the end of 2009 and will be replaced by the Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) from January 2010.  This is a free scheme to benefit children in the key developmental period prior to commencing school.  The scheme will allow eligible children to avail of a free playschool place in their preschool year, which will be provided for 3 hours per day, 5 days per week for 38 weeks.  It will also allow eligible children in their preschool year who are attending full day or part-time daycare services to avail of a free session of 2 hours and 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week for 50 weeks.  As the new scheme will be introduced from January next, the first full year will be from September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1892">Participating children must, normally be aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on the 1st September of each year.  Exceptions will be allowed where children have special needs or it is necessary to accept children at an older age due to the enrolment policy of the local primary school.  Participating services will receive capitation of €64.50 per week where children attend for 38 weeks, and €48.50 where they attend for 50 weeks of the year.  Services will receive payments at the start of each term.  Where the child is attending full-day or part-time childcare, the service will be required to reduce the childcare fees by the amount of the capitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1893">While the scheme will normally be required to provide services on a five day per week basis, transitional arrangements will apply during the initial period of January to August 2010, to allow services to adjust to the requirements of the new scheme.  During this period, services which are already accommodating children on a pro rata basis, may continue to do so and the capitation grant will be set by reference to the number of children attending per day rather than the total number of children per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1894">To ensure that a satisfactory standard of preschool provision is delivered, a minimum enrolment of 8 children is envisaged.  Exceptions will be considered where, for good reason and subject to compliance with all other contractual requirements governing the scheme, a service has an enrolment of at least 5 children in their preschool year or there is a minimum enrolment of 8 children of which at least 3 are in their preschool year and the remainder would be eligible in the following year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1895">The scheme will be open to almost 5,000 private and voluntary preschool services and officials in my Office will be writing to these very shortly to provide further details and to advise them of the application process.  Pre-School leaders will be expected to have a qualification in childcare to FETAC level 5 or 6 qualifications, or equivalent or to be in the process of completing their qualification.  All services will be required to provide an educational programme consistent with the principles of Síolta and appropriate to the age of participating children.  A national team of Síolta co-ordinators will assist services in meeting these standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_1897">It is no longer the practice to designate sites on the public road network as blackspots.  The emphasis now is on identifying locations with a high accident record and devising suitable remedial measures.  The undertaking of any survey of its road network, to, inter alia, ascertain its condition, including identification of locations with a high accident record, is a matter for each local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1898">Since 2000, road grants have been paid to local authorities under the Low Cost Safety Improvement Works Scheme for regional and local roads.  The National Roads Authority (NRA) assesses applications for grants under the regional and local roads scheme on behalf of my Department.  The criteria for grant approval are based on accident data, inspection of sites, locations showing a demonstrable hazard and discussions between the local authority and the NRA.  In 2009, grants totalling €6.25 million have been allocated under the scheme to local authorities for works on regional and local roads.  The allocation of grants for national roads is a matter for the NRA.</p>

The Ports Policy Statement gives a number of indications with regard to port company board appointments.

It is also important that board members cultivate a commercial ethos and display a genuine dedication to the welfare of the port and all its stakeholders.  I will consider these points and the nominations received when making my decision.  In the meantime the board has selected an acting chairperson, as provided for in its Articles of Association.</p>

            <p eId="para_1902">Rosslare Europort differs somewhat from the other ten State owned commercial ports, in that it operates as a commercial division of Iarnród Éireann, rather than a stand alone company under the Harbours Acts.  The port is the second largest roll on/roll off port in the country and provides important transport links to the UK and continental Europe. Traffic through the port has grown substantially over the last decade.  My Department liaises closely with the port with regard to ports policy developments and in particular port capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1903">The port was one of seven ports to make a detailed submission as part of the Port Capacity Study carried out in 2006.  Since the study my Department has continued to monitor capacity developments under the Port Sub-Programme of the current NDP.  Rosslare has a major capital investment programme for 2009. The bulk of this will be spent on a new linkspan in the port, which is currently under construction.</p>

He was advised by the Travel Document Unit in writing on 16 April 2009 to seek assistance from his relevant embassy which is the appropriate course of action in such circumstances. In all cases, INIS must be satisfied that there is no alternative open to an Irish temporary travel document applicant preventing them from procuring their own national passport or travel document before an Irish temporary travel document will issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1986">I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are 36,916 bench warrants recorded as un-executed as of 17 May, 2009.  It is inevitable in any criminal justice system that at any given time there will be a significant number of warrants awaiting execution.  The Garda authorities are committed to strengthening the warrants in the system enforcement process.  The Commissioner has raised the issue of the execution of warrants with each Regional Assistant Commissioner and a range of measures, aimed at reducing the number of warrants on hand, have been identified and are being implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1987">It should be borne in mind too that the vast majority of the outstanding bench warrants relate to unpaid fines for modest sums, arising from minor infractions of the law and not convictions arising from violent and other serious crime.  An Garda Síochána give priority to the execution of warrants in respect of serious crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1988">The Fines Bill 2009, which was published on 20 April, provides for the payment of fines by instalment and an improved means of assessing the capacity of a person to pay a fine.  It also gives the courts powers to treat non-payment of a fine in the same way as non-payment of a civil debt and to impose a community service order for non-payment of a fine.  As a result, imprisonment for default should in future become the exception rather than the rule.  As so many warrants relate to financial penalties, these proposals should result in a smaller number of warrants being issued and so reduce pressure on the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">The operation of the warrants system will continue to be monitored, particularly with a view to making whatever changes may be necessary to improve its operation.</p>

This section prevents obstacles to transfers by forbidding any provisions in PRSA contracts that prohibit a contributor from entering into another PRSA contract and transferring his or her assets to the new PRSA.

            <p eId="para_2012">The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the 10 new EU Member States, without the transitional limitations which were imposed at that time by most of the other Member States. The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2013">Habitual residence condition (HRC) decisions for child benefit, disability allowance, carers allowance and pensions are now made in their respective headquarter offices.  In addition, 90% of Jobseeker's Allowance habitual residence condition cases are straightforward and are decided in local offices at the point of claim.  The average processing times for Jobseekers' claims is currently 6 weeks. The more complex habitual residence cases are sent to the central HRC unit for decision.   As a result of the increase in the volume and complexity of claims currently being referred to the central unit, it can take to up to 5 months for a decision to be finalised in certain cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2014">The Department has recently introduced a number of measures to address the delays and expedite the HRC decision-making process.  Since the beginning of 2009, a further three staff have been assigned to the unit. In addition, a programme of devolving all decisions locally has commenced.  Formal training for the first phase for staff involved commenced on 19th May 2009. The training of the remaining staff will be rolled out over the coming months. The localisation of the decision making functions when completed will result in speedier processing of claims.</p>

            <p eId="para_2016">As Deputies will be aware, in the context of the current economic circumstances, it has been necessary for the Government to take steps to reduce overall public expenditure in order to restore order and stability in the public finances. This has involved reviewing all public expenditure programmes, including social welfare programmes, which at some €21.3 billion in 2009 form a substantial portion of overall public expenditure. In order to avoid cutting all the weekly social welfare payment rates while trying to keep the welfare budget at a level the State can afford it has been necessary to discontinue funding for the Christmas bonus that in the past has been paid to certain welfare recipients. The payment of a 100% Christmas bonus in 2009 would cost an estimated €223 million. The decision not to pay the bonus this year was the most difficult decision the Government had to make in framing the supplementary budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_2017">The rates of child benefit have increased significantly since 2001 having trebled for the first two children and increased by over 185% for the third and subsequent children. Overall expenditure on child benefit grew from the equivalent of €965 million in 2001 to nearly €2.5 billion in 2008 as a result of these rates increases and the growth in the number of eligible children.  The Minister for Finance announced in the Supplementary Budget the Government's intention to subject child benefit to income tax or means-test it from 2010. The Department, together with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, will be giving the matter careful consideration over the coming months. Furthermore, the Commission on Taxation is considering the issues underlying the possible taxation of child benefit. The Commission's deliberations will inform the Government's final decision on how to proceed. Officials of this Department, in their submission and their meeting with the Commission, set out their views on the issues involved in means testing or taxing child benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2018">While very difficult decisions have been taken in order to restore order and stability in the public finances, I have been successful in keeping expenditure control measures in the social welfare area to an absolute minimum and ensuring that the more vulnerable in society have been protected from their effects.</p>

            <p eId="para_2022">The statement to which the Deputy refers is a press release issued by the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs on 14 February 2005 which announced details of changes introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2005. These changes included an improvement in the means test arrangements for all social welfare schemes (except supplementary welfare allowance) under which the amount of capital disregarded for means test purposes was increased, with effect from June 2005, to €20,000 from €12,697.38. The enhanced disregard applied to all capital regardless of where it is or was held, be it in a SSIA, a Credit Union, with An Post or any other account with a bank or other financial institution. The change was introduced following a review of the arrangements for the assessment of capital particularly as they related to SSIAs. The policy in relation to SSIAs and social welfare payments has not changed since 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">In assessing means for social assistance purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property (except the family home).  Capital may include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_2024">Stocks and shares of every description, which are assessed according to their current market value.</p>
            <p eId="para_2025">Savings certificates / bonds / national instalment savings, which are also assessed according to their current market value.</p>
            <p eId="para_2026">Money invested in a bank, building society etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2027">Capital amounts held in Special Savings Investment Accounts when such accounts existed were treated in the same manner as other capital. Following the closing of such accounts in 2007, capital formerly held in these accounts continues to be assessed for means tested purposes in the same manner as before.  Currently, for the purposes of most social assistance schemes the first €20,000 of capital continues to be disregarded. The first €50,000 is disregarded in the case of disability allowance while the first €5,000 is disregarded in the case of supplementary welfare allowance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2029">Eligibility for the State (Contributory) Pension is determined by an individual's PRSI contribution history.  The standard qualifying conditions for contributory pensions require a person to enter insurance 10 years prior to pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate, and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time that they enter insurance until they reach pension age. As signalled in 2002 and provided in the Social Welfare Acts, the minimum number of contributions required will increase from 260 to 510 from 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2030">Individuals in receipt of Disability Allowance are only eligible to apply for the State (Contributory) Pension, at age 66, if they started paying social insurance contributions before reaching the age of 56. They are not liable to pay PRSI contributions but may be eligible for credited social insurance contributions if they have paid at least one PRSI contribution and have paid or credited contributions in either of the last two income tax years before a claim was made for Disability Allowance. Credited contributions are only awarded to those people who were employed contributors, as opposed to self-employed contributors, reflecting differences between the nature of employment and self-employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2031">Alternatively, individuals may be eligible to pay voluntary contributions in order to maintain their contribution record and subsequent entitlement to the State (Contributory) Pension. In order to be admitted to the voluntary contributions scheme, a person must have a minimum of 260 weeks of PRSI paid in either employment or self-employment and apply within 12 months of their past paid contribution. The requirement to have 260 paid contributions to gain access to the scheme is essential in that it ensures that the requisite number of paid contributions required is in place to establish a contributory pension entitlement.</p>

            <p eId="para_2033">The Deputy will be aware of the huge increase in the number of people applying for jobseekers' payments in recent months.  This has placed increased pressure on all of the Department's offices and on branch offices. Staff in these offices are working extremely hard to process claims as quickly as possible.  In order to deal with the unprecedented number of claims, during the past year an additional 190 staff have been assigned to local offices throughout the country.  Many offices are now at capacity in relation to accommodation and to support these offices the Department has set up four central decision units around the country and a further three are planned.  In addition, since early in 2008 we have been examining all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims and streamlining them wherever possible with a view to expediting decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2034">For several years, the Department has operated a fast-tracking system for certain categories of claims. So, for example, if a person supplies all the necessary information and documentation to support their claim at the outset, their claim will be decided ahead of other claimants who have not produced all of the required information.  Customers who have already established entitlement on an earlier claim and who then sign off either to go to work or avail of a FÁS course will, generally speaking, not require significant re-investigation of entitlement if they have to sign-on again and will fall into the fast-tracking arrangements. There should be only minimal delay in deciding this type of claim. Inevitably there will be some claims that may require further examination and delays may arise in such cases.  However, these should be the minority of cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2035">Where there is a delay in processing a jobseeker's claim, the person may apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance from the local Community Welfare Officer.</p>

            <p eId="para_2117">The Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment to the Public Service with effect from 27th March 2009 and as with the broader public service, the Defence Organisation is required to operate with reduced funding for 2009.  In this context, all recruitment to the Cúltaca an Airm and Cúltaca an tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh was suspended.  My first priority was to consolidate the gains that have been made over recent years in developing Cúltaca an Airm and Cúltaca an tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh.</p>
            <p eId="para_2118">While the budgetary provision for training of members of Cúltaca an Airm and Cúltaca an tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh has been reduced, it will be sufficient to allow all current members to undertake paid training during 2009.  I have recently announced the re-commencement of limited recruitment to Cúltaca an Airm and Cúltaca an tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh in order to replace existing members who leave during the course of 2009.  This limited recruitment will be closely monitored and kept under review in the light of the uptake of paid training and future budgetary provision available to Defence.</p>

            <p eId="para_2120">Under Article 5 of Directive1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste, each Member State of the European Union is required to prepare and oversee the implementation of a National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste which will set out measures progressively to divert biodegradable municipal waste away from landfill in accordance with specified targets over the period to 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_2121">In April 2006, Ireland's first National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste set out a range of integrated measures designed to facilitate the achievement of these challenging diversion targets.  The Strategy envisages that 80% of biodegradable municipal waste will be diverted from landfill by 2016, with the separate collection and subsequent biological treatment of organic waste (i.e. food and garden waste) to generate compost having a critical role in minimising the use of landfill into the future.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to implementation of the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_2122">Against this background, a detailed circular issued in summer 2008 to all local authorities to drive forward the roll out of brown bins for domestic householders and to promote the use of home composting.  In tandem with the above, my Department is working with industry towards the development of a statutory instrument to require the source segregation and appropriate treatment of food waste arising in the commercial sector.  Consultations are ongoing with a wide range of stakeholders in this regard, including the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food given the cross-cutting issues concerning the treatment and subsequent reuse of animal by-products.  It is envisaged that these regulations, when made, will have the potential to divert significant amounts of commercial food waste from landfill towards more sustainable and environmentally beneficial practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2123">I have also signalled my intention to introduce primary legislation to allow for significant increases in the landfill levy to act as a further deterrent to landfill and a regulatory impact analysis for this purpose has recently been completed to inform the legislative process.  In the light of the above, I am confident that all of the measures outlined will contribute significantly to the achievement of the targets for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill and to an overall reduction in our use of landfill going forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_2148">Broadband services can be provided over various platforms, (DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless access, mobile, cable, satellite and fibre) by the private sector service providers. The enabling of exchanges for broadband purposes is a matter for the owners of the relevant exchanges.  It is anticipated that the facilitation of greater competition from different technology platforms should encourage the more rapid enabling of exchanges for broadband.</p>
            <p eId="para_2149">Some of the harder to reach rural areas remain without any broadband service as the cost of rolling out networks to such areas is not commercially viable.  To address this, my Department has entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  3 will be required to provide services to all residences and businesses that are within the NBS area and who seek a service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2150">3 is currently planning the construction and rollout of the required infrastructure for the purposes of the provision of the service.

            <p eId="para_2151">The general areas of Annyalla, Oram and Broomfield, County Monaghan will be covered by the NBS.

One month prior to the NBS being launched in any given area, 3 will implement a marketing campaign to announce the forthcoming service availability.  The campaign will include, inter alia, local press and outdoor advertising. Details of the areas to be covered by "3" under the NBS are available at www.three.ie/nbs.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_2158">The issue of labelling of fisheries products is governed by S.I. No. 320 of 2003 which gives effect to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 104/2000 and to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2065/2001 laying down the conditions for informing consumers about fishery and aquaculture products.</p>
            <p eId="para_2159">The Regulations set out the specific information required on the label where fishery products are sold at retail level to consumers. In addition, for the purposes of traceability, this information must be included on the commercial documents for the fishery products throughout the marketing chain, such as during processing, at wholesale level and for use by mass caterers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) have a primary role in the enforcement of these regulations and have published a guidance note on the labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products which is available on their website. The guide specifically details the labelling and packaging requirements for fishery and aquaculture products and may be consulted for a more detailed guide to the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">The cases referred to by the Deputy relate in the first instance to a case brought against a company for breach of the regulations which was ultimately dismissed, not for salmon labelling issues but because the judge felt that the evidence put before her did not adequately prove that the salmon was farmed as set out in European Council Regulation 1198/2006.  I understand that FSAI and SFPA are reviewing the case in its totality and the implications arising, I await their findings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">In another case brought against the same company, they admitted falsely describing fish as being "caught at sea" when they were in fact farmed and declaring that particular fish were caught in the northeast Atlantic Ocean when they were in fact captured in Norway.</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">I take these instances as evidence that the FSAI are active in their role of protecting consumers from misleading labelling.</p>
            <p eId="para_2164">Potential damage to Ireland by companies trying to manipulate legislation to gain some sort of competitive advantage must be prevented and any such activities will not be condoned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2165">In the overall context, I would favour strengthening of the current labelling EU Regulations to ensure that there is more information available to the consumer.  I am particularly interested in ensuring that the consumer has enough information to understand where fish have been caught.  It should enable the consumer to make an informed choice and I will be pursuing these issues at EU level.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</b>
         the way he can justify the 8% cut in forestry premia, which leaves farmers and growers in a catch-22 situation, tied to contracts and yet unable to realise a fair return on investment and furthermore forced to pay for fire insurance, which was not a condition of their original contracts; the measures he is putting in place to counteract this further blow to the viability of the farming sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2177">The decision to reduce the forestry premium and to restrict the availability of the reconstitution grant to forests damaged by disease or frost was set against the background of unprecedented pressure on the public finances and the necessity to take difficult decisions in order to make maximum use of limited resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2178">Maintaining an active afforestation programme was an important consideration in deciding how to make the most effective use of these limited resources following the supplementary budget on April 7th.  New planting is a key element of the Government's overall strategy for forestry and funding for 5,500 hectares of new planting in 2009 has been preserved.  Notwithstanding the reduction in premium levels, I am confident that this level of planting will be achieved in 2009.  With the continued availability of grants to cover establishment costs the overall planting package should still provide an attractive land-use option for farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2179">Notwithstanding the budgetary changes, it has always been considered good practice for forest owners to insure their investment against the potential for financial losses resulting from damage to their estate and they have been consistently encouraged to do so over many years.</p>

            <p eId="para_2188">The Minister for Health and Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.   The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation. In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.  These draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health ministers during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2189">Notwithstanding the outcome of the current review on origin labelling my Department has taken steps to try to introduce origin labelling for meats other than beef, which is already subject to specific legislation since September 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2190">Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2191">My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  The Commission's main contention is that only harmonised rules with EU-wide applicability may be applied to food labelling other than in exceptional circumstances.   In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them.  While my Department submitted further material the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health formally adopted the negative opinion on the draft regulation in December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2192">We will continue to pursue this issue in conjunction with Department of Health and Children, at EU level in the context of the current review of food labelling legislation. In the meantime products carrying the Bord Bia quality assurance label provide consumers with assurance on product origin.</p>

            <p eId="para_2194">According to the Central Statistics Office, in the 4-year period covering the years 2005 to 2008 inclusive, the food price index has recorded a slightly lower level of increase than the overall Consumer Price Index (CPI). Food prices increased by 11.1% over that period while overall prices as measured by CPI increased by 13.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2195">The most recent annual data available from the Central Statistics Office relates to 2008 when food and non-alcoholic beverages prices, as measured by the food price index, increased by 6.5% on average during that year. This is a higher level of increase than the overall annual rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, which averaged 4.1% during the same year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2196">Prices paid to producers are measured through agricultural output price indices (API). In the four-year period in question the total index for agricultural output prices increased by approximately 19.6%, with significant variations between commodities over the period. For example, these indices increased by 21% for cattle, 20.5% for milk and 37.8% for cereals during the period.</p>

The strategy sets out the Bord's six key priorities to be addressed including enhancing the industry's position on its home market to capitalise on the potential for growth and expansion of exports with a particular emphasis on the Eurozone markets. My Department in conjunction with the industry, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia continues to pursue the opening up of markets. A Meat Market Access Group was established in 2007 to ensure market access for Irish meat to non-EU markets. The main barrier had been the restrictions imposed by countries as a result of BSE and efforts to remove remaining restrictions has met with considerable success. The Saudi Arabian and South African markets were re-opened in 2007 while, more recently, the Philippines and Israel have lifted their restrictions. Efforts are continuing to regain access to other markets such as Japan, which continues to restrict for BSE related reasons, and Russia, whose restrictions are related to the recent dioxin incident.</p>
            <p eId="para_2223">Building on the ongoing work of the Meat Market Access group an inter-Departmental Group chaired by my Department and comprised of representatives from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, An Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Iascaigh Mhara has also been established and is currently engaged in a co-ordinated effort to identify potential market opportunities for the full range of Irish food and beverages, prioritisation of market initiatives and broader access issues.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_2225">I believe that the report of the Sheep Industry Strategy Development Group sets out a proper framework for the future development of the sheep sector. While most of the group's recommendations need to be implemented by the industry itself, a number of them fall within the remit of my Department and the state agencies under my aegis and good progress has been made on them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2226">‘Sheep Ireland' has been established to take over the Department's current breed improvement programme and develop a new one.  An interim Sheep Board, comprising representatives of farming organisations and breeders will oversee this process, with the Irish Cattle Breeders Federation (ICBF) providing the technical and professional service required. My Department secured European Commission approval for a new supplementary measure in REPS 4 promoting mixed grazing of cattle and sheep. Under this supplementary measure a farmer can qualify for a top up on his or her basic REPS payment. The results of a trial to examine the feasibility of mechanical carcase classification for lamb, which was conducted last year, are being examined. It is hoped that the system will allow for the accurate and objective mechanical classification of lamb carcases and will gain universal industry support. This would aid greatly in price transparency, which is a prerequisite for efforts to improve quality and respond to the needs of the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2227">The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme was established in 2007. This Scheme is operated by Bord Bia and now has more than 7000 participants. Teagasc have developed a comprehensive plan to restructure their sheep support services, including a programme for Technology Evaluation and Transfer farms, which include hill and lowland areas. This approach will provide an opportunity to engage with sheep farmers on the use of the latest management practices and to identify research and development needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2228">The actions being taken by my Department and the state agencies complement those being taken by the Industry. I am confident that taken together, all of these actions will be of significant benefit to the sector.  In addition and in recognition of the difficulties and costs facing this sector, I decided to allocate the extra funds available in 2009 under the National Reserve to hill sheep farmers, in the form of an Uplands Sheep Payment. It is estimated that some 14,000 hill sheep farmers will benefit from the estimated National Reserve funds of €7 million for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">Approximately 70% of Irish sheepmeat is exported, mostly to the high-value EU market. Traditionally, France has been the major export market for Irish lamb and in 2008 it accounted for more than 50% of Irish sheepmeat exports. Irish sheepmeat is however facing strong competition in France from the UK due to a weakened sterling and from New Zealand, which continues to build up its presence of chilled lamb on the EU market. The French market has also seen a decline in consumption. The impact of any reduction in Irish exports to France has been lessened by increased exports to other markets. Exports to Sweden and Denmark have increased significantly in recent years. Bord Bia will continue to promote intensively Irish lamb at home and abroad. Its actions include a generic promotion campaign with its UK and French counterparts on the important French market.</p>

            <p eId="para_2231">My Department is responsible for the operation of EU controls on imports of products of animal origin and fresh fruit and vegetables under its service contract with the FSAI and in compliance with Community rules for the hygiene of food and feed. The EU rules stipulate that food products of animal origin imported from an EU source must be from approved food business establishments and be accompanied to destination by a commercial document or a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the Member State of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2232">In the case of importation from third countries products of animal origin for human consumption must have originated in a country approved by the EU for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment (with the exception of honey), be appropriately labelled and transported and must be accompanied by a veterinary health certificate in accordance with the models laid down by Community legislation. Consignments from third countries must be landed at an EU approved Border Inspection Post (BIP) approved by the Food and Veterinary Office of the EU (FVO) for veterinary checks.  In co-operation with Customs services my Department undertakes a range of checks on imported consignments including documentary, identity and physical including the sampling of imported products for analysis under national residue monitoring programmes and EU safeguard measures. The level of testing is in compliance with EU requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2233">The scope of products of animal origin coming under these requirements are set out under Commission Decision No. 2007/275/EC11 Official Journal of the European Communities No. L116 of 4.5.2007 which also provides for an exemption from border inspection in the case of certain composite and specified food products comprising processed low risk animal products and plant products. Details of the products are set out in the Annex to this reply. Such products must comply with public health requirements for their placing on to the market. Consignments of animal products must remain under Customs control until the BIP has authorised entry into the EU. Any imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_2234">Where non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed. Where there are risks to animal and public health, and in cases of animal disease outbreaks, the Community adopts safeguard measures that ban or restrict imports from affected countries or areas until the risks have been removed. The FVO monitors and inspects each Member State's controls on Food Safety including the operation of BIPs to ensure the conditions for import and placing of animal products on to the market, as provided under the harmonized legislation, are being correctly applied.  Imported fruit and vegetables are checked for compliance with EU marketing standards. Apart from quality criteria these standards also set down strict provisions regarding labelling, including country of origin. There are currently 36 specific marketing standards.  Regulation (EC) No 1221/2008 will, with effect from 1 July 2009, reduce the number of specific standards to ten  but all fruit and vegetables will be required to satisfy the EU's  general marketing standard. Controls on the import of food of non-animal origin comes under the responsibility of the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

            <p eId="para_2259">All tree species grant-aided by my Department under the forestry grant schemes achieve high levels of carbon-sequestration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2260">The potential of different tree species to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere depends mainly on their rate of growth.  Some conifer species grow rapidly and will begin to sequester considerable amounts of carbon early in their life.  Other species, including some broadleaves, grow more slowly and do not sequester the same level of carbon until later in their life.  Generally, as trees reach maturity, there is little difference in the total amount of carbon dioxide sequestered, when all species are compared.</p>
            <p eId="para_2261">The relationship between forests and carbon sequestration is a highly complex one and the efficiency of forests to absorb carbon is not dependent upon the tree species alone.  Other factors such as soil type, previous land use, local climate, disease, fire, forest management activities, fertilisation and the rate of decomposition of forest organic matter all contribute, to greater or lesser degrees, to the overall forest carbon cycle.</p>

            <p eId="para_2263">Since taking up the Agriculture Fisheries and Food portfolio in June 2008, it has been highlighted to me very forcefully by the Federation of Irish Fishermen that it is essential to have in place a level playing field on control across the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_2264">The EU Commission estimates that 88% of EU stocks are over-exploited and Scientists have recommended closure of 19% of fisheries.  These are shocking statistics and should make us all pause and take stock of the serious situation facing the industry across Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_2265">Each December we agree the TACs and quotas for the following year taking account of the scientific advice available, but where we are failing, I believe, is that these limits are not being respected and there is persistent overfishing well in excess of quota across Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_2266">The EU Court of Auditors report in December 2007 highlighted this problem and  identified substantial control failures across Member States.   On foot of the Court of Auditor findings, the Commission has brought forward a proposal to strengthen fisheries control across the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_2267">The Commission's proposals for a new control system are aimed at tackling over fishing.  The main themes of their new approach are:</p>
            <p eId="para_2268">A new common approach to control and inspection.  This involves a strong focus on inspections on shore based links in the supply chain whereby the owner of the fish must be able to produce documents proving that the product was caught in conformity with the rules and that it observes a principle of product traceability.  It involves using best practices such as risk analysis, concentrating control on problematical fisheries and periods.  It also involves the use of new technologies to ensure the maximum effective delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_2269">The promotion of a culture of compliance with the rules.  This involves a proposal for dissuasive and harmonised sanctions whereby a list of infringements is established together with a minimum fine applicable in all Member States.  It also involves a points based system which may lead to the suspension of a fishing licence or its permanent withdrawal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2270">The promotion of enhanced co-operation between Member States involving systematic exchange of information involving a common website where all relevant information and control data is available to the control authorities of all Member States, the Commission and the Community Fisheries control Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_2271">The proposal also strengthens the Commission's powers to guarantee common implementation of the Regulations and to intervene in case of poor application of control measures on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_2272">I am, in principle supportive of these measures.  I am convinced that if we do not have a common approach to fisheries control across the EU it is grossly unfair to fishermen and will result, despite all our best efforts in Ireland, in the further decline and eventual closure of the fisheries that our fleet rely upon for their economic survival.</p>
            <p eId="para_2273">It is important to remember that I and my predecessors as Ministers for Fisheries pushed strongly for a level playing field on control.  As a coastal state with responsibility for protecting some of the richest fishing ground in the EU and with a fishing industry almost completely dependent on sustainable fish stocks in our own waters, it is of the highest priority that there are effective control regimes in place across all Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_2274">Our own industry here in Ireland strongly believe that they are on their own in being subject to controls, and that operators in some other countries are not detected or when they are, that  they face low penalties.  I consider that this new proposal offers the best opportunity to introduce a level playing field on control.</p>
            <p eId="para_2275">I will be seeking certain amendments to the provisions where the provisions are excessive or impractical.  I will in particular be seeking strong powers for coastal Member States to effectively police waters under their control.  These measures should, I believe, compliment the introduction of the electronic log book requirement which Ireland pursued vigorously and which will have legal effect from 1 January 2010.  I firmly believe that we must seize this opportunity to put a stop to illegal fishing which will if left unchecked destroy fish stocks and the livelihoods of coastal communities around our coast dependent on fishing.</p>

            <p eId="para_2280">Irish dairy products are exported to other EU Member States and to over 100 countries worldwide.  The amount of exports to any particular destination varies in accordance with changes in the supply/demand dynamics in particular regions of the world and in respect of the various dairy products involved. In overall terms, Ireland's dairy exports amounted to €2.2 billion in 2008.  The UK represented the largest single share of export sales with 32%.  The rest of the EU accounted for 48%, while North America and Africa accounted for 6% and 7% respectively. As international demand changes there will be an increasing emphasis on consumer food markets, particularly in the EU, US and high growth emerging economies, together with strategically expanding marketing and distribution capability worldwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_2281">Dairy product output from Ireland and the EU is of course constrained by the limits placed on milk output by the EU milk quota regime. The recent CAP Health Agreement raised these limits with a 1% increase in Member States' quotas from 1st April 2009, together with an adjustment to the butterfat calculation which will deliver the equivalent of a further 2% increase in quotas in the 2009/2010 quota year.  These increases will provide Irish dairy farmers and processors with further opportunities to respond to global demand and to increase production and capture new market share.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_2283">The value of Irish meat and livestock exports reached almost €2.6 billion in 2008, some two per cent ahead of 2007 levels.  Within the overall food and drinks sector, meat is extremely important, with exports accounting for just over 30% of total agri-food exports of over €8 billion. In 2008Irish beef exports totalling 486,000 tonnes, were sent to 21 markets within the Continent of Europe and 16 countries internationally.  Despite the challenging market environment, the position of Irish beef in the key European markets should be maintained this year.  While the economic situation across Europe has had an effect on volume and the type of cuts consumed, trade so far in 2009 has been quite stable due to the diversified profile of customers and markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2284">Almost 99% of total exports now go to the high value EU markets.  This compares to just 50% as recently as 2000.  The UK remains our single largest destination with more than half our exports destined for that market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2285">To date in 2009, trade to the UK has been dominated by currency volatility, and trade has been somewhat slower than usual.  Overall prospects for the remainder of 2009 will be largely driven by how consumer purchasing patterns evolve and the impact of this on demand for beef.  If the trend of switching to cheaper cuts continues and the steak cut trade remains slow, it will continue to put pressure on overall carcase returns.</p>
            <p eId="para_2286">Notwithstanding the fact that most of our exports are to EU countries, the international market, also, remains an important outlet.  The re-opening of markets in Saudi Arabia and South Africa in 2007 and more recently in the Philippines and Israel show that our controls on BSE are recognized as working.  Work on opening other markets is continuing and a Market Access Group supports our efforts in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2287">Approximately 70% of Irish sheepmeat is exported, 99.9% of which goes to the high-value EU market.  Traditionally, France has been the major export market for Irish lamb and in 2008 it accounted for more than 50% of Irish sheepmeat exports.  Irish sheepmeat is, however, facing strong competition in France from the UK due to a weakened sterling and from New Zealand, which continues to build up its presence of chilled lamb on the EU market.  The French market has also seen a decline in consumption.  The impact of any reduction in Irish exports to France has been lessened by increased exports to other markets.  Exports to Sweden and Denmark have increased significantly in recent years.  Bord Bia will continue to promote intensively Irish lamb at home and abroad.  Its actions include a generic promotion campaign with its UK and French counterparts on the important French market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2288">Last year, Irish sheepmeat was exported to 16 countries on the Continent of Europe and 4 countries internationally.  The absence of export refunds, together with a production deficit within the EU means that the market focus is on Europe and there is little penetration outside the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_2289">Ireland exports pigmeat to some 24 non-EU countries in addition to the other Member States.  These include all the most important pigmeat importing countries such as Japan and the USA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2290">Currently the Peoples' Republic of China and Russia have a temporary ban in place as a result of the dioxin incident of December 2008 and my Department is working towards having these reopened.</p>
            <p eId="para_2291">With regard to market access, it is my policy and that of the Government to ensure that Irish producers have access to markets worldwide.  My Department maintains an extensive scheme of controls on the hygienic production of pigmeat and on the operational procedures that are required to underpin the certification of pigmeat for markets worldwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_2292">Bord Bia's overseas marketing initiatives include pigmeat.  My Department will continue to work with Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and the industry to retain existing markets and develop others.</p>

            <p eId="para_2294">The maintenance of an efficient and viable cereals sector in Ireland is clearly of the utmost importance.  In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, it is a key source of feedingstuffs for the livestock sector.  Annual cereals production in Ireland has fluctuated around 2 million tonnes in recent years.  It is desirable to try to sustain this level of production in order to avoid over-dependence on imported cereals.  Last year, despite the adverse weather conditions in Ireland at harvest time, yields generally held up very well resulting in the second highest cereals production on record, at approximately 2.4 million tonnes.  For 2009, the total area planted to cereals in the EU is expected to be down slightly by about 2% while in Ireland the early indications were of a decrease in sowing of winter cereals, influenced by the lower cereals prices and the late and difficult harvest.</p>
            <p eId="para_2295">EU policy regarding the cereals market is determined within the framework of the CAP. Irish cereal farmers, following the decoupling of the direct payments from production, are now in a position to respond to market signals.  With the cushion of the single payment, they can focus on supplying market requirements, minimising production costs and maximising their incomes.  Under the CAP Health Check agreement of December 2008, compulsory set-aside of tillage land was abolished, allowing growers to maximise their production potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_2296">The State supports the development of the cereals sector in a number of ways.  My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency, quality and viability of cereal production.  These services include seed certification, seed testing, recommended lists of varieties etc.  In addition, Teagasc provides comprehensive research, training and advisory services for cereal producers.  The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereal producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world.  I believe the outlook for cereal growing in Ireland is quite positive and that Irish cereal producers are well positioned to meet the competitive challenges ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_2298">The main aspects of the deal that are of interest to Ireland are as follows: Milk quotas will be increased by 1% per annum for each of the next five years (2009-2013).  In addition an adjustment in the butterfat reference will mean the equivalent of an extra 2% in milk quota for Ireland in 2009.  Two reviews of the market situation are planned, by December 2010 and by December 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2299">Due to our additional production potential, Ireland will benefit greatly from these changes.  Including the 2% quota increase already in place for 2008, this means that an additional 500 million litres of milk will be produced in Ireland when these changes come into effect.  This was an outstanding achievement given the alignment of forces on the Council.  I am particularly pleased that our farmers and processors now have policy clarity and can plan their investments with a greater degree of certainty about the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2300">As regards market support schemes, in essence, the key market management mechanisms that are most important to Ireland have been left completely unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_2301">I also was successful in obtaining the option of using funds from the National Reserve together with unused monies from the Single Farm Payment funds allocated annually to Ireland, to target at specific vulnerable sectors.  There is approximately €7 million available in the National Reserve and I secured agreement to use these funds with effect from 2009.  Under the final agreement, we will also have access to additional funds of the order of €25 million annually from unspent funds from 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2302">The funds can be used to address specific economic disadvantages affecting farmers in the dairy, beef and veal, sheep and goat and rice sectors.  I persuaded the Commission to expand the scope of these measures to include economically vulnerable sectors irrespective of their geographical location.  I recently announced details of my decision to allocate the €7 million becoming available this year to the sheep sector, specifically in the form of an Uplands sheep payment to be paid this year to eligible farmers.  In the region of 14,000 hill sheep farmers stand to benefit from this payment.  As regards the funding available from 2010 I am currently examining proposals for the use of these funds and having regard to the provisions of the regulations and my objective of putting these monies to the most effective and efficient use for the development of Irish agriculture I will be making further announcements over the next few weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2303">Simplification is another area where I am pleased with the progress achieved and the commitment secured from the Commission and the Council as regards further simplification.  The details of the simplification measures resulting from the Health Check have been well documented and I am continuing to press for even further reduction of the administrative burden for farmers and administrations alike.  To this end I and a number of my counterparts from other Member States have submitted proposals to the Commission for consideration and in addition the issue is on the agenda for the forthcoming Council of Ministers meeting next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_2304">As to modulation, the rate has been increased by 5%.  I would have preferred if no additional modulation was agreed.  However, this was one element of the negotiations on which Commissioner Fischer Boel was particularly determined.  I am satisfied that we succeeded in getting the rate of additional modulation considerably reduced from the original proposals.  It is worth noting that over 50,000 Irish farmers will be exempt from this increase and I have ensured that all the funds raised can be passed straight back to Irish farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2305">In this context an additional amount of €120 million approximately over a four year period, will be available for distribution under the Rural Development Programme.  As in the case of the unspent funds, decisions on spending will be taken on the basis of the regulatory requirements and with the aim of achieving the optimum outcome for the development of Irish agriculture.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_2307">There has been contact with the European Commission at Ministerial and official level in relation to support for energy crop cultivation.  Under the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), farmers who cultivate energy crops can benefit from the Single Farm Payment and the EU Energy Crops Scheme, which pays farmers a premium worth €45 per hectare.  My Department has supported participation in the EU Energy Crops Scheme by offering farmers an additional €80 per hectare national premium to grow energy crops.  We have also supported EU efforts to increase production of biomass crops following the decision in 2007 to recognize support for willow and miscanthus establishment within the framework of the Single Payment regime.  My Department subsequently introduced a Bioenergy Scheme in 2007 to provide farmers with grants of €1,450 per hectare to establish these crops.  In the recent Health Check review of the CAP, we supported the Commission proposal to recognize support for biomass crop production under the Rural Development pillar.</p>
            <p eId="para_2308">Apart from these support measures, EU and National policy targets to increase the use of renewable energy and tackle climate change can help to stimulate the energy crops sector.  For example, the EU target of 10% penetration of renewable energy in transport fuel by 2020 should encourage demand for biofuel feedstocks produced from energy crops.  Efforts to reduce greenhouse gases in the agriculture sector can also provide a stimulus.  Energy crops can make a positive contribution to greenhouse gas abatement by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, similar to afforestation.  They also displace the use of fossil fuels in heat, power and transport markets.  My Department is supporting research into energy crops under the Research Stimulus Fund to assess the contribution of energy crops to greenhouse gas abatement.  A vibrant energy crops industry in Ireland could provide farmers with additional income streams and complement broader energy supply and climate change reduction policies.  My Department will continue to work closely with industry stakeholders to ensure the development of the energy crops sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_2310">All such products are expected to be compliant with the specified EU Regulations.  In general, responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_2311">My Department is responsible for the operation of EU controls on imports of products of animal origin under the service contract with the FSAI and in compliance with Community rules for the hygiene of food and feed.  These rules stipulate that food products of animal origin imported from an EU source must be from approved food business establishments and be accompanied to destination by a commercial document or a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the Member State of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2312">In the case of importation from third countries products of animal origin for human consumption must have originated in a country approved by the EU for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment (with the exception of honey), be appropriately labelled and transported and must be accompanied by a veterinary health certificate in accordance with the models laid down by Community legislation.  My Department undertakes import controls in co-operation with Customs services.  Consignments from third countries must be landed at an EU approved Border Inspection Post (BIP) approved by the Food and Veterinary Office of the EU (FVO) for veterinary checks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2313">The scope of products of animal origin coming under these requirements are set out under Commission Decision No. 2007/275/EC11 Official Journal of the European Communities No. L116 of 4.5.2007 which also provides for an exemption from border inspection in the case of certain composite and specified food products comprising processed low risk animal products and plant products that nevertheless must comply with public health requirements for placing on the market.  Consignments of animal products must remain under Customs control until the BIP has authorised entry into the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_2314">Any imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination.  Where non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2315">Where there are risks to animal and public health, and in cases of animal disease outbreaks, the Community introduces safeguard measures banning or restricting imports until the risks have been removed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2316">The FVO monitors and inspects each Member State controls on Food Safety including the operation of BIPs to ensure the conditions for import and placing of animal products on to the market, as provided under the harmonized legislation, are being correctly applied.</p>

            <p eId="para_2323">Audits by the European Commission and the European Court of Auditors in 2007 and 2008 indicated that, in the auditors' view, my Department's systems for the administrative checking of REPS applications were defective in some significant respects.  Revised systems were put in place during 2008 to meet the auditors' requirements and as a result it was not possible to complete the administrative checking of 2007 and 2008 REPS applications until early in 2009.  The 75% payment has now been paid in most cases and the balance will be paid shortly.

The position up to the end of March was as follows: 96% of valuation  payments were made within 3 weeks of receipt of all the required documentation and over 99% were made within 8 weeks. In the case of the other supplementary compensation schemes (Income Supplement, Depopulation and Hardship Grant), 98% of payments were made  within 3 weeks of receipt of the required documentation and over 99% were made within 8 weeks.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_2345">The AgriVision Action Plan was the Government's response to the seminal Report of the AgriVision 2015 Committee on what needed to be done to secure the optimal development of the agriculture and food industries. It contained 167 actions based on three key drivers for success, i.e. competitiveness, innovation and consumer focus.  Substantial progress has been made to date with 98% of its actions implemented. The combined effect of these and related actions has been that:</p>
            <p eId="para_2346">The value of agri-food exports increased by 17% from €7.8 billion to €9.2 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2347">The Government Asian target, of doubling food and drink exports to €400 m   by 2009 million, was reached two years ahead of target.</p>
            <p eId="para_2348">Exports of Irish beef to the EU rose from 145,000 tonnes in 2005 to 245,000 tonnes in 2008, with 95% of beef exports destined for the high-value EU markets, compared to over 50% in 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2349">Capital funding was provided for both the dairy and beef /sheepmeat sectors to increase efficiencies in processing and improve their market sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">A new milk quota trading scheme was implemented from 2006 onwards to facilitate quota transfers and to contribute to more competitive milk production.  Testing of milk constituents was extended to include milk protein.</p>
            <p eId="para_2351">Participation in the beef quality assurance scheme increased from 4,000 to 22,000 producers while lamb producers also increased their involvement in their QA scheme from 3,750 to 7,000 participants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2352">The implementation of the wide range of actions in the AV2015 Action Plan has strengthened significantly the sustainability and competitiveness of the agri-food industry and has enabled it more successfully compete on the global markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2353">Addressing the industry's capacity to compete successfully at home and overseas has assumed a new urgency and my belief is that a new development plan for the period to 2020 is required to maintain the impetus gained from the Agri-Vision 2015 strategy. My Department has already started the preparatory work on this plan which is focusing on the opportunities arising from a growing international food and energy crop markets, the challenges from the global economic downturn, currency fluctuations, climate change and the critical issue of competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_2354">Beef</p>
            <p eId="para_2355">As regards the beef sector the development of non-price strategies is fundamental to meeting evolving market challenges. To this end, and in line with the Agri Vision 2015 Action Plan, a number of policy initiatives have been developed and enhanced.  These include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2356">A Capital Investment Aid Scheme aimed at increasing value added and increased efficiencies for the beef and sheepmeat industries at processing level;</p>
            <p eId="para_2357">a nationally funded Suckler Welfare Scheme aimed at improving animal welfare and contributing to the improved quality and viability of suckler herds;and</p>
            <p eId="para_2358">a Beef Forum to examine the various issues arising in the sector and to consider appropriate responses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2359">In addition, Bord Bia is intensifying its promotional measures to publicise the positive response of the beef industry to an ever-evolving market.  These initiatives complement and underpin the existing quality assurance schemes and the advances in breed improvement being developed by ICBF.</p>
            <p eId="para_2360">Sheepmeat</p>
            <p eId="para_2361">The Sheep Industry Development Strategy Group set out a series of recommendations covering areas such as production, research, advice, processing and marketing. The objective is to facilitate the development of a more profitable sheep sector in Ireland covering production, processing and marketing. Most of the recommendations in the Report fall to be implemented by the industry itself and of their nature will take time for their effects to be seen. My Department is playing its part by providing assistance for breeding, processing facilities, mechanical grading and quality assurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2362">Other aspects of the Group's report are also being pursued and sheep farmers are major beneficiaries of various schemes being operated by my Department. Under REPS 4, a new mixed grazing measure is specifically targeted at them.  I decided to allocate some €7 million of additional funds available to Ireland under the National Reserve this year to hill sheep farmers, in the form of an Uplands Sheep Payment.  It is estimated that approximately 14,000 hill sheep farmers will benefit from this payment.  The downward trend in lamb consumption in certain markets presents a real challenge. To address this, Bord Bia is collaborating with its French and British counterparts on a 3 year generic lamb promotion on the French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2363">Pigmeat</p>
            <p eId="para_2364">Teagasc has prepared a development strategy for the Irish pig industry, which identifies the issues facing the sector and makes certain recommendations. The ‘Pig Industry Strategy Steering Group', which includes representation from my Department and all sectors of the industry, has been established for the purpose of furthering those recommendations. This group will identify, prioritise and promote actions needed to ensure a viable sustainable future for the pig sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2365">Following on from the dioxin incident, it remains important to re-assure markets as to the safety and quality of Irish pigmeat. Bord Bia has put in place a number of relevant marketing and promotion initiatives.  On the Irish market, a series of promotional campaigns are in operation and focus on building awareness and loyalty to the Bord Bia Quality Mark. These underline the quality of Irish pigmeat and communicate its origin. A customer reassurance programme is continuing in export markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2366">Poultry</p>
            <p eId="para_2367">It is my policy that this industry should develop to its full potential and be in a position to meet the demands of today's consumers and withstand the very strong competition from abroad.  The Poultry Expert Group was set up to review the main factors impacting on the poultry and eggs industry and draw up relevant action points. The group was comprised of various industry players including producers, processors, packers, feed suppliers, relevant State bodies etc. The final report of the Group contains recommendations concerning such matters as poultrymeat labelling, animal welfare, environment protection and feedingstuffs. My Department will be implementing the recommendations relevant to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2368">Dairy Sector</p>
            <p eId="para_2369">My Department provided funding of €114 million towards investment in dairy processing and a total of 19 capital investment projects were approved and awarded Government grant assistance under the Fund, which will generate an estimated capital spend of €286 million at full production. The purpose of the Fund is to increase the efficiency of the main dairy outputs  by supporting the upgrading of plant and buildings. This will assist operators in capturing new business in global markets and in developing new value added products. Some of those projects have already been completed and others are progressing to the implementation phase, which will continue during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2370">Milk Quotas</p>
            <p eId="para_2371">Reducing costs and increasing scale means getting more milk quota into the hands of active and committed producers at the lowest possible cost.  This is being achieved through the Milk Quota Trading Scheme, which has now completed its third year of operation and has been responsible for the transfer of 375 million litres of milk quota to active and progressive dairy farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2372">At EU level, I think it is generally accepted that last November's Health Check agreement was a very positive one from a milk perspective. The decision to increase quotas by 1% each year from 2009 to 2014 ahead of abolition in 2015 was a good outcome, given the wide divergence of views among Member States. In addition, the increased milk deliveries that will be possible as a result of the downward adjustment in the butterfat co-efficient represent the equivalent of a further 2% rise in quotas in 2009. When the 2% quota increase in 2008 is taken into account, the result is a cumulative increase of 9.3% in Ireland's milk quota by 2014.  I was also able to secure a very positive outcome in relation to market instruments, with all of the measures of highest importance to Ireland retained unaltered. These included intervention and private storage aid for butter, and the retention of the intervention quantity limits of 30,000 tonnes for butter and 109,000 tonnes for SMP.</p>
            <p eId="para_2373">Again on the domestic front, a complete overhaul of the milk quota regime was conducted in 2008, leading to the replacement of SI 94/2000 with SI 227/2008, with effect from 1 April 2008.  The new regulations greatly simplify the quota regime and bring the legislative framework into line with modern farming realities. They include the elimination of unnecessary bureaucracy, the provision of greater flexibility in the transfer of quotas, and the introduction of new rules for the operation of Milk Production Partnerships that remove obstacles to partnership formation and encourage new entrants to dairying.</p>
            <p eId="para_2374">Most recently, I announced the allocation key for the first of the five annual 1% milk quota increases agreed under the Health Check. Three-quarters of the increase will be allocated to all active milk producers on a permanent, saleable basis, and the remaining 0.25% (approx. 13.5 million litres) will be allocated to new entrants to dairying on a scale (200,000 litres per successful applicant) designed to achieve viability from the outset. I made this move because I believe that the extent of the quota increases in 2009 presents a real opportunity to allow new entrants to get a start in dairying on a scale that is immediately viable, and I do not think we should let that opportunity pass.</p>

            <p eId="para_2391">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements and in view of the ominous financial circumstances that we are facing I am not in a position to reverse any of the decisions taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_2392">Teacher allocations to all second-level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  In accordance with these rules each school is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.  The deployment of teaching staff, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the Board of Management of the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2393">In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e. curricular concessions.  This concession is available as a short term support to enable essential curricular provision to continue.  An application for curricular concessions was received in my Department from the school referred to by the Deputy.  The school has been notified of the outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_2394">The allocation processes also include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against their allocation of teachers.  It is open to the school in question to submit an appeal to an independent Appeal Board which was established specifically to adjudicate on appeals on staffing allocations in post-primary schools.  The school in question has appealed the decision to the independent Appeal Board.  The school will be notified of the outcome in due course.  This Board operates independently of my Department.  Discrete allocations are also made to schools to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties for example.</p>
            <p eId="para_2395">Following the Government decision on the moratorium on promotions in the Public Service my Department issued a circular to all schools indicating that with effect from 27 March, 2009 schools may no longer make any appointment to a post of responsibility including those that may have fallen vacant on or before 27 March, 2009.  This Circular 0022/2009 is available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2396">It is a matter for the school authority to re-organise and prioritise the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the context of implementing this moratorium.  Under the revised arrangements schools may continue to fill posts of Principal and Deputy Principal.  The Government decision provides for an exception in respect of the first allocation of posts of responsibility in new schools.</p>

The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the revised schedule for 2009/10.</p>
            <p eId="para_2399">In terms of the position at individual primary school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.  The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_2400">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009.  As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website.  This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts.  It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2401">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_2402">I understand that the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy has indicated to the Primary Allocations Section of my Department its intention to submit an application on developing school grounds.  Based on the information supplied to date it is expected that the school will retain the post referred to by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2404">I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding for a new school project. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band rating of 1.1.</p>
            <p eId="para_2405">Following a site examination it was established that additional land is required to extend the existing Gaelscoil site to facilitate the proposed building project of a 16 classroom school.  My Department is liaising with the neighbouring Community School with regard to a proposed land transfer to achieve an extended Gaelscoil site.</p>
            <p eId="para_2406">When the issue of the site has been resolved, the progression of this project, as with all large scale building projects, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</p>

Recruitment of these psychologists is currently underway from an existing panel of qualified Personnel and upon its depletion discussions will commence between my Department and the Public Appointments Service in relation to the establishment of a new panel in this regard.  The number envisaged will, upon realisation, enable the expansion of the NEPS service to all schools in the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_2412">A Notification of Intention to apply for recognition of a new primary school in the Athlone area has been received from the Patron Body for Educate Together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2413">I have recently announced a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools under the Commission on School Accommodation. It is expected that the review of procedures for recognising primary schools will be completed and revised arrangements will be in place within a two year time frame.</p>
            <p eId="para_2414">In the interim it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except in areas where the increases in pupils numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the provision of new schools. This means that new schools will not be established for reasons unrelated to demographic growth in areas where there is already sufficient school accommodation or where increases can be catered for by extending existing school accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2415">The Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards and Athlone will be included in this process.  Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.</p>

My Department has no role in relation to  processing applications for enrolment in schools. Where a school refuses to  enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary  General of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2423">Where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>
