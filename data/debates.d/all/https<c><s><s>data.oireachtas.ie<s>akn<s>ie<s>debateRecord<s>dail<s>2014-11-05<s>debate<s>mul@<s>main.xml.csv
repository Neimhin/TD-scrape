As part of the package which will be announced, I presume in the next week or two, will the tax relief be provided at source? What is the overall position of Irish Water? Is it on or off balance sheet? It seems very much that next year it will be on balance sheet. Will the Minister clarify these very important issues?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	11	A number of measures were announced on budget day to improve the overall affordability of water charges. The objective of these supports is to assist households which pay their water bills. Following the announcement on budget day, officials from the Department are working closely with their colleagues in other relevant Departments and agencies on the development of the processes that will be employed to deliver the relief. As I stated on budget day and subsequently, we will design the measure as broadly and efficiently as possible to ensure the relief reaches all households which pay their charges. While clearly there are cost implications for the administration of any relief, it is not possible to quantify the cost of administering the relief at this stage. In the design of the relief we must be cognisant of the impact on Irish Water of EUROSTAT's market corporation test. As the Deputy is aware, the advantage of keeping Irish Water off the Government balance sheet is that the necessary investment in the water infrastructure in the country can be made by the utility without impacting on our deficit or debt targets under the Stability and Growth Pact. More generally, in terms of the impact of water charges on the public finances, as the revenue from water charges is considered to be outside government, it has no impact on general Government revenue. Savings will accrue to the Exchequer over time as a result of a lower subvention from the Exchequer. As included in the summary of budget measures, the cost of tax relief at 20% on water charges up to a maximum of €500 per annum will be €40 million in 2016. As Irish Water is considered to be outside government, expenditure by it does not impact on general Government expenditure. If tax relief was provided at source, Irish Water could fail the market corporation test and would, therefore, be classified within general government. Assuming that the operating and capital expenditure plans of Irish Water remained unchanged, the deficit would increase by between €500 million and €600 million, or 0.3 percentage points, in 2015. Separately, with regard to the impact on debt, all borrowings from third parties undertaken by Irish Water would be added to the outstanding stock of sovereign debt.

He stated providing tax relief at source would result in Irish Water failing the market corporation test. That is the issue on which we need clarity. The €533 million to be provided next year from the local government fund will be accounted for in the general Government balance and thus will be on the balance sheet of the State. Is it the Government's intention that Irish Water will be off balance sheet in 2015? To achieve this, what level of revenue does Irish Water need to generate from domestic and non-domestic customers to pass the test? Providing tax relief at source would have a number of benefits. People would receive the benefit upfront and it would avoid them having to go to the hassle of submitting tax returns. If those who will pay water charges in 2015 must submit a claim the following year, they would not receive the full benefit of the tax relief until the full following year. The main issue is the market corporation test. Will the Minister explain the Government's position on it? What level of revenue does Irish Water need to raise from domestic and non-domestic customers next year to pass the test and remain off balance sheet?

As it is not possible to run proposals by them and obtain an adjudication, we are operating without the degree of certainty the Deputy has requested in his question. My advice is a deduction at source would bring about a situation where probably only the net amount would be taken as a contribution. Consequently, while I cannot be absolute about it, there is a risk that Irish Water would fail the market test and everything would be on balance sheet if the deduction were to made at source.

The Minister has overall responsibility for Revenue and needs to clarify the position on this matter. Because of the way Irish Water has been established as a commercial State company it is not open to the Revenue Commissioners to act as a debt collection agent for a commercial State company. Will the Minister clarify once and for all whether Revenue will in any way be involved in the collection of water charges?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	15	As the Deputy is aware, the entire issue of Irish Water and the policy underpinning it is being revisited by the Government and there will be an announcement next week or in the next couple of weeks by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. The re-examination is taking place with three principles in mind: to provide certainty about the bills people will face for water supply; the affordability issue - the Government is examining the situation to ensure whatever charge is applied will be affordable by the generality of households; and, for the reasons outlined by the Deputy, the fact that we would like to keep it off balance sheet because there would be an easier funding arrangement. As the money dedicated to Irish Water will be spent, it is not a question of extra money being spent. It is not even a question of having extra taxes to raise it; rather, it is how to account for the investment in Irish water. The potential effects of being on balance sheet are that the deficit would go up and the debt would increase. These are the considerations and we are proceeding on that basis.

My question is on the Finance Bill and mortgages.While the Bill contains a measure dealing with the DIRT applied to those saving to buy premises, one of the Government's major commitments was the mortgage guarantee scheme. On 27 May, the Minister stated: "I will do an economic analysis on the subject matter of the question, and if I think it can improve supply, I will take action in the Finance Bill; if I think it will not, I will not." The Central Bank issued guidelines on 20% deposits and so on, but what is the Government's policy on a mortgage guarantee? It is important that we know now so that we can feed into the Central Bank's consultation process with accurate information.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	19	As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank of Ireland has published a consultation paper regarding macro-prudential measures for residential mortgage lending. The measures as set out in the consultation document would place restrictions on the loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios that banks can apply when lending for house purchases. They would apply to all lending in Ireland by regulated firms. The Central Bank has indicated that the primary objective of these measures is to increase the resilience of the banking and household sectors to the property market and to try to reduce the risk of bank credit and house price spirals developing in the future. The specific measures proposed for principal dwelling houses are to restrict new lending to a limit of 80% of the value of the property and a maximum of three and a half times gross income. The Central Bank has also stated that banks will be able to lend, in some instances, above these thresholds. However, any lending in excess of the loan-to-value ratio must be limited to no more than 15% of the value of new loans issued and, in respect of exceeding the loan-to-income ratio, to no more than 20% of the value of new loans. Other exemptions will also be available in certain circumstances. I recognise the Central Bank's prudential responsibility and its role in proposing measures to strengthen the financial system. As these particular measures are new proposals in an Irish context, I welcome the fact that the bank is engaging in a public consultation process on them. While there will no doubt be discussion about the precise calibration and thresholds adopted at a particular point in time, macro-prudential rules in the mortgage credit area would nevertheless send a further signal that Ireland has learned from the financial crisis and is putting the architecture in place to prevent a repeat of the crisis. While it is important that credit be available to meet necessary economic and social objectives, it will also be important to ensure that future credit extension is provided on a more sustainable basis. The Deputy also referred to a mortgage guarantee scheme. My Department is committed under the Construction 2020 strategy to examining the concept of a mortgage insurance scheme and how it might benefit new housing completions in the market. The objective of any such scheme would be to help ensure adequate availability of mortgage finance on affordable terms for new completions, particularly for first-time buyers, as the economy recovers. Of particular interest would be the means by which such schemes could support greater levels of investment in new housing, with the associated benefits for the construction sector and, ultimately, the consumer. To further assist the evaluation and consideration of such a measure, I recently wrote to the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Twomey, with a request that the committee consider the matter of mortgage insurance in an Irish context and, drawing on the experiences of other countries, prepare a report on the issue. It is considered that the committee would be a most qualified and appropriate forum to conduct such an examination. Additionally, the Deputy will be aware that budget 2015 contains a number of measures to support a well-functioning housing market. In order to support first-time buyers in saving towards a deposit for their first homes, DIRT will be refunded in respect of savings up to a maximum of 20% of the purchase price. This measure will run until the end of 2017.

As a member of that committee, I am sure it will do that work as diligently and as speedily as possible. However, we need to get to the core of the Government's position at this moment. The finance committee's reports on mortgage arrears have not been implemented. The key issue is that the Central Bank has voiced its opinion on 80% loan-to-value mortgages and asked for submissions. It is important that we know the Government's thinking on a mortgage guarantee scheme. For example, would a scheme only guarantee loans within the 80% limit or would it extend to 90%? How would defaulters be pursued? Would the Government, which would have taken on some of the risk, pursue them? What fees would be applied? Crucially, in terms of the consultation process, we need to know the Government's position. Given the Minister's statement of 27 May, has an economic analysis been conducted by his Department? Is there any intention to introduce a mortgage guarantee measure in the Finance Bill or is it being left to the finance committee to produce a report that the Minister will consider?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	21	There has been a great deal of concern about the lack of supply of houses, particularly in the Dublin area, in recent months. The situation has changed dramatically since many of the Deputies rightly advised me of ghost estates all over the country and an oversupply of unoccupied houses. The pendulum has swung rapidly and now there is a distinct lack of supply in the Dublin area. The Government's Construction 2020 policy raised the issue of the guarantee that is the subject matter of the Deputy's question. I committed to reviewing it and we are processing that, but events have been overtaken somewhat by the initiative of the Central Bank, acting independently, in making proposals of a prudential nature confining mortgages to 80% with some exceptions. However, we must remember that the bank is engaged in a consultative process and has not yet established its policy. Like other participants, the Department of Finance will make a submission to the Central Bank setting out our position. In principle, the guarantee is a good idea. The best operating guarantee that I have encountered - there may be others - is the one in Canada. In simple terms, its prudential rules apply to mortgages of up to 80%, but one needs to be insured if one borrows beyond that level, with the insurance provided by the private sector. One must insure back to the first Canadian dollar - in our case, the first euro - rather than just the excess piece. I would like the all-party advice of the finance committee, because party politics should not be involved. It is a question of getting it right and ensuring that we assist purchasers, particularly first-time buyers and young couples who want to buy homes.

I appreciate the Minister's clarity, but can I take it that, regarding the Central Bank's consultation process on 80% loan-to-value mortgages, we should not assume it will be okay because the Government will introduce a 10% guarantee scheme to raise the ratio to 90%, as suggested in some media? We need clarity. Should we focus on the 80% ratio or will the Government come in through the back or side door to increase the ratio via a guarantee scheme? From the Minister's answer, it is clear that the latter is not the stated intention. He is saying that we should take the Central Bank's proposal at face value and decide whether 80% is an appropriate figure, because no other attempt to increase the ratio will be made by the Government. It has been suggested that the Government might do otherwise.

I have stated a number of times that I do not want our economic model to revert to a boom-and-bust one. Unlimited lending of excessive mortgages is part of the fuel that fires a boom-and-bust model. Obviously, I am in favour of initiatives that obviate that danger. I have certain views about the Central Bank's guidelines, but I will make a submission through the Department of Finance to the Central Bank, which is independent, as part of the consultation process. In principle, I am in favour of a guarantee scheme, but it would not be a reaction to the Central Bank's guidelines. Rather, it would be separate. Had there been a guarantee scheme in recent years, people would not be in mortgage difficulty now. If they were unable to pay excessive mortgages, there would have been an insurance scheme to pick up the deficit for them. However, this should not be a State system. The private sector is active enough to provide a scheme.Models operating elsewhere suggest that between 0.6% and 1% would be added to the interest rate to give a guarantee for large mortgages. That might be a prudent control. One would get a higher mortgage but one would pay for it through an insurance scheme. Then one would have all the benefits of the security that affords. I would genuinely like to hear the views of the Deputies opposite at a meeting of the finance committee to determine whether we can arrive at the best position. Then we will go ahead and do it.

Much of the anger is centred on the cumulative impact not only of direct taxation but also of indirect taxation and charges. If the Government is listening to what the people expressed on the streets at the weekend, as it says it is, will it do something about the cumulative impact of all the measures that drove so many people onto the streets?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	26	I thank the Deputy for his question. The period from 2008 to the present saw one of the largest and longest periods of fiscal adjustment in the history of the State. The budget deficit in 2011, when the Government came to power, was unacceptably large and unsustainable, at an underlying level of 8.6% of GDP. In budget 2015, I set a deficit target for 2015 of 2.7% of GDP. Reflecting this progress in reducing the deficit, our debt burden is now firmly on a downward trajectory, with forecasts indicating that it will fall below 100% of GDP after 2017. Reflecting these improvements, our credit rating has seen repeated upward revisions by ratings agencies. A consolidation of such scale necessarily resulted in a drop in living standards for all citizens of this country. Despite the enormous challenge of such an adjustment, the Government has ensured that the richest in society bore their fair share of the burden and that the poor and most vulnerable were protected as far as was possible. The latest research from the ESRI on the distributional impacts of budgets for the period 2009 to 2015 shows that the top quintile bore the largest burden of income tax and welfare changes over the period, with income losses of approximately 13% to 14%. The impacts on those in lower quintiles were all in the region of 10%. This reflects the Government's firm commitment to make sure those who could afford to pay the most did so.  Analysis published in the budget book shows gains to all household types from budget 2015. For example, a single earner on an annual income of €25,000 will gain €174 per annum; a married one-earner couple on €35,000 will gain €174; and a married one-earner couple with two children on €55,000 will gain €626 per year. These gains reflect the Government's commitment to helping those on lower and middle incomes. Analysis of the taxation measures in the budget based on the ESRI SWITCH tax-benefit model indicates that all household deciles will gain from the income tax measures in budget 2015. Some of these gains arise from the increase in the exemption threshold for the universal social charge, USC, which had the effect of removing lower-income people from liability for the charge. This is the second time the Government has done this. This means that all individuals with income below €12,012 will be entirely exempt from the USC. The Government also reduced the lower USC rates and increased the thresholds, delivering further benefits to those on lower incomes and ensuring fairness. At the same time, the benefits for any individual from the income tax package were capped by introducing a new higher rate of USC for high-income individuals, thus maintaining the progressivity of the system and ensuring that those on high incomes did not benefit over and above what is fair.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 These changes occur against the backdrop of Ireland's having one of the most progressive income tax systems in the OECD. Cognisant of the effect of indirect taxes on living standards, especially for those on lower incomes, this budget contained limited changes to indirect taxes. The increase in excise on cigarettes is motivated by the negative health outcomes of smoking, and the main increase in indirect tax revenue resulted from a technical change whereby VAT is charged for cross-Border EU telecommunications, broadcasting and electronically supplied services. The tax measures outlined are designed not only to extend the recovery across the economy but also to strengthen the recovery for the future. These reductions in tax have the effect of increasing the reward from employment. They lower the cost of employing people, which will help create jobs. Indications from the ESRI HERMES macroeconomic model show that up to 15,000 jobs could be created from the reductions in labour taxation when the full effect of the tax reforms that will be introduced over the next three years is evident.  As a result of the decisions made by the Government and the emphasis we have placed on minimising the negative effects on economic growth from fiscal consolidation, our country is now in recovery. My Department is forecasting growth of 4.7% of GDP in 2014 and 3.9% in 2015. On a no-policy-change basis, my Department would have forecast GDP growth in 2015 of 3.6%, but as a result of the measures outlined in the budget this has been increased to 3.9%. It is clear from the analysis demonstrating the positive distributional and growth impacts of budget 2015 that it does not need the changes the Deputy suggests.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	27	That response really demonstrates how the Minister just does not get it. He does not understand why people went out on the streets at the weekend. I will just throw his own figures back at him. Somebody earning €17,000, as mentioned by the Minister, got €173 back in the budget. Somebody earning €120,000 got €687 back, according to the budget document. The latter got almost five times more than people on the lowest incomes. Even if water charges are pitched at the figure mentioned yesterday by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton - namely, €200, which figure I doubt and which already seems to be causing great controversy in the Government - it would more than wipe out what the Government is giving back to the individual on €17,000. The person on €120,000, however, will be more than able to manage. Therefore, how can the Minister seriously say to me and, more important, the people of this country that this is fair and progressive? When the Minister adds to it the impact of rising bus fares and electricity prices, property tax, public service charges and all the other taxes and charges that disproportionately hit the less well off, can he not understand that there is nothing progressive about the way in which he is managing taxes and that tax justice is the issue at stake? He is not dealing with it in a fair way.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	28	In reply to the Deputy, I would like to make three points. As stated, we have had the greatest fiscal adjustment in the history of the State. When we went into government at the start of 2011, the deficit was over €22 billion. At the end of next year it will be less than €5 billion if our budget comes in on target. This shows the extent of the adjustment. Second, while one can have many anecdotes in these debates, one's argument must be evidence-based to establish the true position. The strongest piece of evidence is the ESRI's research. The ESRI states that those in the highest income quintile were subject to the biggest adjustments, in the order of 13% to 14%. Other quintiles were subject to an adjustment, or a loss of income, of approximately 10%. Therefore, the evidence contradicts what the Deputy is saying. There is another very fundamental fact about giving relief by reducing taxes and the USC. Those who pay most obviously have greater scope for benefiting if tax rates come down, and those who pay very little tax do not have the same potential to benefit. For example, somebody on €17,000 pays less than €600 per year in tax and USC, while somebody on €70,000, where I capped it, pays just short of €25,000. Obviously, if the pool is €25,000 as against €600, the potential when one adjusts for higher gains obviously goes with the higher income.

The Minister knows what they say about statistics. It just does not reflect the human reality that people are facing. That is what was expressed at the weekend. The OECD found last week that Ireland, out of 41 countries in the OECD, was 37th, or near the bottom of the league table, in terms of child poverty. Since 2008, child poverty has increased far more here than in almost every other country in Europe bar Latvia, Greece and Iceland. Other countries, even in the teeth of recession and adjustment, have improved with regard to child poverty. Here we have gone from 18% child poverty to 28.6%. Is that not the clearest evidence that, despite all the statistics the Minister throws around, the adverse measures he has been introducing in recent years disproportionately affect those on the lowest incomes? That is why people are on the streets expressing their rage. The Minister has to listen.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	30	If we are to develop policy according to an evidence base, then all evidence is relevant, and what the Deputy cites needs to be taken into account by people forming policies. However, the point I am making is that the worst-off people did not bear the sole burden. Everybody suffered because the level of adjustment necessary was enormous. It was unprecedented historically.I have said previously that the people who suffered the most were those who had lost their jobs. Regardless of whether their previous incomes were high or low, those who were out of work were most hit by the recession and most at risk of moving into poverty. The second group that suffered comprised those who were forced to emigrate. I do not refer to people who had jobs here who emigrated voluntarily but to individuals who, owing to economic circumstances, decided they had no choice other than to seek employment elsewhere. That is what we are trying to repair. The repair job is going very well, thank God. We have the highest growth rates in Europe. We also have the highest level of job creation in Europe and are eliminating our deficit. We will have a balanced budget in a year or two. Things are going well, but the repair job will continue. I am not claiming we have the finished article; rather, I am saying we are well on the way to recovery. We have to start looking again at societal issues, rather than just at the economy. We need to ask ourselves questions about the kind of country in which we want to live, the values the country should have and the manner in which we should look after the vulnerable. All of these are valid policy issues as the economy grows.

It seems that the thrust of the Minister's comments in response to that question was that the two issues needed to be viewed separately. He suggested the proposed Central Bank rules needed to be examined on their own merits. He also said that if a mortgage insurance scheme was introduced, it would not be designed to circumvent Central Bank rules. Will he clarify his thinking on the issue? I will elaborate on my own views.

The bank is required to consult the Minister for Finance on proposed measures in this area. It may also consult others, as it considers appropriate. Given the wide public interest in this matter, I welcome the commencement by the Central Bank of a public consultation process on its macro-prudential proposals. I normally take the opportunity to reply to such Central Bank consultation processes. As the Deputy will be aware, the deadline for providing comments for the Central Bank is 8 December next. My Department is committed, under the Construction 2020 strategy, to examining the concept of a mortgage insurance scheme and how it might benefit new housing completions in the Irish market. The objective of any such scheme would be to help to ensure the adequate availability of mortgage finance on affordable terms for new completions. To further assist the evaluation and consideration of such a measure, I recently wrote to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. I asked the committee to consider the matter of mortgage insurance in an Irish context and, drawing on the experiences of other countries, prepare a report on the issue. It is considered that the committee is the most qualified and appropriate forum to conduct such an examination. In other countries mortgage insurance schemes can operate with macro-prudential frameworks. This is recognised in the Central Bank consultation paper which asks whether some adequately insured mortgages with higher loan-to-value ratios should be exempt from the proposed measures. Obviously, this is a matter that will require discussion and consideration as part of the Central Bank's consultation process. To answer the Deputy's question precisely, they are two separate issues, but they are obviously connected. They will be connected as people debate the issue.

I would have thought a deposit of between 10% and 12% would be more realistic and achievable for people seeking to buy a home for the first time. It seems from a reply to a parliamentary question that I received last night that these rules will not apply to institutional investors. It seems that private equity funds buying portfolios of residential properties will not come under the requirements of the new Central Bank rules. That is an issue. As a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, I will play my part in examining the mortgage insurance scheme. I welcome the Minister's statement that he is in favour of private sector involvement. My own view is that, to be frank, the State has enough contingent liabilities. I would be reluctant, therefore, to allow the State to sign up to further liabilities. This proposal needs to be examined on its own merits. Will the Minister be making a submission on behalf of the Government in the coming weeks?

We are preparing one and it will not be a Government submission, rather it will be a submission by the Department of Finance in response to the Governor of the Central Bank's invitation to make a submission. It does not have to be an institutional submission. Any Deputy who has well formed views can make a submission before 8 December. Obviously, that will have influence also. The Central Bank is aware that Deputies have very close contact with their constituents. The views of Deputies are valuable when the Central Bank is considering its policy on issues such as prudential rules for mortgages. I agree that there should be rules. We can debate whether a requirement to have 20% of the mortgage would be too high. In the consultation paper there is an exception whereby a bank can lend up to 15% of its loan book in mortgages in excess of 80% of value. If there was a guarantee, it would provide for extra flexibility. While the two issues are separate and should be considered separately, there is a connection between them.

A couple buying a house in Dublin for €300,000 would be required to have €60,000 put aside, which would be really tough. It would be unachievable by many who are renting at a time when rents are increasing quickly and simply do not have the capacity to save such an amount of money. This has societal implications also. Persons from wealthy families that have access to resources and savings will be able to get around these rules. The Central Bank needs to take account of these points when it is finalising the formal proposal. Some level of deposit is good and should lead to more responsible lending, but we do not want to over-react to what has happened. A 20% minimum deposit requirement would be an over-reaction and have unintended consequences which would not necessarily be good for society.

I do not think it is necessary for a mortgage insurance scheme to apply to the full life of a 25 year mortgage. It seems that if there was insurance for the first five years, things would be well settled thereafter. If someone has paid fully for five years, the likelihood of default thereafter will decrease in normal circumstances as their career moves on, they receive extra income and their family settles. It might not be necessary to have a 25 year insurance guarantee. I would like the committee to consider whether a starter guarantee would be appropriate.

Is it true that it was clearly indicated that the Department was reassuring multinational companies that no further tax burden would be imposed on them as a result of the changes to the double Irish scheme and the new patent box proposal? Is it fair that such companies are being reassured that they will have to pay no more tax, while ordinary people are being crushed?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	38	In last month's budget I announced several changes to Ireland's corporation tax regime as part of an overall strategy to play fair and win. This included a change that will bring Ireland's company residence rules into line with those in the rest of the OECD and end the so-called double Irish scheme. This was balanced by a number of competitive enhancements contained in the roadmap for Ireland's tax competitiveness.This strategy was underpinned by extensive research undertaken and commissioned by my Department in 2014, which has now been published. One of the key findings of the research is that the FDI sector is very important for economic growth and employment in Ireland and that Ireland needs a competitive corporate tax offering to attract foreign direct investment. In particular, we need to ensure a competitive offering for knowledge-based investment which is related to research and development and intellectual property. In recognition of the fact that investment and growth in OECD economies is increasingly driven by investment in intangible assets, putting in place an attractive intellectual property offering is key for Ireland's success in attracting foreign direct investment. That is why I made a clear statement on my intention to introduce a competitive income-based regime for intangible assets in Ireland which will be called a knowledge development box, KDB. I view this as a positive measure for Ireland and my intention is that the Irish KDB will be among the best in class on offer internationally. In order to gather views from as broad a spectrum as possible on what this may entail, I will launch a public consultation process before the end of the year on how the Irish KDB should operate. As is the case with all public consultations undertaken by my Department on corporation tax, input has been welcomed from all sections of society. A number of parties came forward to give their views on the public consultation on the OECD base erosion and profit shifting process - the so-called BEPS project - from earlier this year, including groups which represented multinationals based in Ireland, political parties, non-governmental organisations and individual citizens. I expect the consultation on the KDB to be no different and encourage all interested parties to have an input into this process. It is the intention that the design of the KDB in Ireland will be along the lines of what are commonly known as patent boxes which have been in place for many years in countries which compete with us for foreign direct investment. The measures in place in our competitor jurisdictions are the subject of ongoing discussions at the OECD and EU levels as regards their compatibility with the international rules around fair tax competition. As I said in my budget announcement, it will be necessary to ensure the Irish KDB meets the standards that remain to be agreed to by both the OECD and the European Union.

Is the patent box not exactly the same because it centres on intellectual property? It is about offering further tax reductions to corporations here which pay some of the lowest levels of tax anywhere in the world. Yet again, they will be able to avoid corporation tax through this mechanism. Is this not replacing one tax avoidance scheme with another? It was reported last week that the Minister's Department was working with multinational companies and that, when in the United States, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, had met 17 leading multinationals to reassure them that the patent box scheme would not in any way penalise them in terms of having to pay a little more in tax. Is that true? Is this fair when ordinary people are being absolutely hammered?

We abolished the double Irish, which was never an invention of the Irish tax authorities. The tax avoidance arose in matching gaps in different nationalities' taxes and an advantage was gained, but it was never marketed by IDA Ireland or any other Government authority as an inducement to come to Ireland. It is being removed in the Finance Bill 2014 and we will have a chance to discuss the details in the next couple of weeks as we go through the Bill. The intention behind the knowledge box is to ensure we remain competitive. The United Kingdom, Holland, France and Spain have patent boxes and it is the intention of many other European countries to have them. Modern industry is driven largely by intellectual property. If a country is not at the races, it is not going to be seen as a location for modern industry. The intention is that an advantage will be given to companies which establish real research and development activities in the country. It is not a system to avoid tax.

Even according to Revenue's figures, they pay an effective rate of approximately 6%. How is it fair that these multinationals pay tax at 2% or 6% when the people who clean the floors in their buildings pay tax at 20% or 30%? Why is it that the Minister is consulting these multinationals and assuring them that they will not have to pay anything more when even a small extra tax contribution from them would do away with the need to introduce water charges and to have many of the crushing austerity taxes and charges he is imposing on ordinary workers? Why is it that he will not even have a serious debate on the fairness of this and look at the effective corporation tax rate and increase it for the companies in question?

It is not aimed particularly at the multinationals; therefore, I invite a submission from the Deputy along the lines of what he has spoken about, if he feels like doing so. We have consultative processes for new initiatives in the Department of Finance. That is the democratic way in which we operate. I assume IBEC, IDA Ireland and the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland will make submissions. All of these organisations are very familiar with the requirements of multinational companies. However, we live in a global world and the main actors in terms of globalisation are multinational companies. The amount of revenue generated in Ireland by any of the big multinationals is quite small. The Deputy quoted American statistics, but I would not like it if the impression was given that they were based on profits generated in Ireland. They are based on profits generated worldwide. It is in the hands of the American authorities to amend their tax laws to take a greater proportion of revenue from American multinationals.

Regardless of the decision of the European Court of Justice in the past year, does the Minister really think it is justified, in the context of a fourth regressive budget in a row, people being hammered with further austerity and unable to afford to pay water charges, to give a VAT exemption which will benefit disproportionately the better-off in society?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	44	The proposal in the Finance Bill 2014 to exempt green fees in member-owned clubs from 1 January 2015 is necessary to ensure Irish VAT law complies with the recent decision of the European Court of Justice in the Bridport & West Dorset Golf Club Limited case, reference number C-495/12. Membership fees received from members of member-owned golf clubs had already been exempt from VAT and the ECJ judgment which has direct effect in the State found that green fees received from non-members should also benefit from a VAT exemption. Prior to the ECJ judgment, green fees charged by non-profit making organisations such as member-owned clubs to visitors had been liable to VAT at the 9% reduced rate of VAT. Where a person or body supplies VAT exempt goods or services, this means that they do not charge VAT on these supplies and they are not entitled to claim input VAT on costs associated with such supplies. Until now member-owned golf clubs would have made exempt supplies on membership fees and taxable supplies on green fees charged to non-members and, as a result, would have been entitled to partial VAT input deductibility on their business costs, including on capital development projects.From 1 January 2015, however, member-owned golf clubs will be exempt from VAT on green fees and membership fees, and they will no longer have an entitlement to a credit for VAT incurred on their inputs in regard to green fees. This means the changes may have an Exchequer impact in the future and retrospectively. It is difficult to cost the impact to the Exchequer of the changes to the VAT treatment of golf fees because Ireland's simplified VAT return system means that the necessary detailed information to determine the cost of specific changes is not captured on VAT returns. However, as many golf clubs will have substantial overheads relating to capital developments, where up to now a proportion of the VAT on these costs was deductible, it is likely that the judgment will have a favourable impact on only a small number of clubs, retrospectively and in the future, and, as such, it is likely that any impact on the Exchequer will be negligible.  In addition, where VAT refunds arise, the Revenue Commissioners must consider whether the refund would unjustly enrich the club. The Revenue Commissioners have met with the Golfing Union of Ireland and have consulted with individual member-owned clubs to discuss concerns surrounding the issue of unjust enrichment. They will issue guidance on their position regarding unjust enrichment once the discussions are concluded.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	45	I am aware of the relevant case law from the European Court of Justice. However, it remains a political decision of the Government to put that into legislative effect by including it in the Finance Bill. The measure was not mentioned by the Minister in his Budget Statement. He cannot tell me the exact amount of money involved. I presume it is not a significant amount. For example, the 20% cut to the respite care grant saved the Government €25 million. Would it not be a better use of Exchequer funds to immediately reverse that cut, as people have demanded, rather than giving a VAT exemption for clubs which are, to a large degree, privileged and elitist institutions? Plenty of ordinary people play golf and I do not have a problem with that, but the entrance and annual fees of some clubs are substantial. Newlands Golf Club has an annual fee of almost €1,500, with an entrance fee of €5,000, Clontarf Golf Club has fees of over €1,000 and a joining fee of €5,000, and Dún Laoghaire Golf Club has a joining fee of €16,000. Is giving such clubs a VAT exemption or refund justified?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	46	VAT is largely driven by EU VAT directives. When the European Court of Justice makes a ruling, it applies to Ireland whether we legislate domestically or not. We have to legislate domestically to incorporate it in the body of our VAT law. This is a very minor change and the reason it was not mentioned in the Budget Statement was that it was so minor. It was in the supporting documents for the budget.  Before any announcement was made, VAT was not paid on membership. Members of golf clubs were not liable for VAT on their membership fees. Visitors to golf clubs were charged VAT on green fees and the ruling of the European Court of Justice is that they should also be exempt. That is a disadvantage to many golf clubs because, while there was a small return on VAT from visitors paying green fees, member-owned golf clubs had the capacity to reclaim VAT for inputs. If a member-owned golf club spent €500,000 on upgrading a golf club, it was able to claim back the VAT, which was charged at 9%. Now, as a quid pro quo, golf clubs will no longer be able to do that. It is difficult to get statistics on this, but I have received advice from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners that the influence on the Exchequer will be negligible and one balances the other. It is a very minor issue and there is no big gift to golfers coming from the change. The measure is simply to comply with a ruling of the European Court of Justice. We try to be compliant and operate in accordance with the law.

What has it decided to do about refunds? It stated at that stage that it was in discussions and if there was to be a windfall for clubs it would not be given. Has it made a decision yet? If not, why not? This is important because it speaks to the nature of the budget and the taxation system. The Government likes to proclaim that we have one of the most progressive taxation systems in the world, but in doing so it speaks only about income tax and not about VAT, which is, overwhelmingly, a regressive tax. It is not a tax on luxury goods, with the result that those in the bottom 10% in our society in terms of income pay almost the same as a percentage of their total income in tax. This illustrates the regressive nature of our tax system.

As VAT is driven by EU directives, if the European Court of Justice makes a ruling, we try to amend our laws to comply with that.  On the precise question on the current position of the Revenue Commissioners, as I said in my reply, where VAT refunds arise the Revenue Commissioners must consider whether the refund would unjustly enrich the club. The Revenue Commissioners have met the Golfing Union of Ireland and have consulted with individual member-owned clubs to discuss concerns surrounding the issue of unjust enrichment. The Revenue Commissioners will issue guidance on their position regarding unjust enrichment once the discussions are concluded and that will be available publicly.

This type of funding has the potential to increase entrepreneurship as it bridges a financing gap for many micro-enterprises and fosters a more engaged investor community whose expertise can help micro-enterprises. Delivering on action No. 217 of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, officials in my Department are working with stakeholders involved in SME finance on a number of non-bank financing initiatives, of which crowdfunding is one, so that the optimum mix of SME finance products can be established as soon as possible. The SME State bodies group, which is chaired by my Department, hosted an SME policy day and identified crowd funding as an area that is likely to help Irish SMEs in the coming years. My officials recently facilitated meetings between the European Investment Bank and two crowdfunding organisations. In terms of supporting such alternative financing mechanisms as crowdfunding through tax incentives, it must be borne in mind that value for money and a strong justification for State intervention are key considerations. As crowdfunding is relatively new and is only currently establishing a presence in Ireland, I am inclined to consider the various available options prior to intervening with taxpayers' money in an effort to boost take-up. Private sector initiatives have their place and do not necessarily require tax reliefs in order to foster participation. The Deputy will be aware that the employment and investment incentive already provides tax relief for investments of medium-term risk capital in qualifying SMEs.

The justification for State intervention is job creation. Some private companies can point to just under 1,000 new jobs created in the past two years. I acknowledge the significant progress made by Microfinance Ireland over the past four months in terms of reforming and sharpening up its role. What timeframe has the Minister given to his own Department to conclude these negotiations and come forward with a proposal which might hit the marketplace? Might we see some sort of Government-endorsed package around crowd financing to assist the growth of potential projects?

Crowdfunding campaigns are generally funded by the general public rather than by traditional investors.Section 6.2 of the 2014 report of the entrepreneurship forum discusses crowdfunding and recommends that no action be taken by the Government until the industry establishes itself in Ireland and has had time to grow and develop. Action No. 217 of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 commits to developing proposals to support the development of alternatives to bank financing within Ireland. My officials are working with stakeholders involved in SME finance on a number of non-bank financing initiatives, of which crowdfunding is one. Our policy position so far is that it is at a very early stage and I am not disposed to encourage it at this time by providing it with a tax break. However, it is an issue we will keep under review. We have tax breaks to encourage investment in other areas.

As the Minister said, crowdfunding tends to attract smaller investors and people with smaller savings. They are entitled to a fair share of any tax incentives on offer. I welcome the progress made but I encourage the Minister to move forward as quickly as possible on this rapidly growing market. There is no reason this country should not be at the forefront.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	54	We might learn from the practice in the United Kingdom. In 2013, the UK Government commenced lending to small businesses through a peer-to-peer lending platform called Funding Circle. An initial amount of £20 million was provided through its British business bank and this has subsequently been increased to £40 million. These funds will be used to provide the final 10% of any loan to a borrower. The remaining 90% of funds must be raised through private investors. While I will not cite peer-to-peer lending specifically, the Government has a range of mechanisms in place to provide alternative sources of finance to SMEs in Ireland, such as those mentioned by the Deputy - the microfinance loan scheme, the employment and investment incentive scheme, the start-up refunds for entrepreneurs, SURE, programme, and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. Crowdfunding is something that is gaining traction in other jurisdictions, and it is worth looking at what is happening in the United Kingdom. However, while we are keeping up with what is happening, I do not have an initiative to propose yet. The Deputy may be correct in his analysis, but this is something I will keep under review.

What effect, in terms of massive benefits, will the further generous concessions the Minister provides in the Finance Bill have for highly paid individuals?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	56	As the Deputy will appreciate, predicting the cost and take-up of any new tax measure is difficult. When SARP was introduced in 2012, it was estimated that for every 100 individuals that availed of the scheme, the cost to the Exchequer would be approximately €5 million. The recent review of SARP has shown that just 12 individuals availed of the scheme in 2012 and provisional figures show that 31 individuals availed of it in 2013. As the Deputy will be aware, my officials conducted a review of the special assignee relief programme in advance of this year's budget. The review analysed aspects of the scheme such as the background and rationale for the programme and data available from the Revenue Commissioners, including the cost and take-up of the programme. In addition, a public consultation was held. A report was written on the review and this has been published on the budget website. Taking into account the review, on budget day I announced the amendments the Deputy has mentioned. Based on discussions with stakeholders, I believe that these measures are a positive step forward as part of a range of measures, forming a roadmap for securing Ireland's place as a destination for the best and most successful companies in the world.  It is not, however, possible to predict what the take-up will be. I have provided an estimated additional cost of €1 million in 2015 for the scheme. My Department and the Revenue Commissioners will keep the levels of take-up of the programme under review.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	57	The SARP was a massive tax break provided by the Government to the highest-paid executives who qualified for it. A qualifying chief executive on €500,000 a year would increase his or her take-home pay by a breathtaking €52,275 per year. The Minister had instituted a cap of €500,000, but now he is removing that cap, so that somebody on €750,000 will get not just the €52,275 I mentioned but an extra €30,750, giving an extra take-home amount of €83,000. This is an incredible inequality in our society at a time when the Minister is hammering the poorest people and middle- and low-income workers with water charges and other austerity burdens. It speaks volumes about the ethos of the Government.

Countries with a high marginal rate of income tax, such as Ireland, face a competitive disadvantage in attracting key personnel. Holland has a scheme which is even more generous than anything I am putting on the table, and the Dutch are direct competitors with us for foreign direct investment. The scheme intends to provide for start-up businesses in bringing to Ireland key people without whom the business would not take off or development of the industry would not take place. That is being done based on the advice I got. The scheme has applied to few people. In the year of introduction only 12 people took it up, and in the last year for which we have figures the initial estimate is that up to 31 people took it up. As the whole debate on international tax avoidance develops, the OECD's policy position is that the test of validity is that real economic endeavour takes place - in other words, no brass plates. If we can get key individuals in - some of the key people in multinational companies - we can prove easily that real activity is taking place in our jurisdiction.

SARP is a typical result of this. Who lobbied the Minister for this? Who are the stakeholders who wanted it? I agree that only a small number of individuals benefit, but the scheme is highly symbolic of the massive chasm between the richest in this country - people with huge take-home pay, chief executives, etc. - and those ordinary people who under austerity are getting hammered on a daily basis. Where is the break for those people, given that the Minister is attempting to wipe out with a water tax whatever minuscule concessions were given in the budget?

Many people made submissions when we opened the consultative process, but principal among them were the IDA, the American Chamber of Commerce, IBEC, and the tax practitioners and big firms that represent foreign direct investment here. These made their submissions and we made a judgment. We also get submissions from people who do not have expertise in the area but who have strong opinions on these matters, and we take these into account. The objective is to have more foreign direct investment in the country so that more jobs are created. I do not disagree with the Deputy that the model in Ireland has been lopsided. Not enough attention has been given to growing indigenous industry into multinational industry.However, the Deputy will notice that is not true of this Administration and that in every Finance Bill we have concentrated on agriculture and food and tourism which we are growing into major industries, even bigger than they historically were. I will continue to do this. While foreign direct investment is very important, the growth of indigenous industry with deep roots in Irish society is equally important.

Like the previous one, as I said on previous occasions, it is unfair and contains harsh cuts. However, what has since been in the minds of the people, as we saw clearly and as was evident last Saturday, and what the budget cannot be divorced from is the issue of water charges. While the Government claims that water charges are not part of budget 2015, the reality for families is that they are very much part of it and this is a further austerity measure coming down the road. The Minister has tried to provide sweeteners for the public who are simply saying enough is enough, that they will not pay his charges and that they want them scrapped. He has suggested tax credits will be available for those who have tax liabilities and those who do not. On budget day he announced measures which he said would allow for a maximum tax credit of €100 to be received by those with a tax liability. However, it is bizarre, given the number of officials involved, Cabinet meetings, sub-committee meetings and Economic Management Council meetings and the fact that Irish Water and water charges has been the burning issue in the State for many months that he left out tens of thousands of families from the scheme. Three weeks have since passed and we still do not have clarity on his tax credit proposal. It does not appear in the Finance Bill and he has not indicated, unless I missed it in his Second Stage speech, that it will be brought forward by way of an amendment on Committee Stage. This reduces and curtails debate. We had a discussion earlier about the fact that as a result of Members not turning up on time this morning the amount of time we had available at Question Time to hold the Government to account was restricted. Similarly, by the Minister and the Government not getting their act together in bringing forward the amendment on tax credits to off-set water charges we are allowed less time for scrutiny. We will not be able to deal with the issue at the finance committee and will not have sight of the Government's proposal before we have to propose Committee Stage amendments. This is simply not the way to do politics. I ask the Minister to confirm whether he has sought the approval of the Attorney General or the Cabinet for a proposal of this nature. It is very clear that the Government is scrambling frantically to try to appease a certain group of individuals. I tell the Minister clearly that it is not going to work. I believe he is around here long enough to know members of the public have had enough. They are not going to buy into tax credits for water charges that they simply do not want. They are not going to buy into sweeteners from the Minister for Social Protection to off-set the charges. They are not going to buy into an extension of fixed rate charges. I was proud to be standing with people in Donegal at one of the biggest rallies held. There were 10,000 people in the market square in Donegal, while another 1,000 turned out in Lifford, as well as about 4,000 in Ballyshannon, and none of them had a placard demanding tax credits or flat rate charges or clarity. What they did demand was that the water charges be scrapped. Unless it listens to this demand, the Government will go down with the charges. The Minister knows that over 200,000 took to the streets last weekend. He bravely says this was the last sting of a dying wasp, or words to that effect - as the people will have their day, let them go out and it will all fizzle away - but I am telling him that they are determined. They are determined to travel in numbers to the capital city on 10 December to show him that they are not giving up the fight. Despite all of the pressures on them in travelling long distances, they will be here and we will be with them. I hope they will prove the Minister wrong and that he will show a little more humility in understanding where they are at, that they are simply at the end of their tether, that they cannot take this additional austerity measure and that any repackaged water charge will simply not wash with them. This week, at the presidential dinner, the Taoiseach said that without water charges, the tax rate at which some would have to pay would go up by 4%. We have had other Ministers say child benefit would have to be reduced. This is scaremongering and a sign of desperation on the part of a desperate Government that is simply out of touch with the people. The comments of the Taoiseach confirm at least one thing, namely, that there are alternatives to water charges, if the Government wanted to pursue them. However, an increase of 4% in the marginal rate of tax is not one of them. In a letter to a Fine Gael colleague of the Minister he said that if Irish Water was to be on the State's books, it would cost an extra €550 million in 2015, reducing to some €500 million in 2016. The demand is where the Minister would get the €550 million needed and how he would raise it while reaching the deficit target. The Minister knows well that the deficit target the Government intends to reach in 2015 is 2.7% and that the deficit to be reached under the rules is just below 3%. Therefore, he knows that we have headroom of about €570 million in order to be below the 3% figure. These facts are indisputable, although the Minister is shaking his head.

#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	85	I will come to that figure. Let us be clear: it is indisputable that there is headroom of €570 million for us in order to be below the 3% deficit target. Therefore, if Irish Water were to be included in the State's books, that figure could be absorbed. As the Minister rightly said, there would then be the issue of the €300 million to be raised in domestic charges.How would the Minister fund that? If it were to come out of additional spending, it would bring us over the deficit target. First of all, the €300 million is not €300 million, because if the Government scrapped water charges there would be no need for its tax relief off-setting water charges and no need for the household package to assist families who simply cannot pay, so the figure comes down to below €200 million in the first instance. If the Minister did not reduce income taxes from 41% to 40%, he could cope with today with no scaremongering about income tax going up by 4% and taking child benefit from vulnerable families and children. There would be none of that nonsense that this desperate Government is trying to peddle.  That is not the Minister's only option. He has other options for finding that €200 million within the scope of other budgetary proposals, and we have suggested a number of them to him. However, he has decided not to do this. SARP is an absolute tax benefit to a handful of individuals. Let us be clear about this. A total of 12 individuals benefited from the scheme in 2012, while 31 benefited in 2013. It is a handful of individuals who an earn an unlimited amount of money, and their income will be reduced by 30% for tax purposes, giving them not thousands but tens of thousands of euro in write-downs, because they come here and the Minister thinks they are special. He believes that this will cost another €1 million. There is no limit on the type of money that the Government can throw at this handful of individuals. A person can claim for their or their children's educational fees and their flights to and from their home countries. Since they were not happy with €500,000, if people earn €1 million in this State, they can have that figure less €75,000. They can have 30% of that taken away from the tax man when they are calculating their tax. It is an absolute disgrace. At the same time and in the same breath, the Government tells families who simply do not have any money left at the end of the week that they must tighten their belts and pay up for the sins of others in the past through water charges, the property tax, prescription charges and a range of other charges.  The Minister needs to stop the scaremongering on this and get down to fair ways of funding water services. There are other ways of doing it which should be examined in respect of keeping Irish Water off the national accounts. In respect of questions that we have put to the Minister - I have submitted another one and I hope the Minister and his officials will be transparent with the figures - I have looked at every single question that has been asked by every Deputy in this House about the cost of Irish Water, and it is clear as mud. This Government is unwilling to give clear figures in tabular form in respect of the costs associated with Irish Water, the sources of income, the sources of expenditure and the categorisation of that expenditure. I will try once more. I have submitted a parliamentary question and I hope the Minister will ensure that his Department officials and the Government provide that information in a fair and transparent way.  What is telling after three years of stagnation and recession is that when the Government found some leeway, its instinct was to cut income taxes - income taxes for the highest earners. Its instinct was not to scrap the tax on the family home or to restore the respite care grant or funding to the National Disability Authority. Its instinct was to give it in a way that exponentially favours those who earn more. That is clear from the figures that are there. People in this House who earn, at a minimum, over €80,000 - I am not including staff - will get multiples of what someone on the minimum wage earns in this tax relief. Ministers and the Taoiseach earn far more than elected Members. Perhaps people in this House are under pressure - perhaps they over-borrowed or stretched themselves too far - but we are not the most needy in society. The people who must go to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to ask for food to put on their table, who struggle to put clothes on their kids when they return to school or who are worried about what will happen in the next six weeks as they start to prepare for Christmas are the people who should be getting the tax breaks in this budget. But no, the Government has decided to provide the most benefit for the wealthiest in society.  I welcome changes to USC levels and thresholds in the Finance Bill. Sinn Féin would have gone further and removed all those earning the minimum wage from the USC tax net, but I welcome the fact that this is the second time the Government has done this. We will continue to pursue this issue and hopefully, through our persistence, the Government will continue to take those earning below the minimum wage out of the USC tax net. It is in its income tax policy that the views and priorities of Government are most visible. A progressive tax system is how a modern state redistributes wealth. The budget and this Bill do not redistribute. They make sure that less is transferred from those who have it to those who need more.  There are a number of measures in the Finance Bill that I welcome and will support. I want to recognise that there are some positive moves, such as the extension of the tax relief for farmers. However, the farming community has brought to my attention its belief that the definition of "active farmer" is inappropriate, and I hope the Government really listens to this. The arbitrary figure of 50% of farm working time does not represent the real world and will hit small farmers harder. I fully agree with the principle that we need to make sure this is targeted at active farmers and that active farmers are prioritised, but the definition needs to be amended if we are to do what it says and genuinely ensure that those who are farming are able to keep their heads above water. The application of this definition for capital acquisitions tax purposes will have a massive impact on farmers, particularly smaller farmers and those in areas with poor land. I come from west Donegal and those are the types of farmer who live there. If this Bill is not amended, many farmers with hopes of transferring their land to family members will have those hopes dashed. This is the last thing that rural communities need. In respect of such holdings, if a person can get a job off-farm, they will take it. It involves small holdings and farms and bad land. If they can get it, people work 20, 30 or possibly 40 hours per week. The definition in this Bill means that they would have to be working 40 hours on the farm as well to be able to avail of this, which is simply not acceptable, so I hope that the Government looks at this and at the definition of active farming. I understand what it is trying to do here, but I think it will have a consequence, hopefully unintended, of penalising small farmers on poor land in particular.  I welcome the move towards taking a more proactive approach to the domicile levy. In 2012, only six people paid this levy. It is an absolute disgrace. There is certainly a pattern under the Government of placing a higher priority on chasing lower entrants than on chasing higher earners who do not pay what is due. Look at the property tax. The Government allowed the Revenue Commissioners to chase people who had not paid. We hear from the Revenue Commissioners that they are pursuing through the courts 500 people who did not pay, could not pay or refused to pay the property tax. Years later, in the Finance Bill, we are now finally allowing the Revenue Commissioners to send a letter to people they think should be paying the domicile levy. Let us remember who is eligible for the domicile levy. It is people with worldwide incomes above €1 million who have properties in this State worth in excess of €5 million and who have paid less than €200,000 in income tax. The Revenue Commissioners believe that there are people are out there who are not paying it, but years later, a provision to allow the Revenue Commissioners to pursue them is finally included in the Finance Bill, with penalties ensuing. I suggest that we might need to look at the definitions as well. These definitions were raised in 2012, and perhaps we need to reduce the definitions to capture more individuals in respect of the domicile levy. Perhaps new figures exist from 2012, but they are the only figures that are on the record.In respect of corporation tax, the Minister says that:The problem with the so-called "double Irish" from Ireland's point of view is that it has that name. People think that something we do here gives rise to it. That is not the case. It arises from tax codes elsewhere and the way in which the USA regards certain arrangements. We do not operate any kind of tax haven. Our position is legitimate and the 12.5% rate is applied here.I wonder whether he recognises his own words. I could quote other comments he made in response to my questions on this subject in which he clearly indicated that the Irish Government can do nothing to the tax code that would end the double Irish, yet fast forward to budget day when he stated:The so-called “double Irish” is one of many such schemes. I am abolishing the ability of companies to use the “double Irish” by changing our residency rules to require all companies registered in Ireland to also be tax resident in Ireland.Well, fair play to the Minister. Finally he has listened. I wrote the legislation for that reform two years ago. I raised the issue with the Minister and others in the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, where I pointed out that we had to examine what was done in 1997 and apply it in the context of current tax residency rules. He told me it could not be done. He told this Dáil - it is a serious issue to mislead the Dáil - that nothing can be done in the Irish tax code that would end the double Irish. It is on the record. At my instigation, the aforementioned committee reviewed the issue of corporation tax. After all of its work, it still did not have a clue about the subject. Members thought the double Irish was something that could not be ended. That was because every time I raised this issue, people from the Minister's party, including in particular the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dara Murphy, heckled, sniped and accused me of being anti-jobs. I wonder if the Minister of State would accuse the Minister, Deputy Noonan, of the same practices now that he has given in and listened to sensible proposals by ending something that was causing immense reputational damage to this State. The problem with the double Irish and what is proposed in this Finance Bill, however, is that the Minister has given a sweetener to the companies concerned. If they establish here after 1 January 2015, they will automatically be tax resident in this country, which means they had three months from budget day to establish their companies here. If we are to believe what we read in the newspapers, a flood of companies are being set up here to benefit from another provision in the Bill which gives companies incorporated here but not tax resident until 2020 to get their affairs in order. Five years from now, they will be made tax resident here. If the companies that are not currently established here get their act together before 1 January, they will be able to avail of the double Irish for a further five years. That is simply not good enough. At a minimum, he should ensure that the effective date of application for the measure is budget day. I do not think he will do that, however, because he has engaged with the industry and I am sure he has signalled to them that they should get their act in order. This head in the sand approach has not done the State any good. Sinn Féin is clear in its support for the 12.5% corporation tax rate but we will not stand for genuine companies having to pay 12.5% while others are able to avail of tax avoidance schemes that reduce their liabilities to low single digits. This is being done with the support of the Government because it has not closed these loopholes. The Finance Bill proves for once and for all that the Government had the ability to stop this practice at any time in the last several years instead of blaming it on other tax jurisdictions. Of course, it is related to the way other tax jurisdictions interact with us but we could have made a move to stop it. I will not go into the Apple investigation but the Government should have taken it on head first instead of waiting for the European Commission to conduct its investigation. We should have pre-empted the Commission by starting our own investigation. In regard to tax avoidance, the Bill contains an entire section which deals with people involved in deliberate tax avoidance schemes. Someone who is deliberately involved in a tax avoidance scheme will at present incur penalties and interest if the Revenue finds out. The aforementioned section tells these tax avoiders, who are breaking the law, that if they put their hands up they will not incur surcharges and their interest payments will be reduced by 20%. How dare the Minister introduce such a provision at the same time that he is telling people they have to pay up for charges they cannot afford? People who cannot afford to pay the household charge are being pursued by Revenue through the courts but the Minister is amending the law so that people who were deliberately involved in tax avoidance schemes of a huge magnitude will not be subject to surcharges or the full interest liability. That is an absolute disgrace. We should be increasing the penalties on people who are involved in deliberate tax avoidance of this magnitude. Revenue should be strengthened by an additional 100 staff, as Sinn Féin has proposed, to ensure those who are involved in such tax avoidance are pursued and that the penalties, interest and surcharges are applied. This is revealing of the Minister's attitude. I am aware that previous amnesties have brought money into the Exchequer but is this the time to give amnesties to tax avoiders? Should we not be sending a stronger message to the effect that they should pay tax or face additional surcharges? The special assignee relief programme, SARP, again reveals the Minister's priorities. This scheme is an utter disgrace. When it was first announced, the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection stated that it would be linked to employment and that everyone who availed of it would have to prove that in the region of 20 jobs would be created. There is no such requirement anymore. Why does the Minister believe an income of €500,000 is not good enough? Are people who earn €1 million asking the Department of Finance to allow them to write off 30% of their entire incomes for tax purposes? Is he giving a listening ear to such individuals? Does he not get what 200,000 people were saying on Saturday? I realise his comments were very dismissive of them but does he simply not get it? Part of the problem is that the public is not aware of these measures. They are all contained in the Finance Bill but they were not announced on budget day and they will never make the media headlines. I welcome the Minister's statement that office holders will no longer be able to write off their water charges and household charge liabilities against the dual abode allowance. Let us go further, however. Tell me -----

Riddle me that. When I asked Revenue what it means to maintain a second residence in a hotel, the only definition it could provide pertained to laundry expenses. It is madness. The write-off is worth €2,500, which would launder a lot of Y-fronts, shirts and socks.This provision simply should not exist in the tax code. The section dealing with the dual abode allowance was put there by the Fianna Fáil Party in government and it is time for the Minister to take it out. Ministers' expenses should be available on exactly the same basis as any other expenses and the details thereof should be published. Ministers should be able to recoup the cost where they are genuinely required to stay in Dublin or elsewhere as part of their duties. However, having laundry expenses deducted from their tax bill in a private way is not acceptable. In the short time remaining to me, I will comment briefly on a number of issues. We must have an overhaul of the VAT system. I cannot understand why the provision of lessons in Irish dancing, set dancing and brush dancing, which are part of Irish culture, are VAT-liable, while ballet lessons are not liable. We must closely examine these areas. There has been a great deal of talk about the money that has been allocated for the centenary celebration of the Easter Rising, with a range of groups bringing forward proposals to commemorate the events of 1916. Those proposals should be VAT exempt. The Minister provides in this Bill for the elimination of the windfall tax, whereas we called in our alternative budget for its reduction to 41%. The Minister is saying the normal rates will apply in terms of capital gains tax and so on. Our view is that the tax should be charged at 41% and, crucially, rezonings should apply for only two years. There are two reasons for this approach. First, it tells landowners to release their land now in order to deal with the housing crisis, particularly in the capital. Second, it is an anti-corruption measure. Members of the Minister's own party were deeply involved in rezoning land for corrupt purposes in the past. The windfall tax was a way of discouraging that by greatly reducing the benefit to landowners of the massive increase in the value of their land. The Minister seems to think that type of corruption is a thing of the past. I hope he is right, but I remain of the view that the windfall tax should go back to where it was or at least be retained at an appropriate level after the two-year period. In regard to the Living City initiative, it seems the "living" part has been dropped, with the Minister indicating that it is now applicable to a single-storey house. That is the effect of the deletion of subsection (3); it is saying there is no longer a requirement to live in the premises and it simply can be an upfront commercial business. Before this, there was a requirement to live upstairs in the Georgian house. Now the Minister is saying it does not matter - even where it is a single-storey premises being refurbished, one can have expenditure up to €400,000 for an individual and €1.4 million for a company written off over a ten-year period. There is no longer any requirement in terms of residing in the property. People in my constituency would love that, including those living on islands which are being depopulated. It is deeply unfair and the amount of tax forgone is simply not acceptable. The purpose of the initiative was to get people back living in city centres. That there is no longer a requirement for those availing of this benefit to live on the commercial premises to which the benefit applies drives a horse and carriage through the provision. I urge the Minister to reconsider it.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	89	The Finance Bill tells a tale of two different budgets. One of these budgets is for working class people, the most vulnerable and unemployed people. It is a budget which, in effect, ensures the continuance of austerity for them. The other budget is a recovery budget for the rich, high earners, developers and corporations. The weekend before the budget was announced, the headline on the front page of The Sunday Business Post referred to the end of austerity and gains for top earners, builders and farmers. The article was correct in so far as the budget did signal the end of austerity for those groups as well as for private landlords. However, alongside this recovery for the 1%, the budget continues the logic of austerity for the 99%. This continuation of austerity for ordinary people is clear in the cut of €179 million in the budget of the Department of Social Protection, which is the largest cut for any Department in this budget. We have a continuation of the incredibly cruel cut of 20% in the respite care grant, which has had a huge impact on people with disabilities and their families. Many of them depended on this money to pay bills and to cover the extra costs of having a disability. Even at this late stage, I urge the Minister to reverse that cut at a time when recovery has supposedly arrived. Under this budget, an unemployed single person will benefit by 90 cent per week. A single person earning €75,000 per year will benefit by €14.30 per week. For those on low incomes, the scraps given in this budget will be more than wiped out by the water charges. The latter are central to the continuation of this austerity agenda but the reality is that people simply cannot afford to pay them. The water charges may start at the €200 the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, promised yesterday, but will quickly rise once the caps are lifted. The propaganda by the Government on water charges has undergone a significant shift. Originally it was all about conservation and asking everybody to pay their way to facilitate the investment in infrastructure that is needed. Now the Government is arguing that this was all a trick on the European Commission and troika, a way of fiddling the numbers that would cost us very little and save us money in the long run. That is the latest propaganda from the Government. The reality is that whether the money is off balance sheet or on balance sheet, it is money that has to be found and the question remains as to how it will be raised. There is a great deal of talk about the fact that taking it off balance sheet will meet the market conditions test. However, a requirement of the market conditions test is that the seller acts to maximise its profit. The Government accuses us of scaremongering about privatisation and rising costs. However, the Government's argument for water charges is built on the foundation of a test that says the seller must act to maximise its profit. Irish Water will have to negotiate with the Commission for Energy Regulation to eliminate the allowances. It will have to make the argument that the price, which is already double what corporations pay, should go up over time. That commodification of the water supply points ultimately to privatisation. Looking at the other side of the budget, the benefit for high earners on €70,000 or more will be four times that of the gain for those on minimum wage. The budget includes a specific measure, the elimination of the cap on the special assignee relief programme, SARP, which is targeted at a very particular class of people, namely, CEOs and similar earning more than €500,000. It is incredible that the Government would take time to allocate a special tax relief for those earning €500,000 or more. This is a developers' budget. The elimination of the windfall tax, in particular, is simply incredible. The Government has dressed it up as somehow being intended to ensure more homes are built. It will not lead to any more homes being built, but it will give more profits to developers. There is a deficient level of house building not because of the existence of this tax but because of the absence of investment by the State in this area. Such investment is at an all-time low. We are going back to allowing these people to speculate on land and make huge profits while ordinary people who are simply looking for somewhere to live pay the price. This is also a budget for private landlords, who benefit from the extension of the home renovation incentive to rental properties. It seems the explosion in rental costs being paid by ordinary people has not been sufficient to enable landlords to shell out for some new furniture. We must incentivise them with a tax break. In his Budget Statement the Minister expressed his expectation that these tax savings would be reflected in rent levels. That is a joke. If the Minister lived in the real world and interacted with landlords, he would know they will take whatever they can and raise rents as high as they possibly can.We have a corporations’ budget, with an extra €95 million in corporate tax breaks, before we even deal with the patent box tax subsidy. Earlier in a reply to Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett on the corporation tax regime, the Minister for Finance stated the Government played fair but played to win. This encapsulates in an honest way the tax competition strategy of this and former Governments. This is a notion that countries around the world are all engaged in a race to the bottom to provide the best environment for corporations through the lowest corporation tax rates and the most flexible and exploited labour markets, with the lowest wage rates. That is the game in which the Minister and the Government is involved. It is one, however, in which there is only one winner, namely, corporations. In the OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the average corporation tax rate in 1981 was 49.1%. In 2012 it was 32.4%. Has investment gone up in that time? No, it has actually declined. Have growth rates for GDP, gross domestic product, gone up? No, they have declined, too. It is the same in Ireland. For years we have been incentivising corporations to invest here through the introduction of the 12.5% corporation tax rate and the double Irish rule. The result, however, has been a collapse in private sector investment since 2007. The winners are the corporations which have managed massive tax avoidance schemes on a global scale. The patent box will just allow them to continue to do so after 2020.

In the past 24 hours problems with the Finance Bill for the farming community have been brought to my attention. The mothers and fathers of many young people in the farming community want them to take over the land, continue the tradition of farming and carry the baton to drive the agriculture industry forward as set down in Food Harvest 2020. Unfortunately, the Bill’s provisions on capital gains tax tell young people to get a ticket and get out of the country. The Bill states an active farmer must prove he or she spends not less than 50% of his or her working time farming, which is unrealistic. As Deputy Pearse Doherty said, from County Donegal to County Kerry, through the midlands, the income of a small holder farmer with ten to 20 cattle to sell every year will be between €10,000 and €15,000. If that farmer does not work 40 hours elsewhere, he or she could be in severe difficulty and have no future in making a sustainable living on the farm. When I was a young lad starting off in farming, I had to work off-farm. Every pound I earned I put back into the land. Many Deputies will know from visiting Roscommon-South Leitrim during the recent by-election that it is difficult farming land. All over the west, making land productive in wet conditions is a major problem. Up to 30% of farmers, be they large or small holders, are working to have an off-farm income because they cannot make a sustainable living on the land. Between 45% and 50% of suckler cow farmers have to have an alternative way to make a living to rear their families and send them to school. This issue must be addressed on Committee Stage. If it is not, many young farmers will not be able to afford to take over the family farm. The Bill proposes to ring-fence stamp duty consanguinity relief to lifetime farm transfers between family members where the transferor is aged 65 years or under, but there is a problem coming down the track. What does the farmer who reaches 65 years old do for the year? What happens to those aged 66 or 67 years? We need to address this problem, too. Every day in the Chamber, when one looks up to the Visitors Gallery, one always sees young children, the future of the country. Sadly, the education budget has been cut, with the removal of the minor works grant which helped to maintain the life and soul of rural schools. Each year, as the Minister is aware, the only moneys available to schools for essential repairs between September and the end of January were through this grant. I note that the Minister for Finance is a man of optimism, speaking about an economic growth rate of 4% and better. While it is great to have turned corners, the future of the country lies with our children in primary schools. If we take the minor works grant away, they will not be able to have an 11 a.m. or a 12.30 p.m. break because schools will have to close. Two days ago I had a parent on to me to explain that the boiler in their child’s school was ready to blow up and, unfortunately, that the school had no money to repair it. Parents fundraise day in, day out. Will the Department of Education and Skills, as well as the Minister for Finance, address this matter as soon as possible? We all know that for the elderly, the very people who brought the country from A to B during the years, there is chaos in the fair deal scheme. We can go on talking about budgets, but in the end we need to examine the economics. It costs between €3,000 and €4,000 a week to keep an elderly person in a hospital bed, or between €800 and €900 a week in a nursing home, before they are let out under the fair deal system. It would make more economic sense to allow them to be cared for in their own homes, which would allow families to have their loved ones closer to them. Will the Minister examine amendments to the Finance Bill to address these issues, particularly the farming issues which are causing much distress around the country?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	91	Last week, before the protests that took place at the weekend, the Minister for Finance was reported as suggesting they would be the last rally of the anti-water charges movement. He could not have been more wrong. The Irish revolution for the 21st century has begun. The people, as they rise up off their knees against six years of cruel injustice and unfairness, will not be lying down again any time soon. Unless the Government genuinely listens and scraps these hated water charges and undoes some of the cruel injustices perpetrated against Irish citizens in the past six years, it will fall. Unless it genuinely listens to the voices of the people who have risen up, this will be the rock on which it will perish. The message could not be clearer. The people do not want tinkering, statistics or mud to be thrown in their eyes about economic growth and the success of the Government. They want these hated water charges to be scrapped, with the undoing of some of the other injustices perpetrated against them such as the home tax and the cruel burden of the universal social charge, as well as some of the absolute vicious cuts directed against some of the poorest people. That was the message on Saturday and it was unmistakable for those of us on the streets involved in organising the protests. I spoke at dozens of meetings in the run-up to and the mobilisation of the protests at the weekend. The anger, outrage and determination of the people involved were absolutely unmistakable.People have had enough, yet the Minister stills tries to throw mud in their eyes about the so-called progressivity of his budget. How can he stand over a situation where somebody on €17,000 - a miserable, poverty wage - gets €173 back in this budget, which will be more than wiped out by the water charges, but somebody on €120,000 gets €687 back? How can the Minister justify that for people who cannot pay their bills and are on their knees? They are being made homeless because they cannot pay the rent or feed their children.  I have pointed out to the Minister that we are at the bottom of the OECD league table for child poverty. It is extraordinary and it is not just to do with the recession or the adjustment. Even in the teeth of the recession, other OECD countries have seen an improvement in child poverty. Notwithstanding all the economic difficulties, their governments said: "We're not going to let children fall into poverty. It's just not acceptable. It's not fair." Child poverty gets worse in Ireland, however, because this Government does not care, is not listening or does not know. I do not understand what it is, but that is a fact. They have left children to suffer the consequences of an economic crash in their priorities for dealing with it. There are alternatives. The Minister always says that we do not put forward alternatives, although we do so again and again. In our alternative budget, for example, we proposed that if one increased tax on people earning in excess of €100,000 and created new tax bands for those on very high earnings, i.e. over €140,000, over €180,000 and over €250,000, a few extra percentage points would raise €922 million, according to the Department of Finance. That figure was contained in a parliamentary reply from the Minister's Department. That sum would allow him to do away with the USC for everybody under the average industrial wage and slash it for people earning between €30,000 and €60,000. It would genuinely shift the tax burden onto those who can afford it, rather than continuing to cripple those who simply cannot pay any more.  The Minister resists with incredible determination the tiniest extra tax imposition on the financial services sector. A financial transaction tax would impose 0.1% on the several trillion euro in financial trading that goes on in the IFSC. According to the EU Commission it would raise €500 million a year, more than the Minister hopes to raise from struggling low and middle-income families. Which is fairer - levying 0.1% on financial speculators who would not even feel it, or battering low and middle income families who cannot even pay their bills with hundreds of extra euro that they simply cannot afford? How can the Minister say the latter is fair? It is obviously unfair. The financial speculators who caused the crisis would not even feel 0.1%, but other people will be driven further into poverty. More children will be driven into poverty and more people will lose their homes because they cannot afford to pay their rent. How can the Minister say that he cannot do anything about that? We have also made proposals concerning corporation tax. Figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that before deductions and charges, the corporate sector made €61.5 billion in profits but it only pays €4.17 billion in tax. That is an effective rate of 6.5%. If the Minister put that up to 12.5%, which is the nominal rate, as a minimal effective rate he would raise €4 billion. Would that not go a long way to fixing the water infrastructure that the Minister cares so much about? Why cannot some of NAMA's €4 billion in cash reserves go into water infrastructure? Some of it could also go into building housing for the homeless and the 90,000 people on the housing waiting list. Why can the Minister not do those things? It is because the Government repeatedly defends, with incredible tenacity, the wealth of the richest people in the country and the enormous profits of corporations. It unloads the cost of an economic crisis again and again on the backs of the poor, struggling, working people of this country who simply cannot take any more. If the Minister wants to avoid the revolution, he should listen.

They mean continued austerity for low and middle-income families whom this Government are forcing to pay for a recession that they had no hand, act nor part in creating. The water charge is one of those austerity taxes, but ordinary people are now saying that they have had enough. It is the straw that breaks the camel's back. The policies in the budget and in the Finance Bill ensure that the gap between rich and poor has increased. The policies mean that the super-rich get off scot free and will not even be asked to pay their fair share of taxation. In recent days, the Minister's press officer boasted in the newspapers that anyone earning over €100,000 a year will get €747 from this budget. That is nearly €15 per week, while the lowest earners get 90 cent per week. Low and middle-income families will face more austerity, while the very wealthy get support and are not asked to pay for anything. We have high unemployment levels while there are over 100,000 on the housing waiting lists and there is a huge mortgage crisis. Irish children have fallen further and faster into poverty than in any other OECD country. It is shameful that 28.6% of Irish children currently live in poverty. We also have high emigration, including 84,000 graduates who have left this country in recent years. They are now contributing to economies in Canada, Australia and elsewhere. Ordinary people know that our health and education services have been devastated. This country is not broke, however. All objective, independent analysis agrees that this is a very wealthy country indeed. Of course, the wealth is skewed in favour of wealthy people to such an extent that the poorest 10% pay more as a percentage of their income in tax than the wealthiest 10%. That is another absolutely shameful situation. About 12 months ago in this Chamber, the former Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, told us that this was the eighth richest country in the world. That fact has been supported by objective analysis. We know, for instance, that the gross domestic product here per head of population is greater than in Germany, France or the United Kingdom.That finding has been supported by Germany's Bertelsmann Foundation in recent times. The German study shows that, despite being one of the richest countries in the EU, Ireland's rating for distribution of wealth is 18th, in the bottom third of the 28 EU countries, along with Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Latvia. As a result of the study, the foundation also cited Ireland as an example of how high GDP per capita did not translate automatically into social justice for the population. Ireland has a GDP around as high as Sweden's, but ranks considerably below average when it comes to social justice and is one of the biggest losers in country comparisons. This country is very wealthy, but the wealth is in the hands of a very small percentage of the population that is not being asked to pay its fair share. Less than 12 months ago, the Minister for Finance told me that the top 10,000 income earners in the country earn €595,000 each per year. From the rich list published in the Sunday Independent by Nick Webb, we know the 300 wealthiest people in the country have increased their assets and income from €50 billion in 2010 to €62 billion, an increase of €12 billion. We know the financial assets of the wealthy are now at the level of the Celtic tiger era, at €324 billion. It is time the Government made very wealthy people pay their fair share. I am talking about seriously wealthy people, not the ordinary individual with a redundancy payment or a retirement lump sum or who bought a house for retirement. I am talking about people with huge amounts of money, hundreds of millions or billions of euro each. They are not even asked to pay a wealth tax, which is one of the things the Government should do. It should introduce a wealth tax for very wealthy people, but I can see the Minister throwing his hands up in the air, as do the media and the establishment when people suggest it. We should remember there are six countries in the EU with a wealth tax. A wealth tax was introduced in this country by a former colleague of the Minister, Richie Ryan, but it was abolished by Fianna Fáil to suit its backers. A wealth tax is essential. Even a very small wealth tax would provide significant income, billions of euro, to address the issues of water, health and education services.

When we take into account qualifying adults and children, this adds up to almost 2.3 million people in the country who receive a benefit, including child benefit, which is paid to 610,000 families in respect of 1.2 million children per month. Assistance with key household bills is given to almost 410,000 households and pensions are paid to 560,000 people. Working-age income support is paid to 480,000 people, and income support for carers and people with an illness or disability is provided to 300,000 people. The idea that everyone is being left high and dry by the Government is rubbish. Half the population receives some form of social welfare support every month. I listened to some of the comments made about this Bill, and it seems the average nurse or teacher is the enemy of some Opposition Members, based on their salaries. The Opposition resents the fact that these people are getting taxes back in the budget. When we were discussing the budget last year, there was an expectation that this year we would take more out of the economy. In fact, we are putting it back. Not for a minute do I think the average nurse or teacher or a person earning the average industrial wage is overpaid.

Even if they feel my contribution is the same, the least they can do is give me the courtesy of actually listening. The IDA supports companies that directly employ 166,000 people, and the same companies spend €7.8 billion annually on payroll and a further €12.5 billion on materials and services produced in Ireland. It seems the Members opposite want to get rid of that as well, because they have something against foreign direct investment. Do the Deputies opposite want to put another 166,000 people on the dole and get rid of the €7.8 billion payroll and the €12.5 billion that such companies invest in the country? Companies supported by Enterprise Ireland, which are mainly Irish indigenous companies, employ 175,000 people and spend €6 billion on payroll and €13.5 billion in the economy. These are significant figures and should not be thrown around or played with in the way some Members talk about policy. The Minister for Finance once commented that people in this House use kindergarten economics, but some of what the Members opposite talk about goes beyond kindergarten economics. One of the best things the Government has done concerns unemployment. Unemployment is dropping because there has been a sector-by-sector approach to getting people back working. It is not just the Minister for Finance but all Cabinet Ministers working with him. We have made changes in agriculture and drilled into sectors. Changes made to the 9% VAT rate for the tourism sector had a dramatic effect, as acknowledged by everyone. It is a textbook example of how the Government can change something in one sector of the economy in a dramatic way. By the end of 2016, 2 million people will be working in the country. That would be impressive. The outcome of joined-up thinking by the Government is that we will see steady growth of between 3% and 4% per year for the next three to four years. Looking at big-ticket macroeconomic measures, which do not interest most people but which remain important, we have exited the EU-IMF programme. Members who were present in November 2010 will remember Ajai Chopra crossing from the Merrion Hotel to the Department of Finance. They will remember that there was almost a sense of relief that the IMF was taking over the country. It was a low point. We made changes to the IMF loans and the promissory notes which free up billions of euro over the lifetime of the loans. The rating agencies are positive about Ireland's future, and ten-year sovereign bond yields are at record lows. Recently, a 15-year bond issued by the NTMA attracted one of the lowest interest rates for this type of sovereign bond. It is forecast that gross debt ratio will drop below 100% of GDP in 2018, ahead of the reduction required by the Stability and Growth Pact, which is nothing more than living within our means. We have managed to provide services to those who are the most vulnerable in our society and also in education, health and housing. There is an expected investment of €2.2 billion in housing, where a genuine need exists, over the coming years. It is a measure of good governance rather than the hocus-pocus ideas thrown out by the Opposition in these speeches. In October 2011, unemployment was out of control, and in the three years before it peaked in 2012, 300,000 people lost their jobs.Our economy was contracting and there were massive cuts in public services and increases in taxation.

I and others warned the Taoiseach time and again in the Dáil, but the Government simply ignored the issue and carried on. The meters have been ticking for the past five weeks. This means charging began on 1 October, but nobody has a clue what the water bills will be. The Government is now telling the media there will be flat charges, but the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, is boasting that a meter is being installed every 30 seconds. For what reason are they being installed?

There was no accountability to the Dáil. John Tierney told a journalist, Sean O'Rourke, about consultancy costs and nobody was told about that in here. In short, the establishment of Irish Water and everything to do with it has been a telling narrative of the Government's disdain for the people and their views, the Government's culture of secrecy and its incoherence. As Deputy Eoghan Murphy indicated this morning, not only is the credibility of Irish Water in tatters, but the Government's credibility is in tatters as well. Will the Taoiseach bring his much sought-after clarity and certainty to the Tánaiste's comments yesterday? Is she correct in saying the bill for a family of four adults will be less than €200? Is it the case that the Fine Gael Ministers are right? I asked the following question yesterday.

In that sense it should be welcomed.

We know 30% of households in the country are occupied by one adult and 49% of houses are occupied by two adults, with 13% occupied by three adults, 6% occupied by four adults and 2% occupied by five adults. There is a clear issue where there are a number of adults in a house. A person living alone will have 48% of the required water supplied through the free allocation from the State, and so on. The comment made by the Tánaiste yesterday is in respect of making the charges as fair and as affordable as possible. The Government has not made a decision on this yet and the Government will make its decision in the next two weeks. It will be perfectly clear about that, taking into account all of the issues that have been raised here and those which must be dealt with. There is a major programme of reconstruction and investment to be put in place.

She was speaking as deputy leader of the Government during official Question Time with regard to her brief of social protection. She answered clearly that a family with four adults would pay less than €200. The Taoiseach is the leader of the Government. He has come in the following day to say that the Government has made no decision; nevertheless, he is blaming everybody else for the confusion and the lack of certainty or clarity.

Is the figure of less than €200 for a four-adult family correct? Will he answer that question? We have all heard about the famous off balance sheet mechanism, which is essentially an accounting mechanism. One needs 50% revenue from non-State sources, which essentially means charges. What is the level of revenue required by the Government to enable it to borrow off balance sheet? The Taoiseach must have that figure. He knows it, but for some reason he will not tell us. That is a reflection of the entire debate. There has been no debate and nobody can ask questions of Irish Water through parliamentary questions. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government has made a decision that the Revenue Commissioners will be taking over the collection of water charges? The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, refused to rule that out yesterday.

This figure was later quickly rejected by her own spokesperson and the Taoiseach's spokesperson. There were media briefings by the Government suggesting the Tánaiste was expressing a personal view and the Taoiseach repeated that today. The Taoiseach has repudiated the Tánaiste and many people will wonder which is Tweedledum and which is Tweedledee. Is the Tánaiste part of the Government? Yesterday the Taoiseach stressed the need for clarity. The legislation was rushed through the Dáil last Christmas and another Christmas now approaches but the Taoiseach will still not say how much citizens will be charged for water. Will the Taoiseach set out precisely the Government position? The Taoiseach contradicted his earlier remarks by saying he agrees with the Tánaiste. Was the Tánaiste correct in the figure she quoted of under €200? Yesterday the Taoiseach refused to commit to scrapping water charges. Does the Taoiseach remember long ago when he said his Government would be different from those led by Fianna Fáil? He said, "Paddy likes to know".

Under the current structure meters have been running since 1 October but bills will not be sent out until the end of January. The capping arrangement will continue for a further nine months - this means that people with meters who use less water than the cap will pay the lower amount. This is an incentive to register and have a meter installed and it allows for the possibility of beating the cap, as it were. The Government has listened to the many views and concerns voiced by people and, as Deputy Adams noted, they include those who can pay, cannot pay and will not pay.

This is why it is necessary that Irish Water is set up to borrow independently and to invest in a programme of fixing inadequate and inferior infrastructure around the country. The Environmental Protection Agency has noted the number of water treatment plants that are not up to standard and a national standard will be applied by Irish Water. A major capital programme of more than €1 billion per year has been set out. An investment of around €10 billion is required to fix something that it has not been possible to fix for some years. It will not be possible to fix Irish water infrastructure without an entity like Irish Water. Deputy Adams can make all the comments he wishes in a debate on this in two weeks when clear answers will be given.

The Government is dysfunctional and the Minister who introduced water charges legislation says it has failed abjectly. He described Uisce Éireann as arrogant, uncaring and a cosseted quango with a bonus culture. Today Deputy Eoghan Murphy, a Fine Gael TD, accused the Government of manipulating and abusing the Dáil in how it ran through the legislation that established Irish Water. He said the credibility of the Government is in tatters. Meanwhile, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has threatened the use of Revenue to chase those who cannot pay the water tax and has demanded that citizens give their personal public service, PPS, numbers to Irish water. Did the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste authorise Irish water to contact every local authority to seek the names and addresses of council tenants? Is this what the Taoiseach meant when he said he listened to the concerns of citizens who took to the streets in every county of this State last Saturday? Yesterday he said he would act on their calls. The game is up.The Taoiseach will not tell us how much he is going to charge. He refuses to do that. Will the Taoiseach not now, even belatedly, agree that the only way forward is to scrap water charges?

The Government has made a number of decisions in regard to giving the regulator directions to the effect that the average metered charge would be €240 and that 30,000 litres would be allocated per household and 21,000 litres allocated per child. The problems being raised by people here are particularly in regard to those who have difficulties in meeting an assessed charge and where there are households with more than two adults. Clearly that is an issue the Government will have to address. I have given the percentages of the houses involved where there are over three adults living in households and these need to be dealt with. Households with three or more adults comprise 13%, households with four or more adults amount to 6% and those with five adults comprise 2%. There is an issue that needs to be addressed.

There seems to be no end to it and the hole seems to be getting deeper. The Taoiseach told us yesterday that he was not going to put up with under-investment in water, but the Government has been doing that for three and a half years because it has not been investing for the past three and a half years. The problems remain. The Government has not fixed any of the leaking pipes. We still have sewage going into the sea. In Wexford there were 11 village projects ready to go. They had been approved and were simply waiting for funding from central government. Irish Water came along and put them on hold. They have gone right back to the preamble stage. We have raw sewage going into the sea in Wexford from Duncannon, Arthurstown, Ballyhack and Kilmore Quay. We have secondary treatment going in from big towns like Gorey and Courtown. Irish Water has delayed all of this. The Taoiseach will remember very well back in the late 1980s the rod licence dispute. It shook the nation at the time. People felt that a freedom was being taken from them, even if it was only a £5 fee to fish in public lakes. It captured the nation at the time and there was a huge feeling about it. It reached the stage where it was either the case that the Government was going to fall over it or it had to abolish it. Irish Water has reached the same stage. The cat is out of the bag and putting it back in is not going to be easy.

Will the Taoiseach abolish Irish Water? The Taoiseach should do himself and the people a favour by abolishing it. Otherwise, as an alternative, will the Taoiseach go to the country and ask the people for a choice on the matter, abolish the Government now and call an election?

I assume Deputy Wallace wants to see a situation where Duncannon and the other areas in Wexford do not have raw sewage being pumped into the sea. I understand that only in the past two days there has been confirmation by Irish Water of a number of schemes in Wexford now going ahead. That is as it should be. It is very important that the contributions that come for domestic water use to Irish Water are spent on investing in infrastructure by Irish Water. We must have a situation whereby the entity which is charged with fixing this infrastructure and investing for the future can demonstrate that the contributions made to it are spent entirely on investing and fixing inadequate infrastructure. Of course I recall the difficulties with the rod licence which consumed the country for quite some time and the issues about ownership of the waters and lakes of Ireland, particularly those in the west.

That is why the Environmental Protection Agency, which I am sure Deputy Wallace supports, issued a comment yesterday. I note the agency said that a national standard is fundamental and that the setting up of Irish Water will bring that about. Irish Water representatives have a very good story to tell that they have not been telling.

Yesterday, I spoke about the many houses that have lead service pipes going into them. We cannot continue with that but we cannot deal with it unless we have an entity that can borrow off the Government balance sheet and invest in these kinds of projects. If Deputy Wallace is talking to a parent or householder who lives in one of those houses, he needs to be able to say to them that Irish Water is investing and outline the timescale, whether for Duncannon or any other place in the country. This has gone on for too long. Part of the remit given to this Government was to fix our finances and get our country working. In due course the people will have their opportunity to cast their verdict on the work of this Government and on whether it fulfilled its mandate.

I remind Deputy Wallace that yesterday the figures for unemployment were down to 11%. We are now the fastest-growing economy in Europe. The sacrifices made by the people are responsible for that because they accepted all the challenges. Now we have a challenge to have a fair and affordable system. That is what the Government has to reflect on arising from the anxieties and concerns that have been expressed.

The 11 sewerage projects in Wexford have been ready to go for a long time but central government has not funded them and they are not going to start as soon as the Taoiseach has indicated. Sewage is going into the sea because this Government has tolerated it, the same as the one before it. There was supposed to be an upgrade in Ringsend. The local authority was told that the site was not big enough to accommodate a new upgrading facility. The long sea outfall project was commissioned and eventually got through planning after six years of work. What is happening now? Irish Water has decided it can build the plant on-site and it need not carry out the long sea outfall project. Why is this? It is because it will cost €100 million. Irish Water is going to do a cheaper version. Irish Water maintains it has new technology and it will magic it up. I would like to see what kind of effect that will have on Sandymount beach and Merrion beach, because that will be a problem.If Irish Water builds a facility that causes pollution, who will deal with the issue? The local authority will. As I told the Taoiseach two weeks ago, Irish Water is not taking on responsibility for dealing with pollution, flooding or storm water; therefore, dealing with the pollution it causes will be the responsibility of the local authority.

The same applies to every local authority area in the country. There can be hundreds of projects and there have been hundreds for the past 25 or 30 years. Every year there has been a drip, drip effect, as it were, with regard to which scheme will get the go-ahead. The reason is that each local authority and all of the projects in County Wexford which the Deputy mentioned had to compete with schools, hospitals and other public projects funded from the general taxation fund. That is the reason we have never been able to invest properly in fixing the Irish water supply and wastewater treatment system. That is why there is a need for Irish Water to be able to borrow independently and pass the market corporation test of being able to stand on its own feet in terms of resources in order that it can invest independently and undertake the 11 projects in County Wexford and all of the others in every local authority around the country. That is why it is important. If the Deputy wants the system to remain the way it was and which has brought us to this point where we have grossly inferior infrastructure, I do not share his view.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	299	The Seanad has voted for a referendum to prohibit the privatisation of Irish Water. My understanding is that the Labour Party has supported that call. I put to the Taoiseach the urgent need for the Government to give time to the House to discuss Irish Water. The legislation was guillotined and there is a need to bring not just clarity but openness to all of the issues pertaining to Irish Water. No programme of investment or prioritisation has been outlined to the House. There has been no clarity on the level of revenue required to enable the Government to borrow off balance sheet. I have never been given that figure and Deputy Cowen has been asking for a year for a swathe of information.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	301	I ask the Taoiseach to give time, in advance of the Government's decision, in order that he can hear what others have to say about the issue. We learned yesterday that there were more than 400 trolleys in accident and emergency departments across the country. Beaumont had 37 trolleys, James Connolly Memorial Hospital had 49, Galway had 25 and Naas had 21. That is extraordinarily unfair on the patients and families involved. I asked the Taoiseach about the health reform Bill and other health legislation yesterday. It seems that the entire programme for Government and the legislation promised in regard to health are in tatters. There is no sense of any plan or coherence and things are falling apart. The Government is in denial. What is the status of the health reform and health information Bills? When will the family leave Bill be produced? We are one of only two countries across the European Union that does not have specific legislation to allow both parents to take leave when they have a baby. Senator White and others have progressed the issue in the Seanad and commitments in that regard have been made by the Minister. I ask the Taoiseach to indicate when the Government intends to bring the Bill before the House. When does the Taoiseach expect to bring the Seanad electoral (university members) (amendment) Bill before the House? We have long lost any notion that a democratic revolution will happen, but reform was promised after the Seanad referendum. When will he outline his proposals to reform the Seanad? Publishing the Bill would be a first step.

Work is proceeding on the family leave, health information and health reform Bills. The family leave Bill will be published early next year and the family information Bill will be published later than that. The health reform Bill is being examined by the Minister for Health. In respect of delayed discharges from hospital for those who have been cleared to leave but for whom no step-down facilities are available, €25 million has been provided for that in the budget. The Minister will attend to that matter between now and Christmas.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	323	I refer to the minimum wage, marriage equality and the housing regulation Bills. I respectfully suggest to the Taoiseach that it might be useful to have a debate before the Government makes up its mind so we can inform it of our view on all of these matters.That would be a democratic way to proceed. The Government has committed to establishing a body to examine the minimum wage Bill and related matters. Approximately 180,000 citizens are currently on the minimum legal wage, the grand sum of €8.65 per hour, or less if one is under 18 years of age. Will the Taoiseach give us a progress report on that issue please? In regard to the marriage equality Bill, tá daoine ag fanacht agus tá sé riachtanach go mbeidh guth ag gach duine maidir leis an gceist tábhachtach seo. When can we expect this legislation and will the Government support the voter drive which is under way among the gay and lesbian community and others to ensure people are registered in time to vote? This Bill is to be introduced in the next term, with the heads of the Bill to be agreed by the Cabinet. The housing regulation Bill was promised and is to provide a regulatory framework for approved housing bodies. This will be welcomed, given the housing problems being faced by citizens. Will the Bill address this problem and when can we expect it?

He supports those who pay, those who do not pay and those who cannot pay. I know his view - it is all things to all people at all times. Yesterday, the Government gave authorisation for the low pay commission, which will examine the question of wage regulation and wage levels. As the Deputy is aware, in the past, we had a very haphazard structure. The low pay commission will bring coherence to the advice that should be given in respect of wage structuring and it was approved by Cabinet yesterday.  We fully support the programme to encourage people to register to vote and to ensure they are registered to vote by 25 November. I met with young Fine Gael members this morning and they are launching a campaign to support this. Everybody should check the register to ensure they are registered to vote, so that when the Bill is published early in the new year and when the date for the referendum is fixed, they will be registered to cast their votes.

We have a serious crisis in regard to the ambulance service in Wexford. Two weeks ago, a 50 year old man died of a heart attack. The ambulance that came to the scene had no defibrillator and no cardiac tablets and the back-up ambulance did not arrive. The man died but he possibly would have survived if the situation were different. While we are waiting for the new Bill, can we do something to alleviate the problem in regard to the ambulance service in Wexford. Last Sunday, an ambulance took three hours to off-load its patient.

The main outcome was an agreement, after difficult and intensive negotiations, on a new EU climate and energy policy framework for the period to 2030. I am satisfied this ambitious agreement also represented a positive outcome for Ireland and will provide further detail on our approach shortly. The European Council discussed economic developments in the Union and we had a more detailed consideration of the situation in the eurozone at a subsequent euro summit. We also considered a number of external relations issues, particularly the EU's response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the situation in Ukraine. The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, will address in greater detail in his contribution the issue of Ukraine and other external relations issues.  The fifth assessment report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the final instalment of which was published last weekend - brings the urgency of tackling climate change into stark relief. The need for concerted global action had been confirmed already at the UN summit in New York in September, which I attended. The European Council was faced with the challenging task of agreeing an EU climate and energy policy framework for the period to 2030 - setting targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions, as well as for renewable energy and energy efficiency. A successful outcome at the European Council was by no means a foregone conclusion. Negotiations in advance of the Council had revealed differing viewpoints among member states as to how ambitious our targets should be. Naturally, each member state wanted to see its own priorities and constraints - reflecting a diversity of economic situations, patterns of energy and geography - accommodated in the agreement. It was a significant achievement that, following lengthy and at times difficult discussion, agreement was reached and a set of headline targets was determined. By 2030, the EU is to achieve a 40% reduction in greenhouse gases, to draw at least 27% of the energy it consumes from renewable sources and to increase energy efficiency by at least 27%. Some have criticised this agreement as insufficiently ambitious. However, it was clear that it represented the best available compromise. It now allows the EU to lead by example in encouraging other countries to bring forward targets and policies of their own in advance of the UN climate conference in Paris in December of next year. My general aim at the European Council was to secure a fair, balanced and achievable deal for Ireland in the context of an overall agreement. I would like to thank my colleagues, particularly the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and Teagasc, for their stalwart efforts during the advance negotiations which were so important in achieving a successful outcome. Our crucial specific objective was for the conclusions to take account of the special position of agriculture, given that emissions from our already carbon efficient agriculture sector make up a much higher proportion of total emissions here in Ireland than in any other member state. The specific recognition in the final agreement of the multiple objectives of the agriculture and land use sector represented a major breakthrough for Ireland, as did reference to ensuring coherence between the EU's food security and climate change objectives. There was also an acceptance of the sector's limited mitigation potential. Overall, this represents a successful outcome in the context of our ambitious plans to sustainably increase food production in line with Food Harvest 2020. On the basis of a proposal from Ireland, the contribution of afforestation to greenhouse gas mitigation and sequestration was also recognised by the European Council. Again, this is crucial for Ireland as we put in place major investments with a view to expanding new forest cover. We await further detailed proposals from the Commission as to how these important and clear principles will be fleshed out, but the parameters of the future approach have been laid down. A further key issue for Ireland was the setting of a national target for the reduction of emissions in non-traded sectors. The starting point is that the 20% target agreed some years ago for 2020 has proven to be ill-founded, unrealistic and unattainable. It did not recognise the implications of the particular importance of agriculture in Ireland. In addition, our capacity to invest in the wide-ranging infrastructural and energy efficiency measures required has been severely limited by the difficult state of our public finances. Even though our economy is now improving, the need to reduce our national debt burden will continue to impose significant fiscal constraints. At the European Council, I emphasised the economic and fiscal challenges that Ireland has endured and still faces. I stated emphatically that our agreement to the headline targets was based on the clear understanding that our national target for the non-emissions trading scheme sector, which includes agriculture, must take account of our specific circumstances and should be both deliverable and economically sustainable. However, as the negotiations progressed, it became clear that there was not going to be an agreement on the so-called non-ETS targets at this time. Therefore, I focused on ensuring that the European Council itself, which operates by consensus and not by majority voting, must return to this question in due course to make the necessary decision on national targets.This was agreed and made quite clear in the conclusions. The European Council will keep all the elements of the framework under review and, as is its role under the treaties, will give strategic orientations, notably - and I quote language I successfully proposed - "with respect to consensus" on the non-emissions trading sector and some other issues. It is an important issue in that when the European Council comes back to review issues, it will come back for a purpose, and that purpose is to have consensus, because the Council operates on consensus. That means our negotiators will have that as a backstop on each occasion the European Council reviews the issues. While the outcome of the Council is clearly a positive one for both Ireland and the Union as a whole, much work remains to be done. The negotiations to agree binding national targets will undoubtedly present challenges and the Government will remain fully engaged. Meanwhile, we will continue to play our part in realising the EU ambition of becoming a competitive low-carbon economy by 2050. This will call for sustained action at a domestic level. The current low rate of growth in Europe remains an overriding concern for the Council. We shared our perspectives on recent economic developments, as well as ideas for boosting economic growth and investment. There was a separate discussion among leaders of eurozone countries. The President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, made a comprehensive and, I must say, stark presentation on the difficult issues facing the eurozone and the need for a broad and multifaceted policy response. One common theme in interventions at the European Council was the importance of structural reforms. Ireland was referenced several times as a positive example of how such reforms, while painful in the short term, can provide a strong foundation for boosting growth. Member states were encouraged to continue on the path of reform, notwithstanding the challenges. Many of my colleagues emphasised that low investment is eroding Europe's growth potential and called for the boosting of investment levels. Support was expressed for the incoming Commission's intention to mobilise an additional €300 billion in public and private investment over the coming three years, and we expect to have further detail on this initiative in advance of the December European Council. The European Council also welcomed the establishment of a task force, led by the Commission and the European Investment Bank, with a view to identifying and addressing blockages to investment and also developing a pipeline of potentially viable projects of European significance. Meanwhile, the Euro Summit called for work to continue to develop concrete mechanisms for stronger economic policy co-ordination and tasked the new President of the Commission, in conjunction with the other relevant individuals, to prepare the next steps on better economic governance in the euro area in general. This European Council did not take detailed decisions on economic issues, focusing instead on the difficult and delicate negotiations necessary to achieve agreement on the climate and energy policy framework. However, our discussions provided valuable orientation ahead of more substantive decisions at the December European Council. It was clear that, right across the Union, the unwavering focus remains on addressing the challenges of low growth and high unemployment. One issue which had not been foreseen for the European Council but which, in the event, featured prominently in discussions and related media coverage was the issue of EU budget contribution adjustments, which, on the basis of a leaked document, was highlighted in the UK media on the Friday morning. Deputies will be aware that the UK in particular has serious concerns in regard to the volume of, and basis for, its additional assessed contribution. The issue is now being considered in more detail by finance Ministers, and I hope the matter can be quickly clarified and resolved in a way that assuages political difficulties but respects the agreed treaty and legislative rules. The European Council had an important and productive discussion on the EU's response to the Ebola crisis. This followed on from a detailed consideration of the issue by EU foreign Ministers earlier in the week. The spread of the Ebola virus in west Africa is unfortunately continuing at an alarming rate. The most recent figures provided by the World Health Organization indicate over 13,500 confirmed and suspected cases of Ebola in west Africa, with almost 5,000 reported deaths. The disease is continuing to spread faster than the Governments of the worst affected countries in west Africa - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - and the international community can respond. We must unfortunately prepare ourselves for a further deterioration of the situation in west Africa in the short term, and we therefore have to redouble our efforts to limit the human, social and economic impacts of the epidemic. Recognising this imperative, the European Council registered its deep concern at the spread of the virus and at the increasing number of people in west Africa infected and dying from it. We agreed that the EU must be at the forefront of international efforts to combat the virus. We committed ourselves to bringing the total for EU financial assistance to €1 billion, a target that is already close to being met. From the outset, Ireland has been playing an important and active role in the Ebola response, and we are providing over €17 million in the region this year, directly and through NGOs. Our programmes in Sierra Leone and Liberia are focused on strengthening health systems in the two countries, and we have reprogrammed other funding directly to the Ebola response. Last week a grant of €1 million was approved for the newly established UN Ebola Trust Fund, which supports the activities of the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. We are looking at what more we can do through our embassy in Freetown, given that we are one of the relatively few EU countries with an embassy on the ground. The European Council also noted that EU member states are committed to increasing the deployment of medical and support staff in West Africa. In this regard, the earlier agreement at the Foreign Affairs Council on a co-ordinated EU mechanism to guarantee appropriate care for international health workers, within available resources, was very welcome. The European Council also welcomed the appointment of the incoming Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides, as EU Ebola co-ordinator. I wish the Commissioner every success as he takes on this critically important role. Given the gravity of the Ebola crisis, the European Council will consider the state of play again at the next meeting in December. To inform this discussion, we also called on the High Representative and the Commission to develop a package of measures addressing the wider political, security and economic implications of the crisis in the region. I am very pleased that the European Council was able to conclude the institutional changeover by formally appointing the new European Commission. This followed a vote of approval by the European Parliament on 22 October. President Juncker and his team of Commissioners are now in their posts. Together with my Cabinet colleagues, I look forward to working closely with President Juncker and the 27 other members of the college over the new legislative term, building on the strong relationship we enjoyed with the outgoing Commission. I would also like to place on record my thanks to the outgoing Commission, particularly to President Barroso and Commissioner Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, for their excellent work. During the course of this Government, I had quite a deal of interaction with Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn. I must say I found her, as one would expect, to be both courteous and very efficient in dealing with any queries we raised on behalf of the country, and I thank her for that. In what has been an extremely difficult period for the EU, their commitment to improving the lives of EU citizens has never been less than total. I wish them well in whatever paths they may pursue from here on. I also note that the October European Council was the final such meeting to be chaired by outgoing President Herman Van Rompuy. President Van Rompuy has been an extremely able, skilful and committed President, both as the chair of our internal negotiations and in representing the EU on the global stage. He demonstrated enormous patience in many of the interminably long meetings that took place during the Presidency and on other difficult issues. I would like to thank him most sincerely for his leadership. I look forward to working closely with his successor, Donald Tusk, who takes up duty on 1 December. I will return in due course to update the House on the preparations for, and outcomes of, the next European Council, which will take place on 18 and 19 December.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	333	There have been many significant developments in the European Union since we last had statements.  It is unfortunate that the Government decided not to have statements concerning the Council’s various discussions in July and August. The Taoiseach’s approach to cancelling and not replacing sessions of questions means that the practical opportunities to discuss and review European matters have been reduced significantly.  I hope this will not continue. The latest summit had some important items on its agenda but it was, yet again, highly complacent when one looks at the range of urgent issues confronting the European Union and its member states. It was a striking feature of last month’s budget that the Government decided to ignore completely the growing threat of deflation in Europe and the impact this might have on Ireland.Equally, no credit was given to the central role which the policies of the ECB under Mario Draghi have played in our return to growth. The Government's sole focus on the next election means that it is unwilling to acknowledge how important European policies still are for us. The publication of the latest round of bank stress tests and the coming into effect of the single supervisory mechanism yesterday have brought back into focus the issue of the link between banking and sovereign debt. It is over two years since the Taoiseach and the other leaders announced that the link between banking and sovereign debt had been broken and that Ireland would be receiving justice for the debts it took on because of failures in European policy. If the Taoiseach looks back at a number of his statements to the Dáil since then, he will find that he repeatedly said that retrospective justice for Ireland on bank-related debt would be achieved when the single supervisory mechanism became operational so why are the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance so reluctant to say anything now? The Taoiseach will remember that he and his colleagues announced that the decision on recapitalisation was a "game changer" for Ireland. At a press conference held in Government Buildings, the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform were positively giggling about the billions of euro which were to come to Ireland. When asked how much we were looking for, the Minister for Finance confirmed that we would be looking for retrospective recapitalisation. However, he refused to give a figure saying "it's clear you've never been to the Fair of Glynn or sold a calf.  Sure, if I told them the minimum, that's what they would give me." Well it appears that we are receiving nothing so is that what we asked for? The reason why this still matters is because at the heart of the budget is the fact that the fiscal leeway for next year is supplied solely by the impact of debt-related issues. As Fianna Fáil’s spokespeople have laid out in detail, interest changes available to all countries and EU-wide reductions in bond yields account for nearly €2 billion in the improved fiscal situation next year. In other words, every single element of the budget which Fine Gael and Labour Deputies have tried and failed to sell to the people depends on getting the handling of debt-related issues right. The evidence is that there is a lot to be concerned about. For various technical reasons, the decision of the Central Bank of Ireland to sell its holding of Irish bonds faster than planned is a short-term windfall but expert commentators are saying that this will come at a medium and long-term cost. In fact, under many conditions, the entirety of the benefit of the promissory note deal could be lost. The Government has so far bet correctly that these issues are too abstract and technical to have a public impact. However, it is also increasing the risk to Ireland, which may be felt sooner rather than later. In a weak moment two years ago, the Taoiseach said in Paris that Ireland was different from other countries because it was not allowed freedom of action on bank recapitalisation and resolution in 2010. He has not repeated it because he saw that the truth undermines his partisan political attacks. The fact remains that the full justice of Ireland's cause on bank-related debt has not been recognised. We have not even been given the benefit of the same deal as one other country in that the ECB does not return to us the profits it makes on our sovereign bonds. Instead of ignoring the issue, the Taoiseach owes it to the Irish people to say exactly what was sought and whether Ireland is still looking for a deal. The summit's discussion about the state of the economy was short and general. The joint Commission and European Investment Bank, EIB, task force is welcome. It is not large enough to lift the overall European economy but it can help if it means that projects get moving faster and co-funding is less of a problem. This raises the question of what Ireland is doing to take advantage of the availability of long-term, low-cost, non-market financing for major investment. As Fianna Fáil pointed out in our budget statement, there is an urgent need for a new investment plan. Our domestic economy desperately needs it. It might not fit the election cycle but it is no less urgent. Instead of using EIB financing simply to pay for elements of the public capital programme which would be funded anyway, it should go into a new programme to support the competitiveness of the economy and tackle long-term social and economic issues. There has been some but not enough flexibility in respect of excessive deficit procedures. Ireland needs to get off the fence and join those countries which are calling for an end to avoidable austerity. Where countries have manageable debt levels, the entire European economy needs them to help stimulate activity. The pro-cyclical, austerity for all approach has failed and will continue to fail. In recent days the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its most conclusive and alarming report yet. Man-made climate change is happening, it is happening fast and its impacts, which are already serious, may become catastrophic unless long-term action is sustained. Under this Government, Ireland has deliberately stepped back from the position of taking an active role in climate change policy. It has made no constructive contribution and has set no vision for how Ireland will achieve its targets. The Taoiseach was right to seek a special acknowledgement of the distinct position of agriculture and in believing that it is wrong to put agricultural omissions on the same level as others. There exists little or no mitigation potential beyond dramatically reducing beef production, something which would impose dramatic social and economic costs and undermine food security targets. However, this matter has not been finalised. It has been acknowledged as a legitimate concern for discussion. Just like the so-called deal on banking debt two years ago, only when the details are worked out, will we know how significant it is. In general, I welcome the Council's increased focus on climate change and energy and the broad agreements that were reached at this summit. The severity of the potential crisis is enormous. The state-controlled Russian company which supplies much of Europe's gas has been attempting for months to try to stop Europe building up its reserves to survive a cut-off. Even the most naïve or compromised observer will now have to admit that Europe's largest energy supplier is willing to use supplies to achieve political aims. The need to diversify supply is no longer just a matter of economic sense, it is vital for the ability to stand against bullies. Ireland should support any proposals to increase storage and capacity for alternative sources. The understanding that a more urgent approach to building interconnection is essential for Europe is welcome. Only then can intermittent supplies be properly integrated into a market which delivers more secure and less expensive energy for Europe's citizens. This has been a crisis which has been developing for many years. The Russian policy of seeking to be a dominant supplier was allowed to proceed, particularly because of the work of some political leaders with close ties to the Putin regime. Now that everyone seems to understand the problem, let us not lose the opportunity to take rapid action. Leaders adopted the formal resolution of appointment for the next European Commission. We wish them well in their important work and hope that President Juncker's early passion will not be allowed to disperse into bureaucratic management. Fianna Fáil would also like to congratulate former Deputy Phil Hogan on being allocated the agriculture portfolio and his success in the Parliament. Through the years, our Commissioners have a unique record of being willing to ignore party labels and work in the broader interest. Different Governments have always been able to develop a constructive relationship with the Irish Commissioner irrespective of who nominated him or her. I appreciate the comments the Taoiseach made about outgoing Commissioner Máire Geoghegan-Quinn who has been exemplary in her approach to her role as Commissioner, particularly in terms of Horizon 2020 and the centrality of research and developments in terms of the future of Europe. The research and development portfolio is arguably the most important portfolio of all and she did an excellent job and linked in with Ireland's universities and institutes of technology, Enterprise Ireland and others on a continual basis to guide them in drawing down funding from FP7 and the various research programmes. I am sure that our new Commissioner will continue this tradition. Commissioner Hogan's appearance at the Parliament was impressive and it is a pity that there was an attempt by some to grandstand for a domestic audience. We wish him well in his work in the Commission. As was seen during the SARS and H1N1 crises, co-operation across Europe in dealing with public health emergencies is absolutely essential. I welcome the discussion which leaders had on Ebola. Under the Lisbon treaty, the Commission has a new role in helping member states with protecting people at a time of disaster or a major threat. This role should be allowed to develop. The decision to use the European Response Coordination Centre as a clearing house is very welcome as is the contribution of the EU and its member states to helping nations with Ebola outbreaks. This contribution will soon reach €1 billion, although I think we could improve on that. I would argue that the international response was too tardy and too late and that there must be concern about the role of the World Health Organization in the early stages of this disease.An internal document was released some time ago regarding the political nature of appointments in the west African countries where Ebola first emerged, the lack of urgency in responding and the lateness of notification to the powers that be in Geneva. Europe could usefully engage with the WHO in terms of learning lessons and having accountability for what happened. As was seen with the news about Nigeria successfully containing the spread of the virus, there is nothing inevitable about this becoming an international epidemic. I welcome the announcement of Irish support for work in west Africa and acknowledge the wonderful work done by Irish aid workers and experts in the worst affected countries. As a nation we should be extremely proud of their contribution. Since we last discussed the situation in Ukraine, direct Russian army intervention succeeded in throwing back government forces and extending the area under de facto Russian control. Unfortunately it appears to be very close to achieving its objective of creating another frozen conflict. In recent months it has been amazing how far some people and parties have gone to avoid attacking Russian aggression against a neighbouring state. Russia has already partitioned and annexed part of Ukraine. In Crimea it is now illegal to state publicly that Crimea should belong to Ukraine. Tartars have been banned from commemorating the genocidal action of Stalin in removing them from the peninsula. The OSCE, an entirely impartial international agency, is still prevented from gaining access to territory under Russian influence. This is old-style imperial aggression and there can be no stepping back from calling it this. In a classic example of Sinn Féin double-speak, it claims to be an anti-imperialist party while criticising everyone but the aggressor in this case. I look forward to Deputy Adams telling his audience at his next fundraising dinner in the United States that country is equally to blame for Russian partition of Ukraine as Vladimir Putin. This is the line Sinn Féin and its partners in the European Parliament once again trotted out when voting against an EU association agreement which has the support of the overwhelming majority of Ukrainian citizens. The EU eventually stumbled onto a set of sanctions which have hurt the increasingly authoritarian and anti-democratic Putin Government. They have clearly caused a step back from further aggression, although provocations against EU members are happening every week. What has been happening in the Baltic and elsewhere is alarming. These sanctions should not be lifted until Russia ends the partition and occupation of Ukraine. In previous debates in this House and in the writing of some commentators, there has been an effort to push a Russian propaganda line about the Ukrainian side being dominated by fascists but this has completely fallen apart because of the results of both the Presidential and now parliamentary elections. In both elections, mainstream democrats overwhelmingly triumphed and the extreme right fared much worse than in many long-established democracies. Not only did the people of Ukraine overwhelmingly vote for committed democrats, they voted for parties and candidates committed to building a permanent relationship with the European Union based on the association agreement. It is time for the Russian apologists and knee-jerk anti-Europeans to admit that the people of Ukraine have freely chosen what they want. Ireland should stand with them against the partition of their country and in support of a democratic future. It is unfortunate that the summit did not take up in a significant way issues relating to the Middle East. Fianna Fáil has tabled a motion calling for Ireland to formally recognise the Palestinian state, and we were successful in this regard in the Seanad. The progress of events and the refusal of the Netanyahu Government to take any constructive steps mean that simply waiting for everything to be sorted before recognising Palestine is no longer an acceptable route forward. Over the decades Ireland has taken a lead in seeking justice for Palestine. We have not been afraid to speak up for the interests of this stateless and impoverished people. Nobody can or should attempt to justify acts of terrorism or indiscriminate bombings. Many people and groups who claim to fight for Palestine have been, in fact, its greatest enemies but the two state solution remains the only long-term solution and it is time to take a stand. I call on the Taoiseach to show some leadership by supporting the call for recognising the state of Palestine. This summit saw another episode in the ongoing anti-EU grandstanding of the British Tory party. Prime Minister Cameron’s tantrum relating to budget contributions was not only ridiculous but also it exposed his strategy as being bereft of any substance. These contributions are linked to agreed technical assessments. They are not controversial. The amount involved is tiny in comparison to the size of the British economy. It could have been brushed aside as a technical matter of no consequence but he chose to be led by his fear of UKIP and the demands of hardline anti-EU newspapers. It is long since past time for him to stop the posturing and publish a statement of his demands for changes in the EU. We cannot continue with a government endlessly saying it will leave unless it gets what it wants even though it has yet to state what it wants. This once again brings to the fore the fact that our own Government has not stated its policy on the bulk of the current debates about the future of the EU. Depending on what happens in the British election, a treaty negotiation may start next year. Let us not wait until then to start our discussion.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	334	It is hardly surprising that the Taoiseach has welcomed the new European Commission. Sinn Féin voted against the Commission because we have serious concerns over its make-up. We regret that it is still suffering from a major democratic deficit and continues to have too much power over EU policy and member states. The hearings have shown that the new Commission will continue on the path of the former Commission and will not shift the current political orientation towards a real social Europe. Jean-Claude Juncker's new European Commission has presented a programme which essentially constitutes a continuation of the failed austerity policies of its predecessor. There is also a major overlap between the private business interests of certain Commissioners and their portfolios. There appears to be a possibility for major conflicts of interest. For example, the Spanish Commissioner, who now has the climate action and energy portfolio, held significant shares in oil companies until a few months ago, and his family members still have shares in oil companies. Will this man be more of a lobbyist for energy companies than a Commissioner for climate action? Sinn Féin also regrets that no progress has been achieved on the representation of women in the Commission team. Of the 28 members of the Commission, 19 are men and nine are women. Even the Taoiseach selected a man to go forward. The EU should be working towards getting a 50-50 gender balance on the Commission. Last month the Government brought forward a budget which rewards the wealthy elite and punishes ordinary working families. It did that in tandem with its punitive and totally unnecessary water charges. The Government has talked up a recovery that appears on the balance sheets but not in the pockets of citizens, particularly those on low and middle incomes. While I suspect that the Government went to this European Council meeting to present a picture of the recession being over and Ireland's economic problems being solved, communities across the State have been ravaged by emigration and towns and villages are marked by dereliction. Astonishingly, it seems the Government wants the Irish people to forget about the prospect of retroactive recapitalisation of Ireland's banking debt. It is not really our debt but was foisted on us. Last month the Government voted down a Sinn Féin amendment to the European Stability Mechanism Act 2012, which would have compelled the Minister for Finance to apply for retroactive recapitalisation. We were told by the Taoiseach and former Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, two years ago that we had achieved a great victory on retroactive recapitalisation, which they called a game changer. Now, however, the Government does not want to discuss the matter. Another European Council meeting has come and gone and, again, the conclusions do not mention any move towards retroactive recapitalisation for Ireland. Did the Taoiseach even raise retroactive recapitalisation during the economic issues section of the European Council meeting? The reality is that the banking debt has cost every man, woman and child in this State €14,000. It is the primary reason why families' incomes have been slashed, public services decimated and thousands of people forced to emigrate. When Sinn Féin pressed the Government on applying for retroactive recapitalisation we were told time after time that we had to wait until the system was in place. It has been now in place since yesterday but the Minister, Deputy Noonan, will not commit to applying to it. The fact that this Government voted down our amendment last month, which simply compelled him to apply for retroactive recapitalisation, adds to our fears that Irish citizens will not see a cent of that banking debt recouped.Fianna Fáil also voted against our amendment. Perhaps the leader of that party will take the time, when he is finished with other distractionary pursuits, to explain why that happened, given previous indications of an intent to support it. Can the Taoiseach confirm today that the Government will apply for retroactive recapitalisation and undertake to inform the Dáil in due course about his plans to do so? I welcome the Irish contribution to the effort to tackle the Ebola crisis. However, we must do more. I commend, in particular, those Irish people who are working in west Africa to alleviate the suffering that is happening there. Poverty is at the core of these problems. It is interesting that none of the United States citizens who contracted Ebola has died. I presume anybody in Dublin who contracted it would likewise survive, notwithstanding the poor quality of our health service. It is poverty that underlies this problem and it is poverty that must be tackled. The Taoiseach made no reference in his statement to the situation in the Middle East. Last month, Martina Anderson, a Sinn Féin MEP, was selected as chairperson of the European Parliament's delegation to Palestine. I hope the Taoiseach will acknowledge and welcome the importance of such a prestigious and important role being placed in the hands of an Irish MEP. In October I met with Dr. Mohammed Maqadama, head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, medical mission in Gaza, who was visiting Ireland. As I detailed yesterday, Dr. Maqadama spoke of how devastating Israel's military bombardment of Gaza was, how medical personnel were directly targeted while on duty, and how much money and goodwill are needed to rebuild Gaza. The Government has been generous to UNRWA and I hope this will continue to be the case. However, its non-policy on this issue amounts to support for the current Israeli regime. The Government's abstention on the UN Human Rights Council motion regarding Israel's indiscriminate bombing of Gaza was a disgrace. Its vote against a motion calling on Israel to sign up to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty degraded Ireland's work on creating a nuclear-weapons-free Middle East. Last Thursday Sweden recognised the state of Palestine. Last month the Seanad passed a motion calling on the Government officially to recognise the state of Palestine. The British House of Commons passed a similar motion and the Spanish Parliament is considering the matter. I have raised this issue regularly with the Taoiseach, the former Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the current Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Will the Taoiseach engage with the Swedish Prime Minister and others on the possibility of getting together a progressive bloc of EU countries to recognise jointly and officially the state of Palestine and thereby restore the potential for a two-state peace process?

The Taoiseach and his party argued for a "Yes" vote on the basis that it would lead to jobs for Irish people. "Yes to Europe, Yes to Jobs" was the slogan on Fine Gael posters throughout the country. We eventually had a "Yes" vote from the electorate, but the jobs have been very slow in coming. Sinn Féin and others called for a "No" vote on the basis that the treaty's provisions would increase the democratic deficit and reduce Ireland's influence and voting powers. As of 1 November, under the provisions of the treaty dealing with the voting system in the Council, key decisions will now be made on a straight population basis. We have moved away from the consensus approach, with a clear shift in power towards the larger states. The new provisions have led to a doubling of Germany's voting weight from 8% to 16% and increased the weights of France, Italy and Britain from 8% each to 12% each. At the same time, the changes have seen a reduction in the voting weight of smaller and middle-sized EU states - in Ireland's case, that reduction is from 2% to 0.8%. Were these changes marked at the European Council meeting? Was the increased democratic deficit discussed or was it business as usual, with the changes written off as progress? Before the European Council meeting, MEPs voted to extend the Council's proposed 2015 budget by €2 billion, a position that may lead to tough negotiations. It is clear from the discussions last year that a minority of influential member states will seek to continue austerity policies and further reduce the EU budget in real terms. Sinn Féin, together with many others across Europe, is of the view that in this time of social and economic crisis the EU needs to invest in and spend more on cohesion projects, creating real jobs, sustainable economic growth, tackling poverty and disadvantage, and addressing the causes of youth unemployment. There are clearly two groups in Europe, one arguing for more stimulus and investment and the other pushing the austerity line. We are all agreed that there is fat to be trimmed from the EU budget. Last month the European Parliament sat in its second home in Strasbourg. This once-a-month travelling circus is estimated to cost nearly €170 million per year. This continues despite the fact that a majority of MEPs are against it and have voted to scrap the Strasbourg Parliament. Surely this is one of the areas in which cuts should be sought, rather than in vitally important social and economic programmes. What position did the Taoiseach take on behalf of the country when the Council discussed the EU budget? Was he on the side of those who want to invest in member states' economies, stimulate economic growth and jobs and improve quality of life for workers and families across the EU? Or did he place Ireland on the side of the harsh austerity advocates who wish to see the budget decreased in a way that will leave it not fit for purpose, failing people and locking more and more citizens into poverty, including intergenerational poverty? The Taoiseach mentioned that the European Council had extensive discussions on the EU's climate and energy policy framework. I welcome the commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030. It is only a first step, however, and, sadly, watered-down energy efficiency and renewable energy targets of 27% were agreed for 2030. We all got a wake-up call this week following the publication of the intergovernmental report on carbon credits, which spoke about pushing for zero carbon emissions by 2100. Some countries spoke out in favour of the report while others began to talk about derogations. People do not want meaningless formulae; they want real action. We have the capacity to move towards a low-carbon economy, but what is lacking is ambition and responsible political leadership. As one of the largest polluting blocs in the world, surely the EU should be playing its part in rectifying our coal and fossil fuel reliance. Will the Taoiseach agree to champion something better than these weak proposals at the next Council meeting, something more in line with the strong binding targets suggested by European parliamentarians? The Taoiseach referred in his statement to increased investment in afforestation. Will he expand on that? We all want to see that type of investment, but there is a difficulty in this regard concerning the State company, Coillte. There was also reference to the nonsense of buying carbon credits from developing and poorer countries.Again, I question the validity of how this nonsensical approach will help our planet. Rich countries and companies will continue to pollute the planet, while smaller and poorer states supposedly offset, through reforestation and so forth, the environmental damage caused by them.

Unfortunately, EU leaders, including the Taoiseach, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French President, François Hollande, do a good impression of fiddling while the world burns. We are hurtling towards an absolute catastrophe. In 30 years the Artic could be ice-free and those who would pay the price would overwhelmingly be those in lesser developed countries and poor people. A recent report by DARA International suggests 100 million people could die by 2030 as a result of climate change. Another recent report from the IPCC, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, confirms what we already know, namely, that the world faces severe, pervasive and irreversible damage caused by global warming, that human activity is the cause and that drastic action is needed to deal with it. According to the chairman of the IPCC, “To keep a good chance of staying below 2 degrees, and at manageable costs, our emissions should drop by 40% to 70% globally between 2010 and 2050, falling to zero or below by 2100.” We need radical action to tackle this issue. The European Union loves to pose as the leading force across the world on climate change. Its ambition and commitment are, however, 1 million miles away from the rhetoric it uses. Accordingly, there was a huge row at the recent Council meeting over haggling as to whether 27% or 30% should be a target for energy efficiency. What we need are binding targets and regulations to ensure a 50% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 80% in 2050. When one reads the Council conclusions, they are entirely focused on the emissions trading scheme, ETS. The ETS is a failure and it is not just those on the left who are saying this. One can read articles in The Economist and the Financial Times stating the same. The ETS saw a massive windfall for some of the largest polluters in Europe because they received carbon credits and were able to sell them on. Electricity and other utility companies earned between €23 billion and €71 billion in windfall profits in phase 2 of the scheme alone. As a consequence, the European Union uses more coal today than it did in 2007, the highest coal consumption levels since the 1960s.  The ETS is not an answer to global warming. It is rooted in the nature of that mechanism which is about the commodification of pollution and nature. It is about the offering of profit opportunities to traders, with no protections for the environment. Major polluting corporations measure their own pollution only nominally and through estimates. They fiddle the figures and there is massive fraud under the ETS in order that the polluting companies make even more money. A recent report in the journal Climatic Change stated a mere 90 companies had produced 63% of the cumulative global emissions of industrial carbon dioxide and methane between 1751 and 2010. They include oil firms such as BP, Chevron, Exxon and Shell, as well as the range of obvious polluters. What we have is profit-driven global warming. If we are serious about tackling climate change, we need system change. There is an attack on democratic rights for the next European Council meeting with the extension of QMV, qualified majority voting, to over 30 policy areas. This is about a concentration of power in Europe within the hands of a small number of countries in the centre. One could now have a majority of member state governments on the periphery opposing certain measures, but they could be overruled by a strong core of right-wing governments pushing in an authoritarian, neoliberal direction for the European Union. Some of these areas are the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Common Security and Defence Policy. One only needs to look to eastern Europe and Ukraine where one sees the reality of an expansionist imperialist vision for the European Union driven by its leaders.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	339	I want to touch briefly on our relationship with the European Union, particularly the fact that we appear to have an inferiority complex. Provided we can abuse the patronage we are given to make appointments to the European Commission, we do pretty much what we are told by the Commission elsewhere. The last time I debated this issue in the House we were about to appoint a Commissioner. It has happened since. I deplore the fact that we parachuted someone into that position whose primary qualification was that he had political loyalty to the Taoiseach, as well as saving his bacon while he was in opposition. Like Deputy Micheál Martin, I applaud the activities of the MEPs Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan and Nessa Childers, as well as others from whatever quarter, who opposed former Deputy Phil Hogan’s ascent to the commissionership. It was right that they should be talking to a domestic audience, exposing the fact that this post was used exclusively by all Governments as the prime prize of political patronage. It is symbolic the way the country is run domestically and when it has the ability to place people in plum jobs in the European Union. We do it here with judges and gardaí and in semi-State bodies and elsewhere. The prize job in the European Union is always taken by someone with a political allegiance to the party in power. It has little to do with his or her qualifications to be a Commissioner. His or her actual job is not considered before he or she is appointed either. It is right that those Irish MEPs, from all political backgrounds, should highlight that this is the way it is done in Ireland and that they oppose it. They are doing the nation a service by exposing it in the European Union and at home.  It is a great pity that the Taoiseach who has done the European Union’s bidding so loyally and faithfully, bowing and scraping to the crowned heads of Europe, was not beating the table in recent weeks when the French and the Italians tried to cheat the deficit targets with which we had been so compliant. It is well known that member states’ individual budgets must be passed by the Commission. The first attempt by the French - France is the second largest economy in Europe - and the Italians - Italy is the third largest - to do so saw them cheat on their deficit targets to which they were committed. The French blatantly said they would breach the deficit to percentage economic output target, while the Italians said they would breach the structural deficit target. What happened then was that the bureaucrats in the Commission, as well as the Germans, became a bit iffy. The two eyeballed them back and, as they are such large nations, they were not told they would have to pay the penalty but to come back with slightly revised and doctored budgets. Contrast this with the case of Ireland which bends over backwards to beat the targets or get well within them. This, of course, exposes the fact that as a small country Ireland is treated differently from the larger countries.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	340	One of the most popular slogans chanted by the 200,000 people who took to the streets at the weekend was: "Enda Kenny in your ivory tower, this is called people power." As the Labour Party in the Seanad rebels against the Government over a referendum on Irish Water and as a crisis is gripping the Government in the face of a massive popular rebellion against the hated water tax, should the Government not be telling its European counterparts that it may not be in government the next time the European Council meets? That is because the people have finally lost patience with the cruel injustice of taking out €8 billion in interest on a debt that is not citizens' debt. It is being sucked out to pay off bondholders and financial institutions in Europe, while ordinary people are being crushed with water taxes, property taxes and all of the other austerity cuts and charges. In all seriousness, should the Minister of State not be telling his European counterparts that he may not be in government the next time the European Council meets because the people have had enough and are rising up against him? It is the supreme irony that Ireland's new European Commissioner was the very Minister whose fingerprints were all over this shambles and fiasco that was Irish Water and the water charges. Does it not say everything about Governments in ivory towers that are utterly out of touch with the people they are supposed to represent that the Minister who was responsible for this debacle has been rewarded with the highest position we can give an Irish politician in the European bureaucracy? It is really beyond belief. In some ways, is this not the answer to the questions European leaders have debated among themselves, namely, why is the European economy on its knees and why is investment down? Why are they panicking now about a lack of growth? The answer to that question is that we do not have the money to invest in the economy to generate real and sustainable economic growth here or elsewhere in Europe because we are being sucked dry by banks and financial institutions. They are sucking €8 billion out of the economy and the pockets of citizens. Similarly, the European economy has been devastated by the cost of putting bankers, bondholders and financial institutions ahead of the needs of ordinary citizens and the need to invest in real economic activity to generate genuine and sustainable economic growth. Instead, the European Union, as well as the current and previous Governments here, have shoved the bubble economy and the corporate vulture economy down our throats for the past 25 years. The Minister of State should take this message to his European counterparts. If they do not lay off and give us a break, he will be swept out of power by a movement of people power. It will not be too long before other governments in Europe face the same rebellion, unless they come out of their ivory towers and listen to the voices of the people.

It is ironic that we have just had a vote in the Seanad on protecting the water supply, but if this agreement goes ahead, the decision of the Irish people or any other European nation to protect its own resources could be in serious jeopardy as a result of the discussions behind the scenes on the TTIP. Every time we try to raise this matter in the Chamber the Government has a standard response, that it would be good for jobs. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, even went so far as to say it would deliver an extra 8,000 jobs for Ireland and that we would see an increase in GDP of 1.1%. These figures were plucked out of the sky and there has been no substantial research to verify them, never mind the bad analysis of GDP, given transfer pricing and profit repatriation, and the nature of the jobs created by the Government.  The TTIP talks serve as a great threat and there is no transparency. The leaked documents from them describe the sensitive alignments that will take place in private meetings of the proposed joint EU-US regulatory forum. That means that anything that will come out on paper will be ignored behind the scenes later. While the Government seems to be determined to keep this issue under wraps, in fairness, Irish farmers have begun to notice that their livelihoods will be in danger if these trade talks and the TTIP agreement go ahead. The harmonisation of agri-business trade legislation will, in essence, will lead to Europe being flooded with previously banned US beef which is not labelled and is filled with genetically modified contents. It will force Irish farmers to lower their standards in order to compete not only with US beef but also to deal with the threat posed by GMO crops. The Taoiseach talks about the agreement being good for us and business, but what does he mean? The reality behind the agreement is that what the Government is calling the removal of trade barriers is actually the removal of protections for the public against multinationals and others interested in making a fast buck. That is really what the agreement is about and I would expect nothing less from Fine Gael, being the party of big business. The Taoiseach sometimes says we need a disputes resolution mechanism, but who is "we"? Is it the people of Egypt whose government was sued by a French multinational for raising the minimum wage? Is it the people of Germany who were sued by the nuclear industry for shutting down the sector? This is the direction in which the Government will go in the case of water services.  It is ironic that the mass movement on 11 October coincided with a movement of European citizens in Hamburg, London, Paris and elsewhere against the TTIP, yet the Minister of State and the Government have not even deigned to discuss these issues in this Chamber, despite the serious threat they pose to Irish citizens.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	343	The first question I would like to ask the Minister of State concerns the separation of sovereign debt from bank debt, now that the single supervisory mechanism is in place. The Taoiseach said repeatedly that once that mechanism was in place, Ireland would apply for retrospective recapitalisation. Over two years ago the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, with the then Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, said a decision by the European Council was a game changer. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said he would not tell anybody what he was looking for. He said he had experience of many markets and fairs and would not announce in advance what he was looking for. We have got nothing and one is tempted to say we did not ask for anything. That is one of the basic questions. Now that the mechanism is in place, has the Government applied for retrospective recapitalisation? Has it pushed the case that Ireland is in a unique position? As the Taoiseach admitted in Paris, the European Union imposed a solution on Ireland which was not imposed on other countries because of its own failings and inability at the time, at a European and eurozone level, to deal with bank resolution issues and banks that were failing. On climate change, the Government states it recognises that afforestation can mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. Will the Minister of State acknowledge that this is an item for further discussion and that the details have to be fleshed out? Will he broadly outline the Government's approach to the climate change agenda in terms of the targets the European Union has set? Third, with regard to the summit meeting, does the Minister of State accept that Russia is leveraging other countries' dependence on Russian oil for political purposes? This is dangerous in terms of the politics and geopolitics of Europe and energy across Europe. We have seen examples of this in the past when the pipe was turned off, and it is worrying that Russia is so cynical in its use of gas and oil reserves to advance its geopolitical agenda. I would appreciate if the Minister of State would comment on that. In his speech, the Taoiseach described the presentation by Mario Draghi, the President of the European Central Bank, as being stark at times in terms of the challenges the eurozone faces. The Taoiseach did not elaborate on that or outline what he meant, and it would be useful if the Minister of State could indicate what the Taoiseach meant by that. How stark was the Governor and what are the implications for the wider economy that the Taoiseach spoke about?

The State is a significant owner of AIB and Permanent TSB, and choices will be made on our options. The Deputy is correct about the specifics of afforestation and climate mitigation. The detail of the overarching targets will be discussed over the period coming up to the international conference in Paris at the end of 2015, but the overarching targets for the European Union as a whole have been set at a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The objective is that Europe would show leadership for other parts of the planet in having a clear target. There have been discussions, but the specifics for any country with respect to afforestation and mitigation have not been decided. Europe is now at level II sanctions against Russia with respect to the conflict in Ukraine. A decision was taken on increasing or reducing the level of sanction at the last Council meeting and a holding pattern was decided on. It is undeniable that Russia has retaliated with sanctions against the European Union and holds a variety of reciprocal sanctions, including those mentioned by Deputy Martin. With regard to the use of the term "stark", we saw in the figures published over the past days that European growth is exceptionally flat. Youth unemployment continues to be very difficult for the Union as a whole, and my understanding is that, given the focus on the economy and the package of €300 billion introduced by President Junker at the next Council meeting in December, the President was marking out the urgency of the situation with respect to unemployment, growth and investment. That is an iteration of the current position, and its starkness was what the Taoiseach was referring to.

Turkish forces attacked Kurds on the Turkish-Syrian border while well-equipped soldiers sat on tanks. The heavy-handed and uneven approach of the Turkish authorities has resulted in the death of 21 Kurdish protesters. Turkey is giving in to international pressure because of drops by Americans on Kobanê. Last month, they bombed Turkish forces in the south-east of Turkey, officially breaking a two-year ceasefire. Was that discussed on the sidelines or at the Council meeting? Is the Government concerned with Turkish policy? The Minister of State can let me know if he cannot answer these questions. Across Europe, people are concerned about this. Ebola was discussed. The focus has moved away from what is happening in African countries and towards European capitals. What would happen if it occurred in Ireland? The readiness of the Mater hospital was discussed. Bob Geldof said that people are not dying of this dirty little virus but dying of poverty. The focus must be on possible famine and food insecurity. Has the Irish Government adopted a position that the focus must be on stopping the virus in Africa, supporting people in Africa and averting a possible famine? I was going to ask about Ukraine, but Deputy Martin has dealt with that. The Council discussed the disgraceful actions of Turkey and its renewal of tensions with regard to the sovereign rights of Cyprus in its economic zone by trying to chart gas deposits. The actions caused the suspension of peace and reunification talks on the island. Was this point raised with the Taoiseach's Cypriot counterpart? Did the Taoiseach give Ireland's full support to the Cypriot people in respect of their sovereignty and the reunification talks process? With regard to Kosovo, news of corruption in the EU rule of law mission in Kosovo, EULEX, leaked out last week and it was reported that top officials had taken bribes from Kosovo gangsters. When two senior officials faced the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee on Monday, they declined to comment on details of the corruption allegations on the grounds that it is an ongoing investigation. Does the Government have a position on this? What is it? Some MEPs are proposing that OLAF, the European Union anti-fraud office, should look into the allegations, while others think the EU should recruit an independent investigator. I have other questions but I am conscious that other Members are trying to speak.

He referred to the European economy as being on the floor and that it needed a massive investment programme in order to stimulate real economic growth. Notwithstanding the fact that the Government is blowing its own trumpet about successes, there will be no sustained recovery if the European economy does not move in a different direction. As we never tire of telling the Government, there is no real recovery for ordinary families who continue to be hammered. Is there any lateral thinking at the discussions as to why this is the case? Why, after six years of a response to an unprecedented economic crisis, have the strategies adopted by the European Union failed to kick-start recovery? This links with the climate change issue. At what point will it dawn on our European partners - and us - that the law in Europe which essentially precludes major public investment in any of these areas is blocking recovery? We can take afforestation as an example. The State forestry company cannot contribute one iota to afforestation because of EU rules which insist on the process happening via the private sector or it will not happen at all. The State company which was established to contribute to afforestation in the country which would contribute in a serious way to reducing the effects of climate change, while creating employment and generating sustainable economic growth, cannot contribute to this process because of EU rules. This is unbelievable. At what point will we stand up and argue that it borders on madness that the vehicle we set up specifically to contribute to afforestation is precluded by the European Union from doing so?  The same principle applies to housing - we cannot build houses for homeless people because there must be matching funding for the private sector. Unless the private sector can make money from engaging in the activity, there will not be enough housing and people will be homeless. This again is related to EU rules. Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach about what was happening in Kobane and I did not receive a straight answer. There is a big campaign across Europe - it is correct - to have the Kurdish PKK delisted from the list of international terrorist organisations. It has been engaged in peace discussions with the Turkish Government for many years and in recent weeks has been the major bulwark on the Turkish-Syrian border against ISIS, the organisation about which everybody in Europe and America is concerned. The Kurdish Peshmerga and PKK are resisting the ISIS offensive in Kobane, but the Turkish Government is frustrating their attempts to defend themselves against ISIS by putting tanks along the border and so on. It would be a major contribution if this country and Europe as a whole acknowledged the Kurdish PKK as a legitimate representative of the Kurdish people. It is fighting a liberation war against ISIS and some of the despotic regimes in the region.

I do not, however, have an update for Deputies in that respect.  The question on Cyprus, to an extent, is similar. At the last minute, the Cypriot Prime Minister took ill, which meant that the level of detail considered in the discussion was curtailed. However, Ireland supports the idea of a bi-zonal and bi-jurisdictional solution being found through negotiation. I agree with the comments made on Ebola. Deputies referred to the focus nationally and within the European Union on protective measures and I take the points made. Equally, every government and state has an obligation to ensure that if, God forbid, there is an issue, hospitals and emergency services will be prepared to deal with it. The level of funding and support for the three main countries affected has been increased and the appropriate Commissioner has been put in charge of co-ordinating efforts. The matter will, once again, be on the agenda for the November General Affairs and Foreign Affairs Councils, as well as the full Council meeting that will take place in December. Deputy Clare Daly is no longer here, but she asked about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership which was not specifically on the agenda last week. Nevertheless, there was a separate informal discussion in Italy which was attended by the American trade representative, Mr. Michael Froman, and Commissioner de Gucht. I also attended the event. The Deputy mentioned that multinationals would benefit from a trade deal, but the sense among all European countries is that because multinationals have the capacity to move between jurisdictions, a trade deal would be more likely to benefit smaller and medium-sized enterprises. The concerns the Deputy raised about the beef industry and classifications are shared by the Government. One approach does not necessarily contradict the other. There is a strong view that the growth generated in Ireland, the European Union and the United States as a result of this deal would be very significant. Perhaps the best example of all to consider is the introduction of the Single Market which was of major benefit to Europe when initiated. As the Taoiseach outlined, the main focus of the General Affairs Council was on the preparation of the climate and energy policy. In this regard there were very significant measures put in place that will be of benefit to Ireland. To summarise, the discussions concerned the principle that there were competing but very important ambitions that all of us shared. We need to protect our very fragile climate and environment, but, equally, there is an obligation on us to ensure food sustainability and security. That competing objective is fundamental to the security of the planet. In this regard, Ireland has secured, through the negotiations of Ministers and particularly the Taoiseach, an acceptance by our European colleagues of a policy on the production of food. We already produce energy-efficient beef and dairy products because the stock is grass-fed and not as intensively farmed as it is in other parts of the world. This is an important point. With the removal of the Common Agricultural Policy, we will be allowed to continue producing in an even more energy-efficient manner the food we require, whether it be dairy or beef products. That was perhaps the most significant point for Ireland, although other measures related to connectivity and afforestation were discussed.  It is difficult for me to address all of the issues raised at a meeting that took place over a number of days.My time is now up, but I think I have covered most of the main areas.

#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	353	I thank the Acting Chairman for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue and the Minister for coming into the House to take it. I have been writing to him and his predecessor for some time about it. I have been representing the views of parents who are constituents of mine in west Cork. I refer to Jessica O'Flynn who is 12 years old and Aoife Murray who is 17. These young girls are waiting operations on their spines. One of them has been waiting since January 2013, while the other, Jessica, has been waiting since October 2013. I understand from Mr. Pat Kiely in Crumlin that under the current resource system, it will take up to two years to clear the current waiting list. Obviously, this cannot be allowed to continue. It is opportune, since the new service plan for the coming year is being drawn up by the HSE and we have just had the budget announced, to plead with the Minister to speak to the HSE to ensure the necessary resources are allocated to ensure the waiting list of spinal deformity cases is dealt with as a priority. It would be much appreciated. The delay in treatment is leading to complications. I am not a medic, although I know the Minister is, but I understand from Mr. Kiely that in one of the cases mentioned the patient is starting to develop respiratory difficulties and that if we delay too long, the case may become a good deal more complicated. He went on to say he was optimistic that a single stage operation would correct the girl's deformity and that, once she had recovered from the surgery, her life would be quite different, as would her overall level of support and function. These are real people, which is the reason I have named them. Real lives are being affected. It is more than a management issue, it is an issue for society. We must not neglect these children. As they are growing, the curvature of their spines must be dealt with. Therefore, I plead with the Minister to act. I look forward to his response.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	354	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for facilitating this debate with the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  I wish to take up a point made by Deputy Jim Daly about there being an optimistic note. He referred to the comment made by Mr. Kiely on the life-changing consequences of the surgery involved. I was at an under-16s football match last weekend when one of the star performers was a young man who three years ago was in exactly the same position as the two girls referred to. This life-changing surgery has enabled him to be a full and active participant in sport, etc. I imagine Deputy Jim Daly will agree that this is not a plea to have these two individual patients plucked from the list and ask the Minister to look after our constituents. I understand there are approximately 120 on the waiting list. It is not the longest in the world, but it is a critical one. It is painful for parents to have to watch their children stoop because of scoliosis and wonder whether they will undergo surgery in time or whether there will be long-term consequences for the health and well-being of their children as a result of the delay. The time is opportune because the HSE is preparing service plans for 2015. Deputy Jim Daly has alluded to the fact that Mr. Kiely has written to his colleagues in Cork and said he is prepared to travel to Cork if he can access theatre space and recuperation facilities, in particular, intensive care unit beds. That is one of the critical issues involved. The waiting list is probably the consequence of the lack of investment for too long in paediatric medicine in the children's hospital. Obviously, we are making progress in this regard, but we need an interim solution. The 120 children involved, including the two young girls referred to by Deputy Jim Daly, Jessica O'Flynn and Aoife Murray, represent the manifestation of the problem in our constituencies. We are familiar with both cases, but I know of others in my constituency. I appeal, therefore, to the Minister. The surgery involved could substantially improve the lives of these young children for the better. They can participate fully in sport and all other activities following successful completion of the surgery. I, therefore, call on the Minister and the HSE in the context of its service plan for 2015 to try to ensure we will have a more efficient system for performing this critical surgery.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	355	I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter and will take the opportunity to outline the Government's position. As a constituent of mine is on the same waiting list, I have some understanding of the matter as a local Deputy, as well as in my role as Minister. Scoliosis in children and young people is predominantly managed at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin. The hospital has an agreed capacity to carry out 58 full spinal cases per year as part of its annual service level agreement with the Health Service Executive. A total of 68 full spinal surgeries were carried out in 2013, ten more than the number for which funded had been provided. In total, 147 procedures were carried out in 2013. It included children who required repeat procedures and rod lengthening, as well as full spinal surgery. Surgery is provided in two full day theatre sessions per week and there are ten specialist orthopaedic beds in Crumlin. There are two orthopaedic consultants, each with a half-time commitment to provide paediatric spinal surgery, providing this service in Crumlin. They have been jointly appointed between Crumlin and the paediatric adolescent adult spinal services at Tallaght. Approximately 5% of cases, predominantly those with neuromuscular disorders, will require high dependency unit or paediatric intensive care unit access after the operation. The average length of stay for a patient having spinal surgery is normally seven to ten days. There has been an increase in the number of outpatient referrals for spinal review and a consequent increase in surgical demands. Hence, waiting times for outpatients and those awaiting scoliosis surgery are challenging. The latest available figures indicate that 1,389 patients are on the waiting list for spinal review, while 190 have been waiting for an outpatient appointment for more than one year. There are target waiting times for surgery, but there are 108 children waiting longer than 20 weeks for this service. The HSE has prioritised a business case for additional capacity for this service. The Department of Health and the HSE are fully conscious of service needs. The resource requirements to address waiting times and service needs are being considered in the context of the 2015 service planning process which is under way. In parallel, the children's hospital group which comprises the hospitals in Crumlin, Temple Street and the paediatric service at Tallaght is working to identify a comprehensive plan for the utilisation of all orthopaedic resources in the two relevant hospitals, Tallaght and Crumlin. This would address needs in the areas of trauma, bone cancer and other orthopaedic requirements, as well as spinal services. The Department and I will work with the HSE to ensure service needs and waiting times in this area will be addressed having regard to the overall level of resources available to the HSE.

Deputy Michael Creed and I have made the case. It is heartbreaking to have parents come to a constituency office in these circumstances. Clearly, they will do anything for their children, as any of us would do for ours. They are completely helpless. Talking to them about resources and such issues is irrelevant. We are talking about real people.Their child has a deformity of the spine, which is curving and getting progressively worse. It is heartbreaking to listen to the parents, who feel so helpless. They are pleading with us as their representatives in this House. Those children do not have a voice here and we are their representatives. I hope we have brought forward the human side to this. I endorse what Deputy Creed said. It is not a case of seeking to take one or two names from the list. There are 120 children involved, all of whom are cherished equally by the State. That waiting list should be attended to as a matter of priority and the necessary resources should be made available in the preparation of the HSE service plan, which is under way at present.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	357	I thank the Minister for his response. It raises an important issue in the context of having sufficient manpower to deal with the issue. Given the outpatient surgical waiting lists and so forth, is the issue whether an adequate number of consultants are appointed in this area? Is that something that must be addressed in conjunction with the issue of access to theatre and post-theatre recovery and intensive care beds? Perhaps this could usefully be pursued by the Minister with the HSE in the context of its service plan for 2015. The common denominator in respect of the cases mentioned is Mr. Kiely in Crumlin hospital. He has indicated a willingness to regionalise his service delivery. In other words, he has communicated with HSE South and his colleagues in Cork that he is prepared to deliver this service in Cork. Obviously, we are more familiar with demand in Cork for the service, but would this help? If there is a logjam in access to theatre facilities in Crumlin, could regionalisation of the service be a way of dealing with it? Mr. Kiely is prepared to travel, so it does not mean we must duplicate manpower. There are two issues here: regionalisation of the service and the adequacy of consultant manpower to deliver the service.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	358	The timing of this debate is quite opportune. It is entirely a coincidence, but I am having a meeting with the chief executive officer of Crumlin hospital in the next couple of hours about orthopaedic surgery, because it is acknowledged to be a problem. At present, 12 children have been waiting longer than a year for scoliosis surgery, which is really unacceptable. However, when we consider projected demand, we can see that it will be necessary to increase the number of cases carried out per year from approximately 58 to 120. It is easy enough to deal with 12 cases, perhaps, but there will be more going onto the list after them, so we must almost double capacity for scoliosis surgery in Crumlin. I do not know enough about how the surgery or after-care work to be able to state whether it could be regionalised. The risk of doing something in two centres rather than one is that there might not be specialised staff in both centres all the time. Perhaps it is or is not doable, but this is something I am aware of and about which I am concerned. We certainly cannot allow a situation to develop whereby children's scoliosis is getting progressively worse, to the extent that they are starting to develop respiratory and neurological problems. I understand that is happening. Needless to say, I am personally concerned about this and I hope it can be addressed in the context of the service plan for next year.
#GabrielleMcFadden	unknown-#GabrielleMcFadden-party	unknown-#GabrielleMcFadden-dob	unknown-#GabrielleMcFadden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	359	I am grateful for the opportunity to address the Minister about the audiology course in Athlone Institute of Technology, AIT. I wish to highlight the urgent need to ensure the BSc honours degree programme in audiology at AIT continues its student intake once the current cohort of students complete their programme in the summer of 2016. Students from the Republic of Ireland traditionally had to go to the UK to gain an educational qualification in audiology by pursuing a BSc degree in audiology, which is the current entry level for an audiologist working in the UK. On foot of this, and worrying reports on the serious scarcity of community audiologists and long waiting lists, one of the programmes proposed during the AIT school of science strategy meeting in 2009 was a level 8 four-year BSc honours degree course in audiology. It was the first of its type in Ireland. At this juncture, AIT, which has the authority to develop, design and validate its own programmes, began a phased development of the BSc honours degree in audiology. The AIT audiology course was subsequently included in the Central Applications Office, CAO, listing for entry in September 2012. The college received public funding of €100,000 to support the programme. However, it appears that the HSE changed its thinking and proposed that the entry-level qualification for an audiologist working in the HSE be a two-year MSc programme, as opposed to an undergraduate course. In the meantime, a cohort of 21 students had commenced their first year in the new course in audiology in the AIT. However, at the end of their first year the programme was facing cancellation because the Higher Education Authority, HEA, said it would not provide funding for work placements. Apparently, they did not meet the new MSc entry level requirement. At the start of August last year the class of audiology students was left in academic limbo after the course was cancelled due to placement and funding issues. Thankfully, a settlement was reached some weeks later in the High Court between AIT, the HSE and the HEA, allowing the cohort of students to continue their four-year course. Unfortunately, once the current cohort of students graduate in summer 2016, the programme will not continue until the situation is resolved to the satisfaction of AIT, the HSE and the HEA. Athlone Institute of Technology has suspended its student intake for the course. The Minister will be aware that the earlier a child is tested, the better the chance of diagnosing a hearing problem and putting in place a programme to ensure the child gets the best opportunity to develop communications skills. In the last few years a senior HSE official said the service was facing significant demand and pointed to research carried out in the UK which showed that between the ages of 71 and 80 years as many as 82% of people have some degree of hearing impairment. Given our aging population, the service will be expected to meet a greatly increased demand from that age group. As the window of opportunity to resolve this issue is getting narrower and there is obviously a clear demand for audiologists in this country, I ask the Minister to give the matter due consideration. We must ensure that the excellent audiology course at Athlone Institute of Technology continues to take in students, which will help in meeting the growing public demand for audiology services.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	360	I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to address the issue of audiology education. The HSE's national audiology review group recommended in 2011 that a domestic programme for audiology be established as a matter of priority. The audiology clinical care programme was tasked with reviewing the workforce numbers and making a recommendation for a BSc versus a MSc programme. The audiology clinical care programme concluded that in view of the relatively small size of the current and proposed workforce, some of whom would in any case be at assistant audiologist level, the long-term sustainability of a primary degree programme was doubtful. Undergraduate programmes with cohorts of less than 15 are financially challenging and sometimes unviable. Due to the limited number of clinical placements and employment opportunities, a larger cohort of students would not be sustainable or necessary. The alternative is for initial training to be through a two-year accelerated MSc degree, as happens in other countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The audiology clinical care programme, with guidance from the Higher Education Authority, concluded that the most effective route for initial training would be an accelerated two-year master's degree programme for students with suitable primary degrees, motivation and disposition. The advantages of a master's over a primary degree for initial training include lower cost, smaller numbers better matched to placement capacity and employment prospects, a better-quality workforce with greater likelihood of future leadership, and research and development linkage. The HSE, in partnership with the Higher Education Authority, undertook a formal process of inviting expressions of interest from higher education institutes in Ireland. University College Cork was selected in 2013, and it will commence the master's programme in 2015. Unfortunately, Athlone Institute of Technology commenced its primary degree programme in 2012 without approval from either the HEA or the HSE.It faced sanction from the HEA in early 2014 as a result of this action. Nevertheless, the Health Service Executive agreed to provide placements for the current cohort of Athlone Institute of Technology students once the course was accredited by an external expert. Since accreditation of the Athlone Institute of Technology course in mid-2014, the clinical lead, the senior clinician in audiology in Ireland, has worked continuously with AIT to arrange placements for the students who will commence their studies in early 2015. In summary, the required domestic framing programme for audiologists in Ireland is at master's degree level. University College Cork was formally selected by the HSE and the HEA to provide this framing and the course will commence in 2015. It will supply a sufficient number of highly qualified graduates per year to maintain the audiology workforce. For this reason, an additional training programme at a lower primary degree level is unnecessary.

Athlone Institute of Technology has received significant professional support from the audiology community, North and South, in taking the initiative in 2010 to offer a degree programme. It should be noted that Athlone Institute of Technology filled a gap that needed to be filled by offering the only full-time BSc audiology course in the country. As the Minister is aware, from a demand point of view, there is a long waiting list for audiology services for both adults and children. I spoke recently to an extremely upset mother whose two and a half year old child had waited 21 months for an audiology appointment before being told that the service could not be provided because no audiologists were available.  At the end of October 2014, an expert independent evaluation report found that the Athlone Institute of Technology programme was on a par with the standards of similar courses in the United Kingdom and other international programmes. The report identified 22 reasons the AIT degree course met the required standards and concluded that its graduates in audiology would be more than able to fulfil any role available in this area. The previous Minister for Health was very impressed with the audiology department in AIT when he visited. I hope the current Minister will keep this matter under review.

Working with the Health Service Executive, the national clinical lead, the most senior clinician for audiology in the State, decided that a master's degree was preferable to a bachelor's degree, and University College Cork, rather than Athlone Institute of Technology, offered such a degree. While I understand that AIT would prefer to have been selected ahead of Cork, the decision was to opt for the higher level master's degree in Cork. If the national clinical lead for audiology takes the view that a bachelor's programme in Athlone is not necessary and the HEA, which comes within the ambit of the Minister for Education and Skills, is not willing to fund the programme in Athlone, my hands are tied.

I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, will be up to speed on proposals to develop Malin Head as a tourist destination. Significant investment has been made recently to develop pathways and improve access to the area. The potential of Malin Head as one of the key tourism destinations in Ireland remains very much untapped. The 100,000 visitors to the area each year are drawn by Malin Head's natural beauty and intrinsic and undeniable advantages. Despite this, the area has been left behind in terms of securing the investment required to allow it to develop further and offer the types of facilities that tourists expect. I commend Bord Fáilte on its Wild Atlantic Way initiative, which offers immense potential for County Donegal and the entire west coast. I also commend the Minister of State and the Government on backing the initiative. Of the 15 key signature discovery points along the Wild Atlantic Way, which stretches from Kinsale Head to Malin Head, three are located in County Donegal. These are Fanad Head and its lighthouse, the Slieve League cliffs and Malin Head. Given that the first two are in receipt of investment funding, I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the key priority now is to ensure investment is also made in Malin Head. Investment proposals have been made by Donegal County Council, working locally with Bord Fáilte. My purpose in raising this issue is to emphasise the importance of allocating funds to the phase two proposal. If such funding is provided, I expect that considerable progress will be made in attracting visitors to County Donegal and delivering economic benefits to local people.  I commend the work of many other organisations which have contributed towards the investment project. Malin Head Community Association has done significant work in trying to bring forward the project, as has the Malin Head working group under the Inishowen Development Partnership. I am working with Councillor Martin McDermott from Malin Head to advance the project. I hope the Minister of State will provide a timeline for the second phase of investment in the area and give a commitment that the Government will work with Bord Fáilte on a third phase that will deliver an iconic project in Malin Head, which will become one of the leading attractions nationwide for tourists.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	364	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for his comments. He is correct that the Wild Atlantic Way is one of the greatest developments that has ever taken place in this country. Its benefits have been visible this year in the thousands of visitors to every corner of the Wild Atlantic Way. As the Deputy is aware, the Wild Atlantic Way is Ireland's first long-distance touring route. It stretches along the Atlantic coast from County Donegal to west Cork. Budget 2014 provided €8 million in capital investment for the development of the route. This funding was directed towards route signage and developing discovery points and other infrastructure on the route. While the route is still being fully developed, the Wild Atlantic Way is already a central part of our overseas promotion. Having visited the World Travel Market in London earlier this week, I assure the Deputy that it was the talk of the overseas tourism trade. That said, given how long it takes to get on the international travel map, I expect it will be next year before the route starts receiving recognition among potential tourists. Following my visit to London, I am satisfied that the Wild Atlantic Way project will bring more overseas visitors to County Donegal, specifically Inishowen. To help make this happen, Fáilte Ireland is working with tourism operators and local communities to help them get the most out of the Wild Atlantic Way. Earlier this year, it held a series of community briefings along the route which outlined the benefits of the project and Fáilte Ireland's long-term development plans. The briefings were very well attended by local tourism operators, stakeholders and community representatives. This year, Fáilte Ireland and Donegal County Council have completed the Wild Atlantic Way signage programme in the Inishowen area. Fáilte Ireland is also working with the council on a programme of remedial works for Wild Atlantic Way discovery points, of which there are 36 in County Donegal, including ten in Inishowen. This work will involve placing markers and information panels and upgrading the appearance of each point. I am also aware that a number of overseas tourism journalists have been brought to Inishowen in recent months, most notably the astronaut Chris Hadfield, whose visit created worldwide coverage for Inishowen. Malin Head is a designated signature point on the Wild Atlantic Way and a key stop on the route. As the Deputy is aware, it is renowned for its rugged coast and attractive beaches and is steeped in history and folklore. The area has something for all tastes, including walking, fishing, swimming and photography. It is also close to Inishowen's splendid golf courses. In regard to capital funding, my Department provides funding to Fáilte Ireland for investment in tourism projects such as the Wild Atlantic Way. However, it is not involved in developing or managing these projects. As the allocation of grant funding is a matter for the board of Fáilte Ireland, I have no role in deciding funding allocations for projects such as Malin Head. I am aware, however, that Fáilte Ireland is working closely with Donegal County Council on the development of Malin Head as part of the Wild Atlantic Way. The council applied to Fáilte Ireland this year for funding for a public service centre and development of the car park area at Malin. The Fáilte Ireland authority is expected to make a decision on this application shortly.

While I know he does not make the decision directly, the funding comes from his Department and I am sure he will emphasise, following this debate, the importance of Malin Head which Bord Fáilte recognises. It is crucial because Malin Head does not have the basic facilities which tourists expect. I have no doubt that when they are put in place we will see a continuation of the increase in tourist numbers we have experienced to date. Timing is important because in order to have in place for next year's tourist season the phase 2 proposals which will see public service areas and new toilet facilities delivered to Malin Head the decision on funding needs to be made in the next number of weeks. I have commended Donegal County Council and Bord Fáilte for the work they have done until now. I emphasise the importance of following that through and seeing the funding delivered in order that the developments are ready for the coming year. The Minister of State outlined the benefits of the Wild Atlantic Way nationally. It is even more important for Donegal because it has not traditionally been able to draw the number of tourists the west or south coasts would see. Many tourists visiting Donegal come from the Giant's Causeway coast and the North. Malin Head, the Slieve League Cliffs and Fanad Head form one fifth of the signature points on the Wild Atlantic Way. The Minister of State said 38 of the 150 key dedicated points on the Wild Atlantic Way are in Donegal. That shows the significant slice the county has of the Wild Atlantic Way. With investment it has the potential to be the single biggest initiative in terms of attracting tourists to the county from the North and the Republic. I ask the Minister of State to ensure he continues in his engagement with Bord Fáilte to emphasise the importance of continued investment. I hope we will soon see investment to develop the facilities in Malin Head.

He is quite correct. Malin and Inishowen connect to the Giant's Causeway route in Northern Ireland which is an all-Ireland tourism project. It means people visiting Ireland can travel North or South, which is very important. I want to see all the signature points on the Wild Atlantic Way developed. Erris in my county of Mayo never saw as many tourists as it did this year, and Achill and Westport were the same. That was because of the Wild Atlantic Way. I know when something is working. Every corner of the country which has a well wants to be part of the Wild Atlantic Way because they know it works. We have to do something for the east and south coasts, but they will not have what is in the Wild Atlantic Way, namely, natural beauty, rugged land-----

We need to make sure we get funding from Government to ensure we can develop the 2,500 km route. There are some exciting plans for Donegal, Mayo, Kerry, Cork and all other places on the Wild Atlantic Way. The work will take a few years. Yesterday I attended the World Travel Market in London. A significant number of people wanted to talk about the Wild Atlantic Way. Large numbers of tourists will come from France, Germany and Europe next year. They love it and cannot get enough of it. It is a great development for the country and we need to continue developing it. Every Deputy on the route has a role to play. We must make sure that local communities know what is happening on the wild Atlantic way because cottage industries will build up around it. There are many hidden gems in the country. Even those living on the Wild Atlantic Way did not realise the beauty of certain parts of their county because they had not visited them for years. It is exciting and good, and something we need to develop to its full potential. It is good for the country and tourism, and will bring the numbers of tourists here that we badly want. There was a 9% increase in tourism numbers in the first nine months of the year. I never thought the day would come, but when I visited London this week people were discussing the fact that there was not enough capacity in Dublin. We did not think three and a half years ago that we would need more hotels in Dublin and the rest of the country.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	371	I tabled this matter last Thursday week when it came to my notice. SICAP contacted me when it saw figures from Pobal. It was a major surprise and shock to people because they heard the Minister, Deputy Howlin, say there would be no cuts in this area in the next budget. I want to get clarification from the Minister that €2 million is to be taken out of this area. I hope that is not the case and that the figure is not higher. The areas affected are at the tip of their collar. Deputy Ó Snodaigh can outline the impact the cut will have on Ballyfermot Canal Community Partnership. If the cut goes ahead the equine centre serving Ballyfermot and Cherry Orchard could loose nearly €80,000 from its funding and will have to close. Is this happening? Will the Minister reverse the cuts? There are deadlines on 13 December, as far as I am aware. On 19 December the tendering process will close for groups or partnerships working with equine centres. This will have an impact on the situation. There is a 25% cap on what can be spent on administration. The organisations concerned feel this is a major handicap, in particular in the first, second or third year of operation, and want to review that with the Minister. They say it is a deterrent to them being able to engage in the tender process, in particular in public areas. Private organisations such as British companies can do it much more easily because they are bigger and their administration costs are much lower. Is Friday, 7 November the cut-off point before which the Minister has the opportunity to reverse the cuts? People are very concerned.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	372	On 16 October 2014 the Minister reiterated his and the Government's commitment to the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP. He lauded the scheme in terms of its ability to create opportunities, provide supports and ease the transition into meaningful employment for the harder to reach in the most disadvantaged areas in society. He announced that €46 million would be invested in 2015 to increase access to formal and informal education activities and resources and to increase people's work readiness and employment prospects. I am sure he recalls those words. Contrary to the fair expectation that, therefore, schemes and projects in the most disadvantaged areas would be protected, we find that in the north inner city of Dublin there has been a cut of 38% in funding. In real terms that is a drop of over €500,000 for projects such as the Lourdes Youth and Community Services in Sean McDermott St., An Síol in the north-west inner city, Nascadh Community Development Project in East Wall, the Cabra Community Development Project and many more.These cuts mean the viability of these projects is under threat.  The headline unemployment figure across the state does not really give an insight into the level of unemployment in many of these disadvantaged areas. In some areas it is as high as 70%. The Minister knows that projects, communities and individuals are dealing with a history of neglect and under-investment. These projects make a real and substantial contribution to the life of the community and the prospects of people in it. I want an explanation from the Minister as to how it is possible that a 38% cut in funding can be made to these projects in the north inner city. I appeal to him to correct this cut and reverse it if that is the decision that has been reached.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	373	Like the other Deputies, I cannot see the logic behind an announcement by the Government that austerity is over and there will be no more cuts, while the equivalent of a cut of €2 million is being made in this vital sector. Deputy McDonald outlined the effects of this in the north inner city and I know from a meeting I attended in Ballyfermot that a potential effect of the cut is the closure of one of the key projects in that area, the equine centre, while another project, the Ballyfermot partnership, will be severely hampered if not undermined. A similar effect will be seen in the Canal Communities Partnership and the Rathmines Partnership. All of these partnerships work in areas which are deemed RAPID areas or have RAPID areas within them. These are areas of severe disadvantage which have higher than the national average unemployment. Poverty levels in these areas are sky-high and alternatives are not available to these projects to breach the funding gap now facing them. Therefore, the equine centre will lose a manager and other staff. While the Minister has set out the logic of tendering and the potential privatisation of community services, that is an ideological debate that we can have some other time. One of the Minister's criteria for projects is that no more than 25% of the allocation should be spent on administration. However, this does not take account of the historical way in which these groups were funded. Different streams of funding were used. The criteria do not allow these projects the opportunity to phase in the changes, because if they submit a tender application by 19 December which includes anything more than 25% funding for administration, it will be ruled out straight away. They do not have an alternative source of funding so they will lose a manager. If a partnership loses a manager, that undermines the cohesion of that partnership and its ability to leverage other funding, as most partnership managers are involved in that. Will the Minister explain the logic behind this and whether there is any potential to move some of the targets and deadlines set so as to allow these groups to make alternative arrangements if possible?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	374	I thank the three Deputies for raising this issue. My Department's local and community development programme, LCDP, is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State. The current programme officially ended at the end of 2013, having operated for four years with funding of €281 million over that period. It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of €47 million, pending the roll-out of the new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, in April 2015. Therefore, this is a gap or interim year. In accordance with the public spending code, legal advice and good practice internationally, and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of the services to clients, the programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently under way. Stage one, expression of interest, has been completed. Stage two, invitation to tender, got under way on 20 October and will involve the successful applicants from stage one being invited to apply to one or more local community development committees in local authority areas to deliver the programme. Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of this extensive procurement process. The SICAP is one of my key priorities on the community side of the Department, and its overall indicative budget for 2015 has been maintained close to 2014 levels. The Deputies should be aware that the indicative SICAP lot budgets are based on a nine-month period from April to December 2015, as opposed to a 12-month period. This may be reflected in some calculations. The 2014 budget for LCDPs was based on a 12-month period. Therefore, we are not comparing apples with apples in some cases. The programme’s target groups are children and families from disadvantaged areas; lone parents; members of new communities, including refugees and asylum seekers; people living in disadvantaged communities; people with disabilities; the Roma community; the unemployed, including those not on the live register; Travellers; and young unemployed people from disadvantaged areas. In allocating resources in the prevailing stringent budgetary situation, I was particularly conscious of the need to support funding levels for the LCDP and SICAP to ensure that resources were allocated in the fairest way possible and to make the maximum contribution to job creation and economic recovery. We may debate the fairest way possible, but we thought this was the fairest way. The Department’s intention is, over time, to use our knowledge of population levels and disadvantage to ensure that available resources are targeted at areas of greatest need. The ultimate ambition is to ensure they go where they are needed most. As a tool to assist with this, a resource allocation model, RAM, has been developed. In order to achieve the objective of moving towards allocating resources according to this model, the Department has in recent years worked to ensure that those areas with the greatest needs based on the RAM are protected, where possible, from cuts and moved towards achieving a fairer share of resources because, under different models, in the past we have had arguments on the allocation of resources. In deciding on funding allocations for SICAP, the principles of the RAM model were used. Overall, the SICAP allocations were lower in some instances than those for LCDP, commensurate with the overall funding available and the demographics of each lot. In instances where the application of the RAM would have resulted in a significant reduction in the funding allocation to a particular lot, my Department modified the results to ensure that the severity of the reduction was minimised. The RAM, underpinned by the Pobal-HAASE deprivation index, which is used in regard to allocations, allows funds to be allocated in a manner which means that a disadvantaged person in any area of the country will have equality of resources available to their area to support their needs. This is the ultimate objective and it is what we are trying to achieve.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	375	The Minister has certainly not explained the position clearly. He says the funding for this year is for the nine months from April to December. What will happen for the three months from January to March? What funding has been allocated for that transition period? We spoke to people on the Ballyfermot and inner city projects today. They say they were never contacted or involved in discussion on this and do not know where the figures were plucked from. They are not based on any figures they handed over to the Department and they do not believe the allocations are based on factual information. They say they need the Minister to reverse the €2 million cut to the SICAP allocation. Otherwise, the equine centre in Ballyfermot will have no manager and will close. The partnership managers who leverage funds and try to support transparency and accountability on projects will not retain their positions either if the Minister does not review the situation quickly. The administration cap of 25% of overall spend must also be reworked and a longer lead-in time must be provided to secure the level of reduction required.There are other points about the innovative community development project. I ask the Minister to meet those involved in the projects in Dublin very soon to tease out the problems.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	376	The Minister read out all of the target groups involved, including children, lone parents, new communities, the unemployed, including the long-term unemployed, and every category he recited is box-ticked for the inner city of Dublin. I am very puzzled by this resource allocation model and how it functions because I cannot for the life of me figure out how such a model could be used to come to the conclusion that a 38% cut is viable, appropriate or merited in the case of the inner city. By the way, the 38% figure takes account of the nine month as opposed to the 12 month allocation and the figure still comes out as 38%. Does the Minister stand over this figure? I take him at his word when he talks about social inclusion and targeting the most disadvantaged. I can tell him that in the inner city of Dublin he will find communities and populations that are, unquestionably, among the most disadvantaged by comparison with anywhere else across the State. We must also bear in mind that, in the absence of a local development company, because the partnership was dismantled and has never been replaced, 15 inner city groups have come together as the Dublin Inner City Community Alliance. If the Minister was to meet them, rather than take my word for it, he would hear at first hand about the devastation this cut is going to cause. Will he meet them? Does he stand over this resource allocation model? He needs to go back and look at it, as there is no way - not a chance - this could merit a 38% cut in the inner city. I ask him to at least agree to meet this group.

In the document I have before me we have annualised the figures and the figures I quoted to the Minister still show a 23% reduction in the case of Ballyfermot. This is the smallest of the allocations, but it is the equivalent of a cut of €163,191. In the case of the canal community and Rathmines partnership, it is the equivalent of a cut of €198,967. These figures are easily obtained and, while figures can often cloud the issue, I can give others for the equine centre or any of the groups dependent on the partnerships. These cuts come on top of others. For example, in the equine centre which potentially could lose its manager there have been six redundancies since 2008. It cannot sustain that level of cuts and will collapse. It is a centre that caters for over 500 children a week and has moved young people from deprivation to employment, which is its purpose. It offers FETAC level 3 and 4 courses and is considering offering level 5 course for some of the children who in many cases do not have alternatives. That is the consequence of the cuts. I, therefore, urge the Minister to look again at this issue in the few short weeks available. He should seek to change the timeframe and the criteria used. In particular, he should look at the 25% figure for administration costs in the context of historical funding, not forever more but in recognition of the fact that there are different funding models and that these groups cannot change overnight, as they are expected to do. The announcement was made on 20 October, yet they are expected to submit a tender document by 19 December.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	378	I know that the Deputies are raising this issue in the right spirit, which I appreciate. On Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh's last comment, the issue has been well flagged for a good period. On the point about the period of three months, to answer the question directly, the previous funding model applied for three months, which is the reason for having a period of nine months. With regard to the resource allocation model, RAM, which uses the HAASE deprivation model index, I will make it available to the Deputies as that is the easiest way for them to scrutinise it, like anybody else. That is the fairest and most appropriate thing to do. The key point is that, under this model, there will be change. The targeting is apolitical and not something that involves political allocations or anything like it. The allocations are assessed. It is an attempt to target the most deprived areas and ensure we have a balance between areas where other resources are available in order that we can intercept appropriately. It is done as fairly as possible, based on high quality, scientific data and is equitable. It deals with population and deprivation indexes across a range of analyses and data. It is important to acknowledge that, if funding was not going to other areas, the Deputies opposite would be asking why it was not going to them. It is the case in one scenario as it is in another. We have to be as fair as possible. We have to ensure the funding goes to the appropriate areas where other resources are available which can be intercepted to get them to where the real problems are. If the group involved sees fit to write to me, I will ensure it receives a fair hearing as a group

#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	382	On the day when the unemployment figures are again showing an improvement and down to 11%, it is important to remember a few of the important points on the taxation measures included in the budget. The measures include the reduction in the top rate of tax from 41% to 40%, the increase in the standard tax rate band by €1,000, the USC rate cuts and the raising of the USC threshold to over €12,000, and the reduction in the pension levy from 0.75% to 0.15%, as well as its planned abolition in 2015. There is also certainty regarding the 12.5% corporation tax rate, which is very important in a constituency like mine, in which there are a number of multinational companies creating and providing employment. There are a number of other positives not included in the Bill such as the decision not to increase the excise duty on alcohol. This is particularly important for the rural pub trade which mounted a strong campaign. We are aware of the importance of rural pubs as focal points for rural communities. I also point to the decision to retain the 9% VAT rate for tourism which, again, is hugely important in parts of my constituency such as Galway city, Connemara, the Aran Islands and Inishbofin Island. On the arts, section 5 of the Bill increases the threshold by €10,000 to €50,000, meaning that the first €50,000 in profits earned by artists will be exempt from income tax. This is an important measure for the arts and the creative sector and, again, hugely important in the constituency of Galway West. Section 11 extends the home renovation incentive to include rental properties and is also hugely important. Some substandard properties are being provided for students and others and this incentive will allow landlords to invest and improve these facilities to make them safer and warmer. I welcome the incentive, given, in particular, the success of the previous incentive provided in the non-landlord and non-rental market. I welcome the decision in section 24 to extend the employment investment incentive scheme to medium-sized companies. We know the importance of micro and medium-sized companies in terms of the employment they create and it is important to extend the incentives available to recognise these important companies. I welcome the decision in section 34 to extend corporation tax relief until the end of 2015.We need to reward entrepreneurship - people who establish new companies, create employment and take that risk. In respect of having a tax code in place that gives them a three-year corporation tax relief, I welcome the decision to extend that up to the end of 2015. With regard to section 28, I welcome the extension of the Living City initiative. The expenditure has been limited to €1.6 million for companies and €400,000 for individuals so as to permit the commencement of the scheme as soon as possible. The limits mean that the initiative comes under a less complex EU state rule regulation. This initiative has already attracted attention in Galway from individuals seeking to restore and renovate homes in older parts of the city, and I certainly welcome that. In respect of agricultural reliefs, I welcome the policy initiated by the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture, Food and the Marine in respect of the agricultural section of the tax regime for farmers. I welcome the initiatives relating to assistance in succession and farm transfer; in section 18, the targeting of agricultural relief from capital acquisitions tax to qualified or full-time farmers or those who wish to lease out land on a long-term basis; in section 44, transfers under the retirement relief and the extension of the eligible letting period of a qualifying asset to 25 years; and for transfers other than to a child under retirement relief, a one-off measure until the end of 2016 deeming conacre or short-term rented land lettings to be eligible. I also welcome section 69, which concerns the extension of stamp duty consanguinity relief to related persons on non-residential transfers to the end of 2017. We know the importance of encouraging land transfer and encouraging young people into farming as our primary industry. We know that next year, with the removal of milk quotas, there will be a significant rush to acquire blocks of land by dairy farmers, and they need to have security and certainty into the future. These initiatives and measures will allow them to secure plots of land on a long-term basis. People will be more willing to lease land long-term because it will be more tax-beneficial for them.  One issue I have concerns about is the definition in the Bill of an active farmer. I would support the cause of the Irish Farmers' Association and its belief that the definition of an active farmer should be amended. It states in the Bill that it relates to people who spend 50% of their time on the farm. There is a lot of off-farm employment, so I would ask that the definition of an active farmer be defined as an individual who is carrying out the trade of farming as set out in the section 655 of the Taxes Consolidation Act. I hope the Minister will look at that in amendments on Committee Stage.

Anyone who came in here in 2011 and saw the figures that were in front of us knows that there were even some people in this House who were looking for sovereign default. The issue of a possible collapse of the euro also arose. It looked as though, if the euro did not collapse, we would certainly be outside it, and if we managed to stay inside the eurozone, there would be a two-tier eurozone, with us in the second tier and the rest of Europe in the first tier. Fast-forward three years and we see a budget that is attempting to give something back. Perhaps we would always like to give an awful lot more back, but one certainly sees the transformation over a three-year period, which must be acknowledged and recognised. It has not been easy. There are very many people out there who over the past number of years and through no fault of their own saw their living standards decimated, with job losses, unemployment and emigration. If nothing else, the budget that was announced two and a half weeks ago must have been okay, because we are not talking about it any more. Two weeks have passed and there is no debate or conversation about the budget we have just had. Obviously, something very positive happened within it. People often ask me what the budget means for them. They are trying to read through all the commentary. I always say the same thing to them. It is probably not as good as what we on this side say, while it is certainly not as bad as what those on the other side say. The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. The fact is that this will give a little something back to everybody. If nothing else, it will hopefully create some confidence - confidence that the years of austerity are finally coming to an end. As someone who is relatively new to politics since being elected to Galway County Council in 2009 and to the House in 2011, I felt there was something different about sitting here two weeks ago listening to the details of a budget that did not involve cuts. That was somewhat different for a person who came into the House in this era of politics. We can finally start to talk about a different situation for our country, and it is something that is very welcome. I would certainly agree with many of the key measures that have already been mentioned by Deputy Kyne. We have set out very clearly where we stand on corporation tax and have moved to allay the fears of other countries and jurisdictions. We still have a huge reliance on foreign direct investment and we need to encourage more of it. Coming from County Galway, like Deputy Kyne, I see the number of multinationals there. We need to make sure they understand the role they play in this country, the role they play in respect of Exchequer figures and the amount of money they contribute, but it is very welcome that we have set out very clearly what we are going to do in that area.  The retention of the 9% VAT rate in the tourism sector is very welcome. It is a very proactive move. I know it is linked to the pension levy, which was a real bugbear for many people. I welcome the fact that the Minister for Finance has moved to remove it over the next two years. I also welcome the reduction in income tax and the USC. I do not think I have ever known a tax that sticks in people's throats like the USC. I understand that it was introduced in an emergency budget in 2008 and that it raises quite a level of income for the Exchequer. However, I would like to see if we could come up with a way, over the next number of years, of improving growth figures while reducing the USC with the intention of removing it. It might be very aspirational but, hopefully, as the country continues to grow, it will happen. We must also be very cognisant of the fact that we still borrow money just to run the country on a daily basis. While we are moving in the right direction, we certainly have a long way to go.  One final issue I would like to address, which was also addressed by Deputy Kyne, concerns the issue of the active farmer. We need to see changes in how that is framed within the Finance Bill. Between 50% and 60% of our farmers are part-time farmers. They need enough farm income to drive up their overall income. We have seen quite a level of investment in infrastructure over the past number of years, so the mantra from now on is "Work smart", not "Work hard". The amount of time farmers need to spend on their farms is not as great as it used to be, but I can assure the House that many of these farmers are as skilled and productive as any full-time farmer, and they should not be discriminated against for that reason. It must be recognised that any farmer out there who is thinking about transferring the farm to his or her son or daughter can still do that. The way it is framed in the Finance Bill needs to change, with amendments on Committee and Report Stages, because the way it is framed now actively discriminates against some young people who want to get into the industry. There is a bright future for agriculture, and the measures announced are very welcome, but let us not put a stumbling block in front of many people who want to help the future of this industry.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	384	I welcome the opportunity to speak about the Finance Bill 2014. We must look at what the essence of this legislation is. I think we all know that it is to give statutory effect to the provisions announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day. That brings us back to the basic question of whether this is a good or a bad Finance Bill. That can only be judged on the basis of whether the budget announced a couple of weeks ago by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform was a good or a bad budget, or a fair budget. It certainly failed the test of fairness. In a nutshell, it was a budget for the high earners, and those on lower incomes suffered. There are some people in Ireland who believe that is good. I do not think so. Are the follow-through pieces of legislation - the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill, which are based on an unfair budget that lacks a social conscience - good or bad Bills? Overall, the Finance Bill is bad legislation, and this House should reject it - and the Social Welfare Bill, when it arrives - because it is the legal implementation of an unfair budget. Many of the fine details in the Finance Bill, which I think is 120 pages long, are very good in their own right. There is a list of them, section by section, covering all the various areas of taxation in Ireland. Many of the individual proposals will not be debated because they are not too controversial and people will be happy enough that some specific measures are going through.Be that as it may, we have a responsibility to assess the overall impact of the budget, the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill. This budget fails the test of fairness. The previous speaker noted that claims on the Government side normally exaggerate the positive impact of a budget, Opposition claims are probably overly pessimistic and the truth is somewhere in between. The truth about this budget is simple. Households earning more than €70,000 are the winners but households with incomes of less than €40,000 per annum, or €800 per week, are losers. This budget and the Finance Bill can be condensed down to that sentence. That is the ethos behind the Bill and it is the reason it should be rejected. I have taken the impact of water charges into account in arriving at those figures. There may be some changes to the universal social charge and child benefit but, while these are all well and good, we cannot ignore the water bills which are due to arrive early in the new year. I acknowledge the Government is in a state of flux and does not know its own mind on that issue. It is probably still looking at the opinion polls. In any event, one cannot divorce the impact of government decisions from people's daily lives. Like the local property tax introduced last year, water charges impact on people's daily lives. The Minister for Finance was forthright in arguing that the impact of water charges should not be lumped into the consideration of the effects of the budget. They are magically off the balance sheet, as if they are not real bills. I do not know where the Government got its fascination with keeping the accounts off balance sheet whenever it wants to do things that the State was able to do in the past. Even the homelessness issue is going to be dealt with off balance sheet. A special vehicle for social housing is to be created through a public private partnership. All of the key areas that a Government should be funding directly out of its capital expenditure and current budgets are now mysteriously going off balance sheet. This reflects the Government's preference to avoid dealing with issues directly and to have somebody else take responsibility. However, the Taoiseach let the genie out of the bag in regard to mixing the two issues when he stated that if we do not proceed with water charges, the top rate of income tax will have to increase by 4%. He has thus clearly linked income tax to water charges. This gives the lie to what his own Ministers have said in previous weeks. They were bravely holding the line in their efforts to keep the two apart but the Taoiseach blew their cover. It is interesting that he referred to the top rate because it would impact on the people he looked after by lowering it, and who are probably his supporters. He wanted to put the fear of God into them. However, these are just funny, off balance sheet figures. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government produced an estimate of €533 million for Government expenditure on water services this year. As there is already income of €222 million from commercial sources, I do not know how we would require an increase of 4% in income tax. However, when people assess the impact of the budget, they will have to include the cost of water charges if they are to follow the Taoiseach's example. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, referred to the provision of tax credits for up to €500 worth of water at 20%, which could be €100 in a year, and will be calculated in arrears on a monthly basis based on the payment cycle. It is possible that one will get a tax credit 24 months after paying a water bill. However, he forgot about all the people who are not in the tax net. Hundreds of thousands of people in employment will not benefit from the social welfare concessions announced by the Minister for Social Protection or from the income tax concessions announced by the Minister for Finance. These are ordinary people who were left out in the Government's rush. People who become unemployed will not benefit because they will not qualify for the free fuel allowance. It is necessary to be long-term unemployed to qualify for that allowance. The Minister is discriminating against people who lose their jobs. I will deal with that issue further when the Social Welfare Bill comes before the House. This is a Finance Bill for high income earners. There is an income tax cut for those on the top rate and everybody else has been left behind or ignored. That suggests a lack of social conscience on the part of the Minister for Finance. Perhaps he believes that people will vote in the next election based on their pockets rather than their social conscience but I suspect, after the difficulties Ireland has encountered in the last several years, that there is a higher level of solidarity among the people. What upsets people is the preaching about the country picking up. As if it was not enough that they were not feeling any benefits in their pockets, they are now being told that others are benefiting.

The health budget will get a mere 0.5% increase in its expenditure ceiling for each of the next three years. As those increases will not keep pace with demographic trends, they will result in real cuts. The Minister for Health has announced that with the introduction of medical cards for children under six years, parents will still have to pay a nominal fee to the doctor. It is not a free medical card if one must hand cash to the doctor to treat a sick child. The reason I want to address the health issue is because I unexpectedly spent more than two hours in the accident and emergency department in Naas General Hospital before I came to the Chamber. I was there with a person who is close to me. One could not get in the door of the department because of all the trolleys lined up in the corridor. This is why the Finance Bill is devoid of social conscience. It should deal with the issue of people on trolleys in accident and emergency department corridors. The phrase, "bed blockers", is often used. There are so many trolleys in Naas, they are blocking the door. These trolleys are occupied by young children and old people, males and females, with insufficient doctors available to treat them. The Minister's answer to this is a tax cut for the wealthy. We will have trickle down economics and they will all be better next year. Can one imagine what signal that is sending out? I agree with Government Deputies that it is good to have resources available to make the choices which were not open to us in previous years but we should have used those resources to do something for the heath services, provide social housing or help the people who are sleeping on the streets less than 200 yards from this building. When a country comes out of a recession, there are economic wounds which cause suffering for many families and individuals. However, there are also social wounds, which are twice as deep and twice as divisive. This budget actually serves to aggravate those social wounds. It might heal the economic wounds for some people on higher incomes, who will be a little better off, but it will exacerbate the social wounds. The budgets for this year and next should have seen the allocation of resources focused on healing some of those festering social wounds. It is not surprising that people are dissatisfied with all the political parties. As they see it, we are not looking after ordinary people. We all are aware of the view that, when it comes to politicians, it is essentially a case of "A plague on all their houses." This is not confined to my party or the Minister of State's party; it is across the board. What is lacking in the budget is a social conscience. It may be the case that the Government intends to take a calculated gamble that people will vote not with their conscience but according to their pockets. Perhaps some will do so, but that is too clinical for me and it is not the way to go about rebuilding our society. People certainly do want to see planning for a recovery, not just minor tweaks here and there. Even though there are some good things in the budget, including a small increase in child benefit, it is really an example of old-style politics. There is no vision and no social conscience, simply gimmicks and a few bob given out here and there. The only thing that was not done was to increase the price of the pint, although cigarettes were hit.

I hoped people had learned a little bit and would want something better from the Oireachtas than a few bob here and there. Several colleagues opposite referred to agricultural relief. I hope the Minister will listen to what has been said on both sides of the House and by the Irish Farmers Association in this regard. Even before the IFA issued a press release, several farmers in my constituency were on to me about the issue. The Finance Bill is full of little nooks and crannies that will help foreign direct investment companies, investment schemes, share schemes, stamp duty schemes, dividend schemes and so on. Farming is our largest industry, but there is much less on offer here for it. There is a problem with the definition of "active farmer". In my own parish and the neighbouring parish there are only a handful of people who are full-time farmers, deriving their entire household income from the land. One must be a dairy farmer on a fairly large scale to be able to do that. Certainly, it is not the norm. I accept that the Minister's intention is good here in that he wants to assist with the hand-over of farms and separate full-time farmers from hobby farmers. Unfortunately, however, the definition he uses is counterproductive. It suggests an individual with an off-farm source of income for which he works a 40-hour week would need to farm for another 40 hours in order to qualify as an active farmer. On the other hand, a farmer with no off-farm employment would have a lower time commitment to qualify, as his or her normal working time might be only 30 hours in some cases. Teagasc has indicated that 43% of cattle-rearing farmers, often known as suckler farmers, have an off-farm source of income. In my local town of Mountrath, the marts now take place midweek and in the evening. After leaving this House on a Wednesday night at 9.30 p.m., I often drive through a Mountrath that is chock-a-block at 11.30 p.m. These are farmers with daytime jobs who must go to a mart that begins at 7.30 p.m. and runs until 12.30 a.m. or 1 a.m. After selling their cattle, they must be up at 7.30 a.m. for their day job before returning home to farm at night. I am not sure how these things can best be measured, but the 40 hour restriction must go. What is happening in Mountrath is happening in towns in every county in Ireland. There are still Friday evening and Saturday marts, but some of the busiest are the evening marts. The definition of "active farmer" should be amended in light of what has been proposed by the IFA, which is in the spirit of what the Minister said he wanted to do. This issue affects farmers in a range of ways, including when it comes to stamp duty relief between family members. There is a big word for it, consanguinity, which does not mean much to most people but is well understood by legal practitioners. We want to make sure people are not caught out in that way. A farmer in his early 60s who came to see me explained how his son has a full-time job but also puts in a lot of hours on the farm. If the son wants to take over the farm, he will either have to give up his job to qualify for the relief or else keep his job and pay the top rate of capital acquisition tax. The problem is that the farm income is not large enough to support both the son and his family as well as his parents. I hope the Minister will make the change that the IFA has proposed. In regard to forestry and clear felling income, there is an issue in that a lot of the income comes in at the very end of the period and can thereby shove people into the high income earner restriction. I submitted a parliamentary question some weeks ago which pointed out that when one sells land for any crop in Ireland, the whole thing is subject to capital gains tax, the exception being where one sells land that is forestry, in which case the land is subject to capital gains tax, but the crop - namely, the trees - is deemed to be income. Forestry crops are treated differently from every other crop, with the former, because it is considered income under the tax code, subject to PRSI and the universal social charge. When one sells land with forestry which is near maturity, as some people have to do, a large chunk of it will be deemed to be income arriving in the one year and will be subject to PRSI, USC and income tax at the top rate. There are many issues to discuss. Many of the details in the Bill are good, but my concern is that it is coming out of an unfair budget.

I will also touch on the relevance of legislation which would introduce mandatory collective bargaining, and the impact of such legislation on what is in this Bill. The relationship between our tax code and corporations, particularly overseas companies, is changing rapidly. What has become clearer in recent weeks is that this is not a situation for which we opted voluntarily. The reasons behind the ending of the so-called double Irish regime have more to do with the OECD and the European Commission than any decision made by Cabinet. In his introduction of the Bill last night, the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, said that the double Irish provision was damaging Ireland's reputation. That is fair enough, but I am less concerned about that than I am about the impact its removal will have on inward investment. The reality is that the OECD rules on base erosion and profit shifting are changing.Sooner or later, Ireland would have had no choice but to bow to certain tax standards. Second, the European Commission has made it absolutely clear that in its opinion the loophole needed to end quickly by opening up an investigation into two specific rulings granted to Apple. Judging from the comments made several weeks ago by the Commissioner in charge of this, it has been going on for some time. This was not a case of Ireland needing to get rid of this tax avoidance scheme because it is the right course of action. This has been coming down the line for some time. We acted on this because, sooner or later, we would have been made to. That is significant because there are other measures over which the Government has unilateral decision-making power. One of those issues directly relates to the companies affected by the ending of the double Irish scheme in this Finance Bill, namely, the inexplicable proposal to introduce mandatory collective bargaining legislation at a time of incredible uncertainty in inward investment and foreign direct investment. Some in government are genuinely concerned about the effect these measures will have on our attractiveness to foreign investment. The week after the Budget Statement, it was announced that the rules governing the special tax incentive to attract foreign executives into Ireland were to be relaxed through the removal of the €500,000 cap for very highly paid executives working here, essentially making it a more attractive place in which to work. The day we end one tax avoidance scheme, we introduce a new tax incentive. This speaks volumes. At the same time, we are planning to introduce a disincentive for those same companies by introducing a provision that might not require mandatory union recognition but would allow unions without representation in the workplace automatically to take a case to the Labour Court. The Labour Court could then take a legally binding decision which could be enforced by the Circuit Court. If this provision is passed, then mark my words, with the environment in the country today, those unions will grab any such new power to justify their own existence. All it will take is one union and one dispute for the rest of them to jump on the bandwagon. I get the impression some people in government have not considered the implications of this at all. Any mandatory collective bargaining legislation - in other words anything that might compound this country’s potential unattractiveness to foreign investment - should be reconsidered immediately. Why is the Government contemplating such mandatory collective bargaining legislation? I examined the law and regulations governing industrial relations. Even from a cursory look, it is clear there is no glaring deficit in this area, no obvious need for reform. There is also fairly widespread agreement on that point. There have been challenges in the Supreme Court and at the International Labour Organisation but at no point has the current system been found to provide insufficient protection for employees or unions. The point is made that we have a voluntarist system when it comes to industrial relations. If we were to bring in a system that would effectively oblige both employees and employers to negotiate via a third party, it would not help. It would only add strains to industrial relations across the country. The relationship between the employer and the employee is already covered extensively by EU and Irish legislation. If the Government persists with mandatory collective bargaining legislation, all that will happen is that those existing protections will become completely subservient. The suggestion is that a union will have the authority to negotiate changes in the terms upon which the employment relationship was founded in the first place. That is unwise, regressive and not positive. The logic behind taking such a step, considering where we are economically and what else is proposed in the Finance Bill, is baffling. In Ireland as it stands, serious and strong protections are already in place when it comes to employees and the right to join a trade union. Those protections are bolstered by the Labour Court and the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA. Enforcing mandatory collective bargaining and de facto trade union recognition is unnecessary. It amounts to a step too far in practical terms considering where the country is at. An employer’s right to disassociate is worth protecting also. Why was this considered in the first place? One union representative gave it away when he said we cannot let the centenary of the 1913 Lock-out pass without some movement on mandatory collective bargaining. In other words, this has more to do with a political ideology than it does with economic necessity. This country can no longer afford that kind of political thinking. Two weeks ago I said in the Chamber that this has more to do with the Labour Party’s political curriculum vitae and policy wish list than anything else, unfortunately. Governing on the basis of marking a commemoration to Jim Larkin is absurd. We no longer have the luxury to legislate for political whims. Much space in today’s newspapers is devoted to predictions on the effect of ending the double Irish tax avoidance scheme in this Finance Bill. The head of Twitter in Ireland said it will be no problem for its company or cause it any grief. The former head of Apple, John Sculley, said yesterday that Ireland needs to retain such measures, however, or else it risks losing its competitive edge. No one knows for sure what impact it will have on our competitiveness and attractiveness when it comes to foreign investment. For that reason, I do not believe the country is in a position to create additional reasons for a company not to locate here. That includes introducing new and unnecessary strains between employers and employees with mandatory collective bargaining measures. Any such legislation needs to be put on hold until we know the effect of this Bill’s proposed other measures on the economy and the companies on which we rely to keep it afloat.
#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	391	For any parent who spends a Sunday night on Skype to their child in Australia or watches their unemployed youngster fiddling with a television remote control watching inane television programmes, and despite the other debates occurring in which a fair bit of self-interest is involved, the only issue in this Finance Bill - the only show in town - is job creation. The great moral responsibility on us as legislators is to create conditions where people can get work. This is the basis on which the Finance Bill should be evaluated. When Fine Gael came into government with the Labour Party, 7,000 jobs a month were being lost. Thankfully, 5,000 jobs are created per month now. Unemployment is now down to 11% but it is still too high. However, it is heading for single figures by the end of our term. We have created 70,000 jobs in the last year with 100,000 in the coming year. Our duty is to parse the Finance Bill and establish in what way will it contribute to further job creation or otherwise.If one looks at the personal taxation measures, taking 80,000 people out of the USC increases their spending power and increases consumer confidence. By virtue of their low income status, which is not their fault, they will tend to spend on domestic, locally produced goods. That will have a hugely beneficial effect on the economy by generating a multiplier. The top rate of tax is reduced from 41% to 40% which incentivises work and increases consumer spending. There is a €1,000 increase in the entry point for the standard rate band to €33,800. That is good in that it provides more discretionary spend, consumer confidence and the money is spent on domestic goods. In addition, one makes work attractive and creates jobs. The budget passes on personal taxation measures. One of the Government's most successful budgetary measures is the 9% VAT rate on the tourism and hospitality sector, which has been maintained. It has proved to be effective and it is thus continuing. In addition, there will be 1,700 new jobs in education. I will turn to the agriculture sector which is so relevant to the Cavan-Monaghan area that I represent. We have 5,279 farms in Cavan with approximately 15,000 people employed directly therein. The sector provides a farm income of €74 million a year to County Cavan. The agri-food sector in Cavan has always been strong and we have 20 large food and drink employers providing 1,860 local jobs. This is something we are proud of. It is my job, as a representative for Cavan, to do everything I can to support, protect and encourage this sector. That is why I am particularly pleased to see a range of measures in this legislation designed to enhance the agriculture sector and ensure that it evolves into a sector that is more efficient and productive. Chapter 4, section 18, lists certain amendments to the tax treatment of farmers. I am particularly pleased to see the clause that deals with the income averaging tax regime and its extension to include farmers who generate income from other trades or professions. There is a provision that said income must come from on-farm diversification and I believe this to be incredibly important. Chapter 6, section 44 deals with capital gains tax retirement relief for farmers. It states that land, which has been leased for up to 25 years, will now qualify for this relief. This will make it more attractive for older farmers to pass their land on to the next generation. This measure involves both job retention and creation. The recent agri-tax review found that the number of farmers under 35 years of age fell by more than 50% between 2000 and 2010. Only 6.2% of all landowners were under the age of 35 years. That has job creation implications and it will change. I also welcome the clause in this section which pertains to land-leasing to non-family members. Providing that this land is leased, under a conacre arrangement, for a minimum of five years or disposed of on or before 31 December 2016, the landowner can avail of capital gains tax retirement relief. That is all excellent news for farmers. Deputy Seán Fleming was very selective in his understanding of the budget. He excluded all the personal taxation measures and the 80,000 people coming out of the USC. I think he is clever enough to read the budget properly, but he is reading it selectively. I agree with Deputy Fleming, however, about the amount of hours people work. I appeal to the Minister for Finance and my good friend the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, to examine that issue. It is the case that farmers invariably work a lot outside the farm. In many instances they may give 35 hours both on and off the farm, thus working a 70 hour week. That situation needs to be examined. The measures concerning capital gains tax exemption for farmers are all positive. In addition, the other agri-measures listed by the Minister all contribute to job creation. A comprehensive package of corporation tax measures will ensure a strengthened flow of multinational investment and jobs. These measures will also ensure we are on course to support up to 50,000 new jobs in 2015. The Bill makes a range of changes to tax incentives for start-ups and SMEs. These incentives will make it easier for new businesses to commence, for established businesses to attract further investment, and will ensure that we achieve our main objective of creating more jobs. Chapter 4, section 23 of the Bill deals with research and development tax credits. It legislates for the removal of the base year restriction, for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015. Research and Development is an incredibly important part of Ireland's corporation tax regime and plays a large role in attracting foreign direct investment into the country. I applaud those developments. I welcome the commitment to remove the base year restriction on this tax credit. It will allow companies to calculate and claim their research and development tax credits without restriction by reference to their research and development expenditure in 2003. This will be a favourable move for our more established foreign direct investors. Chapter 4, section 24, deals with amendments to the employment and investment incentive. One amendment that I want to touch on briefly is the part of this section that deals with the rate of relief, under this scheme, becoming aligned with the revised income tax rates. This will start from 1 January 2015. The employment and investment incentive allows individual investors to claim income tax relief on investments up to a maximum of €150,000 per year. This tax relief can be used for usual trading activities which, in turn, contributes to the creation and maintenance of employment. I note that nursing homes are now able to qualify for the scheme. Commenting on the budget, IBEC said it was a budget for jobseekers and job creators. That is quite an endorsement. There are many more provisions which I do not have time to mention. While I have great respect for the ability and commitment of my colleague, Deputy John Deasy, I do not share his view that mandatory collective bargaining is such a disincentive to foreign direct investment. I personally think that employers with good HR policies and corporate structures will not necessarily be frightened by this. The prevailing economic considerations and European law will still predominate. I do not think mandatory collective bargaining is frightening or such a disincentive. That is my personal view of it. I think it might well work favourably, although that has yet to be tested. The budget's personal taxation measures and its research and development incentives mean the Finance Bill is completely targeted at creating the conditions for creating more jobs. That is how it should be. It is for that reason that I am an enthusiastic supporter of and advocate for the Finance Bill. Some recent debates could provide a distraction from that but there is no greater mandate for this House than to focus on job creation every day. I know that as a teacher, a parent and a public representative.

I will take about seven minutes. Before the 2011 general election, Fine Gael and the Labour Party repeatedly promised a new era of politics, but this is clearly not the case. Not only did the Government carry on the mantle of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party's austerity agenda, but it did so unapologetically and with enthusiasm. They are now telling the public that they have led us into a recovery. This, too, is clearly not the case. This so-called recovery has not reached the cash-strapped pockets of citizens. Try telling a person sleeping on the street in the freezing cold that we are in recovery. Tell it to the person who goes without a mobility scooter because they are no longer provided.The Government should tell it to one of the 9,500 children waiting to be assigned a social care worker, the person struggling to pay his or her mortgage, the woman living in a household in which there is domestic abuse and who has nowhere to go or to one of the 704 elderly citizens lying in a hospital bed awaiting a home care package or a package under the fair deal scheme. The Government should tell it to Members in the Chamber who listen daily to the tales of poverty, fear, hunger, pain and loneliness. The people concerned are suffering because of successive budget cuts. Budget 2015 represents another wasted opportunity to truly make a difference to the lives of those who struggle most.  Last week a UNICEF report showed that child poverty levels had increased in Ireland by 10% since 2008, ranking it 37th out of 41 OECD countries. It equates to 130,000 children falling into poverty or 130,000 children who have not felt the benefits of this recovery about which the Government speaks so proudly. The report also stated people did not believe children in Ireland had the opportunity to learn and grow every day. Children, specifically those from lower income families, are paying a disproportionate price for the collapse of the banking system and the Government's subsequent unwavering commitment to austerity. In its alternative budget Sinn Féin outlined fully costed measures that the Government should have introduced to address the issue of rising poverty levels. Lower income families are in desperate need of a reprieve, but the Government has been unrelenting in budget 2015 in targeting them once again. How can the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government stand over policies that decrease a child's chances to have a better future? The Government is creating a continuous cycle of poverty. Children who grow up in poverty are more likely to be impoverished adults who, as a result, will raise their children in the same conditions. That is unacceptable. Some 28.6% of Irish children are living in poverty. That is nothing to be proud of and no Minister or Deputy can spin that fact to suit his or her agenda. The Government has a duty and mandate to protect those who cannot protect themselves, but it has failed to do so. While child benefit is set to rise by €5 a month per child, this will only go some of the way to reverse the cruel cuts made to child benefit, despite the Labour Party's promises that protecting child benefit was a red line issue. Does it have red line issues anymore or has the line between it and Fine Gael disappeared completely? How many families are struggling to put food on the table, send their children to school or provide a warm, stable home? Those who were asked to give most to fuel recovery have not seen a benefit. In fact, the Government rewarded higher earners. Sinn Féin's alternative budget showed how budget 2015 could have been much better for low and middle income earners. We have advocated consistently for investment rather than austerity. The Government chose to ignore us to try to discredit us, which is shameful. There is more to this than political point scoring. The Government's budgetary measures since taking office have impacted badly on families and individuals all across the State. Communities have been wrecked, hollowed out by the effects of mass emigration. We have sent our young people abroad; even though they never contributed to its cause, they have been forced to bear the brunt of the recession. That was the Government's political decision. It chose to protect higher earners in successive budgets and has done so again in this one. It chose emigration over the creation of long-term, meaningful employment. We have lost a generation who fill jobs all across the world. Our young people are contributing to other economies, living lives in other communities and seeking better opportunities. The Government left them with no choice.  Last weekend we saw over 100,000 people marching on the streets across the State in opposition to water charges. As water is already being paid for, the new charge is merely a doubling up of the cost. The people have spoken on the issue. Sinn Féin demonstrated that the Government could end both the property tax and water charges and put €800 million into the economy and the pockets of struggling families. The water charge is essentially a tax on a resource that is, fundamentally, a human right. The Government failed to scrap these charges in the budget, despite the will of the people who had elected it. This is another missed opportunity, one that will cost the Government gravely when the people go from the streets to the ballot box. Each one of us in the Chamber is elected on a platform of policies outlined during an election campaign. Political representation is about political choices. The political choices made by the Government have resulted in a less equal society. Sinn Féin's alternative budget sets out many ways by which we would make different choices, with fairer and more sustainable ways of meeting the State's deficit targets. In addition to scrapping property tax and water charges, Sinn Féin committed to exempting from the universal social charge the 296,000 low paid workers who earn between €193 and €337. We would introduce a third rate of income tax of 48% on incomes over €100,000, raising an additional €448 million, and reintroduce the second home charge at €400 per year, with other measures, including increases in betting tax. In total, the measures contained in our alternative budget would raise an additional €1.7 billion. Crucially, over €1 billion would be put back into the pockets of ordinary working people. This would reverse the growing inequality and poverty in society. It would also help local economies and save jobs.

I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the Finance Bill which implements many of the measures announced in the budget. A number of measures must be welcomed. As someone who advocated strongly at all levels for a return of the Christmas bonus to social welfare recipients, I am glad that a start has been made in that regard. Some 25% of the money is to be returned this year and I hope a further 25% will be returned next year to assist people on fixed incomes at a time of year when they face significant additional demands and pressures. Likewise, the living alone allowance has not been increased for many years. Efforts must be made to increase it on a regular basis. People living alone must purchase everything; there is no sharing of costs and they find themselves in challenging situations. It is time to reward all citizens, including those on fixed incomes and those who work hard and were subject to unrelenting cutbacks and reductions in the past six years. They made extraordinary sacrifices to rescue the country and must see some of the benefits that will accrue in the coming years. I hope some of the tax adjustments and alleviating measures provided for in the Bill will be felt by these taxpayers when they start to receive their wage packets in January. It should be the commencement of a sustained restoration. We need a fair, efficient, effective and competitive tax system that rewards enterprise and contributes to economic growth and job creation. The securing of a properly paid job is the best route out of poverty. Tackling the scourge of unemployment must remain the number one priority. While progress has been made, it is not uniform and in many areas of the country there are significant pockets of unemployed persons, especially in rural areas, who are not feeling the fruits of the recovery and must not be left out. Everyone is entitled to a fair shake. The State agencies, including IDA Ireland, seem to focus on the major towns and cities. We cannot compel foreign enterprise owners or entrepreneurs to locate in an identified area. However, it seems that, unless there is a seat of learning, a college or third level education infrastructure of some description in a town, the chances of encouraging IDA Ireland companies to locate are remote. I appeal to IDA Ireland to redouble its efforts in Mullingar. We have the facilities, including an excellently appointed park of over 20 acres. We are glad to see a local entrepreneur building on it. It is important to continue to focus on this issue and I call on IDA Ireland to do so with greater vigour. In this context, I welcome the setting up of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. The idea was developed and promulgated by me on behalf of the Labour Party when I was its spokesperson on enterprise and employment. It focused on a strategic investment bank, which is a bigger idea, but the allocation of €800 million in funding for Irish SMEs will be used to provide tailored loans and innovative financial products for SMEs at favourable rates. These businesses have struggled to obtain the credit they need. Start-ups, in particular, have struggled in this regard. I hope there will be no blockages or obstacles in the distribution of the finance to worthy projects.Will the funding be made available to financial institutions other than the pillar banks for distribution to applicants such as entrepreneurs and the people behind start-up companies? There is currently an advertisement on television for AIB, a bank that needed one of the bigger State bailouts. In the advertisement, self-employed people in small businesses are described as brave. The bank is giving the impression that it is eager to lend to self-employed people, but the experience of many self-employed people is that whatever money is lent to them will come at a high interest rate and there may be a requirement for personal guarantees. If the bailed-out banks were lending to the self-employed and small businesses, the Government would not have needed to set up the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. It is clear that repairing their balance sheets is more important to banks than lending for job creation. I know a business whose owners tried valiantly to get money from AIB but failed to do so. Lip service is continuously paid to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and the self-employed, which are responsible for 69% of the workforce. That is well and good, but action speaks louder than words, especially as the self-employed have been hammered in this budget. The universal social charge has been imposed at the top rate of 11% for self-employed people, while a person who is not self-employed is charged a top rate of 8%. This is a serious matter. Much of the budget discussion focused on taxation of multinational enterprises, but although these companies account for a large proportion of exports, they employ only a small share of our workforce; 99% of Irish-owned firms are SMEs and 69% of private-sector workers are employed by SMEs. Employment in SMEs has fallen much further since 2008 than the corresponding rate for multinationals. Future economic growth depends on SMEs and our individual entrepreneurs, but despite a great deal of rhetoric about the importance of the self-employed and SMEs, some of the provisions of the budget are detrimental to the sector. There is no possible justification for the 11% USC rate to be imposed on the self-employed, particularly as they are not entitled to the same level of benefits as those people on lower rates. Given the outrage about the low levels of corporation tax paid by Apple and other multinational companies, it is worth noting that the 11% rate paid by a self-employed person earning more than €100,000 is approximately the same as the percentage of profits paid in tax by multinationals. Unlike the multinationals, however, the self-employed person faces a 40% marginal rate of income tax in addition to PRSI contributions. What is the justification for a marginal income tax rate of 55% for self-employed people? As a PAYE worker, I pay a marginal rate of 52%. It could be argued that, given the level of insecurity and risk that the self-employed have, they should pay a lower marginal rate than those people in secure employment. Some left-wing politicians and commentators seem to think all self-employed people are well off, when some take home little more than what they would earn on the minimum wage. The tax system has changed since the 1980s and 1990s, when the PAYE tax credit was introduced, and it is time for this to be made available to self-employed people. Despite the rhetoric we constantly hear that Government policy should support the self-employed and people setting up small businesses, the income tax system discriminates shamefully against the self-employed. A self-employed worker with annual earnings of €15,000 - less than the average industrial wage, which we all want to rise above €30,000 - will next year pay 14.9% of his or her gross income in tax. If I worked in a job on that wage in the PAYE sector, I would have to pay 1.9% of my gross income in tax. The self-employed person will pay €2,235, which is almost eight times the €285 that I would pay if I earned that wage. The self-employed person would also be entitled to fewer benefits despite his or her larger tax contribution. After the collapse of the building industry in 2008, many self-employed building workers found themselves almost destitute. Despite having paid substantial amounts of income tax, they found that in some cases they were eligible only for strictly means-tested supplementary welfare allowances. Far from being a path to riches, being self-employed or establishing a small business in Ireland is often a high-risk activity with little return. One of the most misleading figures quoted about Irish industry is that it is the most profitable in the European Union. When the multinationals are removed from the picture, Irish firms are among the least profitable in the European Union, as they are third from the bottom of the list, above only Lithuania and France. Employer PRSI is low in Ireland, but other business costs such as energy and professional services are among the highest in the European Union. I have always called for a mandatory social welfare system to be introduced for the sector, with self-employed people paying for it. They would not be afraid to do so. The biggest social issue facing us as a people is the scarcity of housing, especially social housing. More than 100,000 of our citizens do not have access to housing, with many more living in substandard accommodation. This has come about because of a withdrawal from the construction of social housing by central Government, and I am glad to see a proposal to spend over €2.2 billion on public sector housing over the next three years. This will give much-needed employment, especially in rural areas, but these allocations should be unbundled so as to allow small, tax-compliant and efficient building contractors to get into a position to tender for smaller bundles of housing projects. The €2.2 billion figure is clearly inadequate, as it will provide approximately 10,000 new public housing units. That amount must be at least doubled in order to tackle the housing crisis. My colleague, Deputy Brendan Ryan, brought forward a very worthwhile document in this regard and we must implement its recommendations in order to tackle this crisis. In my county of Westmeath, up to 3,000 households are now on the housing list, and this must be addressed by a sustained house-building programme. With rents increasing, the problem will get worse as more people seek social housing. The issue can no longer be put on the long finger. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, clearly understands the matter, and I have every confidence in his ability and vision to tackle it wholeheartedly. I welcome the commitment to end the pension levy next year. This will give some degree of certainty to people with a pension, who felt deeply aggrieved because of this imposition. There are a multitude of pension issues to be addressed, and whatever the shape or membership of any future Government, it will have to confront a related issue. Some of the loony-bin economic theories will not be of much use in this complex area. What will happen when the social insurance fund deficit, which is approximately €320 billion, has to be considered as part of the overall Government finances? This will happen in 2017 under EU rules. It is important to recognise the role of agriculture and the efforts of the farming community to achieve the targets set out in Harvest 2020. The abolition of milk quotas next April will be an opportunity in this regard. I especially welcome the increase in the period of income averaging from three to five years from 2015, with a 50% increase in the amount of income that can be exempted for the purpose of qualifying long-term leases taken out after 1 January. The lower age threshold of 40 years has been removed in the eligibility requirements for the long-term leasing tax relief. I also endorse what was said about active farmers with regard to the taxation review. I urge the Minister of State to amend this.
#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	395	I will make some brief comments on the Finance Bill which is the legislation that underpins the first budget that takes Ireland firmly from crash back to recovery. This recovery is clear from figures indicating GDP growth of 4.7% in 2014 and 3.9% in 2015. There will be 1.92 million people at work at end of 2014, an increase of 80,000 since the low point in 2012. An additional 48,000 jobs are forecast by end of 2015. There are a number of positive aspects of the budget that I want to emphasise. In budget 2015, all the levers of the tax
system, including tax
thresholds, bands and rates, have been utilised to target reliefs squarely at low- and middle-income workers and households. With regard to single PAYE workers, for example, a person earning €25,000 will see a 4.6% reduction in his or her total tax bill, including income tax, USC and PRSI. A single person earning €45,000 will see a 3.9% reduction in the bill and a person on €70,000 will see his or her total tax bill reduced by 2.9%. Similarly, a married couple on one income of €25,000 in the PAYE sector will see a reduction of 8.4% in the total tax paid. A similar couple on €45,000 will see a 5% reduction, with a couple on €70,000 receiving a 3.1% reduction in the total tax bill. This is clearly a progressive package of tax measures. More tax is being paid by the highest income earners than at the lower end, and the bottom line is that reliefs have been targeted at low- and middle-income workers. This highlights the Government's commitment to ensuring that low- and middle-income earners and families are prioritised when it comes to feeling the benefit of the emerging recovery in their pockets. In budget 2015 a relief from deposit interest retention tax, better known as DIRT, for first-time house buyers was announced, which is welcome. This applies to savings used by first-time house buyers towards the deposit on a house. This is to apply to houses bought between October 2014 and 31 December 2017. The refund of DIRT will be for up to four years prior to the purchase date and will apply to the amount of DIRT charged on deposits, up to the value of 20% of the purchase price. For example, if a house costs €200,000, a first-time buyer will be able to claim a refund of DIRT paid on the first €40,000 that he or she had on deposit up to the date of purchase. The refund will be for a period up to four years.Therefore, if €40,000 was in an account that was to be used to pay a deposit on a house and that account paid 3% interest, that would mean deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, of about €1,600 over four years. Under this refund scheme that €1,600 would be refunded by Revenue to the first-time house buyer. A total of €808 million is allocated for housing programmes, which is a huge investment and the first step towards serious and significant investment over the next number of years in social housing. I welcome this aspect of the budget in particular - it is of great importance given the housing crisis that is so evident and about which I am approached every day. Local authorities are to provide 946 housing units through direct building and acquisition and 440 housing units will be provided through voluntary housing bodies and co-operatives. Up to 150 new homes will be provided in the community for people with disabilities who are leaving institutional care and 400 new housing units will be provided for people with specific needs. Some €40.4 million will be provided for approximately 7,600 housing adaptation grants for older people and people with disabilities. Some 1,000 vacant housing units will be refurbished and brought back into use in 2015 and an extra €3 million will be provided for regeneration and remedial works in disadvantaged communities. It is expected that 8,000 households will transfer from rent supplements to the new housing assistance payment and up to 2,000 new transfers are expected under the rental accommodation scheme. I welcome the extension of the home renovation incentive to include rental properties as it will result in better accommodation and living standards in the private rented sector. Much attention has been paid to the soon to be abolished double Irish tax scheme. I am glad to see that this scheme is being changed as I believe it did reputational damage to Ireland. It angered overseas governments because it allowed multinational companies to channel untaxed revenues to Irish subsidiary companies, which then paid the money to another company registered in Ireland that is tax resident elsewhere, usually a tax haven such as Bermuda. In short, it was a tax loophole and it needed to be closed. The 12.5% corporation tax rate, which is a cornerstone of the Government's foreign direct investment strategy, will not change and I welcome this. I also welcome the social welfare improvements announced in budget 2015, such as the beginning of the restoration of the Christmas bonus paid to long-term social welfare recipients. They will receive a 25% bonus this Christmas. In 2015, some €1.97 billion will be paid out for the child benefit allowance with 613,000 families getting an extra €5 per child per month. The living alone allowance for 177,500 pensioners and people with disabilities will be increased to €9 per week. I commend the Bill to the House. I see it as the beginning of the way forward for an Ireland in recovery.
#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	396	With every budget the old maxim applies that the devil is in the detail and the detail of the budget is usually in the Finance Bill. In examining this Bill, it is clear that it does include measures that will begin to ease some of the burden for ordinary people. In the past few years the difficult economic adjustments undertaken through the troika programme have taken billions of euro out of the economy through tax rises and spending cuts. This budget is the first without the troika's hands on it and we have, albeit in a modest and responsible way, been able to provide some relief to hard-pressed families. I am encouraged by the content of this Bill with regards to income tax and the universal social charge, USC. Every person in the State who pays these charges will benefit from the changes in this Bill. One criticism of successive budgets is that they have widened the gap between rich and poor and that the tax system has been regressive. This budget has begun to move the burden of distribution back in a more progressive direction and I very much welcome this. For example, after the implementation of this budget, the 1% of all earners in the State on over €200,000 will account for 21% of all taxes paid in 2015 - this is up from 19% in 2014. The 6% of all earners on over €100,000 will account for 44% of all taxes paid in 2015 - this is up from 42% in 2014. The 76% of all earners on under €50,000 will account for 20% of all taxes paid in 2015 - this is down from 21% in 2014. Also, the benefit of decreasing income tax for high earners is capped at €70,000. The pension levy will be phased out by the end of 2015 and I know this will be welcomed by a lot of people, particularly retired older people. The introduction of the pension levy helped fund a VAT reduction in the hospitality sector and this helped instil buoyancy into our tourism market which, in turn, helped with the retention and creation of jobs in the tourism sector. As we are returning to growth, I welcome the fact that this levy is being phased out as this measure will benefit up to 750,000 people. Allied to this, a further 80,000 of the lowest earners in our economy will be removed from the USC and this will help many low earners, including part-time workers. When this budget was announced I received a call from a Labour Party supporter in university who supplements her studies with part-time work. She was grateful for the changes in the USC as it will help her meet the costs of attending college. I am also happy that there has been no increase in the old reliable taxes on petrol and diesel. The cost of putting fuel into a car is very high and is prohibitive for some. I believe these duties need to be examined in future budgets with a view to making commuting more affordable. We need to make it more affordable for people to travel to and from work, to leave their children at school and to go shopping in our local towns and villages. I represent a large rural area in north County Dublin and transport to urban centres is a key concern as people need their cars in order to engage with the local economy. I think we need to look at reducing these duties in future budgets. Before the economic crash we had some of the cheapest motor fuel costs in Europe and, while our entire taxation system has had to change after the neglect of Fianna Fáil, we are now in a situation where up to 60% of the money we pay for motor fuel goes to the Exchequer. As the economy improves, I believe this should be re-examined with a view to reducing this burden on people. I wish to say a word on the plight of road hauliers who see themselves at a competitive disadvantage relative to their counterparts in Northern Ireland and in mainland Britain - I have several in my constituency. Although I understand from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, that a working group is in place to look at the issue, there is disappointment that the pace of progress is slow and that the matter was not dealt with in the context of budget 2015. I wish to speak about the need for further assistance for people in paying water charges. I know we are awaiting further clarification from the Cabinet regarding the charges and I am conscious of speaking on this when we do not have full clarity yet. However, I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of the inclusion in this Bill of a refundable tax credit in respect of water charges, as proposed by SIPTU and the Nevin Economic Research Institute. Perhaps this could be done on Committee stage. We need to ensure water charges are clear and, most important, affordable. The Irish Water debate has dominated the airwaves in the past few weeks and I understand many of the concerns people have. I welcome the initial intention to provide a water support payment and I look forward to further clarification from the Cabinet in the coming days and weeks.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	397	This budget and Finance Bill, like the Government's three earlier budgets, yet again increases the regressive and unfair nature of the taxation system. Those who claim we have a progressive tax system do so on the basis of a sleight of hand - when they refer to the tax system they exclusively mean income tax, the universal social charge and pay related social insurance, PRSI. This allows them to claim that a small number of high earners pay the bulk of taxation and that working people on low incomes and people in receipt of social welfare benefits pay no taxes. This is completely untrue and those who consciously peddle such ideas are spreading an untruth. Examination of indirect taxes and consumption taxes such as VAT which accounts for 20% of the State's total tax take, along with various charges and services that are actually taxes, shows that the wealthiest families in Ireland pay out some 28% of their incomes in taxes. Meanwhile, using the same measurement, the poorest families also pay out 28% of their total incomes in taxes. This Government continually uses false arguments and the deliberate distortion of figures to make the Irish tax system increasingly regressive and to justify tax cuts which, of course, means cuts in income tax. If we examine the cuts in income tax made in the budget and how they affect people with different levels of income it is immediately apparent that they are regressive in nature. Total income tax cuts in the budget amounted to €688 million and if they had been evenly applied they would have meant a gain of €405 per year for working families. However, the cuts were not evenly applied. A single worker on the living wage of €23,247 per year gained €173 per week in the budget while a worker on €80,000 per year gained €747, five times as much, from the tax cut.For the lower income worker, it immediately wipes out a benefit since the Government is trying to introduce the water tax. Its presumption is that it will get the water tax in, but I have a different presumption. For workers earning €15,000, the net change, after water charges, is minus €61, according to the numbers of the Commission for Energy Regulation, while for a worker earning €70,000, after the budget and water charges, the net income gain will be €570. That is the difference and how fair the Government's budget has been. Let us consider all of the figures, for example, those for working couples and those with children. The more a person earns the more he or she will gain. Another element in making the overall tax system regressive is the preoccupation with low corporate taxes. Low corporate taxes are supposed to incentivise investment, which means higher productivity, economic growth and job creation. The problem is that this is not backed up by the evidence. The OECD has seen a significant fall in corporation tax rates. In 1981 the OECD member average rate was 49%; in 2012 it was 34%, far above the Irish rate of 12.5%. With the exception of a number of years in the 1990s, the level of investment and growth was lower in the 32 year period since 1981 than in the previous 30 years. Low taxes on business are not proof in the worst economic crisis since the OECD was formed. Let us consider the position in Ireland. The pattern is similar. The 12.5% corporation tax rate was in place in 2003. According to the theory, it should have led to high investment, high growth and full employment. In the ten years since 2003 the reality is that we have the lowest growth rate in the history of the State, the lowest rate of investment, seen the biggest crash and the highest level of unemployment. We need a new model for the economy and society. We need to put people's interests before those of big business and the wealthy. A point was made about how in the case of the fundamentals the devil was in the detail. The devil is in the detail when it comes to VAT and other cuts. Families are forced to pay the property tax, the household tax and the water tax that the Government intends to bring in. What happens in society in general and what has happened recently is that the wealthy have become wealthier. The richest 85 people in the world added a collective €668 million per day to their wealth in the past year according to the charity Oxfam. The study concluded that global inequality was firing out of control as the number of billionaires had doubled during the period of the economic crisis. In March 2009 there were 793 billionaires throughout the world, but as of March 2014 the number had rocketed to 1,645. That is the type of society in which we are living and the type of society in which the budget has been framed. It is the same in Ireland. According to the Irish rich list of the Sunday Independent, the 300 wealthiest individuals in the country were worth €57 billion in 2011; in 2014 they are worth €70.75 billion. That is the extent of the wealth they have gained during the period of austerity on the backs of ordinary people who in the past eight years have had to take the brunt of the €30 billion in cuts in their pockets. That is not fair; the budget is not fair and the Finance Bill is not fair. These are the fundamentals that need to be addressed to apply real equality or have any move towards equality in people's pockets. We need a fair and progressive taxation system under which the wealthy pay their fair share. A mere 1% wealth tax on €70 billion would raise €7 billion. A financial transaction tax has been mentioned many times in the Dáil. If it was set at 0.1%, it would bring in €500 million. The Government has choices, but it has not made them. It has listened to the troika, the OECD and the ECB, but it has not listened to the people. Its priority is to protect the wealthy in society and it will continue to protect them in the coming period, rather than protecting the majority from the worst austerity and then when the opportunity comes, give them some gain in their pockets. However, it has not done this; the budget does not do it; neither does the Finance Bill. Therefore, I have to oppose it.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	398	Last week, within ten days or two weeks of the budget being introduced, we saw a major rise in fares on the Luas, the DART and Iarnród Éireann trains. These fare rises were introduced at a time when the Dáil was in recess and while the row over Irish Water was raging. They may not seem relevant to the budget or the Finance Bill, but when we see a semi-State body acting in this arbitrary way, we must ask some questions. Why is CIE raising prices and public transport fares at this time? The company raised fares last year and has raised them far beyond the rate of inflation for many years. Inflation is simply a dot in the distance when we compare the rate with the rise in public transport fares. Why did the company raise fares? We could possibly understand fares being raised last year because the company had argued that fuel prices were rocketing and passenger numbers were going down. This year it raised them, despite the fact that fuel prices had been falling and passenger numbers were going up. When we try to find out from it or the regulator why this is happening, they say growth costs money and that because the company is seeking to grow capacity it costs more money and that the company has to expand. Either way, it seems this semi-State body is going to have a right to increases fares, whether it grows or shrinks. We must be a little puzzled by such an attitude and response. I suppose the reason is that semi-State bodies work in a sphere of their own. In this case, CIE is fully owned by the State. They are monopolies, although not altogether in this case but very nearly. They are allowed to do virtually what they wish in terms of fares and are now acting as tax collectors for the State. I will explain what I mean in CIE's case. As everyone knows, it receives a large subvention from the State which, thank God, has gone down from approximately €300 million to €265 million. As it cannot make ends meet with a cut subvention, what does it do? It simply applies to the regulator to put up fares and it puts up fares in an outrageous way. Instead of receiving a subvention from the State, it crucifies the punter. That is really the same as paying tax by the backdoor. The Government ought to examine the regulators not only in the case of CIE but in the case of many semi-State bodies, particularly State monopolies. It ought to examine the regulators - in CIE's case, the National Transport Authority gave the all-clear - to see what they are actually up to because I cannot recall a time, certainly in the case of transport costs, when the public was not such an easy target or soft victim. When people kick up about the behaviour of State monopolies - I am referring to the DAA, CIE, An Post and one or two others - the Government constantly maintains it has nothing to do with them and that it is simply a matter for the regulators, but the regulators simply provide a fig leaf. The National Transport Authority and the regulators for many of these bodies are simply acting in the interests of the Government; they are certainly not acting in the interests of the punter.In that sense, those who relieve the Government of the burden of imposing extra taxes directly to increase the subvention - they are very large subventions - are acting in its interests. It is obvious that they are and quite obvious why. The structure of these agencies and semi-State bodies makes them, in effect, tools of the Government. The members of the board of the NTA and, I assume, the boards of other regulators are all Government appointees. It is the same story time and again about State institutions, that they are tools of the Government and filled with directors who are friends of the Government and meet its wishes. Time and again what they are doing is imposing taxes by another name by increasing fares or charges elsewhere. One of the most unpleasant experiences many of us must suffer is travelling through Dublin Airport, which is a semi-State monopoly and has all the signs of it. It is not just that parking in the short-term car park costs approximately €40 a day, which is absolutely outrageous, but there is no competition which means that one must pay it. However, the culture also permeates some of the stores that occupy this semi-State monopoly. Has anybody travelled through various parts of the airport and tried to obtain foreign exchange at inconvenient times of the day? The outlets are not open. They only open at times that are hugely profitable because the monopoly has given another firm a monopoly at the airport and the public service remit has gone out the window. One of the things the Government could have done in the Finance Bill was set up some form of quick-fix inquiry to examine the semi-State bodies, find where there was waste and examine what was wrong with the culture. However, there is no quick-fix for it because the culture is sick, monopolistic and anti-consumer. In effect, it meets the Government's wishes and collects taxes by another name. The Labour Party loves quangos. It makes absolutely no bones about it; it has always been in love with them. Fine Gael wrote a wonderful document when it was in opposition about Ireland as the land of 1,000 quangos. In its input to the Government the quangos could have been a target for savings in public expenditure, not just CIE but Enterprise Ireland, An Post, the Dublin Airport Authority and so forth. Attack the culture, examine it and ask them to put their houses in order. However, there is no pressure on them to do so. Instead, Governments appoint top heavy boards of individuals who are not qualified to be there but damned well paid for it. This is an area of expenditure cuts which could be tackled each day but never is. It is taboo. FÁS was a Fianna Fáil protectorate for many years and untouched. We could not debate it in the Seanad; for years we were refused debates on it. Now we know why. It was because it was working in a world of its own. Other semi-State bodies are unsupervised, almost unregulated and live in worlds of their own which have nothing to do with either the commercial or the consumer world. If the Government was serious about tackling the budget in a radical way, it would look at that area to see where it could make savings. It would find there was plenty of room for them. It would be politically difficult in certain cases, of course, but these are difficult times and if it wants these opportunities, it should take them. I have a suggestion for the Government. It is welcome that the Bill apparently heralds the end of the pension levy. It was an absolutely deplorable innovation when it was introduced. The levy was straightforward daylight robbery of individuals' savings. It made significant differences not just to people's pension pots but also to the pensions they were receiving. In recognition of the fact that it now knows this was wrong, the Government should consider repaying some of the money to those from whom it stole it. It should look back, count the cost, admit it was wrong and state it will repay the money in order that people's pension pots will be intact. This was official theft. It was the same as taking money from somebody's deposit account, which I doubt any Government would contemplate. I cannot understand how the Government, when it raided these pension pots and decided to target the pensions industry because there was so much money available in it, did not decide simultaneously that the way to raise money from the pensions industry was not to crucify pensioners, just as in raiding CIE it crucifies customers, but to go for the industry. I recall making this suggestion to the Taoiseach in the House three years ago. He agreed that I was right that the industry was full of very rich people living off the fat. He did not say this, but he acknowledged that there was scope for huge savings and taking money from those who were earning too much. It is an industry of parasites. It is full of fund managers who do absolutely no good for pensions. In fact, they lose money most of the time. There was much scope in that industry to take money out of the pot from those who were milking it, as acknowledged by the Taoiseach at the time, instead of taking it from pensioners. A repayment should be made by the Government to those from whom it stole the money.

We have slowly worked our way towards fiscal health as individuals, families and a nation. In the efforts to recover from the global financial crisis most of us were asked to shoulder a heavy burden. Many people recognise that burden as a reality in society. However, the self-employed, in particular, believe they are being asked to carry more than their share of responsibility. They are a critical component of the national economy. They take significant risks, often without a safety net. Their goal is to contribute to the economy and secure a living for themselves, their families and employees. Budget 2015 is about building futures for families and creating jobs and the Government is doing so with gusto. However, many small business owners believe the new USC rate of 11% will put undue stress on their finances. Instead of expanding their operations, many business owners believe they will be forced to save costs wherever they can. I received a letter from a constituent who said: "I can understand imposing extra charges on people who earn more, but I think then, we should be given rights as well - and also incentives to take on more staff."I recognise the strides we have made in rebuilding the economy and welcome and commend the many progressive steps taken in budget 2015. I simply ask the Minister to make clear the message that the Government is not unfairly taxing the self-employed. There is great confusion and thus annoyance about the universal social charge rate among the very people whom we encourage to meet the challenge of starting a business and taking risks. The self-employed are honest, hard-working people who want only fair results for their work. Yesterday's edition of The Irish Times featured a helpful response from Mr. Brendan Loughane, an official in the Department of Finance, in which he stated:To suggest the divide has widened as a result of changes introduced in Budget 2015 is simply not true ... The factual position is that a single PAYE worker and a single self-assessed worker earning €100,000 will see an increase of €747 in their net income in 2015, as a result of the Budget 2015 changes.This message needs to be communicated to the self-employed as they do not feel they are supported by the Government.  I propose to respond to suggestions made by Opposition Deputies that the Government introduce a wealth tax. It is easy for Deputies to shout out ill-thought out suggestions in the Chamber without considering the reality. As a Deputy for Dún Laoghaire, I can vouch that many families paid exorbitant prices for the modest three and four bedroom semi detached homes in which they live. These taxpayers cannot afford to pay a wealth tax. I remind certain Opposition loudmouths that while many of my constituents in Dún Laoghaire pay income tax, child care costs and property tax and support and will pay the water tax because they know water is not a free commodity, by God, they will not support a wealth tax on their homes.  I again commend the Minister for introducing a progressive budget which abolishes the 0.6% pension levy, retains the 9% VAT rate, does not increase excise duty on alcohol, extends BreastCheck and retains the pupil-teacher ratio. Yesterday, the European economic forecast published by the European Commission stated Ireland's growth rate would be the highest in the European Union both this year and next year. This achievement is a direct result of the difficult, wise and competent decisions made by the Minister and shouldered by the people. I am confident that the measures included in the Finance Bill will help to ensure continued growth and positive news for Ireland.
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	400	Much has been said in recent months and years about the Government's ability to deliver on the promises and commitments made before the general election. I intend to deal with these commitments in a general manner.  Looking back to where we were four years ago, the Government's central commitment to the electorate was that it would restore the economy and return people to work. All of the other commitments, while important in their own right, could not even be contemplated if, as a nation, we continued to be in a state of bankruptcy. Let us not forget that the country was bankrupt four years ago and most political commentators and Opposition parties and all Independent Members doubted whether the Government could deliver on its agenda. The facts are now clear and our central commitment and policy plan are being delivered. There is no doubt, however, that this enormous task has been painful for the Government and, in particular, the people. Work to complete some of the tasks we set ourselves, for example, the introduction of water charges, is still in progress. As all Deputies are aware, water charges are proving to be a difficult issue. The Government has given a commitment to clarify and address concerns about the charges in the coming weeks.  Most targets have been successfully met through difficult Government decisions aimed at saving and raising money. The embargo on public sector recruitment, by necessity, remains largely in force. While the embargo was a difficult decision for the Government to implement, it has been even more difficult for the thousands of public servants who maintained services through difficult times. The complete reform of local government resulted in the abolition of town councils and a reduction in the size of our regional administration to make it more appropriate and affordable for the country. In this context, I often question the accusations of cronyism that continue to be made, given that Fine Gael, the largest party in local government, reduced the number of its public representatives by one third in a ruthless but necessary measure. The property tax has been introduced as a part of a necessary effort to broaden the tax net. Property taxes are generally regarded internationally, including by most observers and politicians, as a fair component of the tax structure. The exception are Ireland's left-wing politicians whose brand of social values appears to differ from that of their counterparts in the rest of Europe, the reason being that it confers political advantage. The universal social charge which hit every employed and retired citizen very hard had to be imposed by the previous Administration as a result of its poor management of the economy. The budget shows that the economic growth we are experiencing will deliver small returns to people at an individual level and ease their fears of further austerity in the period ahead. The current level of economic growth also gives enormous hope for the future. Despite serious difficulties during its term of office, the Government has maintained basic social welfare rates. No other country in Europe that experienced similar difficulties managed to achieve this outcome. With a growing economy, social welfare benefits can be improved gradually, as shown by the restoration of the Christmas bonus at 25% of its previous rate.  The policies pursued by the Government quickly restored confidence in Ireland among our European partners and the financial markets. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, showed a steady and reliable hand in guiding the economy and renegotiating the agreement on the promissory notes, as well as our repayment schedule and interest rates. At the same time, he injected confidence into the economy, with the ultimate aim of creating jobs. His approach is working. As he stated, the number of people in employment has increased by more than 70,000. Furthermore, we have learned today that unemployment has fallen to 11% and the Government is on course to achieve its target of having 2 million people working in the economy by 2016. Despite the general consensus that the Government would not achieve the fiscal targets set by the troika, forecasts suggest the deficit for 2014 will be 3.7% of GDP, well inside the original deficit target. While we all accept that our debt is still too high, the actions taken by the Government have created confidence in the economy in the financial markets. The Minister is reducing the taxation burden by refinancing our debt through new loans, with interest rates of well under 3%. Ireland's ten year sovereign bond yields have reached record lows and now trade at less than 2%. Since taking office, the Government has provided vital supports for indigenous industry, including the jobs initiative for the tourism industry, tax reforms for small and medium-sized enterprises and measures such as the home renovation incentive for the construction industry. Its general handling of the economy and skilful approach to our corporation tax regime ensure foreign direct investment will remain a cornerstone of economic development in the future. The certainty the Government has provided on this issue will ensure this investment will continue to increase.  As I stated, the core commitment we gave at the general election was to restore confidence in the economy and return people to work. The Government is dedicated to continuing to set the economy on a sustainable growth pattern. Now that the economy is doing well, political pundits and Opposition parties are honing in on other issues. They should remember that, in addition to economic success, the Government has delivered complete reform of local government. Our commitment to let the people decide on the future of the Seanad was honourable. The restrictions in the Freedom of Information Act have been reversed. Appointment to State boards will be made on the basis of recommendations made by a Civil Service commission. Most importantly, a quota regime has been introduced to ensure more women will stand for election and, I hope, be elected in the future. I commend the Bill to the House.

Hundreds of people in County Mayo alone can no longer use their cars because their engines have been severely damaged by these practices. The scale of the problem which has also been reported in other parts of the country is alarming. Additional resources and a joined-up effort are required to nail the criminals who are lining their pockets at the expense of people who do not have insurance cover for the damage being done to their cars, are unable to return their vehicles to a garage and live in areas with no public transport to speak of.People have been left in a dreadful position.  I listened to "Today with Sean O'Rourke" on which a journalist did not hold back. He named who, through his investigations, was responsible for this. All roads led to offshoots of the Provisional IRA. It was something else to hear what he had to say. It is using the money to buy properties in England, the USA and Ireland. It is estimated that a laundering operation in Monaghan has resulted in a loss of up to €10 million in taxes and excise duties to the State. We were told the conglomerate had a stake in 140 filling stations around the country, including supermarkets.  We need a massive operation to deal with the issue. We need the Army, the Customs service and the Garda because the Exchequer, as well as the ordinary person who has nowhere to turn and the legitimate trader, are losing out. Every time this fuel is sold at filling stations legitimate traders are losing out on business, not to mention their reputations, as people do not know where to turn. I have attended meetings in my county at which people asked me where they should go to buy petrol. That is shocking to say about consumer confidence in this day and age. Given that there is a lot of information available, the issue has to be tackled and the operations shut down. I would like to think the ill-gotten gains, filling stations, tankers and profits would all be confiscated and a fund established for those who are out of pocket because of this activity. Those involved should be subject to the full rigour of the criminal justice system and put where they should be. It seems that some gangs are operating above the law, which is not good enough for ordinary law-abiding citizens who are at a loss and for whom the State can provide no solutions. The first step has to be law enforcement. Those involved should be named and shamed in order that people will know which filling stations are involved. They are filling up their tanks innocently and coming out with damaged vehicles. I understand it takes only one fill to damage a car.  I have raised the issue of NAMA, transparency, accountability, the treatment of developers and, above all, value for money for taxpayers on numerous occasions with the Minister in the House, at committee meetings and during Fine Gael Parliamentary Party meetings. Representatives of NAMA appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 22 October. I was present and said what I had to say. After the meeting I received threatening correspondence which was anonymous, as all cowards send such correspondence. Subsequent to the meeting I tabled parliamentary questions. I am well aware that the Minister does not prepare the replies. I asked about the Michael O'Flynn loan sales, an issue which was discussed by NAMA. The response I received was one of the most pitiful I had seen and the staff have something to answer for. They could only give me information based on what NAMA had stated at the committee. It did not need to be repeated to me.

I referred to a case in which loans had been sold to an underbidder, rather than the highest bidder. In the interests of achieving the best value for taxpayers' money I cannot obtain confirmation of what the small difference was or that the taxpayer received value for money, other than what NAMA stated at the committee meeting. There does not seem to be any transparency or accountability. NAMA seems to be stating the highest bidder in this case, a globally trading hedge fund which I understand has at least $23 billion in assets, did not have the funds to go through with the purchase, which I cannot believe, and that a short-listing process took place. There are many questions to be answered and explanations are required. Mr. Flynn said after the court case in which NAMA had been ruled against and Mr. Justice Cregan delivered a fairly damming judgment in the matter that dealing with NAMA was like dealing with the establishment in North Korea. There are serious questions to be answered and it seems that if I table parliamentary questions, I will not get answers, about which I am disappointed.  Anything I am saying is factual and I have the information here. To tell the truth, after I raised the issue at the committee, I accumulated quite a bit of correspondence from people around the country who told me how they had been treated by NAMA and received telephone calls from people in a very distressed state. I cannot adjudicate on all of these cases, but there are questions to be answered by NAMA.

I raised this issue two weeks ago in a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance who told me in his response that the figures from the Revenue Commissioners showed that 26 cases of petrol stretching had been reported to them from counties Mayo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Galway between July and October. They told local media that 25 cases in County Longford alone had been reported to them, but I am aware of a garage in my county which has two vehicles a day coming in in which the engines have seized. That is the reality of what is happening across the west. A welcome announcement was made today that the Garda and Revenue Commissioners would come together in County Mayo to see if they could tackle this issue. This is not an issue in County Mayo, it also affects counties Roscommon, Longford, Galway and Leitrim, all of which face significant problems. The Minister pointed out to me that the Revenue Commissioners had a dedicated section on its website on which one could report such incidents. One reason they are not being reported is that one would want to have a PhD in IT to figure out how to report the matter on the website. We need to be far more proactive in encouraging people to come forward and report such crimes. The Minister also said motorists should take care about where they sourced their petrol. The impression is being given that people are buying yellow pack petrol and should know better. In fact, the garages of which I am aware that are selling this fuel are not selling it at the going rate and, in some case, are more expensive. I know of a couple in my constituency, both of whom are on the minimum wage and who have three small children.One of them has an eight year old car, while the other has a ten year old car. They need their cars to travel to and from work each day. They have third party insurance because they cannot afford to pay for comprehensive insurance. They are facing a bill of €10,000 because both cars have had dodgy petrol put in and both engines have seized up. Christmas has been cancelled for that family, probably for a couple of years. They will not be able to recover from this blow. That is what is happening on the ground. The penalties in place are inadequate. On summary conviction, the maximum fine is €5,000 or up to 12 months in jail. The Revenue figures for the second quarter of this year for convictions show that 65 firms and individuals were convicted for fuel offences. The average fine imposed on conviction for illicit fuel offences is just €2,900. People are making far more on a daily basis from fuel stretching than the penalties in place. I urge the Minister of State to separate the two offences - that of supplying stretched petrol and other fuel and that of using it. The mandatory penalty on conviction for those supplying these fuels should be a minimum fine of €5,000 and 12 months in prison. This is the maximum penalty that can be imposed at District Court level. This penalty should be imposed on the individuals involved because they are causing immense financial hardship throughout my part of the country. People's vehicles are being completely destroyed and they do not have the money to pay to have them repaired. Two vehicles a day are coming in for repair to a particular garage every day. Another issue I wish to raise is the crisis in the agriculture sector, in which we have had protests by farmers about the price of beef. I will try to explain the issue in simple terms for those outside the agricultural community. Farmers receive approximately €600 less per head of cattle today than they did 26 years ago. This includes the single farm payment they receive. Nobody can survive in such a situation. The various sectors of agriculture have good and bad years, but the beef sector has bad and very bad years. For many beef farmers, it is not about Harvest 2020 but about survival 2015 and whether they will be able to remain in farming and beef production at the end of next year. There are bigger issues about the specifications required by the factories and the price differentials between here and the United Kingdom. In general there are fluctuations from year to year in commodity prices, whether it be milk, beef or sheep. The globalisation of food production and the increased unpredictably of weather events mean that this problem will continue. I suggest we try to introduce an additional incentive to assist farmers with their cash flow. We should allow them to put a limited amount of their profits in a good year aside in a dedicated bank account. This amount would be deducted from their farm profits and only taxed when withdrawn from the dedicated bank account in a difficult year. What I am suggesting is an emergency fund that farmers would set aside in a good year and access in a poor year. This fund would not be penalised in the good year and could be taxed in the normal way in the poor year. For example, last year there was a fodder crisis and farmers were unable to get fodder at any price. Many farmers had to borrow money or through the co-op to pay for fodder. If they had the type of rainy day account I suggest, they could have accessed these and used these funds. This would help to even out the highs and the lows we see in commodity prices and the even greater highs and lows expected in the future. I urge the Minister to consider this suggestion on Committee Stage. I wish to raise an issue that infuriates everyone, namely, the golden pensions received by senior executives in semi-State companies, senior officials in Departments and some senior Ministers, particularly by those who managed the economy in the run-up to the financial crisis. All of them have now left their positions and cannot be held accountable unless they come forward voluntarily to answer questions. Every one of them is collecting a gold plated pension. I propose that we introduce a clawback clause for all State pensions and that where people are grossly incompetent in their jobs, a clause in their pension contract would ensure they could be held accountable where it hurt them - their pockets - and a deduction could be made from their pensions for gross incompetence. The difficulty in regard to many of these individuals is that there is a big rush to retire when they are found out and once they have retired they are no longer accountable. In many cases, it is only after their retirement that the full scale of the financial mismanagement and waste of public funds comes to light. Some of them see the writing on the wall before they are caught and once out, they end up with a full pension. We need to put some provisions in place to ensure there is a clawback clause because consistently rewarding public sector bosses who have screwed up on the job they were contracted to do is one of the main reasons the country is being administered appallingly. I will be told we cannot introduce a clawback clause retrospectively. However, we were able to do it in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act that was passed by this House and which undermined the constitutional property rights of citizens. It needs to be done in regard to this issue. I am aware that the Minister of State has an interest in the issue of disability services. Currently, the Department is clawing back money spent in the intellectual disability sector between July and October. A letter sent in October indicated this money would be clawed back. If moneys provided for intellectually disabled people can be clawed back, surely we can claw back moneys from the fat cats who undermined the country, the economy and society and who are drawing down pensions today.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	415	I am glad to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution on the Finance Bill 2014. The Bill implements the majority of the taxation changes announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, in his Budget Statement of 14 October. Today, Deputy Eoghan Murphy suggested a change in approach in how budgets were invigilated by this Parliament and spoke about the need for a stronger Parliament overall. His comments in this regard are reflective of the views I have long expressed in the House, on approximately 24 Finance Bills. This is the 24th time I have been asked to invigilate the debate on the Finance Bill. I hope we will begin to receive more detailed budgetary information earlier in the year. Perhaps we might use the approach adopted by the Australian and Dutch Parliaments in order that Deputies can make an informed contribution to the debates on both the budget and the Finance Bill. While the Minister did provide outline costings for the new measures contained in budget 2015 which are instructive, there is still a disappointing and frustrating dearth of information on the macro position in regard to costings for many tax expenditures in this and earlier Bills. Tax breaks have always played a prominent role in the Irish taxation system and the history of the State. For many years, colleagues in this House and I have demanded that tax expenditures be regarded simply as Government spending programmes and not effectively as a series of measures which are revenue neutral. Many studies, in particular the work of TASC by O'Connor, Staunton, Sweeney and O'Donnell in recent times, have shown that the costs and benefits of tax breaks are not uniform in their application across the people and households. The ESRI has noted, for example, that 80% of the benefit of pension tax reliefs goes to the top two deciles of income.Tax expenditures are often anti-competitive, deadweight and less efficient than direct State spending. Most of all, the cost of tax breaks is difficult to determine and usually underestimated, even in the annual budget documents such as those presented with budget 2014. Nowhere in the budget papers and speeches of the past four years of the Government, for example, is there a full estimate of the current level of tax expenditures in this era of savage cutbacks and retrenchment. Right-wing journalists love to write about the budget revenue gap in regard to social programmes and public spending without ever mentioning the cumulative tax expenditures throughout each budget. The OECD's 2009 economic survey of Ireland put the average EU level of tax breaks in the income tax system at 5.6% of total taxation, whereas the Irish level was placed at 18.3%, or three times greater, of total taxation. In addition, the benefits of many tax breaks accrue to the highest earners and these expenditures continue to provide a way whereby many high earners can dodge paying their appropriate share of income tax. The recent TASC report, A Defence of Taxation, refers to Revenue statistics from 2007 and 2010 which show that the total cost of tax breaks on income tax was €17.9 billion in 2007 and €17.7 billion in 2010. When one deducts the basic income tax credits for workers and employers which amounted to €8.9 billion in 2007 and €8 billion in 2010, we are left with tax breaks of €9 billion in 2007 and €9.6 billion in 2010, significantly more than the whole education budget. Perhaps in his reply to the debate, the Minister might update us on the total cost of tax reliefs in 2013 and 2014 and the projected total costs of same in 2015. I note the Australian Treasury produces an annual tax expenditures statement which I presume includes a full cost-benefit analysis of each tax break. That is the type of issue Deputy Eoghan Murphy was rightly commending to the House. We should know what we spend on these tax reliefs and tax breaks which, as I said, by and large, benefit the more wealthy in society. I note that there are again hugely significant tax expenditures in the agriculture sector in sections 43 and 44 of Chapter 6 of the Bill. These were estimated to cost at least €30 million in the Minister's Budget Statement. While these measures are said to be derived from the review of the Departments of Finance and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, they are still presented to Deputies in a very narrow manner, without guidelines on how the changes will affect the overall macro tax treatment of the sector. I also recall that last year the Ministers, Deputies Michael Noonan and Simon Coveney, overruled their departmental officials to introduce a €26 million tax break for inactive farmers. The decision in section 27 to slash the 80% rate of income tax on windfall profits owing to certain planning decisions in regard to land is also not costed. The excuse given by the Ministers, Deputies Brendan Howlin and Michael Noonan, is that there had been absolutely no activity under the provisions of the principal Act, now amended by section 27. However, given that there were more homes built in 2009 alone than in the entire period since, it is no wonder the section did not come into use. Perhaps the developers were waiting for the Ministers to cut the windfall tax down to the capital gains tax rate of 33%. While the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, has said there will not be a return to the boom and bust policies of the past, the windfall tax provision was an important measure in actually addressing past boom and bust policies which got us into the mess of the economic crash. I note that Deputy Mick Wallace, for example, has made valuable contributions in debates in this House on his experience of how land is ruthlessly hoarded by developers and landowners and land banks could best be used to provide desperately needed housing and commercial and public infrastructure. I note the Minister's fanfare about removing the double Irish which he clearly states has caused Ireland reputational damage. Deputy Michael Noonan has been Minister for Finance for four years and did not seem to believe there was any reputational damage throughout that period, although he does now. I read a report in today's edition of The Wall Street Journal which effectively stated the extension of research and development tax credits in section 23 and the changes to the capital allowances in section 35 would effectively create bigger loopholes in the tax system, thereby benefiting the same multinationals. Clearly, Dáil Éireann needs much more information on how a research and development or patent box tax expenditure will operate and what it will cost. In this instance, we can also observe how Mr. Cameron's similar patent box operates in the United Kingdom. I made a submission to both the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in the run-up to budget 2015. Of course, the level of resources afforded to Independent Deputies makes it very difficult for us. I was sorry that I could only deliver my 20 page submission to the two Ministers four or five days before the budget. I note that some of the measures I proposed are actually contained in the budget and the Bill. However, would the Minister believe some of the measures I proposed to tackle high earners are noticeably absent? One of my principal recommendations was ending all cuts to public services. I welcome the decision by the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to finally stall the horrendous cuts across the major Departments of Social Protection, Health and Education and Skills. I also proposed a €5 a week increase in all social welfare benefits, including pensions. One of the key measures which I welcome in the Bill is in Chapter 2 in regard to changes to the universal social charge. In my submission I recommended increasing the entry point at which a worker was liable for USC and also a cut to the middle rate of the charge. Therefore, I welcome the amendment of the threshold and recognise that this will be beneficial for workers on very low incomes. I also welcome the cuts to the lower rates of USC. They will assist all workers but will have particular benefits for those on lower incomes. I also note the inclusion of higher rates of USC for higher earners. However, these progressive changes are offset by the decision by the Ministers to cut the marginal rate of income tax by 1%, as contained in section 3 of the Bill. The Government's decision to cut the rate is regressive because it benefits higher earners most. Coupled with the increase in the threshold at which the marginal rate of income tax will be paid, also in section 3, this means that higher earners will benefit disproportionately from budget 2015. A much fairer approach would have been to increase the income tax credits available to all workers. I proposed in my submission increasing tax credits by €5 per week, at a cost of €332 million. I also proposed adding a third rate of income tax of 48% on incomes above €100,000 which, again, would be an equitable measure ensuring those who could most afford to contribute to the recovery of the nation would have the opportunity to do so. I also renewed my call for solidarity taxes on wealth and an increase in the bank levy. I note that Deputy Peter Mathews has done some very thoughtful work and made thoughtful contributions on the way in which the financial services industry can, if one likes, pay reparations to the nation for the damage it did to us in the past six years and the suffering it has caused to the people. In regard to Part 3, sections 58 to 63, inclusive, in preparing my submission I strongly considered a cut in VAT of at least 1%. I can understand the difficulties the officials have in trying to balance a budget, given the huge amount of funding that comes in through VAT. Clearly, however, consumption taxes, including VAT, excise and custom taxes, are extremely regressive. Citizens and families on low incomes pay a much higher portion of their income in VAT and other consumption taxes. I believe that, following the next general election, the group of Independents will have a very strong influence on the next Government and perhaps might even lead it. We will then have an opportunity to begin to address the great unfairness of VAT and other consumption taxes. Earlier today I attended a meeting organised by Deputy Peadar Tóibín and our trade union colleagues to consider the very necessary changes to the relevant contracts tax, RCT, system, which is dealt with in section 15 of the Bill. As the Minister knows, in recent months I have raised issues with the RCT system and the manner in which it relates to construction workers. There is a situation where PAYE workers on State school contracts are being turned into subcontractors against their will and paid salaries below the minimum wage. It is an horrendous state of affairs. I hope to bring forward an amendment on the next Stage of the Finance Bill in conjunction with colleagues. Either something is wrong with the current RCT system rules or they are not being implemented by Revenue. Either way, we need some new ideas. I note that in my Finance Bill papers I have a very nice "Dear Wolfgang" letter, submitted by the Minister for Finance. I wonder why he did not say "Dear Wolfgang and Sigmar," given that there is a sort of Noonan and Howlin outfit in Germany. Of course, Wolfgang visited his more or less Dublin Branch Office last week. I wonder why we did not receive a "Dear Michael" letter in return. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, might raise that matter with the Minister as we have received only one side of the correspondence.

The cost of one which had been purchased at the height of the boom was €720,000, while the other had been purchased after the depression began for €350,000. I believe this identifies the crisis at the heart of the housing programme, planning and all of the issues related to the cost of housing and particularly the windfall profit tax which is being done away with in the Finance Bill. I have concerns about this and note the points made by Deputy Thomas P. Broughan.I accept that it is included in the legislation and, obviously, is going to happen, but the key aspect is regulating the price of building land. This issue was raised a long time ago. I think Deputies Peter Mathews and Thomas P. Broughan might remember the Kenny report when we were just four or five years of age. Do the Deputies remember it?

Needless to say, it also included a minority report, but it contained a lot of common sense. If we are to make sure people are not ripped off, we must address this issue. I appreciate that land is not being released and that there are different issues around Dublin, but, at the end of the day, particularly for poorer households and the taxpayer who will be paying for local authority housing, public works and public buildings into the future, we need to look again at this issue, about which I have concerns. I welcome the continuation of the living city initiative, but there is a problem with it. It includes Dublin city, Cork, Limerick, Galway and - hey presto - Kilkenny. Whatever for?

Drogheda is the largest town in the country, with a population approaching 40,000 citizens. The heart of Drogheda, Dundalk and many of our cities and towns was devastated - businesses were closed and there was no rates income; nothing. At the centre, they are ghost towns. However, what do we have on the outskirts owing to the planning policy of other Governments are huge shopping centres that have broken the heart of towns. This is a core issue. The living city initiative is an excellent one and I support it fully, but I regret very much that in a reply to my recent parliamentary question it was stated there was no intention to extend it in the budget. I would like to lay down a marker - it ought to be extended, which would make a lot of sense, as one could bring back to life the core of our towns and cities, many of which are denuded of people at night. We want to see commercial activity and enterprise. Extending the living city initiative and looking again at new initiatives to include urban renewal would make a lot of sense. It is much cheaper to provide new apartments and so on where commercial buildings are extant and can be improved. I welcome the extension in the budget of section 28 tax relief where anybody who owns a private house or those who own residential properties and flats can avail of it. One of the key issues about which people complain is the fact that the quality of apartments to be let in the market is not up to scratch and does not meet basic requirements for modern living. This initiative will certainly help and is most definitely a move in the right direction.  I wish to raise a very important issue. It concerns encouraging enterprise and businesses to start up. There is a 10,000 sq. ft. property in my constituency in Drogheda which is empty. The previous business has closed and all of the charges have been paid. The planning fees have also been paid and the car parking is right. Somebody wants to move in and start up a business, but what are they faced with? First, they have to meet planning fees of almost €4,000, have a fire certificate at a cost of €2,697, meet a disability access certificate application fee of €800 and, let us not forget, the change of use fee of €23,752. That is an absolute disgrace and the issue needs to be addressed in every single urban area. We are killing enterprise and ensuring places that are denuded of commercial activity will never reopen. Young people want to get going and start off, but how are they going to do it? They cannot and will not do so. We are not tackling this core issue that needs to be addressed. We talk a lot about enterprise and there is no doubt that the number of jobs around the country are increasing and that the unemployment rate which was 15.3% when we took office is now 11% and falling. That is a fantastic achievement on the part of the Government which has been brought about by having the right policies and the drive and energy of the Administration. It is most welcome, but economic recovery has not trickled down sufficiently to ordinary people. It is a little like what they are saying in Great Britain, the United States and Ireland. Yes, we are improving and creating more jobs, but we do not have enough of them. There are too many barriers in our way.  I suggest to the Minister and the Department, if they are listening, that we tackle this issue. Let us scrap these damn fees. Let us open a new window of opportunity in a 12 month trial. For the next 12 months let us cut the fees to damn all for anybody who wants to open a new business. What would be the benefit to the local authority? I rang a local authority official whom I will not name about this issue. Local authority officials are decent people. They asked me what they would do for money, but there will be no one in this place. Why are so many shops empty? Why are people afraid to start a business? The reason is they cannot afford the charges. There is a premises at the very centre of my town that has been empty. A new business wants to move in, but guess what it needs to do so? It needs to pay a change of use fee. It must also pay huge planning fees. It must pay €30,000 to open up. This premises is right in the heart of my town and could be buzzing with people, creating employment and generating income for the local authority, but it is now empty and will remain so, unless we can find a way to deal with the issue. This lies at the heart of our commercial and economic recovery.  I will hand over to Deputy John Paul Phelan, the fellow from Kilkenny who people say is a good hurler. I welcome all of the significant changes that have been made and all of the good things included in the Bill, but we need to open our eyes a little more and tackle these issues in order that we have an open door policy and a welcome mat for anybody who wants to set up a business. We should tell them that we want them, that we are prepared to cut their costs, including their planning costs, down to zero. Let us give it a go and see what would happens because the local authority would be getting rates. It would have an income, people would be working and our towns would be alive. They would no longer be dead. Let us wake up and smell the coffee.

I will correct my earlier interruptions. I would have no difficulty if Drogheda was to be included in the Living City Initiative, although it would have to be renamed the living town initiative. Seeing as it is called the Living City Initiative, it is only appropriate that all cities are included in it. It is a very good initiative. Deputy Fergus O'Dowd is not the best at mathematics and I think he used to be a teacher. With a population of over 25,000, Kilkenny has far more than one quarter of Drogheda's population.

Dundalk is another large town in his constituency which I am sure could also benefit. I echo the sentiments expressed by the Deputy in respect of the costs faced by businesses and people who are thinking of starting a business in facilities that already exist. There are countless numbers of premises that are closed on high streets and other streets in towns and cities across the country. The planning charges and the development contributions required are so large in many cases that they are putting people off. I believe the Deputy is correct in suggesting that the Government needs to look at this. I know it has been done in other places on the Continent. I did a bit of research about it a while ago. It was even done, perhaps not successfully, in parts of the United States, although small-town America probably died many years ago. Efforts were made to revive those towns. There is no doubt, when one observes this city, the main roads leading out of it and its immediate hinterland, as well as Cork and Galway, that conditions have improved visibly over the last three or four years. Such improvements are not visible in much of the rest of the country. People are not necessarily feeling the improvement in their own pockets and they will not believe it until they see it happening. This should not be taken as undermining the good work that the Government has done. The purpose of the Finance Bill is to give legislative effect to the budget announcements. For that reason, I am fully supportive of it. However, I wish to address some specific issues arising from the Bill. There is merit in Deputy Naughten's suggestions regarding public service pensions for those who have been less than good in the delivery of services, whether as politicians or senior civil servants who were in powerful positions during the period leading up to our economic collapse. Last week the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced a list of reforms for the public service. A system of clawbacks from those who presided over the collapse would act as an incentive for those who currently occupy such positions to ensure it does not happen again. The issue of petrol stretching and diesel laundering was mentioned by several speakers. There was a significant discovery of a diesel laundering plant in the Border region yesterday. I am part of a group of members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Association preparing a report on this issue. We have had several meetings with Ministers on both sides of the Border and with the acting Garda Commissioner. There is considerable anecdotal evidence along the Border about such activity, including the presence of tankers, many of which are unmarked, moving around where they should not be at all times of the day or night. I realise that officials in the customs division are put to the pin of their collars. Various agencies have a hand in regulating farms, and if a farmer seeks to carry out any sort of development it will not be long before the county council finds out, but some of these plants appear to operate with impunity in certain Border regions. I do not understand why there has not been a more comprehensive crackdown on these facilities. Some of those who have come before our group have suggested that a blind eye is being turned on the basis that it is preferable for some of the elements involved in this business to be laundering fuel than to be killing people. That is not acceptable. I have been trying to get answers to my questions about the budgetary measures on the transfer of land to young farmers. These are welcome measures, because there have been significant problems in this regard since the cessation of the early retirement scheme. It has emerged following the announcement in the budget that the measures will apply only to full-time farmers. That is not acceptable. If the son or daughter of a farmer owning a 50-acre farm needs another job to make a living, why should he or she be penalised? I am led to believe that the difficulty in this area is coming from the Department of Finance rather than the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I urge the Minister for Finance to consider amending these measures to include all young farmers who are qualified regardless of whether they may be inheriting a large or a small farm. It is probably more inequitable for people farming small holdings who might hold an off-farm job out of necessity. I welcome that the private sector pension levy will be removed in 2016. It was introduced for the specific purpose of allowing the VAT rate for the hospitality sector to be reduced. One of the most spectacular measures this Government has introduced was the reduction of the VAT rate for the hospitality sector, which led directly to the creation of thousands of jobs in towns and villages across the country. The pension levy was controversial, to say the least, but now it is being removed. A similar question arises in respect of the public service pension levy, which affects a considerable number of people who retired from the public service on the basis of the pension they expected. They understand that the levy was introduced in response to the emergency facing the country three or four years ago but they want an indication from the Government that it will be phased out over time. Their expectation of an income that could provide a decent standard of living during their retirement years should be met.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	429	I was pleased to hear Deputy John Paul Phelan speak about the need to change the provisions on agricultural relief. A number of parts of the Bill, including the section dealing with stamp duty, makes reference to farmers spending 50% of their time on their farms. The vast majority of farmers in this country are producing suckler cows, dry stock or sheep. There are only 18,000 dairy farmers in the country, and even if that figure increased to 20,000 it would not be a significant number. A further 4,000 to 5,000 farmers are involved in tillage. It does not require 40 hours per week to farm suckler cows, dry stock or sheep. The worse the land, the more farmers would be simply passing the time if they were working that many hours. Requiring them to devote 50% of their time to farming will prevent a considerable number of family farms from being transferred to the next generation with the assistance of the reliefs. I welcome that a consensus appears to be building in this House that whoever wrote that provision did not understand the situation. When one does not understand the consequences of one's actions, it is important that one listen to those who do understand them. It has been estimated that 30% of farmers currently earn off-farm income, but 60% of farmers had off-farm incomes when the economy was booming. The reality is that those who do not have an off-farm income would like such an income, because otherwise they are depending on payments such as farm assist. Please God, they will have an opportunity to work off their farms in the future. I am disappointed that the relief that was sought in regard to compulsory investment in shares in dairy co-operatives, because of the expansion in milk production, was not given. I was a supporter of the business expansion scheme, BES, in the past because it provided equity for industry. As we know, it is hard enough at times for small businesses to access equity. If a business is depending on borrowed funds and the gearing ratio is wrong, it becomes much more vulnerable and liable to fail. In a time of massive expansion in the dairy industry and when markets internationally are very volatile and we are not sure what the future will bring, it is very important that dairy co-operatives are well geared and do not have a high borrowing ratio. They should be increasing their share capital rather than having to bring in private finance. The idea of their being farmer-owned is very attractive. Indeed, it is a positive that so much of our dairy industry remains farmer-owned. We must avoid a situation in which co-operatives seek to compensate for the share capital they do not have by going on the market and borrowing large amounts of money. It is interesting to consider which businesses survived the downturn where one might say they should not have done. The timber industry is an extraordinary example of this. Five or six major mills in the county had to switch from making 70% of their sales in the home market to making 70% of their sales in the export market. We did not lose even one of these companies overboard. Logically, one would have to conclude that they were incredibly vulnerable because of the downturn in the construction industry. If any industry was going to go, one might well have figured the timber industry would be it. My understanding, however, is that these companies had very good gearing ratios, had not diversified outside of their core businesses and were therefore able to take the hit, ride out the difficulties and win new markets without going to the wall. Very few industries have taken such a hit without going under. We need to build the same resilience into the dairy industry. When it comes to taking in shares, we must also ensure farmers are not hit with a double jeopardy and put in a position in which they have to borrow money to buy shares, improve their farms and put in extra capacity. We must avoid a situation in which farmers become over-borrowed. It is a major risk. I am very concerned that if people over-borrow and there is a downturn or price volatility, some will end up losing farms that have been in families for generations. For many years I have made the case that for the ordinary citizen, there is nothing more frustrating than a massive tax form demanding information on multiple reliefs, representing a range of complications and twists and turns. The vast majority of PAYE workers do not fill an annual tax return because they are not obliged to do so. When my party was in government we got rid of many of the smaller reliefs. My view was that rather than reducing tax rates, it would be better to remove some of these small reliefs in the knowledge that many people were not availing of them. I used to have a slogan that the types of people who availed of these reliefs and sent in all the forms often did not need the money, while those who did need them were often the people who were afraid to fill the form. Some people simply have an antipathy to form-filling, while others are cautious when it comes to their dealings with the Revenue Commissioners. In some cases the policy is of "Out of sight, out of mind," and "Do not tickle it or it might bite back." I have always maintained that what the ordinary punter wants - by "ordinary punter," I mean a person earning between €5,000 and €60,000, or €70,000 or €80,000 - is a very simple system whereby filling in a tax form does not require expert advice. We need to simplify what is there. We should give grants if we want to give money to people; the tax system should be simple and understandable in a way that enables people to work out how much they owe without having to seek expert advice. I am not talking about people with complicated accountancy issues, tax schemes and big money. I am talking about the average people we meet every day of the week. I see people trying to fill in tax forms who might have a farm income of €5,000 and a small PAYE income. Einstein would not be able to complete some of these forms. There are so many rules and regulations and this Bill is adding to the grief. When the relief on refuse collection costs was in place, my understanding is that only 40% of people who had an eligibility for the relief actually claimed it. Now we are going down the route of a tax relief on water charges. It is not my intention to debate Irish Water and all of those issues this evening. My point is that I disagree fundamentally with such a relief as a method of reimbursing people for a charge. It is another crinkle in the system, and in order to avail of it, people will have to make a claim. Plenty of people have a paranoia about dealing with the Revenue Commissioners, even if they are totally tax-compliant. I have often dealt with people who filled out a tax form and discovered they were owed a lot of money. The relief on water charges is a bad idea. Speaking more broadly, I would propose that in respect of all of those small reliefs listed on the back of tax form, applicants should be given two options. Option A, the simple option, would allow people to waive their right to claim all of them individually and instead receive a tax credit of €100 or €150. Option B would be to fill out the complicated form in order to claim all these bits and pieces of reliefs. I have no doubt that nine out of ten people will take the simple option of the tax credit. In the meantime, the forms are becoming incredibly complicated for ordinary people to fill out. Some of these schemes and reliefs were introduced by my party in government but the intention was that they would be temporary measures. Certainly, we should have it as a medium-term goal to get back to a two-legged system, those legs being social insurance and income tax. Under the social insurance leg, everybody pays in at the same rate of 4%, 5% or whatever it is. I have made the case before that self-employed people should be brought into this by being covered for invalidity pension and so on. Everybody should pay in at a uniform rate that is easy to calculate, and the pay-out is the contributory pension, invalidity pension or whatever. The second leg should be income tax, full stop. We should absolutely have it as a long-term aim to get rid of the universal social charge. As it stands, we have made it incredibly difficult for people to calculate how much tax they should be paying. For the self-employed, no PRSI is payable on incomes below €5,000, and USC is not chargeable at below €10,032. For older people, the threshold is €36,000 for a couple and €18,000 for a single person. For younger people, various limits and permutations apply based on the various rules. If one asked everybody one met on the street, how many of them would be able to name all these thresholds and limits? People have a right to be able to calculate these sums without having to go to the Revenue On-line Service, ROS, for an answer which must be accepted at face value. People want to understand how the sum on the Revenue return was arrived at. We must simplify the system. When we talk about better government and reform of government, it is often in reference to this House. The reality is that the vast majority of people in this country do not care how we operate this place. What they care about is that when they interact with the system, it is efficient, effective and understandable. Sometimes we spend more time in here talking about trivialities than the things that would actually make a practical difference in people's lives. One such change would be to facilitate people by helping them to access the system and find out what they are paying and how it is calculated. I hope the Minister intends to review the proposal on a water charges relief in the coming week.We have a clear policy on it. The Government should just put it out there into the ether and forget about it for the moment because it is such a mess. One solution is not to bring in a small tax relief. Asking people to pay €300 at the marginal rate of tax is ridiculous for the complication it will put into people’s lives. That money could be given out in a much simpler way. What is the Minister for Finance’s vision of a tax system that will be fair, accessible and calculable for the ordinary people, most of whom lead fairly simple, regular lives? Has he got a vision of going from a three-tier system involving USC, with one set of rules, PAYE and self-employed income tax, with a second set of rules, and PRSI, with a third set of rules, back to a two-tier system? I was shocked at the way the increase was done through a tax credit. The Government has perpetuated a measure we introduced, one with which I never agreed, namely individualisation. This was particularly cruel because at least in the good days there were good chances for families to have two incomes. The credit should have been doubled for people who are married. It should be remembered many families who were dependent on two incomes are now dependent on one.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	430	I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for facilitating me by allowing me to speak before Private Members’ business. If a week is a long time in politics, a year is certainly a longer time. This time last year, when we debated the Finance Bill 2013, the projected adjustment to take place this year was put at €2 billion. It was to be achieved through taxation-raising measures, public expenditure reductions and so forth. Twelve months later, we find ourselves in a remarkable place where, for the first time in seven years, we have a recovery budget and are beginning to put money back into people’s pockets. In this budget we saw an increase in spending in a careful and targeted way, taxes cut for low and middle-income workers and meaningful measures that will boost growth and continue the recovery that is under way. What do we mean by recovery, however? I understand the frustration of those who have continued to work during the difficult years we have endured since the country’s financial collapse. They have worked but have seen their household incomes diminish during that period. While they hear claims that unemployment is dropping by 1,000 a month and that we are back in the bond markets at rates better than before 2004, along with other positive financial indicators, they do not feel these improvements in their pockets. Recovery really only kicks in when people actually feel it across the private and public sectors. The Government’s job is to ensure that as economic recovery continues, it is felt by all. In times of financial difficulty, Governments introduce emergency budgets, usually to take money out of people’s pockets. As the recovery proceeds, the Government should consider the introduction of a mini-budget between now and next October to put money back into people’s pockets. Before the budget, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform heard several presentations from various agencies, including IBEC, stating that the budget deficit correction actually only needed to be €400 million, but they were not taken seriously. They indicated that money could actually be returned to people. I believe serious consideration needs to be given by the Administration to these proposals. There is a criticism that the budget was unfair, with an imbalance in benefits between low-paid and high-paid workers. Those who have made this claim have done so either disingenuously or in a selective manner. A person with a child dependant earning around the €12,000 mark, which just comes into the USC area, will also now qualify for family income supplement, another State support. This person will get 60% of the difference between €250 and €504 made up. This will come to another €160 a week that they are actually getting. If one adds this to €250, then one is earning, net, what a salary of €23,000 would bring in. It is disingenuous for people to criticise the changes to the €12,000 USC entry level while not looking at the other ancillary supports and benefits introduced by the Department of Social Protection. We will see an extension of this type of thinking through the work the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection is doing on the family assist programme. At the heart of the financial crisis and meltdown was an unsustainable housing market. As we move towards recovery, we must aim for a normal and sustainable housing market that ensures people can afford to buy homes. Despite the financial crisis and the house price crash, Ireland will continue to be a home-purchasing nation. We must ensure those on average wages can get access to the housing market and can afford to buy homes. Much consideration must be given to the recent announcement by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, on loan-to-value, LTV, ratios and the requirement of a 20% deposit for a house. There were the obvious knee-jerk reactions in some quarters, which must be resisted. We should have learned from the past. We now have a regulator who represents the opposite of light-touch regulation and whom we must listen to. It also presents an opportunity to examine a new way of having a housing market that favours home purchasers over buy-to-let and corporate investors. Ultimately, the Government must choose; one cannot have a housing market in which the Government is neutral. The difficulty with the 80:20 LTV ratio is that it favours investors. First-time buyers, the very people who sustain a housing market and were locked out of the previous market, which led to its collapse, will have problems meeting an 80:20 ratio requirement as they tend to have high risks. We need to examine new lending practices or a new type of financial product geared towards favouring homeowners. This has been done in other jurisdictions, most notably Canada, which did not have a housing crash. I would like to see the Department of Finance, along with the banks and Financial Regulator, examine a new type of approach to house purchases, one targeted at first-time buyers and which is sustainable and will keep property inflation in line with wages.Ireland is on the road to recovery, there is no question about that. People need to feel that recovery in their pockets. Despite the biggest economic crash this country has ever faced, we continue to be a home-purchasing nation. For a litmus test of this recovery being real, genuine, long-term, sustainable and - to quote the Minister, Deputy Noonan - to show that we are taking a road less travelled, we need to design a mortgage product to ensure that home-owners are at the preferential end of the housing market.

Sin an fáth go bhfuilim ag tabhairt tacaíochta don PMB seo. Tá sé an-tábhachtach ar fad. As Sinn Féin's housing spokesperson, I welcome the motion by Members of the Technical Group on this important issue which lamentably remains a major problem and a cause of much heartache, stress and hardship for families up and down the country. This is a simple and clear motion which I am disappointed the Government will not be accepting. Once again the Government has instead sought to gut the motion and force us to vote on an amendment which is more focused on giving praise to the Government than reflecting on the ongoing problems and seeking a resolution. The mortgage crisis is still unfolding. People who lost their jobs, whose hours or pay were cut and who sank into negative equity, still to this day struggle to keep their home or to see a way out of crippling debt. This is despite an improvement in some of their circumstances. In June this year, the Central Bank released its latest figures on mortgage arrears. The statements surrounding this release were grim to say the least. They outlined the fact that we are currently facing a catastrophe for those in arrears in the future if something is not done. Some 35,314 mortgage accounts were found to be in arrears by two years or more, resulting in outstanding balances of €7.4 billion. This was a rise of 5.1% on the previous quarter. In more understandable terms the average arrears for these accounts rose by €5,000 to €46,000. While restructuring figures could be spun as being somewhat encouraging, campaigners made the point that mortgages were being cherry-picked for restructuring which does not bode well for future figures and those in most distress. Over 3,000 repossession applications were made in the first quarter of 2014 with no reason to believe that this rate has not continued throughout the year. A major crisis already unfolding within the wider mortgage crisis is that of the buy-to-let market. In February 2013, I had a Topical Issue debate on this subject taken by the former Minister of State, Brian Hayes. I was calling for a binding code of conduct for the buy-to-let market in a situation where tenants are in danger of losing their home due to mortgage arrears or repossession. It was clear at the time and still is that some people taking control of properties have no interest in acting as landlords and so are more than happy to remove tenants from repossessed homes. Since the end of the moratorium on repossessions, this has put families out on the street. These families were good tenants who paid their rent on time - often rent which was totally unjustifiable based on the quality of the property and in excess of the mortgage repayment owed each month. The Minister of State's response at the time was to quote a reply he had been handed. It completely ignored the issue. This has been the policy of the Government ever since. People continue to lose their homes. This code of conduct is still badly needed and I once again call on the Government to act on this. Last night my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, told of how the Government had ignored the work of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in developing a detailed report on possible measures to tackle the mortgage crisis. This report had all-party support and was born out of wide-ranging and comprehensive engagement with all manner of stakeholders. The Government's amendment to the motion before us is a restatement of its desire to ignore the issue or to engage with anyone on it outside of a few Cabinet Ministers. Is it any wonder that people are so angry at this Government? Is it any wonder they feel so utterly betrayed by it? The Government has certainly blown a lot of hot air at the banks for their failure to engage properly in providing a solution. However, the Government has certainly not done anything to make the banks listen or force them to address the problems. The report to which Deputy Doherty referred made it clear that the Central Bank must be firm with the banking industry that repossession and eviction are not sustainable solutions and they will not be accepted. Instead, the Government has responded to the banks' position with not much more than disinterest. The Government has sat by as families have lost their homes and its amendment shows that it intends to do little else in future. The Government hopes this problem will just go away, but it will not. The motion from the Technical Group rightly states that a code of conduct on mortgage arrears is not working. It is weak and without a statutory footing. Before they can take legal action, banks should be bound to offer all of the options laid out by the code of conduct. This was an important part of the report by the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. In cases where a home is repossessed, those who have lost their home should be cleared of their debt to the lender. Failing to do this is simply cruel and leaves those who have lost almost everything without any hope at all. While I am outlining Sinn Féin's policy on these matters, I am also speaking in line with the all-party report of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, which I urge the Government to revisit. Or maybe the Government should take a first look at it, as it would seem that Ministers have never heard of it. The mortgage to rent scheme must also be reformed so as to be more accessible and more effective. At present it has been described as unworkable and a miserable failure. It is a good idea put into practice in a pathetically limited model. In June 2014, it had succeeded in getting just 40 homes purchased. Mr. David Hall of the Mortgage Holders' Organisation called it "rubbish". The scheme does not put enough pressure on lenders to engage. It limits too tightly the value of homes which can be entered into the scheme. It also puts in front of any potential applicant a long road of hoops to jump through, so that they might in the end remain in a home they no longer own. A review of this scheme must take place. The Government must recognise that its application has so far failed to meet the needs of those it seeks to help, or to move on reform. This scheme could save families from eviction and provide AHBs and local authorities with extra rent revenue. In the long term it could provide an asset which becomes part of the hopelessly inadequate social housing stock. The Government's performance on the mortgage crisis has been inadequate and limp-wristed at best. At worst, its inaction has put families out of their homes while banks do as they please. I commend this motion to the House and call on the Government to wake up to the reality that this crisis is not going away and requires immediate attention and strong decisive action. This motion contains some of what is needed as well as the report by the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that I have already mentioned. Some of the leg work has been done. It is now up to the Government to tackle the problem from the side of the thousands of families struggling to keep their homes however they can.

There is a serious crisis here. I have been a member of the Finance committee since 2007 and we have watched as our economy has basically imploded. We have seen what has happened to people and their livelihoods. It has been absolutely horrible.At the end of the third quarter of 2009, approximately five years ago, 3.3% of home mortgages were in arrears by more than 90 days. By the end of the third quarter 2013, this time last year, some 12.9% of home mortgages were in arrears of more than 90 days. It is a catastrophic crisis. Not everyone can keep their homes but we must be mindful of the homeowners and children who have endured such a crisis. We must make sure we provide alternative homes, not alternative accommodation, for these people. It has had a shocking impact on young people and young families. The mortgage to rent scheme is a good idea but it is not working well. I hope the Housing Agency, which has taken responsibility for it, will come up with better results than those we have seen so far. Housing in rural areas may not suit a housing agency and there are concerns about too many people being in a house or a house being too big for the people involved. The mortgage to rent scheme may not work for everyone. The priority remains to keep people in their homes. The Government has responded but, as with everything else, more can be done. The crisis was almost overwhelming in an era when the economy was going through a significant crisis. Since 2011, the Keane report was published and the Government, along with the Central Bank, has responded. We have had legislation on personal insolvency as the previous legislation in that area did not work for those in serious financial debt. We introduced the mortgage arrears and information advisory service. One of the major problems with people who were in mortgage arrears was that they stopped engaging with the lending institutions. The crisis overwhelmed them and they stopped engaging. A service with fees removed is welcome so that people can engage and try to work themselves out of the crisis. A practical measure introduced by the Minister for Finance was to increase mortgage interest relief for those who purchased houses between 2004 and 2008 to help them hold onto their homes. The Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears is being used. The report of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform recommends that this should be put on a statutory footing, with which I agree. We have had a response from the Central Bank but we are awaiting a response from the Department of Finance. The Central Bank is also working on the mortgage arrears resolution process because there is a need to help thousands of householders who are in difficulty. Some 70,000 people are in a crisis and there are also individuals in rental accommodation owned by someone else securing a buy to let mortgage. That person may be in mortgage arrears and we need to take on board those issues. The Government is working towards this and everyone, including the banks, needs to up their game. The banks have appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform every year since 2009. The Governor of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance have appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss this. Progress is being made but it could be made faster. The report on hearings on matters relating to mortgage arrears and the resolution processes, published just before the recess by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, could form the template to move the issue along as quickly as possible. I do not know how quickly we can get these resolutions sorted out. One of the best things that happened last year was the drop in unemployment figures. We are creating jobs in the economy and this is taking people out of the crisis. We must move forward in our effort to make sure we get people working. Equally, we must move forward in resolving the crisis.

It is important we debate an issue of such importance that deals with housing, mortgages and people's lives and families. This matter has been ongoing since the start of the recession. We know the background to what happened. During the Celtic tiger years, funding was thrown around like confetti, with 100% mortgages available everywhere and people were nobodies unless they got on the property ladder. People were talking not just about homes but about the property ladder and the number of properties they could accumulate. It did not matter where these properties were built and if tax incentives pointed them in one direction, they were built in those areas. We are now witnessing ghost estates being demolished. Some 250,000 additional homes were built in those years. In 2006 we, a small country of approximately 4.5 million people, built almost exactly the same number of houses as were built in England, a country of 65 million people. Anyone in their right mind should have seen that what was happening in 2006 was unsustainable and unrealistic. Nevertheless, the fires were fuelled by further tax incentives and the end result was that the massive bubble led to a massive bust. A large number of developers who had come to the country and built the houses soon departed. We moved from one extreme to another, with virtually no housing being built. Housing that had been built was mainly built in the wrong place, with the exception being Deputy Mick Wallace, who was building them in the right place, in Dublin. Nevertheless, he also encountered problems. In 2004 and 2005, there were no mortgage arrears and nothing that exceeded 90 days. That moved up rapidly from 2008 as the situation deteriorated. The number of mortgages in arrears for principal dwelling houses increased for four consecutive quarters. People could not afford to pay and became unemployed. Between 2008 and 2011, 250,000 people lost their jobs. A crisis was created given the major cost of houses at that time and the number of people who purchased them because finance was cheap and easy to get. It was a bubble we must never allow to inflate again. There is no easy solution to the mortgage crisis and what is proposed is, by and large, positive and forward-looking. The Government has researched and implemented a number of measures to deal with the problem such as the provision of the mortgage advisory service, the reform of the insolvency and bankruptcy regimes, and the strengthening of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. The code of conduct is a central issue that the members of the Technical Group who have signed the motion would like to see addressed. I have a certain sympathy for that idea but the code of conduct is mandatory for lenders and its implementation is monitored by the Central Bank. There are on-site inspections of mortgage lenders and the Central Bank sets the mortgage arrears resolution targets that banks must meet on a quarterly basis. For example, the targets for the fourth quarter in 2014 require the banks to prepare sustainable solutions to 85% of customers who are more than 90 days in arrears and to conclude agreements with 45% of customers by the end of 2014.We will examine those figures to see those targets have been reached. They may sound ambitious but the Cental Bank is making those demands. It will undoubtedly result in a decrease in the number of mortgages in arrears. The overall figure has declined this year but the number of mortgage holders in arrears for more than two years has continued to increase. There has been an overall decline but the numbers of people in the most difficult position have increased. I have obtained figures from the Courts Service indicating the number of possession orders made in the Circuit Court has increased significantly in recent months. The average number of possession orders made in each quarter from the start of 2013 to the first quarter of this year was 88 but this more than doubled to 218 in the second quarter of 2014. That is the direction in which the trend is going. Unfortunately, the figures are only available from the Courts Service and the recorded statistics are not available in respect of residential possessions. We do not have the breakdown of other property repossessions as well as residential repossessions, which seems to be a serious flaw in the statistics. I have written to the Courts Service to ask that it address this issue in the way it compiles statistics. I am concerned that lending institutions, particularly banks, are beginning to head down the repossession route, largely due to the upturn in the housing market. It was not as attractive in the past to repossess a property because the market was not there for purchase but the danger now is that as the market picks up, the lending institutions will see markets in which to sell homes. The incentive will be for repossession to become the norm rather than the exception, and that must not become the case. The Government has made it clear that repossession should be a last resort, coming at the very end of any other processes. The Irish people have given unprecedented support to lenders and co-operated with them in every element of the process in seeking to find a particular structure that would suit in dealing with people in difficulty. Such efforts should be reciprocated by the lending institution and we should ensure that repossessions remain a last resort. We have now moved from cases of 100% mortgages to a position where the Central Bank is demanding a loan limits of 3.5 times the applicant's salary, with a 20% deposit. That is a mistake, particularly with regard to the deposit percentage. How can a young family get a roof over its head when a €200,000 house, for example, requires a €40,000 deposit? The required deposit should be reduced by half to 10% of the total loan, and the loan limit of 3.5 times a person's salary should be a sufficient guard against mortgages getting out of control. It is important to ensure that young families get a roof over their heads, and it should be made as easy as possible for them to get an initial deposit before working with a bank on a salary ratio limit. It is a more reasonable element in the proposal.

In fairness, in her introduction she reflected the experience perhaps not of all Deputies but certainly most of us who have dealt with families, in particular, who fell into a difficult financial position because of the collapse of banks and economies as a whole. Many of the points she made in introducing the motion were very solid and good in spirit. As Deputy Costello has mentioned, the principle is important regardless of which side of the House a Deputy sits. If something of merit is said, it should be recognised. The fact that family homes could be at risk is a sensitive subject. It is one of the by-products of the collapse of the economy and it can lead to great anguish for families. It can even destroy some families, as I have dealt with cases where marriages fell apart because of financial strain. I know of cases where both parents lost jobs within a year, even when the jobs were very good and the mortgages were large. Most people would admit if they had borrowed way beyond their means but having said that, such people would have done so with the assistance of the local bank, which could not give out money quickly enough. Unfortunately, some people found themselves in an awful position as a result. Different banks exercised different ways of dealing with clients and unsustainable mortgages. Until the collapse, banks had a free run in this country and were treated with too much respect by ordinary people. The population does not look up to banks or their managers now, although I am sure there are some good bank managers. I could not list any now.

We have made some positive changes with regard to accountability and the control of banks, as people on both sides of the House would admit. We have also dealt with control of the Central Bank, which was a very powerful body in this country. Again, it had free reign but exercised little control. Some of what happened was unbelievable and, as we now know, contributed to the mess in which we found ourselves. Other Members and I would like certain restrictions to be introduced for banks, which are held to account in other jurisdictions in a greater way than we can see here. This is a learning curve and Deputy Collins last night indicated that in the history of the State, we are fortunate that this sort of calamity has happened only once. I hope, if this Parliament does as it should, it will never happen again. The Members present might remember that when this Dáil was in its early days, the discussion predominantly concerned banks and their future. Not all of us used the word "eviction" but there was a fear in that respect and I am sure it was real for many people. Whatever the shortcomings of the legislation being introduced, there were some cries of the word in the House from a small number of Members, although most people behaved very responsibly. The word "eviction" has a connotation among us as Irish people for very good reasons.Fortunately, use of that word did not become the norm. I acknowledge that there are sad cases; people are in difficulties with mortgages and we should welcome discussions like this about those who have been left behind, irrespective of from which side of the House the discussion originates.

Government policy is being implemented to support households in arrears and Government targets have seen progress in reducing the number of mortgages in arrears across the country. The statistics we heard at the finance committee meeting today with representatives of the Bank of Ireland reflect this. More such meetings are to follow with the other banks, but it does not take a genius to see that many households are still in arrears and families are in crisis as a result. This should never be acceptable - the statistics are positive, but each household in crisis is much more than a statistic. The targets set by the Central Bank for the fourth quarter are optimistic and I look forward to seeing the results at the end of the year, given the momentum that some of the banks have built in the past 12 months, but we in this House can do much more to assist people in mortgage arrears, as can the banks. Research by Fitch Ratings was published recently and it showed that the figure for average default expectations in Europe was around €235 billion. Ireland, Spain and Portugal are, unfortunately, the worst culprits and the research shows a growth in hedge funds seeking to take advantage of the market position. These hedge funds are buying up commercial non-performing loans and buy-to-let performing loans, but there is a dearth of options for those in mortgage distress in their family homes. I welcome this debate and thank the Opposition for tabling the motion. I take the opportunity to set out alternative solutions to the current list of problems in this area. Everyone in the House is aware of New Beginning; unfortunately, tens of thousands of families around the country are aware of it because they have had to avail of its services. It was co-founded by Mr. Ross Maguire and Mr. Vincent P. Martin and has a new programme that includes a socially responsible element, the idea being to allow families to remain in their homes while finding mechanisms to write down unsustainable debt. The fund New Beginning has established will allow banks and the Government to co-operate to find a solution for the 15,000 to 25,000 families that find themselves unable to pay much off their mortgages. Families with loans that have been non-performing for over 240 days will be able to sell their homes to New Beginning and re-lease them over a seven year period. At any stage during the seven year period they will be able to buy back their homes at the prevailing market value. Account will be taken of any rise in property prices between the initial purchase by New Beginning and the repurchase by the family in question. It is an initiative that the Government examined some years ago, when it went by the name of "mortgage to lease", but could not implement owing to a technicality that would not allow the State to act as landlord or lessor. This is an initiative where the fund will be regulated when established and, most importantly, has a socially conscious element whereby a family will be allowed to stay in their home and benefit from a rise in the value of the property. As we all know that property prices will rise in the coming months and years, this initiative is to be praised and supported, particularly by the banks. I encourage the Government to continue to support it, as it has done in the past. I commend Mr. Ross Maguire and Mr. Vincent P. Martin of New Beginning on their work and extend this to the organisation's staff members who work on a voluntary basis. The work is done in a quiet and consistent manner and there are families who would not be in the position they are but for the support of the organisation. The work was particularly necessary before the Government got its act together and set up the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, process. The support of New Beginning has helped families in distress up and down the country. I encourage the six lending institutions that own most mortgage debt in the country, particularly the three banks the State has supported financially, to examine seriously this offering when it comes before them in the coming weeks and months. It could help the institutions to meet their mortgage resolution process targets and will give a decent offering that is greater than the mortgage to rent offering. In my humble opinion, the mortgage to rent offering is poor, but this gives a real, socially conscious offering to families that will allow them remain in their homes. This measure should be supported and I commend the Government on doing so, but I ask that the six lending institutions, including the three main banks, examine it seriously in the coming weeks. If it is accepted, it will help the 15,000 to 25,000 families in serious distress to keep their family homes in a discreet and quiet fashion.

Buying a home, be it a house or an apartment, is the biggest investment most people will make in their lives; therefore, it is important that we, as legislators, discuss this issue and try to bring forward measures to assist those in distress. It does not matter which side of the House we occupy; nobody wants to see a family, couple or an individual fall behind on a mortgage or be evicted. We want to give young people and young families the opportunity to step onto the property ladder - I am 28 years old and would like to do so in a number of years. This is still a daunting issue because not long ago the property bubble caused extremely high house prices and once it burst there was an extraordinary drop in values. Ultimately, the entire property market collapsed and we are still trying to deal with the consequences. As a Government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have tried to address this issue by putting arrangements in place to assist people. I am referring to the Personal Insolvency Act and the creation of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS. There are issues around MABS and not everyone agrees that it performs its duties as well as possible. The Government is trying its best. The mortgage to rent scheme was launched in 2012 and enables eligible individuals to remain in their homes. The number of accounts that have been in arrears for over 90 days continues to fall and we are moving in the right direction, although I agree that a figure of over 69,000 is still too high. Most importantly, I have spoken to a number people of my age who say that without mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers, they do not know where they would be. They do not know if they would still be in their homes and able to maintain making payments. The Government has taken many actions to help people, but some problems persist. If a person in mortgage distress cannot speak to someone in a financial institution on the telephone, there is a serious problem. A man in my constituency is a single parent and has worked his entire life. Like many, he lost his job and was unable to keep up making full payments on his mortgage, but he never failed to pay back something. He paid over €600 every month for four years, but he now owes over €50,000 more than he did when he first took out the mortgage. I do not know how anyone could do what he did, given the pressure he was put under, and he has now reached an agreement to pay €500 less per month, but it took a year to make contact with the bank. It is unacceptable that this should happen nowadays and banks should take note of such cases. We are moving in the right direction, but we all come across cases such this on a daily basis and must deal with them. I thank Phoenix Project, an organisation in County Offaly, because it helps people like the man I mentioned to deal with banks and speak to them. We have come a long way, but we must ensure there is not another property bubble. It is worrying that house prices are rising - it is not happening everywhere in Ireland, but it is evident in Dublin.An interested party is quite likely to come across a viewing of a house where there are 50 people standing outside all bidding for that same house while the price is going up and up because of demand. We need to be very careful with that. The Central Bank is trying to address the problem and has put forward a motion that first-time buyers should have 20% upfront when buying a house. While I understand where the bank is coming from I believe that is too much. As a said earlier, I am 28 years old and I am keen to get on the property ladder myself, but I know from speaking to my peers and other young families that 20% is simply too much to ask first-time buyers to put forward for a home. I am calling for the proposed level to be halved, reduced to 10% or a maximum of 15% to allow people to get on the property ladder. While we have seen a major increase in the number of people who have been assisted with their mortgages, there is still a long way to go. I welcome the debate and I am glad the Opposition has brought forward the topic for debate.

The data showed that the number of mortgages in arrears of more than 90 days fell. At the time that figure fell for the fourth consecutive quarter but well over 120,000 homeowners continue to carry the burden of mortgage debt and long-term arrears. This figure is continuing to grow. According to the bank's statistics, over 37,000 mortgage accounts were in arrears for more than 720 days, over two years, during the second quarter of this year, an astounding figure. Instead of making progress with their arrears these people, who became seriously indebted at the early stages of the economic crisis, are becoming more deeply trapped in the quagmire. There has been an accelerated rate of applications to repossess homes. Over 3,000 repossession proceedings had issued by the end of the third quarter of this year. Local authority lending is also crippled by arrears. This sector is often forgotten about and is a sector that does not seem to have been given any focus in this crisis. A great proportion of loans in this sector are in arrears to the banks. The total outstanding value of all local authority mortgages stood at almost €1.2 billion at the end of 2013. Almost one in three local authority mortgages were in arrears of over 90 days. Almost 20,000 people have a local authority or council mortgage and over 6,000 of these were in arrears of more than 90 days at the end of last year. Local authority councils have repossessed more than 400 houses between 2010 and 2013 and, according to the figures of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, many of the people involved may find themselves reliant on our social housing system. The system is already unable to cope with the existing numbers of qualified applicants on the lists. We are well aware of this but it puts all these councils in a precarious position. They will now have to re-house the people whose houses have been repossessed. This will rebound on the local authorities that are already under pressure. The Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation ought to be commended on its outstanding work on reaching agreement on a long-term resolution for 1,330 people in mortgage arrears. This was achieved under the pilot scheme conducted with the AIB during the past 12 months. Since its establishment the scheme has been available free of charge to all AIB customers, including those with the EBS and Haven. As well as the 1,330 people referred to a further 177 cases are due to be decided shortly. In 30% of these cases customers who were facing proceedings managed to achieve a long-term sustainable solution. Strong commendation is due to David Hall and his organisation on achieving this. I am pleased that the arrangements between the IMHO and AIB is to be extended for a further 12 months with an expanded team. The team is now functional and receiving over 125 calls per day. This will mean, for example, that in many of the these distressed mortgage cases a resolution can be achieved within two months or seven or eight weeks. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform produced a report on mortgage arrears in July. It recommended that the project be rolled out nationally to involve all the banks. It was disappointing to learn at today's finance committee meeting that the chief executive of Bank of Ireland, Mr. Richie Boucher, more or less did not embrace the concept. He was not over-enthusiastic when he was asked about extending the project to his bank. I understand Ulster Bank has a similar line of thought and is rejecting it. It is interesting to note that Bank of Ireland repossessed 621 owner-occupied or buy-to-let properties in the first half of this year. This data was in documentation given to Oireachtas Members at the committee meeting today. The bank representatives told the committee that 322 judgments were enforced against owner-occupiers and 299 on buy-to-let investments. This means that the properties were either in the bank's possession or had been sold. In the first six months of this year the bank sold 80 properties that it had repossessed. Data provided to the committee show that 85 properties were repossessed in 2010, rising to 166 the following year, to 180 in 2012 and to 214 for last year. This means a grand total of 645 people have been evicted from their homes, to put it mildly. Between 2010 and last year Bank of Ireland disposed of 383 of these properties, which are so needed by victimised people who have borne the brunt of what the banks have been carrying out in recent years. They were walked up the garden path in many respects. Now, with low pay, cuts to their pay packets and ongoing taxes, of which there is a long list, these people cannot keep a roof over their heads. They are only trying to survive and live. Mr. Boucher indicated he intends to veto the insolvency arrangements. I believe this is a drastic measure and that there should be more co-operation in this respect.

I commend her on putting forward this motion and on consistently raising the issues of mortgage distress and the need to deal fairly with people who find themselves in this extremely difficult situation. The proposals Deputy Collins has put forward are nothing more than the proposals agreed by an all-party committee that examined these issues, including members of the Government parties. Therefore, I do not see why the Government has moved an amendment to the motion. There seems to be widespread acceptance that there is no consistency whatsoever in terms of the banks and mortgage lenders to deal with the problems of mortgage arrears and that we need to improve the situation considerably to bring fairness, certainty and assurance to the many tens of thousands of families who find themselves in extreme difficulty now, some six years after this crisis hit.One can bandy about statistics on the number of mortgages that are less than 90 days in arrears and the banks meeting targets and so forth, but all of that masks the human reality that 130,000 families have been living a nightmare for six years. For many of them, there is no end to that nightmare. That is a very debilitating, unfair situation to put families and children through - living in a constant state of anxiety and insecurity about the roof over their heads. The Government has failed to deal decisively with that, despite the fact that an all-party committee of the Oireachtas has stated that it should do precisely what is proposed in this motion. It is worth pointing out that I, Deputy Joan Collins, and many other Members would go a great deal further than what is proposed in the motion. We have said from the beginning that Ireland should have adopted the Norwegian model and simply forced the banks to agree deals with distressed mortgage holders which would ensure that they kept the roofs over their heads. The Government has resisted that. Instead, it has put in place some rules and regulations, but to a large extent it has left the ultimate decisions in the hands of private banks. The banks are commercially driven and interested in profit. They are not particularly interested in the distress in which mortgage holders find themselves. It is worth noting the contrast between a bank that is fully owned by the State and other banks that are privatised or close to being privatised, after we bailed them out. The State-owned bank at least has brought in a third party in the form of the Irish Mortgage Holders' Organisation, which has been campaigning consistently for fairness and consistency in how we deal with distressed mortgage holders and is showing itself capable of getting results. It raises the question of why other banks, such as Bank of Ireland, which we also bailed out, are allowed to behave in whatever way they wish. As they consider their first responsibility to be their shareholders and making money for those shareholders, they are far less interested in the fate and plight of people who have distressed mortgages. It is against that background that the Government is being asked to be fair. I wish to make a final point. The other side of this coin is the spiralling social housing lists, the bill for which is being picked up by the taxpayer. They are spiralling out of control and to a large extent this is being caused by banks forcing tenants out as receivers move in and the banks repossessing people's homes, as a result of which people go on social housing lists. It was confirmed last week that the social housing list in Dún Laoghaire has increased from 4,000 to over 5,000 in just one year. I have not seen the national figures yet, but if that increase is replicated around the country, we are facing a social housing crisis that is spiralling out of control. We have not dealt in a proper way with the issue of providing housing for people as a right and ensuring that banks treat people fairly. If the State is not going to step up to the mark in terms of forcing the banks to behave properly, it should at least build social and affordable housing to ensure that people will have somewhere to go when they are turfed out by the banks. Indeed, it is this and previous Governments' privatisation of the housing market that has left us in this sorry state in the first place.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	443	I commend Deputy Joan Collins on tabling this motion. Many of the problems highlighted in it have not gone away. The motion is about poor banking behaviour, deregulation and the failure of the State to control the banking system in any way. That has led to a situation in which we are now facing an increased number of repossessions. It is a crazy scenario. Of course, we are all well aware that the deregulation should never have happened in the first place. However, the ideology that drove deregulation, neoliberalism, is sadly still alive and well, which poses a problem for the future. The Government still cannot tell the banks what to do. The State refused to have any measure of control over the banks in the good times, and even when the State owned the banks, it was still very reluctant to tell them what to do. That is a massive problem. The principle behind repossessions does not make sense. It is fair enough if somebody can afford to pay a mortgage and will not pay it, but if a person cannot afford to pay a mortgage there is little common sense in throwing them out of the house. It costs more in the long term. There is no logic in throwing people out of their homes, especially if they cannot afford to pay the mortgage. Ninety-nine percent of people would pay their mortgages if they could, because they wish to remain in their homes. The fact that we are still unable to tell the banks what to do means that they will be able to do what they wish. The banks do not look at the building a person lives in as a home. To them it is a financial asset on which money is owed, and if they do not get the money they wish to take action. They claim that repossession is a last resort. However, it is not the State that is deciding what a last resort means. Sadly, it is the banks, so they do what they like. That is the reason there is an increased number of repossessions now. Repossessions were not nearly as plentiful three and four years ago. In the first place, the banks were so far under water they did not know their backsides from their elbows. Second, when people were living in homes that were seriously underwater and had no equity in them, the banks were reluctant to move on them. Obviously, the change in the legislation has facilitated their actions now, but it also has become more attractive for the banks to repossess because there is more equity in these homes. In cases in which people cannot pay their mortgage, it is becoming more attractive to the bank to sell the property, because prices have increased. One was nearly safer when one was in more trouble, because one's so-called asset, one's home, was less attractive to the bank. This situation is going to get worse before it gets better, not just in the short term but in the long term. In my lifetime - and I have been in the industry for most of my life - there has never been a real housing strategy in this country. It has always been market and developer-led. Planning is market and developer-led and, sadly, the State has been too often led by the nose by the developer as well. I am not just referring to the present.The problem has been prevalent for the past 30 years. If the State wishes to change how things are done, it has a great deal of work to do. First and foremost, a complete change of ideology is required.  The Central Bank has proposed that loans be limited to three and a half times the salary of mortgage applicants and that applicants be required to produce a deposit of 20% of the price of the property. This has created a new game, which is fine as it will mean with fewer people meeting these criteria, the number of people getting into trouble with their mortgages is likely to decline. However, it will also mean that almost half of young people will never be able to afford to own a home. This is not the end of the world. In the rest of Europe, there is much less emphasis on owning one's home because it is much cheaper to rent. The Italians, for example, are happy to rent, with home owners in Italy making up only 25% of the market and people renting making up the remaining 75%. One can rent cheaply in Italy, for example, in Turin it is possible to rent a nice apartment for €300 per month. If one were to try to do that in Dublin, it would not work out very well.  If fewer people are able to afford to buy a home, it will be crucial that the State turns its back on the current approach of throwing people at the mercy of the private rental market. This is not the correct approach. In the past 30 years, only minimal efforts have been made to build social houses and these have been concentrated in poor areas. As we know, people who live in poor housing tend to be poor and have poor life opportunities. Very often, this comes back to bite the State through various social problems. If we proceed with the proposal that banks be required to provide loans of not more than three and a half times a person's salary and demand a deposit of 20%, we will also have to rethink completely our approach to social housing by building good quality social housing for up to half the population. Social housing will be required in all areas and we will have to move away from ghettoisation and poor quality social housing. An entirely new approach to the issue is needed and the sooner a Government adopts such an approach, the better.

I am surprised and disappointed that the Government saw fit to table an amendment which effectively amounts to a counter motion. Given that the contents of the motion are ostensibly Government policy, I hope the Government, even at this late stage, will withdraw the amendment and allow the motion to be passed unanimously. I note the Government at least agrees there is a mortgage crisis. This crisis has been ongoing for a number of years, with as many as 120,000 families having lived a nightmare for the past six or seven years. Thousands of people are living in mortgage misery and in fear of action by the bailed out banks. They are being bullied by these banks which the State and taxpayers rescued. People are in genuine fear of losing their family home and this fear is both palpable and traumatic. All public representatives, whether at local or national level, will be aware that this issue is creating serious mental health issues for a significant number of individuals and families. At this stage, people even fear the sight of the postman in case he or she delivers the dreaded letter from their bank which demands either the sale or repossession of the family home. I have a copy of one such letter, which offers people the stark options of engaging in a voluntary sale or voluntary surrender of their home, failing which they will be evicted. This letter informs home owners in respect of "all of the options above" that "in the event of a shortfall", they remain "liable for the outstanding debt", including accrued interest, charges, legal, selling and other related costs. The bank in question also states that it will "always seek the gross sale proceeds and a certified copy of the unconditional contract for sale." The options facing these home owners are voluntary sale, voluntary surrender and eviction. Having a roof over one's head and being able to continue to live in one's family home is probably one of the most cherished aspirations of people here and worldwide. Why should that not be the case? I draw attention to as many as 30,000 families who face eviction as a result of the Government's failure to protect them because they are not covered by the insolvency arrangements. I refer to mortgage holders who do not qualify under these arrangements on the basis that they have insufficient disposal income. The individuals in question have fully engaged with their lenders and are not strategic defaulters. Their only asset is their family home. I am not referring to owners of buy-to-let properties. The mortgages held by these families are modest, amounting to less than €100,000 in many cases and less than €200,000 in all cases. They are low income families headed in most, if not all, cases by an unemployed person. These householders took out a mortgage when they were employed, having been urged to do so by every arm of the State, from the Central Bank to the Government and politicians, as well as the banks and media. Having become unemployed, they now find themselves unable to meet their mortgage commitments. There is no doubt that these families are in very serious difficulty, with many facing eviction. The number of repossessions and court actions in train indicates that thousands of evictions are imminent. Apart from the severe human trauma this will create, whether in terms of people's health or otherwise, these families will join between 90,000 and 100,000 other families in the queue for social housing.Again, this is an additional cost for the Government. They will find themselves in a position where they will have to apply for housing, be approved and qualify for rent supplement at a cost to the State. It would be advantageous to all concerned, namely, the mortgage holder, the State and the banks, to ensure such families remain in the family home. In that regard, I refer to the mortgage to rent scheme mentioned in the motion. It is a good scheme in theory, but, unfortunately, the banks are not prepared to use it and appear to be opposed to it. Very few mortgage to rent solutions have been approved. This should change and the scheme should be beefed up to ensure the 30,000 families who face eviction are dealt with.  Other issues need to be addressed. Split mortgages and the mortgage to rent scheme are mentioned in the motion. To solve this problem there needs to be a significant write-down of mortgages.

In that regard, I compliment Deputy Joan Collins for tabling the motion, in particular on its timing. Representatives of the banks appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform today. Like others, I attended the committee as a member in the past few years until my appointment as a Minister of State and it is fair to say the banks have a different opinion. I have before me a list of many of the measure the Government has taken. I will address some of the points made by previous speakers, in particular Deputy Joe Costello's point about the availability of proper statistics, not just to the committee but more generally. It is a point well worth following up on and I hope the Department will do so with respect to the difference between mortgage to rent properties and family homes.  I share the positive commentary of Deputy Regina Doherty on New Beginning and the introduction of a changed scheme which could made a difference.  Deputy Liam Twomey, as Chairman of the committee, has engaged following publication of its report on this issue which was presented to the Department in July. Many Deputies who were part of the cross-party committee felt measures contained within it could be of benefit in helping to solve many of the very difficult problems people faced. As Deputy Liam Twomey said, the Minister is giving consideration to many of the suggestions made in the report. It is interesting to note that there appears from the contributions made to be a degree of consensus on the difficult choice to be made between the deposit one is required to have to purchase a family home and not wanting to have it so low as to fuel another property bubble. The key component is targeting and identifying the family home. To a large extent, the property bubble was not fuelled by people purchasing family homes. The Minister, the Department and all of us in the Government parties are aware that there is a lot to be done. There have been some very significant measures introduced and some of the statistics for the reductions in numbers show that they are, albeit slowly, starting to take effect. Borrower engagement with banks, through the introduction of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears which was revised in 2013 to strengthen consumer protection and ensure fairness and sustainability, is vital, as is achievement of the mortgage arrears resolution targets. I agree with the comments made on all of these targets, percentages and statistics. Any of us who holds constituency clinics will be aware that it comes down to individuals and families. Deputy Mick Wallace said 99% of people wished to pay their home mortgages and we all have to acknowledge that this is the case. Strategic default is not happening as people are trying to pay their mortgages on their homes. We have also seen reform of the insolvency and bankruptcy regime which for some has been of assistance. The provision of the mortgage advisory service was the result of the Department of Social Protection's review last year.

Deputy Joan Collins was disappointed not to be able to table a motion on Irish Water as Fianna Fáil had done so previously. In some ways, it is ironic because if Irish Water is established, it will be like a second mortgage for many homeowners. That said, the issue of mortgages and the number of families affected has probably not received sufficient attention. From that point of view, it is important that the motion has been tabled. As of October, 132,000 households were in mortgage arrears, representing just short of 500,000 citizens who are under severe economic pressure and for whom the Government stated it had a solution. Given that the overwhelming majority have been in arrears for over two years, whatever the Government thinks it is doing to deal with the problem, the reality is different.  We need to examine the issue by stepping back. There are hundreds of thousands of households in the State in serious need of housing who are forgoing the basic necessities of life in order to engage in a struggle to keep a roof over their heads, which is incredibly unhealthy. I will not repeat the points made by other Deputies, but the figures available for the numbers of sustainable solutions about which the banks are bragging - over 5,000 in the case of Bank of Ireland - pale into insignificance when we look at the large numbers in arrears. I agree with the proposition that what the Government is doing and the current code of conduct essentially allow the banks to do what they like. We need to stand the arrangement in place on its head and put protecting the family home centre stage. That has to be the starting point, but the reality is that it is not. Today the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, spoke to the media and essentially bragged about the new arrangements in regard to mortgage protection and the scheme being brought forward to help buyers to buy property and overcome some of the restrictions the banks were introducing. This is not about the interests of homeowners; rather, it is, first and foremost, about protecting the banks' money. That is why we are in this position.Everything is being done to appease the banks; we are not starting at the essential point of keeping people in their homes. This is a bit rich for people to accept against the backdrop of the €64 billion of our money that was spent on bailing out the banks. Mortgage arrears would account for only a small amount of that, and the banks have been recapitalised for that money already. We must have an arrangement in regard to the writing down of debt. That is the best move for the economy and for the citizens involved. This is the experience of other countries. Norway and Iceland recovered far more quickly by releasing people from the burden of debt, and that must happen here. The motion before us is more modest than this and does not even look for a Norwegian solution. It simply seeks to alter the code of conduct that exists currently and for us to start on the basis of keeping people in their homes. I do not understand how the Government can oppose the motion. I know of a situation in my area in which a couple has been through hoops to try to defend the family home. They have gone through every form of restructuring arrangement, have changed to an interest-only mortgage and so on and kept to the agreements made, but out of the blue the bank decided to move the goalposts. It says now it wants everything, the full debt amount. This couple then goes into a process where they meet some young person with little life experience who tells them how to manage their finances. This family, which has been through an episode of serious ill health and needed to factor in emergency medical expenses, was suddenly being lectured by somebody as to how to manage their expenses. It is suggested that if they cut back on medicine in one area or food, they could sustain their mortgage. Clearly, they could not. This is not good enough. We need more definite arrangements along the lines outlined by Deputy Collins in her motion in order to deal with this situation. It is not good enough that the banks are allowed to rule the roost in the manner they do. I do not believe the Ombudsman has played the correct role in this scenario either. Unless we deal with the big vulture of unsustainable debt that is on the backs of a minority of householders now, the economy and those families will be decimated. We must deal with this issue sooner rather than later.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	449	I thank and congratulate Deputy Collins on bringing forward this important motion at this time. We sometimes forget when we are talking about water charges and other important issues that over 160,000 mortgages in this country are in arrears. This means that 500,000 men, women and children are living in homes with mortgages that are in arrears. This does not include the tens or hundreds of thousands more who are struggling to stay out of arrears or who have had their mortgages restructured and are not in arrears. Years into this crisis, huge numbers of men, women and children are living in these homes. Let me give one example. I met a couple this week who are close to retirement. The husband has had to give up work for health reasons and the wife works on the minimum wage and has done so all her life. They live in Blessington, but their mortgage is in arrears and their bank has moved for possession of the house. The house is in equity, but not in significant equity. However, because of the shambles that is the mortgage-to-rent scheme, this couple cannot avail of that equity. If this couple had been fortunate enough to bank with AIB during the bubble, they would have passed its test for a split mortgage product for homes in positive equity. AIB would have given them a split mortgage with 0% interest on the warehoused portion. Then, when both reached retirement age, AIB would have done a debt-for-equity swap. It would take equity in their house and bring the remainder of their mortgage payment down to something they could pay through retirement, which would let them live and retire with dignity. When the couple passed away, AIB would have taken the portion of the home required to pay the debt. However, this couple banks with Bank of Ireland and cannot avail of the AIB solution. Instead, Bank of Ireland will evict them. It has already brought them to court and is refusing to do anything that will keep this couple in their house. Bank of Ireland does not have a split mortgage product where there is equity in a house. Even where it has a split mortgage product, it charges interest on the shelved portion, so this solution would not work anyway. Bank of Ireland does not have a debt-for-equity solution at retirement. Therefore, this is what is about to happen. In three months' time, this couple will be pulled back into a court in Wicklow, the judge will grant possession of their house, the sheriffs will come and kick them out of their house and they will be left with just a small amount of money. Bank of Ireland will take approximately another €10,000 from them for legal fees, for having the audacity to have forced it to hire lawyers to bring them to court so as to kick them out of their house. This couple will not get rent allowance from the State because the council will say it is sorry but it cannot give an allowance as the couple has savings and does not qualify. They will be told they must spend the little bit of residual funds they have following their eviction on rent. In two or three years' time, when all that money is gone, they will show up at Wicklow County Council offices and say they are two retirees on very little income with no savings left and that they are now homeless. Wicklow County Council will tell them it has no house for them and they will then come to my office and say they are still homeless. This is what is going to happen because this couple banks with Bank of Ireland rather than with AIB. I am not here to cheerlead for AIB, which has done both good and bad. The point is that the Government's approach from day one has been that this issue needs to be resolved on a case-by-case basis. The Government believes it is not up to it to interfere in the banking market, although it is when that market needs €64 billion of taxpayers' money. It believes it is not up to it to interfere when there is a need to protect people like this couple. Therefore, we, the Government, do not care that these people will be evicted. We do not care that other people in the country in the very same position will not be evicted because they banked with another bank. We do not care, because we do not feel it is right and proper to interfere in how the banks work. We may talk about the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, the CCMA, but is an entirely voluntary code. I have heard Ministers, who should know better, state that it is a mandatory code, but that is nonsense.  The heart of the matter is that this type of issue is arising every day. There are 500,000 men, women and children in these houses. The reason this continues in Ireland, in contrast to any other country, is that the Government continues to say, "We do not care; let the banks sort it out themselves." The only way this is going to change is if the decision-maker in government at this time is changed, because he is calling the shots.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-11-05 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	450	I would like to comment on the points made by Deputy Coppinger last night. The motion does not attempt to deal with the totality of the mortgage crisis. I put forward a Private Members' Bill on that issue on a previous occasion and proposed the Norwegian model which would allow a write-down of debt. This motion deals specifically with problems with the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, and the mortgage-to-rent scheme. Anyone who deals with serious problems as a MARP third-party representative knows that lenders do not operate on the basis that voluntary surrender or repossession should be the last option. The only way to change this is to introduce a legal requirement, not an onus, to offer substantial solutions as outlined in this motion. This would make an enormous difference to the tens of thousands of homeowners in their dealings with the banks. The proposals in the motion are fully supported by the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, whose members I welcome here tonight. It has done far more on third-party representation and has gained far more experience in this area than anybody else. It believes that what is proposed in this motion is what is needed to resolve the issues. I want to refer now to some of the specific points made by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Harris, in his contribution to the debate last night. He said:The CCMA provides that lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where they have already made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative arrangement with a co-operating borrower. Any bank proceeding to legal recourse with co-operating borrowers in circumstances where an alternative sustainable arrangement is feasible and can be agreed is not acting in a manner consistent with a mortgage arrears resolution process or with the CCMA.This is simply not true. There is no sanction or no compulsion under the CCMA or the MARP unless we accept that voluntary surrender represents a sustainable solution. The Minister of State went on to say: "Of course, these efforts can only achieve positive results in circumstances where the borrower co-operates with the lender and engages with the process." This is outrageous. The Government is suggesting it is only non-co-operating borrowers who face repossession. Last night I gave two examples of distressed homeowners in my constituency. They are in the family home and borrowers who have co-operated fully with their lenders through the MARP. They were represented by a person in my office and then represented by the IMHO. The implication in the Minister of State's contribution to the debate should be withdrawn. Some Government Deputies have expressed sympathy for the motion. I am sure all Deputies are genuinely expressing sympathy for the thousands of families who fear losing their homes. It is all very well to have sympathy, but, as Ministers and Government backbench Deputies, they are going to vote down a motion which, although it would not resolve the totality of the crisis, would assist thousands of families. From that point of view, I repeat the key points as to why the motion is before the House. There is an ongoing crisis. Some 22,000 cases are either in or will be entered into the legal process. We could, therefore, be facing more than 20,000 evictions. I thank Deputy Sean Fleming for using that term. The CCMA is not fit for purpose because there is no legal requirement to offer viable solutions such as those we put forward in the motion. The mortgage-to-rent scheme is in need of a major overhaul. It has not resulted in 50 but 38 conclusions, which is pathetic. House values are rising, which means that the limits of €180,000 and €220,000 are now too low and need to be raised. To protect the family home, I brought forward the motion and hope Deputies will come into the Dáil Chamber to vote for it.
