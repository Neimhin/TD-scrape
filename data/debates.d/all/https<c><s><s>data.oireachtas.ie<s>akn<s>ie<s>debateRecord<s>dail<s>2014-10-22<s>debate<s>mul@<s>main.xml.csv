Nonetheless, I raise the very serious and important matter of the proposed legislation pertaining to the National Concert Hall, NCH, and in particular, the lack of a proposal for clear gender balance on the board as well as what I would see as the excessive powers the legislation gives the Minister to interfere in the affairs of the NCH.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	The programme for Government includes a commitment to take steps to ensure that all State boards have at least 40% of each gender. Nine of the 17 bodies funded from my Department's Vote group that currently have boards in place have already reached that target. I have developed an implementation plan to reaffirm and achieve the target of 40% of each gender on the remaining boards and will be working with all bodies to move towards 45% of each gender as the new target for gender equality. It may be noted, however, that in a number of boards certain appointments are made other than by way of Government or ministerial appointment, for example, on foot of nominations by other bodies, by way of elections or on an ex officio basis. Clearly, such circumstances can have an influence on the gender balance of the boards in question. I can assure the Deputy, however, that I am fully committed to further promoting gender equality across all of the bodies and agencies funded from my Department's Vote. The general scheme of the national cultural institutions (National Concert Hall) Bill sets out that the Minister shall, to the greatest extent possible, ensure that there is an equitable balance between men and women in the membership of the board. As the Deputy will appreciate, there is a number of different ways in which this issue can be reflected in legislation and I remain open to considering, in the drafting of the text of the Bill, how best to deliver on this commitment to gender balance. In general terms, the purpose of the Bill is to establish the National Concert Hall, NCH, as a statutory body and to put in place a governance framework that will provide for appropriate reporting and accounting to the Minister and onwards to the Oireachtas. The legislation must stand the test of time, enabling the NCH to fulfil its functions to promote and encourage the performance of music to the highest standards regardless of what Minister is in place.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 It is important to emphasise that artistic policy at the national cultural institutions has never been nor ever will be the remit of the Minister and this is guaranteed in the draft legislation currently being prepared. The general scheme provides that the Minister may issue general policy directions on matters such as pay policy and staffing but not artistic or curatorial matters. It also sets out the Minister's role in the statement of strategy and in the approval of staffing and borrowing by the NCH, among other things. I do not consider that these proposed provisions are an inappropriate intrusion into the business of the NCH, especially in the context of the significant level of State funding being provided to it. Indeed, they are broadly reflective of the approach to corporate governance adopted in other legislation enacted in recent years.  I am, of course, aware that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, of which the Deputy is a member, is currently engaged in pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme of the Bill. These issues will, no doubt, form part of the committee's considerations and I look forward to receiving its report in due course and to the further debate which will take place on these and other matters as the Bill proceeds through the legislative process.

What we have before us at present states quite clearly that the Minister will "endeavour, to the greatest extent practicable" to achieve an equal balance between men and women on the NCH board. The phrase "endeavour, to the greatest extent practicable" has no legislative meaning. It is a pretty worthless commitment and is at variance with what the Minister has just said in terms of indicating a strong commitment to working towards gender balance. That commitment is not reflected in the text. Additionally, the Bill as proposed provides that the board shall take policy directions from the Minister "in such a manner and at such intervals as the Minister may direct". I put it to the Minister that this allows for extraordinary potential to interfere in the affairs of a cultural institution.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	I reiterate that I am absolutely committed to gender balance. It is important that there is strong representation of both genders on all boards because decision-making is much better when issues are viewed from different perspectives. The legislation is at a very early stage and I am happy to engage with the committee on it. I am open to suggestions that will improve the legislation. I am not looking for control but I am looking for accountability and good corporate governance. I want to allow this important institution to continue to thrive and flourish while at the same time holding it accountable to the taxpayer, which is important given the level of funding it receives. I want to make it clear that the legislation is at an early stage and I am very open to listening to the suggestions and views of Oireachtas Members because at the end of day, we all want the best possible legislation that will protect the taxpayer.

Why would the Minister want to be in a position to direct the board of the NCH? That the current or any future Minister should be in a position to direct the activities of the board is bizarre in the extreme. Indeed, it is the antithesis of how a government should be treating any national cultural institution. It also seems to me to be unprecedented, in the context of cultural legislation at least, that any draft plan or strategy would be exempt from the freedom of information process for five years, as the general scheme provides. Why would the plans or strategies of the NCH be exempt from the FOI process? Why would such a provision be included in the legislation? It makes no sense.

There will be much more debate on this legislation and I am very happy to take on board the different suggestions and ideas put forward by Deputies and Senators because at the end of the day, we all want an institution that is allowed to continue to thrive and flourish but which is also accountable to the taxpayer.

#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	Revised designs for the restoration of the national monument buildings at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, and the creation of a commemorative centre to the leaders of the 1916 Rising on the site, were approved by my predecessor under the National Monuments Acts on 30 April 2014. Consent has been granted to the owners under those Acts for the full repair and conservation of the monument buildings. Consent had previously been refused for the demolition of any structures or the removal of any material from the site that dated from or before 1916. Plans for an underground car park within the boundary of the national monument site or for the demolition of the Moore Lane facades of Nos. 15 and 16 were also ruled out. I believe that the decision made on the revised designs provides the means to secure the future of the national monument. The conditions attaching to the consent will also ensure that the restored buildings will have a standard of finish and appearance that befits their historical importance. I have recently visited the national monument and have been through the entire site. During my visit I spoke to a number of the Moore Street traders who are very supportive of the plans for the monument and the proposals to redevelop the wider area. I have also offered meetings to both of the 1916 Moore Street relatives groups next week and expect to discuss the plans for the national monument with them. However, it is important to note that advancement of the project, which relates to a previous grant of planning permission, is a matter for the owners to progress in consultation with Dublin City Council.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	The Government's proposals to preserve and develop Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, while welcome, are totally inadequate. Is the Minister aware that among the buildings on Moore Street the developer, Chartered Land Limited, proposes to demolish, there are structures which predate the 1916 Rising? However, the reason given for not conserving buildings on this historic site has been that these were post-1916 buildings. These buildings lie both within the terrace containing the national monument and within what the Taoiseach has called the "lanes of history". The evidence exists to show that many of the structures alleged to be post 1916 do, in fact, predate the Easter Rising. Is the Minister aware that the facade of No. 18 was identified as a pre-1916 structure that was still standing in 1916 in the conservation report that accompanied the environmental impact study of 2011 by Gráinne Shaffrey? Does she realise that this key point was omitted from the Shaffrey battlefield report? Will the Minister freeze the consent order for the works proposed by Chartered Land Limited on and around the national monument?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	The preservation order covers Nos. 14-17, with the objective of protecting No. 16, as the final headquarters of the leaders of the 1916 Rising prior the surrender. A small number of buildings on Moore Street, in varying states of order, can be identified with specific events which took place within them, with No. 16 being the main one. It was what the then Minister was asked to save when the preservation order was being made in 2007. It was also decided to preserve Nos. 14, 15 and 17. Most of the buildings on Moore Street have been altered extensively since 1916 and retain little of the character of that time. In light of this, the substantially intact structures at Nos. 14-17 take on a greater significance and the importance of their protection becomes more evident and relevant. My remit is confined to the boundaries of the national monument site at Nos. 14-17. Dublin City Council is responsible for the development of the wider area, which has been dealt with comprehensively by the council and An Bord Pleanála under the planning Acts since the making of the preservation order in 2007. The current planning permission dates from 2010.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	Sinn Féin disagrees with the decision to grant a licence to Chartered Land Limited to demolish Moore Street and turn it into a shopping centre. The decision by the Government to grant permission for the development of Moore Street to go ahead is tantamount to the obliteration of what the National Museum has called the most important site in modern Irish history. Will the Minister commission an independent battlefield survey as recommended by the Dublin City Moore Street advisory council?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	A comprehensive assessment has already been carried out at my Department's request, as part of the consent application under the National Monuments Act, for the proposed works on the national monument site. The consent applicants, Chartered Land Limited, which owns the national monument site, was asked by my Department, in January 2012, to commission an assessment of the wider battlefield context of the national monument as part of the Minister's consideration of the consent application. The report reinforces the primary status of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, most notably because of the degree to which pre-1916 fabric survives in association with the final critical hour of the Easter Rising and how these buildings stand up in contrast with the wider area. The methodology for the assessment was drawn up and agreed in advance of my Department's national monument service and by the director of the National Museum of Ireland. The assessment was carried out by an eminent archaeologist and historian and the Department is satisfied with the quality of the research. I do not propose to seek a further assessment of the area.  I have no function in regard to the regulation of development, outside the bounds of the preservation order. As required under the National Monuments Act, an application for consent in respect of the proposed works to Nos. 14-17 Moore Street was submitted to my Department on behalf of Chartered Land Limited in June 2001.

In view of that, will the Minister put a freeze on the consent order so as to ensure there can be a proper, independent, comprehensive assessment of the battlefield site?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	I do not accept the suggestion that the decision made by my predecessor was based on misleading or inaccurate information. As indicated in previous replies, revised designs submitted by the owners for the restoration of the national monument buildings at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street and the creation of a commemorative centre to the leaders of the 1916 Rising on the site were approved by my predecessor on 30 April 2014. The granting of the consent followed detailed consideration and appraisal of all relevant factors, including a formal environmental impact assessment. A comprehensive assessment of the wider area was also produced as part of the consent process and full account was taken of it in the Department’s decision. The methodology for the assessment was drawn up and agreed in advance by my Department’s national monuments service and by the director of the National Museum of Ireland. The assessment was carried out by an eminent archaeologist and historian and my Department is satisfied with the quality of the research.  I do not propose to seek a further assessment of the area. I am satisfied that the determination made on the consent application was not in any way influenced by misleading or inaccurate information and my Department has made this clear in writing in reply to correspondence on the matter, including to Dublin City Council. I have recently visited the national monument and been through the entire site. During my visit I spoke to a number of the Moore Street traders and they are anxious this development should go ahead. They pleaded with me to do something to ensure this development goes ahead because the area needs redevelopment. I told them my role is to protect the national monument and the decision on the development remains with Dublin City Council.  I have also offered meetings to both of the 1916 Moore Street relatives groups next week and expect to discuss the plans for the national monument with them. However, it is important to note that advancement of the project, which relates to a previous grant of planning permission, is a matter for the owners to progress in consultation with Dublin City Council.

However, the point is that the whole area is a monument and other buildings on the street, apart from Nos. 14-17, have been identified in the Myles battlefield report as having significance in regard to the events of the Easter Rising. For example, O'Brien's mineral water building in Henry Place was occupied by the volunteers, the white house in Henry Place was occupied and held by Michael Collins, and Cogan's in No. 10 Moore Street was where the first council of war was held and where there was an overnight stay. The bottling stores were occupied by Frank Henderson and Hanlon's, at 20-21 Moore Street, was where the surrender order was accepted by the volunteers, after consultation with Tom Clarke, Joseph Plunkett and Seán Mac Diarmada. Therefore, there are other buildings on that street of historical significance.The consent order issued by the Minister will result in their obliteration. While I fully understand the position of the street traders and respect the street trading tradition, the traders can be facilitated with an appropriate development that takes account of the historical significance of Moore Street. It must not be a sprawling, massive shopping centre in the middle of a number of other shopping centres.

The Minister is to meet the relatives of the leaders of the Rising. I ask her to tour the entire battlefield site with them and listen to the stories of the events that unfolded at every step of the way between the General Post Office and the Rotunda where the photograph of Pádraig Pearse surrendering was taken. I also ask her to meet the Dublin city manager. Someone must take responsibility for this issue. While it is great that funding has been provided for the General Post Office and the former courthouse at Kilmainham, Moore Street is also a very important site, one which we are in danger of losing. People used to live on Moore Street. While it is now derelict, it has considerable potential for business and housing, especially given the current housing crisis. Housing should be provided on the street and its historical aspects preserved.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	I have met members of the Dublin City Council sub-committee which deals with the national monument on Moore Street. I do not consider that the assessment was flawed. The Department is satisfied that there is no basis to the suggestion that the previous Minister was misinformed or had inaccurate information when making his decisions on consents granted under the National Monuments Acts in respect of the national monument on Moore Street. On Nos. 13, 18 and 19 Moore Street, my Department has dealt comprehensively with related correspondence received from the relatives' solicitor. It was pointed out that these buildings are outside the bounds of the preservation order covering the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 and that the requirement for the ministerial consent to cater for their demolition only arises in so far as the continuation of the demolition works creates ground disturbance in the proximity of the monument that could impact on the monument.

#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	My Department has no plans to become involved in or fund Hallowe'en or Samhain celebrations in a manner similar to Culture Night. Most families already celebrate Hallowe'en. Every house has trick or treat and one makes every effort to be at home when children call and to have something to give them. Gardaí organise fireworks displays also and there are a great many things going on at Hallowe'en. I am, however, pleased to advise the Deputy of a joint initiative between the National Museum of Ireland, Age & Opportunity, Poetry Ireland and Mayo County Council's arts office supported by the Ulster Museum and Music Network. The initiative is entitled "Samhain: shadows, sounds and stories" and has received funding from my Department in co-operation with the Northern Ireland funding scheme. It consists of a multimedia exhibition of photographs and creative-writing with an accompanying soundscape and it will be on display at the National Museum of Ireland on Kildare Street from 20 November to 7 December. Entry will be free of charge. The work has been produced by groups of older people in Belfast, Dublin and Mayo who created photographic, musical and written responses to the Celtic festival of Samhain.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	I thank the Minister for her answer. When considering the origins of Hallowe'en, one must look to the festival of Samhain in Ireland's Celtic past and its importance as a festival that marked the end of summer and the start of winter. Our Celtic ancestors celebrated Hallowe'en as Samhain - all Hallowtide - the feast of the dead that brought people together and which we could learn from. Hallowe'en is an event in our calendar that we should look forward too. It should be a time of celebration and a fun night for communities and our young people in particular. In my home town, Youghal, we hold a festival called "Youghaloween Spooktacular", which is very successful. Regrettably, however, 31 October has become synonymous in many places across the State with anti-social behaviour, vandalism and drunken attacks on our emergency services. In the lead-up to Hallowe'en and on the night itself many of our most vulnerable citizens are left fearful in their own homes, becoming victims of the type of loutishness that on occasion can have serious consequences. We must change how we celebrate Hallowe'en. One way to achieve this is to learn from the traditional Celtic rituals that made the feast of Samhain an event that was uniquely Irish, like one of the initiatives to which the Minister referred. I ask the Minister to consider promoting initiatives and providing funding in her Department.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	I am reluctant to do anything that would dilute the success of Culture Night which has grown from a relatively small cultural event staged only in Dublin in 2006 to a significant national cultural event with approximately 350,000 people visiting museums, galleries, historic houses, artists studios and cultural centres across the State. Funding totalling €230,000 was allocated to the 2014 event and that is broadly in line with the funding provided in 2013. Access to all Culture Night events is free. Culture Night most recently took place on Friday, 19 September 2014 when more than 36 locations across the island participated in Ireland's most popular cultural extravaganza. A diverse mix of more than 1,400 indoor and outdoor events took place with something to suit every age and interest from live music and street performances to interactive tours and workshops. Culture Night is very successful. I attended events in Dublin and then attended one in Clones in my own county of Monaghan. This year was the first in which a Culture Night event took place in Clones and it was a great success. I understand the Deputy's point about Hallowe'en. Currently, there are many organisations involved at local level. I am happy to talk to the Deputy at a later stage to see if there is anything we can do to support something. Local authorities get involved and the Garda Síochána puts on fireworks displays.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	I agree with the Minister that Culture Night is extremely important but it is also important to build on it. If we are serious about ensuring a safe and enjoyable Hallowe'en, the Minister must provide the type of leadership that can ensure this important festival is celebrated in a way that is both safe and enjoyable. This means working with local community groups in urban and rural settings in a planned and managed way. I commend to the Minister an initiative that has proved very successful North of the Border where in recent years County Down's local authority has provided funding for eco-friendly bonfire beacons. These are steel pyramids built on sand and filled with willow woodchips. The beacons burn fiercely but safely for up to two hours significantly reducing clean-up costs and causing no environmental damage. Bonfire beacons have greatly reduced the negative impact of bonfires on local communities and proven hugely popular in towns and villages across County Down and beyond. Will the Minister consider looking at this initiative?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	Gardaí have been very proactive nationally in organising fireworks displays and such things and must be commended for their great work. They have taken the initiative over many years and organised this. It is a great night in many towns which many attend. One sees skies lit up by fireworks around the country but rather than to have that, gardaí organise a safe environment. We must give them great credit. In terms of the Deputy's points, I am open to suggestions.I would not like to encroach on the good work that is being done by other organisations, but I will talk to the Deputy about it.

Mar gheall ar na hirisí, bhí naoi gcinn ann - agus bhí na hirisí sin an-mhaith - ach tá deireadh curtha leis an maoiniú seo i mbliana. Céard a dhéanfaidh an tAire Stáit faoin scéal seo?
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	Baineann saincheisteanna maidir le hirisí Gaeilge le gnóthaí oibríochtúla Fhoras na Gaeilge agus níl ról sonrach agam féin mar Aire Stáit ina leith. É sin ráite, tuigim go mbíodh Foras na Gaeilge ag cur maoinithe ar fáil do roinnt irisí Gaeilge i bhfoirm chlóite nó ar líne, ina measc An Sagart, An Timire, An tUltach, Beo.ie, Comhar, Feasta, Gaelport, NÓSmag agus SAOL. Mar thoradh ar chinneadh na Comhairle Aireachta Thuaidh Theas, chuir Foras na Gaeilge socruithe nua maoinithe i bhfeidhm do na heagraíochtaí ceannais ón 1 Iúil 2014 agus tháinig deireadh dá réir leis an maoiniú do na hirisí a bhí ceangailte leis na heagraíochtaí bunmhaoinithe. Tuigim ó Fhoras na Gaeilge go bhfuil sé mar aidhm aige pobal léitheoireachta na Gaeilge a spreagadh agus an iriseoireacht Ghaeilge a chothú tuilleadh trí dhíriú ar ábhar léitheoireachta a chur ar fáil saor in aisce ar líne. Mar shampla, tá nuachtán seachtainiúil ar líne á fhoilsiú ag Tuairisc.ie faoi chonradh ceithre bliana ó Mheán Fómhair 2014; iris stíl mhaireachtála á sholáthar ag NÓSmag go míosúil; agus iarratais faoi scéim le haghaidh foilseachán liteartha/cúrsaí reatha á measúnú faoi láthair.

Bhí maoiniú ó Fhoras na Gaeilge á chur ar fáil do na foilsiúcháin Ghaeilge. Tá an tAire Stáit tar éis naoi gcinn a lua. Is í an cheist atá agamsa ná más rud é gur chuireadh deireadh leis an maoiniú i mbliana, an bhfuil na foilsiúcháin go léir ar líne anois, nó an mbeidh siad ar líne, agus cén plean atá ag Foras na Gaeilge chun iriseoireacht Ghaeilge a chothú? Céard a tharla don phlean chun nuachtán seachtainiúil ar líne a chur ar fáil? Bhí sé sin geallta ag an Aire Stáit agus ag an Roinn. An mbeidh níos mó ná nuachtán amháin ar fáil? Mar a dúirt mé ar maidin, is é Seachtain an t-aon iris atá feicthe agamsa. Tá sé i gceist ag Foras na Gaeilge scéim le haghaidh iris stíl marachtáil ar líne a chur ar fáil agus tá siad ag iarraidh foilsiúcháin liteartha agus cúrsaí reatha freisin. Is í an phríomhcheist ná an mbeidh na hirisí seo go léir ar líne as seo amach.

Cheadaigh an Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh-Theas socraithe nua maoinithe. Faoi na socraithe nua seo, tá sé eagraíocht ceannas á maoiniú chun na Tosaíochta í Straitéiseacha i réimse ar leith a sheachadadh ar bhun uile-oileáin. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil don Teachta as ucht na ceiste mar tá díospóireacht ar siúl anois agus bhí díospóireacht ar siúl ag tús an tsamhraidh faoin scéal faoin idirlín agus faoi na hirisí. Chas mé leis na daoine atá freagrach as an iris An tUltach i rith an tsamhraidh agus fuair mé eolas mór faoi stair na hirise agus an eagraíocht eile. Beidh mé i dteangmháil le Foras na Gaeilge faoin ábhar seo mar tá díospóireacht mhór idir, mar shampla, léitheoirí an nuachtáin The Irish Times nó an Irish Independent nó an Irish Examiner i gcoinne an idirlín. Tá The Irish Times agus araile anseo anois ach tá díospóireacht ar siúl. Ba mhaith liom fanacht i dteagmháil leis an Teachta faoin ábhar seo agus beidh mé i dteangmháil le Foras na Gaeilge freisin.

Is í an cheist a bhí agamsa ná an scéal faoi láthair. Tá ísliú ar an méid eagraíochtaí atá ann agus tá mé ag cur ceiste faoi na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge. Bhí laghdú ar an méid eagraíochtaí a fhaigheann airgead ó Fhoras na Gaeilge agus tá ísliú 4% ar an mhaoiniú sin. Tá 75% den mhaoiniú ó Roinn an Aire Stáit agus is dócha 25% ón Roinn Cultúir, Ealaíon agus Fóillíochta i dTuaisceart Éireann. An mbeidh maoiniú breise ar fáil don bhFhoras le haghaidh na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge? Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil an Chomhairle Ealaíon, mar shampla, ag fáil níos mó airgid - tá méadú ar an mbuiséad ansin i gcomparáid le Foras na Gaeilge. Caithfimid an teanga agus an Ghaeltacht a neartú chomh maith agus is féidir linn. Déanann na heagraíochtaí seo an-obair chun é sin a dhéanamh, agus ba mhaith liom freagra a fháil ar an gceist sin.

Dúirt siad liomsa i lár an tsamhraidh nach bhfuil mórán éilimh ann. Mar a dúirt mé ag an tús, tá stair fada ag baint le gach ceann de na 19 eagraíocht atá ag fáil maoinithe. Ba mhaith liom a rá arís go mbeidh mé i dteagmháil le Foras na Gaeilge. Tá fhios agam go bhfuil An tUltach, mar shampla, ag lorg €8,000 sa bhliain. Is airgead mór é €8,000 ach sin an méid atá á lorg ag an dream seo don iris. Arís, beidh mé i dteagmháil le Foras na Gaeilge agus leis an Teachta fosta.

I acknowledge the work done by the Minister's predecessor in this regard. I congratulate both Ministers present as this is the first occasion on which I have had an opportunity to raise questions with them. I wish them well in their respective portfolios. My question concerns this ongoing issue whereby displaced turf cutters feel disadvantaged. While they have been the true, traditional turf cutters, I wish to differentiate them from others who may not have been traditional ones. Will the Minister consider addressing their particular issues?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	I thank the Deputy for his good wishes and also for having raised this matter. Some 3,017 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, applicable to raised bog special areas of conservation, have been received and acknowledged by my Department.Of these, 814 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs. Some 6,116 payments and 610 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of these applications. In addition, 1,373 legal agreements have been returned to my Department and 1,197 once-off incentive payments of €500 have been made in respect of these legal agreements. Total expenditure to date amounts to over €10.9 million since the Government introduced the compensation arrangements for affected turf cutters. Since the cessation of turf cutting, the compensation scheme has been extended this year to raised bog natural heritage areas. Up to 147 applications for compensation in respect of these sites have been received and acknowledged by my Department. Of these, four applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs and 68 payments have been made in respect of the applications received. Progress in relocating turf cutters to non-designated bogs is being achieved in several cases. Arrangements have been made as regards Clara bog in County Offaly, where 25 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated on Killeranny bog, and Carrownagappul bog and Curraghlehanagh bog in County Galway, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated on the Islands bog and Killasolan bog. Potential relocation sites have been identified for each of the remaining raised bog special areas of conservation where relocation may be required. However, relocation is a complex process with many issues to be resolved for each individual site.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The draft national raised bog SAC management plan, published in January, sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. The draft plan sets out the demanding tests which must be met before turf cutting could be consented to within the provisions of the habitats directive. The final plan will clarify whether the relevant provisions of the directive could be applicable for any particular special area of conservation and will seek to establish whether sufficient consensus can be achieved at a national level to make a successful case to the European Commission for flexibility on this basis.

Has it been possible to identify the precise number of traditional turf cutters who do not wish to be relocated and would much prefer to remain where they are based in preference to compensation? To what extent is the Quirke report taken into account and where a SAC, special area of conservation, might be relocated to accommodate turf cutters where available?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	It is difficult to quantify these issues. It is hoped to relocate turf cutters from Barroughter bog and Clonmoylan bog to Shragh bog and Mount Hevey bog to Colehill bog, Kinnegad, County Westmeath. I can provide further information to the Deputy later. The majority of those cutting turf on raised bog SACs are co-operating with my Department in resolving relevant issues. Up to 3,017 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, applicable to raised bog special areas of conservation have been received. Of these, 814 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs. Some 6,116 payments and 610 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of these applications. In addition, 1,373 legal agreements have been returned to my Department and 1,197 once-off incentive payments of €500 have been made in respect of these legal agreements.

Is it possible to identify those particular areas where traditional turf cutters are not anxious to relocate and find a means to resolve their difficulties? They are not a significant number of people but do feel aggrieved at being asked to relocate. They have exercised their turbary rights over the past 60 years without interruption. They could be the subject matter of an assessment by the Minister’s Department with a view to resolution.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	The option of relocating turf cutters from Coolrain bog to Ballaghmore bog was examined by the former Minister but it is now out of the equation. The draft raised bog management plan stated only 1 ha of degraded raised bog can be restored at Coolrain bog. Will she examine this and exercise the possibility under Article 6.4 of the habitats directive which Alan Seatter of the European environment directorate general in Brussels, confirmed to me can be used? There is flexibility and the turf cutters at Coolrain bog want to have a credible plan. If the Minister leaves this to the NPWS, National Parks and Wildlife Service, and civil servants, it will not be solved. She is new in the Department. Will she grab this issue by the scruff of the neck to solve this problem?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	There are turf cutters who do not want to relocate and make the argument they should be allowed to continue cutting at a certain bog. In one instance, I asked officials to meet with the people in question to explain to them the full issues. The only way to resolve this is through engagement. Much progress has been made already but we need to deal with these individual cases through engagement on the ground. I want to work with everyone to resolve these issues. A lot of money, €10.9 million, has been spent on this already. We need to work together to resolve the remaining issues.

Instead of sanctions, licences were given recently to them.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	Licences were issued by my Department in August 2014 under the wildlife Acts to the Irish Coursing Club on behalf of their affiliated clubs to facilitate the tagging and capturing of hares for the purpose of hare coursing for the 2014-2015 coursing season. Where resources allow, officials of the NPWS attend coursing meetings on a spot-check basis to monitor compliance with conditions on the licences granted by my Department. Veterinary officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine also attend some meetings on an annual basis. The reports of officials from my Department who attended the two coursing meetings referred to in September and October 2013 indicated there was a lack of co-operation with them in the course of their duties, an issue which I take very seriously. Following engagement with the clubs in question and with the Irish Coursing Club, the body that oversees individual coursing clubs, written assurances were provided to my Department that both clubs would fully co-operate with officials of my Department at all times and that they would adhere to all licence conditions. On the basis of these assurances, I decided not to impose sanctions against the clubs on this occasion. At the same time, both clubs have been issued with written warnings that any further transgressions, especially relating to lack of co-operation with NPWS officials, would result in my Department imposing future sanctions against the clubs. It is clear this approach has worked satisfactorily to date. A meeting of one of the clubs which took place last month was attended by a conservation ranger who reported that there was full co-operation forthcoming. The meeting of the other club, due to take place this week, will also be monitored by officials from my Department.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	Not granting a licence this year would certainly have ensured better acknowledgement of the conditions. It was horrifying to read the reports. As the Minister said, the lack of co-operation and the incidence of intimidation were specifically mentioned in one report while the other report mentioned serious issues. The ranger was unable to verify if a number of hares had been released, 39 hares were unaccounted for and the ranger had no idea what had happened to those. There are serious issues around coursing and I am very well-known for being against live hare coursing. Reports from previous years indicate the occurrence of serious breaches and the only way to bring home the point and to ensure serious breaches do not occur is for licences to be revoked. Will the Minister consider this and bear in mind that Ireland is one of a very small minority of countries that allow live hare coursing? Will the Department consider an investigation into the use of drag hare coursing, as is the case in other countries?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	The matter was brought to my attention and I discussed it with the officials concerned. I decided that in the circumstances the Department should write to the clubs and I also spoke to some representatives from the clubs. I listened to both sides and I discussed it with the officials. I wrote to the clubs asking them to give me assurances, which they did, that this would not happen again. I made it very clear to them that if it did happen, they would be sanctioned immediately. One coursing meeting was held and everything was in order and according to plan. The personnel there were quite happy with the way the event was carried out. Another event is planned for this week and the official will be in attendance. My letter expressed my serious concerns but the issue was resolved by means of dialogue and the coursing event was allowed to go ahead in a safe and proper manner.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	I remind the Minister that there have been reports of breaches every year, not just this year. The clubs are assuring the Minister with their words but we shall see. We know about empty vessels making the most noise. They are giving the Minister these assurances but I am in no doubt there will be breaches this year. Is it not somewhat perverse that the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is licensing a so-called sport but which is deliberate animal cruelty? This cruelty begins from the time the hares are collected with the use of nets on various offshore islands and other places in the country and are brought into these coursing fields. There is documented evidence every year of the injuries and killings of hares in a most cruel way and reports of injuries to the greyhounds. The Minister stated in a media report that the persecution of wildlife is intolerable, but this is persecution of wildlife and I do not think it has any place in a Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, nor has it any place in a country that is supposed to value animal welfare.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	The approach I took in this case worked satisfactorily. The control of live hare coursing, including the operation of individual coursing meetings and managing the use of hares for that activity, is carried out under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. While I understand that many individuals are opposed to hare coursing, there is no evidence that coursing has a significant effect on hare populations. The decision to issue the licences took into consideration that favourable conservation status of the hare as detailed in the report on the status of European Union protected habitats and species in Ireland which was provided to the European Commission in 2013. Hares can show significant inter-annual fluctuations in population and recent estimates indicate that the Irish hare population varies from approximately 250,000 to more than 500,000. Regional management staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department monitor compliance with the conditions of the annual licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club as resources allow. During the 2013-14 coursing season, 37% of meetings were monitored by officials from my Department. In addition, as stated in my reply to the Deputy, veterinary staff from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine carry out some monitoring inspections during the coursing season to verify compliance.

The Minister knows that I make the assertion that no issue in respect of turf cutting and relocation has been resolved in 17 years. The Minister is not long in her new job and I wish her luck, but I do not want the same stuff as I have listened to down through the years about this, that and the other issue solved, when what matters is that the issue has not been solved. The Minister referred to figures of 1,300 people who have signed up and the figure of 6,000 relates to a period of four years. The figure of 1,300 people is out of a total of 9,000 people. Will the Minister please give me an accurate update because I do not want to hear what the Department has always given me down through the years?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	I congratulate Deputy Fitzmaurice on his recent election to Dáil Éireann. It is always a great honour to represent the people of one's county and constituency. I was very pleased to note that the morning before he came to the Dáil, he had time to feed his cattle. I wish him well in his new position. Since this Government has come into office, major efforts have been made to solve the issue of the protection of Ireland's raised bog special areas of conservation within the framework of the EU habitats directive. This has included intense engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission. A long-term compensation scheme was introduced to compensate cutters for their loss. The draft national raised bog SAC management plan was published in January. It sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed in the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. The draft plan sets out the demanding tests which must be met before turf cutting can be consented to within the provisions of the directive. The final plan will clarify whether the relevant provisions of the directive can be applicable to any particular special area of conservation and will seek to establish whether sufficient consensus can be achieved at a national level to make a successful case to the European Commission for flexibility in accordance with Article 6(4) of the directive. This national raised bog SAC management plan responds to the central recommendation of Mr. Justice Quirke arising out of the 2012 peatlands forum. Notwithstanding the complexity involved, progress in relocating turf cutters to non-designated bogs is being achieved in a number of cases, and arrangements have been made for Clara bog in County Offaly, where 25 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated on Killeranny bog, and Carrownagappul bog and Curraghlehanagh bog in County Galway, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated on the Islands bog and Killasolan bog. Works have been undertaken on Lemanaghan bog in County Offaly with a view to facilitating turf cutters from Moyclare bog. Works are also under way in Cloonabricka bog in County Galway to facilitate additional cutters relocating from Carrownagappul and Curraghlehanagh bogs. Potential relocation sites have been identified for each of the remaining raised bog special areas of conservation where relocation may be required. When relocation sites have been assessed as suitable, my Department has been seeking expressions of interest from turf cutters with a view to them moving to these sites. As pointed out on many occasions, this is a very complex issue with each site having its own challenges. Final resolution will only be achieved by everyone working - within the law - with my Department and with the Peatlands Council which was established with the purpose of ensuring input from all stakeholders.

This is the Department's achievement. Governments love to look at parts of what Mr. Justice Quirke stated in his report. He stated new faces were needed, as was a new way of resolving matters. There are no new faces. I do not blame the Minister.

This includes the establishment of a substantial compensation scheme of which the vast majority of active cutters have availed. More than €10 million has been paid out by the Government. The Peatlands Council was established to facilitate the views of all stakeholders, and we have a comprehensive policy framework, including a draft national peatlands strategy and a draft national raised bog SAC management plan. Once finalised, these will give certainty to all stakeholders about the Government's views on the future of our peatlands and how our SAC raised bogs are to be managed. There is no denying the complexity of the issues involved. Issues can only be resolved by working together within the law and not outside it.

The people who want to cut turf do not want the money and the people in the Department must get this into their heads. People have cut turf and will continue to do so if the people in the Department keep burying their heads in the sand. I am well aware of local authorities on tight budgets rationing funds to provide the best road surface to taxpayers, especially in the west. I have spoken to directors of services throughout the country on the issue of roads who are almost crying on the phone because of what the Minister's staff are doing to them. When a road is being built, it seems it is less important than the bird or the ditch which is a so-called SAC. I challenge the SACs because I have asked for ten years for proof that these areas are SACs. In several parts of Ireland the Department's staff in the National Parks and Wildlife Service are terrorising local authority staff trying to build roads-----

I acknowledge the efforts of the people, particularly during the past three and a half years when the almost insurmountable task was handed to them of bearing up under the financial burden thrust upon them through no fault of theirs. I congratulate the Government, collectively and individually, on the way in which it handled the issue. Members of the Government could have run away from their responsibilities, pretended it did not happen and continued down the road advised by some and borrowed more money, lashed it out and assuaged the population on this basis. They could have addressed the issue raised by those who called it austerity. They did not. They were responsible and did their job. They did their accounting properly and put forward and implemented proposals which were sustainable and remedial. This needed to be done. Against this were those who call themselves anti-austerity. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes on the other side of the House. They stated there was no need for this austerity and what we wanted was more stimulus, in other words, more borrowing. Little thought was given to the fact there was no place from which we could borrow. Our credit rating was gone. I cannot understand for the life of me why people still come forward and state what we need is more stimulus. We have another contradiction at present, which is that perhaps this is the wrong budget for now. The reason for this is some of these commentators have been so wrong so often about so much, they are afraid to adopt a position on any side on anything any more, and rightly so. They are discredited. I say well done to the Government, especially the Minister for Finance, on a difficult job and a great result so far.There is much more to be dealt with in the future. It remains to be seen the extent to which that commitment and support for it will remain in the future. It has been said in the past of certain issues that one could not see the wood for the trees. At least we can see the trees now. The national ship has been hauled off the rocks and is now drying out before the next move ahead. Three, four or five years ago that was not so. Some people on the other side of the House repeatedly say this Government is the same as Fianna Fáil, the Green Party, the Progressive Democrats and all those people who came before us. What does that mean? It simply means that this Administration had to do things that the previous Administration did with money. This Administration had no money with which to do it and no borrowing facilities available to it. It is a great tribute to the Minister for Finance that he has managed in the face of all these difficulties to achieve the kind of credit rating that we now have internationally while at the same time being able to go forward with reasonable growth expectations for the future. One feels sympathy towards those who remain prophets of doom and gloom because they have been continually wrong. It is sad when people are wrong all the time. There are those who have, for example, introduced the word "austerity", a kind of dirty word. Austerity is something a government introduces when it has options and when it can decide to inflate its economy by introducing particular measures. Frequently during the lifetime of previous administrations we were told that everything was controlled from Brussels, that because we could not change interest rates we could do nothing, and that credit and everything else were out of our hands and dealt with elsewhere. However, when the crunch came, it soon became possible to do all these things ourselves - all these things that could not have been done before. It is remarkable and, as the Minister for Finance said, it was not a miracle but it was done with great effort and concentration by a great number of people. A few issues still need serious and urgent attention. I do not have time to deal with them at present, but water and housing are two such issues. For 20 years I have been tabling parliamentary questions - they are there on the record for all to see - asking when we would have a proper investment programme to provide a sustainable supply of domestic drinking water incorporating adequate treatment works. All we hear from the other side is how outrageous it is that it actually costs money. If they can find somebody who can produce a commodity of that nature without the requirement to pay, I want to hear about it. Even Archimedes could not do that and he came before my time.

#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the budget, the first, hopefully, of a series of budgets that will start giving money back to people. As the previous speaker and the Minister have said, this is not by accident. It is because of the work we have done over recent years to correct our finances that we are in a position to do this. We have got our deficit under control. That is because of the growth in the economy in recent years which has occurred because of the series of measures introduced in the tourism and other sectors to boost growth. I welcome some of the budget's taxation changes. Obviously, work must pay and the budget measures are designed to help working families, including raising the standard rate tax band by €1,000; cutting the top rate of income tax from 41% to 40%; and the changes in the USC reductions, including increasing the bands at which people become liable to pay the USC. Many people have an aversion to paying tax but especially the USC, which is regarded as a temporary tax, an austerity tax and even a Fianna Fáil tax. Over the forthcoming years it is important that we see a gradual reduction in the USC. The pension levy has been used over a number of years to boost job growth and it has had a positive effect on the sectors for which it was used. We have seen growth in those sectors - tourism and hospitality. It has worked and it is now time to end that levy. I welcome the commitment that it will be abolished at the end of next year and reduced from 0.75% to 0.15% in 2015. In the area of social protection, there has been an increase in child benefit and we need to push on with the housing assistance payment which helps a person with housing costs. Unlike the rent supplement, something needs to be provided after a person takes up a job. I have mentioned the tourism sector which is very important in my constituency, Galway West, and along the west coast. We have seen the success of the wonderful initiative that is the Wild Atlantic Way, introduced by the previous Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. This has been hugely successful along the west coast. The 2015 edition of the Lonely Planet' guide has cited the Wild Atlantic Way as one of the "must see" places in the world, which will be very positive. The 9% VAT rate introduced in 2011 has been a huge success in terms of the hospitality and tourism sectors. There was a big campaign to retain it and I am very happy that it has been retained. As the Minister said, it is important that those reductions are passed on to consumers. I also welcome the decision not to increase excise duty and its impact on the drinks industry. I raised this matter in the Dáil in the week before the budget. It is not that I am promoting alcohol or anything like that, but I cited the importance of supporting the retention of jobs and creating more jobs particularly in our rural pubs which in many ways form the mainstay of the tourism sector. They are also a focal point for rural areas in many of which the population is falling. I welcome the funding for the sports capital grant which is very successful. One cannot have enough money for sports capital grants, which is highly sought finance. It is very important for clubs to put in place much-needed sports and community facilities. The previous speaker mentioned housing. We have a housing shortage and we know that building houses creates jobs. Any initiatives that can boost and stimulate the construction sector are to be welcomed. I welcome the commitment of €2.2 billion for social housing in the coming years. It is very important that this money is provided. The home renovation initiative has been extended to tenants to allow them to renovate the houses they are letting up to the end of 2015. The standard of some of the accommodation in the rental market is not good enough. Hopefully this scheme will allow people to do up houses for that market. I also welcome the living city initiative, on which discussions with the EU are at an advanced stage, to help regenerate urban areas and safeguard architectural heritage in Galway and other cities. I commend the range of taxation measures in the agricultural sector to stimulate our most important primary indigenous industry.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	From this side of the House I always struggle to find measures in the budget that I welcome. However, people on all sides of the House should welcome the proposed abolition of the pension levy. It is a bit like congratulating a highwayman on stopping robbing carriages. It caused great hardship to many people and was unjustified if not unlawful. On this side of the House we should acknowledge the Government's realisation that it was wrong. It caused great pain to many people who depended upon these savings for their existence. The Government has been able to do remarkable things in the budget. The most peculiar feature of it was the debate coming up in the past few weeks where the figures suddenly changed and from it having a choice between cutting expenditure or increasing taxes by a diminishing amount, suddenly it found it could give some money away. We have to ask why this happened and why it happened so suddenly. The answer of course lies in the Minister's Budget Statement, in which he came out with some sensational and spectacular growth rates. He is not alone in that - they came from the Department of Finance. I believe his growth rate projection was 3.9% following the budget measures - it was 3.6% before that. It has to be asked how the growth rate projections changed so suddenly and whether they are questionable.The basis of the entire budget will be undermined if these growth rates are not correct. The Minister is not alone. IBEC, an organisation that is not particularly reliable in any way and one I would not commend to people to study for their thesis on economics, changed its growth rate projection for next year from 3.1% to 6.1% in the space of three months, which is utterly extraordinary. The Central Bank is more conservative saying the growth rate will be 3.5% while the ESRI says it will be 5.3%. The Minister and the Department of Finance have come in somewhere in the middle at just under 4%. How and why has this happened? Are there dangers in this? If a growth rate projection can change from 3.1% to 6.1% in three months and the first projection is unreliable, like the initial projections from other sources, then surely the current projections we are relying on are just as vulnerable to being changed or to not being reliable in the future. The basis for the projections is the US and UK economies because while the Minister said last Tuesday that the economic growth rate next year would be 3.9%, later in the week bad news came out of Germany, France and almost the entire eurozone area. Germany is on the verge of recession, France is missing all its targets and other European countries such as Italy are not living up to the expectations the European Commission has asked of them. Europe is contracting while Ireland apparently has a rocketing growth rate. It sounds unnatural but the explanation for this lies in the fact that the US and UK economies were up to recently the best preforming economies in the western world. Ireland has relied on them because we luckily have a large proportion of our trade with them, which is unusual for a European country. We are expanding in that direction and that is expected to continue next year. However, as the Minister outlined in his Budget Statement, the stock markets of the world were taking fright the same day. The stock markets, which we are told rightly by Deputy Higgins are the masters of our destiny rather than ourselves, were saying they were spooked by the prospects for the US, in particular, because of bad retail figures last week, and the UK for other reasons. If the US and UK economies do not perform to the expectations of the budget arithmetic, Ireland will be in trouble as well because these economies will not fuel the export-led growth predicted in the budget. That is a serious danger, which was signalled to us by the stock markets last week.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is a pity that Mr. Austerity himself, Deputy Bernard Durkan, is not in the House. It was interesting to hear him praise austerity in his contribution because I thought the Government was claiming that this would be the last of the austerity budgets. However, I wonder whether people such as Deputy Durkan who talk like that are living in the real world. They refer to the end of the austerity. They should say that to the long-term unemployed, the disabled, the low paid and all our senior citizens. They know the reality of austerity on the ground and the real pain people have suffered over the past number of years and they know we have a less equal society, particularly following the budget. There has been no focus on the issue of services for people with disabilities in the budget and there was no climbdown on the respite care grant. That could been considered. Many people with disabilities live in poverty while a significant number of them who are well qualified are unable to secure employment. A deaf man attended my clinic recently and he commented that he was "coursed" out. He is a man in this 30s who is fed up doing courses and he would love to get back into the workforce. I also met a person with cerebral palsy who is highly qualified having done loads of courses and who would love to get an administrative job. These people have been going around for the past two or three years looking for an opening, which is not acceptable. On the broader issue of the economy, the Government says it will support small businesses, the low paid and the poor. The haulage industry, which employs approximately 50,000 people, is being hammered by motor taxation. Industry representatives sought a meeting with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport but he did not want to meet them to discuss the issue and they had to block Dublin Port to highlight their case. It is a national scandal that 2,000 people who worked in this industry have had to move to other European countries and beyond because of the high tax rates on their businesses. The 50,000 jobs in the industry are an important part of the economy. The Minister and the Taoiseach need to wake up and talk to these people before they are forced to block Dublin Port again. It is not an option to say: "I am not going to talk to them." They have to face the reality that jobs are at stake. The notion of supporting small and medium-sized business should have been considered in the budget because many of them employ between five and ten people. This is another disappointing and regressive budget. It widened the gap between rich and poor by €499 a year. The gap between the disposable income of a single unemployed person and a single person in work on €50,000 a year was measured. For example, the budget will result in a 90 cent a week increase in income for an unemployed single person while giving €14.30 a week to a single person earning €75,000 annually. Does the Minister call that a fair and responsible budget? An unemployed couple will receive €1.51 a week or €78.52 a year extra while a couple with two earners on €125,000 a year will receive an additional €23.50 a week or €1.225.64 a year as a result of the budget changes. These figures are being ignored in the debate. There is a huge gap between the rich and poor in this society and it was not bridged. The Minister had an opportunity to do something for the poor and the long-term unemployed and to restore the respite care grant for families of people with disabilities. The Government cannot say this is a positive budget when many important measures could have been taken. This is why I strongly oppose the budget.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	This is the fourth regressive budget in a row introduced by the Government, which is deeply disappointing. It is a slap in the face to families who simply have had enough and who cannot make ends meet. As previous speakers said, according to Social Justice Ireland, the gap between rich and poor has widened by €499 a year. This measures the gap between the disposable income of a single unemployed person and a single person in work earning €50,000 a year. The gap is higher when higher salaries are taken into account. As a result of this and previous regressive budgets, those who took the greatest hits during the recession have been left behind again and priority has been given to reducing the top income tax rate, favouring the wealthy in our society.The two groups particularly badly impacted by the budgets from 2008 to 2015 are families dependent on social welfare, who lost approximately 12.5% of their income, and working poor families, who lost approximately 11.5% of their income. This budget does nothing to reverse their situation. Indeed, it adds insult to injury.  The people of Ireland are facing huge challenges. Some 750,000 people in this country live in poverty. Some 20%, or 1 in 5 children, live in poverty. The deprivation rate is 26.9%. We have 150,000 people who are long-term unemployed, 90,000 families on local authority housing waiting lists and emigration rates of huge proportions. Up to end April this year, 21,000 people had emigrated. Between 2009 and 2014, 84,000 graduates left this country. This challenge will not be met by continuous regressive budgets which favour the rich and powerful in society. It can and should be met. All objective research indicates that Ireland is one of the richest countries in the world. The problems we face are two-fold. The super-rich in this country are coining it and we are paying approximately €8 billion per annum - which equates to the entire education budget - in interest on foreign debt. These issues must be addressed if budgets are to be fair and we are to meet the challenges ahead. Money to fund State job creation programmes and the restoration of services must come from a number of sources. We should do first as the French have done and defy the fiscal treaty. The provisions of this treaty in respect of Ireland are perverse and should be reversed. That is what this country needs. We must raise income by way of significant taxes on the incomes and assets of the super-rich in this country and we must insist on the mutualisation of bank related debt. We must stop servicing bank debt until realistic negotiations in that regard have been concluded.  It has been said time and again that this country is broke. Nothing could be further from the truth. We were told not too long ago by former Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, that Ireland is the eighth richest country in the world, which is true. The gross domestic product per head of population in the Republic is greater than it is in Germany, France and the UK. Despite that Ireland is one of the richest countries in the EU, studies indicate that when it comes to the distribution of wealth Ireland is at the bottom of the table along with Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and Latvia.  Significant income can be raised by way of the imposition of higher taxes on the super-rich who have gained from the recession in respect of their incomes and assets.

They came out to declare that they have had enough and that all of the Government's trickery in terms of the hated regressive water charges and property taxes is meaningless. People want them abolished and to be given real relief. The Government is panic stricken and back peddling at a rapid rate in the face of that rebellion on the streets in regard to water charges. The people will not be fooled by the measures taken by Government in recent days, which were driven by panic and fear. The Government's spin will be further exposed on 1 November by, not 100,000 people on the streets of Dublin, but 100 or more demonstrations of thousands more people from across the country, thus reminding it of its real job, namely, to give genuine relief to the hundreds of thousands of ordinary families who are innocent of any of the crimes that led to the crisis in this country and have been battered for six years by this and the previous Government in terms of their being asked to continually pay the price. That is the important response to this budget. Water charges and property taxes aside, there is more dishonesty in this budget by way of the claims of an end to austerity. Let us take the health budget. Last year, the health allocation was €12.7 billion. This year the allocation is €13.1 billion despite that there was a €500 million over-run last year. When one adds €12.7 billion and €500 million one gets €13.2 billion. According to the Department of Health, because of demographic pressures of an aging population it requires an additional €200 million this year. In reality there has been a cut in the health allocation for this year in that it will be €300 million short of what is needed to maintain services in the public health service. What is the human cost of this? I will give some examples. April, a young woman, severely disabled, requires 24-7 care. In 2013, her mother had 24, four-day, weekends of respite care. She now gets only 12, 3-day weekends per annum and is at her wits end. Also, her respite care grant has been withdrawn. There is no end to austerity for her. I am also dealing with two cases involving people waiting for hip replacements at Cappagh Hospital who have been told the waiting time for their operation is 16 months. When I contacted the Minister and asked if there was anything he could do I was told there was nothing he can do.  On education, the Department of Education and Skills requested an additional €500 million to deal with upward pressures of 10,000 extra children joining primary education this year. It got only €60 million of that €500 million, which is a de facto cut in the resourcing per student in the education system. This is against the background where one in four of our children are in classes of 30 or more. When one considers that a few years ago the stated aim of the then Government was to have a ratio of 1:20 the current situation is a disaster. The cuts in respect of SNAs and so on is leading to much greater disruption, with teachers in half of the schools in this country simply engaged in riot control.  On housing, what is provided for is a joke. It is proposed to build only 2,500 houses next year against the backdrop of 96,000 families on the housing waiting list. In my area alone, 1,200 people a year are joining that list. This means the number of houses to be built next year will not even cover the number of new applicants joining the housing list never mind make a dent on the massive 13 or 14 year housing waiting list. There is no end to austerity. Austerity continues. It is about time this Government was honest and fair with people. It will get its answer on 1 November.

The Deputies have five minutes each.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	94	Deputy Buttimer wants a debate but he will not get one because that is not how this process works. I welcome the budget and the presentation of it but I cannot welcome the process around it. Six years ago this country's economy crashed and six years later, nothing has changed when it comes to Dáil Éireann and the way we prepare, debate and approve budgets as a Parliament. Where is the role of parliamentarians in this budget? Where is the role of Dáil Éireann? Something was presented to us as a fait accompli and we debate it after the fact. That is not acceptable. People will say that these issues around Dáil reform are not that important, that they only matter to a few people, that they do not matter when the economy is getting better, that the budget seems to be a good one and people are happy with it, and that the crisis is over, but it matters to us in Fine Gael because we said it matters. Prior to coming into Government, when we examined the problems around the economy and how they arose we did not just blame the bankers, the developers, the speculators and the Financial Regulator; we put the political system at the heart of that failure. It was in our 2011 manifesto - political failure lies at the heart of Ireland's economic collapse. In our programme for Government we said we would open up the process of the budget to the full glare of public scrutiny, and a senior Minister of Government came into the Committee of Public Accounts and said that the idea of a big-bang budget day was a nonsense and that someone coming into the Dáil to reveal the secrets decided by Cabinet on one given day was crazy. The Government has done much that is good but if we set ourselves a standard we must meet that standard and hold ourselves to it. In the simple case of having a functioning Parliament around the budgetary process, that means looking abroad and taking best practice. In so many other aspects of Irish political and public life, we talk about best practice from abroad or best practice from the private sector yet here in the Parliament, six years after the economic collapse, we are failing woefully in catching up to what a modern day parliament should look like and how it should operate. In terms of what that means, we need a committee dedicated to budgetary matters sitting on a year-round basis to examine the forecasts and determine if they are being met to see how budgets are being implemented, and to plan for the year ahead. It means debating elements of the budget months in advance of a vote being taken on them in a dedicated committee. That might be boring to some but it is necessary work. It means Ministers coming in to the committee to defend their money requests ahead of a decision being taken on them so that all of us can be across the detail. It means also an independent Oireachtas budgetary office where any Deputy in government or in opposition can have their ideas properly costed and then debated thoroughly. It is not too radical to suggest that a member of the Opposition, be they an Independent or of a party, would have to have their proposals properly costed before they came in to participate in the debate on the budget. It is not too radical to suggest that a member of the Government backbenchers would be aware of the detail of the decisions they will be endorsing when they cast their vote on the budget. Even if it is radical, we said we would do it so we should. On the details of the budget, we have unexpected buoyancy in the economy. That means we were not in a position to continue to reduce spending but to reduce taxation and increase spending. I fear that might have been a mistake. The caveat on this is that we have another chance to have this properly debated in terms of the recommendations from the fiscal advisory council, the warnings from the European Commission or even the opinions put forward by the Central Bank. We continue to borrow to run this State and given that position and with the increased buoyancy, we should have injected it into one-off capital expenditure that would benefit the economy. The important time to invest in capital expenditure is not at the top of the economy but as it begins to grow so that the economy can benefit from that expenditure and continue to grow in later years. I welcome the decreases in taxation. That was important because there is too much taxation in this society and because decreasing taxation in certain areas will help continue the recovery so that there will be more money in the economy for expenditure, but not while we are still borrowing to run the State. I would have liked to debate the possibility of a neutral budget. I did not see a spending increase on the spending side. On the spending side, I am concerned that this now signals the end of reform in the public sector because the necessity that was brought about by the financial crisis to cut costs and define efficiencies no longer exists. Reform of child welfare is imperative. A universal payment of child welfare is very difficult to stand over. Some very wealthy individuals are getting it and rather than reforming that system, we increased the payment. Having imposed the difficult cuts we have now undone those difficult decisions and increased the payment. I am concerned about that. I am concerned also about replacement rates. The replacement salary some people who are unemployed are getting on social welfare is not an incentive for them to seek work again and because that is a problem in society, we have introduced an additional social welfare payment to encourage them back to work. There is something perverse about that logic and it must be debated. We continue to see registration fees for third level increase with no serious debate on whether the State can afford a free fees scheme at third level. That must be discussed as well. I understand the rationale behind the mistreatment of people who are self-employed with the high universal social charge applied to them but self-employed people take a huge risk. Not only do they deserve a reward for that risk but the gains to the economy from them being self-employed in terms of them starting up businesses are disproportionate. They are much greater, and that must be recognised also.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	I spent the last week listening to the contributions of other Members on budget 2015 with great interest. I first entered this Chamber in May 2007 and for the first time in seven years I have seen the introduction of a non-austerity budget. I am pleased about that and I commend the Ministers, Deputy Noonan and Howlin, for their hard work to date. This is the coalition Government's fourth budget and the measures introduced in budget 2015 are a clear sign that we have turned a corner in the economic cycle. It is very important that this economic recovery spreads out to the regions, particularly the midlands. After seven years of austerity measures, some of which were necessary for this country's financial survival, there is finally light at the end of the tunnel for the Irish people. In his contribution the Minister, Deputy Noonan, acknowledged that many people have not yet experienced the fruits of recovery. He is right. There is still a large section of society that needs some support from Government. Regardless of what the Opposition says, it is clear to me and Members on the Government benches that the concessions in tax and welfare will benefit the families who have yet to feel the positive effects of economic recovery. I have limited speaking time in this debate and as a result I will focus my comments on agriculture. Budget 2015 was a very good budget for thousands of farming families and rural communities across the country. For the first time since 2009, the agriculture budget has been increased. The agricultural measures introduced will allow us achieve the maximum potential from our biggest home industry. I come from a rural constituency where farming is the lifeblood of the community. In past years there were only three routes to starting a career in farming: one had to inherit a farm, buy a farm or marry into a farming family. However, thanks to measures introduced in this budget we are sending out a clear message that anyone who wants to do so can enter farming. This budget will make it easier to get land into the hands of young productive farmers. The 50% rise in income tax exemption levels for all long-term leases is a good example of the incentives we need to make land available and accessible to young farmers. We can now realistically aspire to having a larger and more sustainable group of young farmers driving this industry. I have raised the issue of farm safety many times in this House. As a farmer I have a history of near misses in that regard. As the saying goes, complacency is the enemy of success and when it comes to farm safety, there is no room for complacency. Regardless of one's experience or how well one knows the farm, the machinery or the animals, there is always the possibility of a serious or fatal accident occurring. According to the Health and Safety Authority, farming is the most dangerous occupation in the country. Unfortunately, this year's statistics reinforce that bleak reality. This year alone, 23 people have been killed. That is 23 families who have lost a loved one as a result of a farming accident. I congratulate the Minister in the strongest possible manner on the announcement of the €12 million farm safety scheme. The scheme is subject to EU approval but when enacted it will provide 40% grants to a maximum of €20,000 for safety-related farm improvements.I hope this will work to reduce the number of fatalities on farms. I also welcome the decision to retain the 9% value added tax, VAT, rate for the hospitality sector. This will help create a significant number of jobs in rural Ireland. In my home county, Longford, the reduction in VAT on food and tourism services since July 2011 has been a fantastic success. In Longford alone, 173 jobs have been created. In my neighbouring county, Westmeath, a total of 412 jobs have been created since July 2011, according to the report from the Restaurant Association of Ireland, as a result of maintaining the 9% rate. I believe I will be in a position to again tell Members of this House how decisions taken last week will have resulted in the creation of even more jobs in the food, tourism and hospitality sector in the midlands.  The decision to increase the living-alone allowance to €9 a week is important, particularly for those in rural Ireland. Rural isolation has always been a serious issue and I am glad the Minister has recognised this and increased the allowance. I am also very pleased to see the allocation of €1 million for the establishment of the rural innovation and development fund. Rural areas such as the midlands have yet to feel the effect of economic recovery. This fund will support innovation and small scale pilot initiatives that are designed to aid our economic recovery. The fund will support rural communities. I am pleased to see it is part of the wider programme to support and encourage economic development in rural Ireland.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	I commend the budget. After years of difficult and prudent decisions it helps to relaunch the next phase of our country’s recovery. None of us on this side of the House is complacent. The model promulgated by Deputy Boyd Barrett - I am sorry he is not here - is one of spend, spend, spend. We need to be prudent in our economic management, create jobs, and get more people back to work. Over the past six years every household and family in the country has been affected. The sacrifice the people have made has helped bring us to the point where we have a non-austerity budget. As Deputy Eoghan Murphy said, we have for too long allowed a certain few to participate in the delivery of a budget. I support the reform of that process. We need an independent budgetary office and more oversight of how the budget is presented and to find ways in which we as Members of the Parliament can participate by having our ideas and suggestions costed, probed and analysed. I fully support Deputy Eoghan Murphy in that regard.  This budget is the result of a collaborative effort on the part of the Irish people and a Government that could steer a ship and be strong in its course of action. It is important that people feel the economic benefits. Growth of 4% means nothing to the person at home. A reduction in unemployment to 11% means 70,000 jobs have been created and those people are back at work. This budget contains measures that will put people back to work and assist those who rely on social protection payments. Members opposite are peddling a narrative that this is a budget for the rich. Let us dispel that notion: the taxation measures contained in this budget are progressive. It has prioritised those on low and middle incomes by taking 80,000 on low incomes out of the universal social charge, USC, net and increasing the income level at which the top rate of tax is paid. Since coming into office this Government has relieved more than 400,000 people of having to pay USC. This is the first year of a three year reform package to reduce the tax burden and which will have at its core the tenets of fairness, job creation and economic growth. We have heard nothing but misinformation from the Opposition about the fairness of this budget. Low-paid workers were prioritised. The tax bill of a PAYE worker earning €25,000 a year will be cut by 4.6% whereas tax on a person earning €70,000 will be cut by just 2.9%. After this budget 80% of the taxes of the nation will be paid by the top 24% of earners, a fact not acknowledged by the prophets of doom and gloom opposite. Under Fianna Fáil someone earning €12,000 a year would pay €160 in USC. Under this Government the same person will pay no income tax, yet we do not hear that from Fianna Fáil. This budget has provided much relief for people on fixed incomes and contains measures which help those who rely solely on social welfare payments. I very much welcome the return of the Christmas bonus of 25% on the weekly payment and the new water subsidy of €100 per annum for all those on the household package or fuel allowance. The budget helps families by increasing child benefit by €5 per month. Working families will be helped to pay water charges by a tax deductible allowance up to €500 per annum at the standard rate. I would like to see reform in the cost of child care and the payment of child benefit and would very much like to see a White Paper of some description and a conversation on the cost of child care. After the damage caused by Fianna Fáil, which was in Government for 12 of the past 17 years, our sovereignty has been restored, having been betrayed by Fianna Fáil when it forced us into an EU-IMF bailout. Returning the country to a position of growth, employment, prudent economic management and fairness has been the hallmark of this Government.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	97	I welcome the fact that an extra €35 million has been allocated to the development of mental health services. Up to this year, €90 million extra was allocated overall in the budgets. We had hoped to get €15 million extra because last year we got €20 million when we expected €35 million. This year that sum has been allocated, bringing the total investment in the mental health service to €125 million since 2012 for its development and modernisation in line with the recommendations of the expert report, A Vision for Change. The additional funding for mental health will be directed towards the continuation of the prioritised development and reconfiguration of the general adult teams, including psychiatry of later life and child and adolescent community mental health teams. This will be delivered through further recruitment and investment in agencies and services in order to achieve consistent service provision across all areas. To put into context the low contribution this country makes toward mental health services, in 1986, 13% of the total health budget was allocated to the mental health services. The lowest point was 2011, when it was just 5.31% of the total allocation. In 2014 this will increase to 6.63%, which is still very low by comparison with our neighbours and European partners. In England and Wales, 12% of the total health budget is allocated to the mental health services and in Scotland the figure is 18%. In most other European countries the allocation is approximately 20%. While ours has improved in the past three years we are coming from a very low base and there is a long way to go. There is a low budget, starting from a low base, for the National Office of Suicide Prevention. In 2013, the most recent date for statistics, 475 people died by suicide. There were 65 undetermined deaths.Such deaths are included in the suicide statistics in the UK, in Northern Ireland and in most European countries. There is a view that unidentified suicides are happening. We often hear about single-occupancy vehicular deaths that take place without any skid marks being evident. In such cases, it cannot be conclusively said that it was suicide. We know that coroners are very slow to bring in suicide verdicts in cases of deaths from drowning, etc., if they can avoid doing so. This can really be attributed to the stigma around the whole area of mental health and suicide. It is said that it is done to protect families. The same problem exists in the UK. I recently attended a conference at which it was mentioned that a coroner in London brought in 30 verdicts of accidental hanging. Such decisions show us the difficulty associated with the whole area of statistics. I would like to put together some of the figures I have mentioned. Approximately 600 people die each year from suicide. In 2011, the allocation to the National Office for Suicide Prevention was €4 million. That figure has been more than doubled, to €8.8 million, since then. It is still at a very low base. A great deal of work needs to be done. The same point applies in the case of mental health services. Some of the additional €35 million that was allocated for such services this year will go the National Office for Suicide Prevention. I urge the Minister and, in particular, the HSE, which manages the budget allocation, to ensure the National Office for Suicide Prevention receives several million in funding to develop the excellent work it is doing. I hope we can improve our mental health services and reduce the rate of suicide and deliberate self-harm.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	I compliment Deputy Neville on his contribution. The work he has been doing in this House and around the country to highlight the issue of suicide is to be commended. Since the Deputy first raised this issue, the number of people committing suicide has grown to a frightening level. It is correct to say we are not investing sufficient funds in mental health to deal with all of these issues, to assist the families that are affected by these problems and to inform people, particularly men, about the need to talk about these matters. I heard on the radio yesterday that a taxi driver talked two people who were contemplating suicide down from a bridge in Kilkenny last weekend. There are many other cases like that. The figures are not being manipulated. As Deputy Neville said, we are not calling it the way it is, which is what we need to do. Much more needs to be done. For example, a great deal of money needs to be invested in the community aspect of the mental health services in my constituency. Although we are breaking down the institutionalised settings, we are not providing sufficient funds in the community to support the individuals and families affected by mental health problems. As a result, those who are directly affected are suffering very badly in terms of their health and their quality of life. We have to do much more on this issue. I listened to the previous speakers telling us that this budget marks the end of austerity. They said that austerity is finished. I have to reflect on the 2011 general election, when the outgoing Government lost 58 seats. Undoubtedly, it was rightly punished for the view that people had about how the economy was handled and what had happened in their lives. The 2011 general election moved everything on. The parties that are now in government promised reform. They said they would use their massive majority in this House to deal with all of the issues in an upfront manner. People were looking forward to the fulfilment of the promises the Government made to the electorate. It has not fulfilled those promises, however. The Deputies opposite can dress the budget up any way they like, but when they go back to their constituencies and meet local authority tenants whose rents are going through the roof, will they tell them not to worry because austerity has ended? It has not ended for such people. What will they say to the 12% of people who are unemployed? I remind the House that this figure would be higher if many members of the current generation had not left the land. They are gone. We can play the blame game, but I suggest we should look at the facts. They have gone. They have left the country. They are not here any more. What does the Government say to those who have gone away? Is there anything in this budget to attract them to come back and find jobs here? No, there is not. The Deputies opposite know there is not.

Individuals are being let go from jobs, only to be replaced within weeks by people on the JobBridge scheme. Real courses for real jobs are not being implemented. The Government is messing around with the statistics. It is not actually doing anything. The numbers are coming down because a few jobs are being created and because the vast bulk of young people have left. During the 2011 general election campaign, I was struck by the sadness of grandparents who will not see their children's children reared near them. The reality is that they will probably not see them at all other than on Skype. The reforms the Government promised have not been implemented and will not help those people. As a result, people are even more cynical about politicians at election time. Deputy Rabbitte let the cat out of the bag when he said that regardless of what one tells the people at election time, one can do what one likes if one gets in.

None of what they have said today is new politics. Can they tell people involved in the SME sector that austerity is over? That might apply to some businesses in urban centres, but it does not apply to family-run SMEs all over the country that have been in business for generations. These families have spent all their savings to keep their shops and services open, and now they are left with nothing. This Government, like its predecessor, has been saying it has given the banks €3.5 billion this year to lend to the SME sector. The banks are not lending. They are spoofing. They are telling the Government porkies and the Government is taking them on board. Why does it not tell the banks not to act in this manner? Where is the bank that the Government said it would put in place for the SME sector? I am talking about companies on the high street that provide two, three or four jobs in local communities. They cannot get the money they need to stay open. They are pushed to the pin of their collars. The Government is doing nothing about it. This is happening on the Government's watch. It should tell AIB that it wants to see weekly returns on the investments it is making in the SME sector. AIB will not be able to provide such details. It is paying a fortune for newspaper advertisements about being brave or something. It is a joke. The Minister of State with responsibility for the SME sector, for whom I have the greatest respect, knows it is a joke. AIB needs to be called in because it is not just bluffing the Government - it is bluffing every single one of us in this House. Some 800,000 people were employed in the SME sector at one time. As that number has dwindled dramatically, the response from the banks and, as a result, the Government has been absolutely pathetic. The Government should not allow the banks to get away with this. It should tell the banks to fulfil the Government's policy and commitment to facilitate lending to the SME sector. The Government said there would be no upward-only rent reviews, but that went out the minute it came into office. People out there are still affected by it. Are Members aware that the Government is one of the biggest holders of leases with upward-only rent reviews? When representatives of the various harbour companies appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts last week, we learned that 54 properties have little or no leases attached to them.The Government is not doing its homework or introducing the necessary reforms. What about commercial rates for the small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector? The Government claimed to understand the difficulties in that regard. SMEs have cut their costs and minimised everything. The last cost, which they cannot effect, is the commercial rate, but the Government is doing nothing about it. When an enthusiastic entrepreneur builds an extension to his or her pub, shop, warehouse or whatever, the first visit he or she receives is not from government wishing him or her well, but from a local authority's rates section, organised by government, seeking to revalue his or her property. Is this the type of country that the Government wants? Should everyone who attempts to create or sustain jobs be taxed and penalised? It happened prior to this Government's tenure, too, but the Government promised reform. It has not delivered, and has instead continued to tax and shame SMEs up and down the country. If the Minister of State told them that austerity had ended, they would not believe him. We in the south east have argued for a university in the region. The Minister of State's party colleague agreed that one was needed and recognised the fact that outside investors looked for the best quality services for them and their employees, for example, schools, housing and universities. We promoted our campaign and Institute of Technology, Carlow linked with the Waterford Institute of Technology, but the project has been derailed.

It should insist that the original plan to bring Carlow and Waterford together to form a new university be executed. It is about time that the vested interests, including those in the education sector as well as the Department who probably do not want a university anyway because it would cost money, do what they are told. If the project is good for the south east and Ireland and creates jobs, let us have it. Why is the Government not declaring that, in the interests of business and our international profile, we need this university and vested interests will not be tolerated? The Government should make a point of supporting its backbenchers and Opposition Deputies from the constituencies involved, award university status to Carlow and Waterford together and stop the games being played with the process. I touched on the issue of mental health, but the Government is an absolute and utter disgrace on the wider issue of health. It spent five years and more on this side of the House telling us how health could be handled and that it would implement best practice and abolish the HSE. It went half-cocked down that road and listened to no one. Alongside Irish Water, the HSE is now the largest quango of which we know. From its appearances before the Committee of Public Accounts, I can tell the Minister of State that it is not fit for purpose. Every waiting list is growing and older and marginalised people are not being accounted for or supported with services. The Government should hang its head in shame, given the number of people awaiting serious hospital operations. The medical card fiasco happened on the Government's watch. An administrative issue, it gained the State nothing financially and destroyed older people's belief that the Government would do what it was supposed to do, namely, care for the State's people. The Government failed them. To this day, it is only when people try to collect their prescriptions from chemists that they discover their medical cards have been withdrawn. Letters have been lost in the post, information sent to the centre has not been dealt with and communications from Deputies have been ignored. Not only has the Government failed to learn from the situation with the HSE or to take account of the people it represents who are in hardship as regards their health, it has decided to create a similar quango in the form of Irish Water, leaving it in the greatest mess. Irish Water's board should be gone. If it was a private business, its board would be thrashed out the door and one would never again hear tell of its members. Indeed, we have not heard from the board or been told why its qualified members are not performing. The Government is encouraging Mr. John Tierney to take the flak. The Government members are a great bunch of lads. Why do they not take the flak? They created it. According to Deputy O'Dowd, doing so was wrong and he told the Government as much. The Government is shouting about the end of austerity. All of the quarter Christmas bonus that it gives will be taken back in January by Irish Water. Let us examine what has happened. Assets owned by the State were transferred to Irish Water, a semi-State company. All of the corporate knowledge was also transferred to it free of charge. It has a magnificent budget of millions upon millions of euro to be spent on consultants. This happened on the Government's watch. Irish Water is of the Government's design, yet the Government expects people to pay for what has been spent on those consultants before they even get a drop of water. Some €300 million has been spent on water meters and €1 billion on fixing the infrastructure. Look at all of the money the Government has spent on consultants. Ownership of the State's assets went to Irish Water from the Irish people. The Government then told it that it could charge people for them as well. It is a disgrace and has led to the current fiasco. While in opposition, those opposite asked for something that is never debated in the House, but they were not interested in it come government. The Comptroller and Auditor General produces a report every year and lays it before the House and the Committee of Public Accounts, forming our programme of work, but the House and Government do not discuss it. Nor does the Government take the actions proposed by the committee to stop wastage of money in the public sector. The Government might claim that there is not much waste, but there is. Some €31 million spent on a site in Dublin was lost simply because of incompetence and a lack of leadership in two Departments. The Department of Justice and Equality knocked down the State pathology lab that was being built, amounting to a further €4 million lost, because it did not know whether it would have funding available for the next two year. None of the €2.3 billion that is spent on local government is accounted for properly. I have not seen a single value for money report or special report from local authorities that means anything. The local government sector is an in-house operation-----

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	113	I understand that this morning, the Taoiseach met Maíria Cahill. Although I am not aware of what transpired in the course of their conversations, I have no doubt but that the Taoiseach would have been very taken aback by her story and by her account of being raped as a young 16 year old. In addition, attempts were made earlier, when this story was revealed, to undermine her credibility. The story regarding the IRA interrogation into her abuse is one that would shake any person who has had the opportunity to hear it. Over the past decade, there have been many debates in this House relating to the issue of child sex abuse. These range from the swimming abuse inquiry many years ago to the inquiry into industrial schools to the various inquiries into Cloyne, Ferns and Dublin and across the board. Politicians from all parties were anxious that those debates would take place and they participated fully in them in the interests of the victims of such abuse, in the sense that those institutions had covered up and had transgressed the rights of victims. For many Deputies at that time, some of that material was uncomfortable. People could hardly believe what they were hearing on those occasions. I remember it well and was involved in initiating some of the inquiries myself. Sinn Féin Deputies were to the fore in condemning the Catholic Church. The Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, said that Cardinal Brady should resign when it was revealed that as a young priest, the cardinal was secretary to a secret inquiry that swore to silence two young boys who were abused. The deputy leader of Sinn Féin, Deputy McDonald, said that anyone found to have covered up the abuse of children should be arrested and should face the full rigours of the law.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	115	We know that Maíria Cahill was sworn to silence by Sinn Féin-IRA. This is known and one should just read her father's testimony during the week. I put it to the Taoiseach that this morning, Members have learned of another victim from the Irish Independent. They got three options, namely, we will execute him, you can execute him or we will expel him. Expulsion means moving to another parish. When one reads the blog on this issue by the leader of Sinn Féin, Deputy Adams, one notes he said that on occasions, the IRA shot them. We do not know what happened on the other occasions. Sometimes they expelled them. Expelling means moving to another parish-----

Will the Government ensure there is a comprehensive Dáil debate on this issue, like those held at any time abuse in other institutions came up? We should have such a debate. Second, can the Taoiseach confirm whether the Minister for Justice and Equality has discussed this issue or case with the Minister for Justice in the Northern Ireland Executive, David Ford, because of the obvious cross-Border dimension to this matter? Third, will the Government give consideration to creating a facility to enable victims of such abuse at the hands of Sinn Féin-IRA to come forward and tell their story in confidence so the full story can come out?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	120	I had the opportunity and privilege of meeting Maíria Cahill over the past hour and a half or so. This is a courageous, confident and brave young woman who is a force to be reckoned with. She overcame the horror of being raped and had to face down the IRA and its generals, secret or otherwise. All Members know that the horror of rape is that it is not just a violation but is about control and power. While in that frightening situation her own control was taken from her, she never ceded in any way her own power. It is that power and that sense for truth that brought her here to Leinster House and that brought her to Government Buildings this morning. When innocence is defiled, clearly there are consequences when people have the courage to speak out. Deputy Martin asked three questions. The answer to the first question is "Yes." The Government will facilitate a comprehensive debate on this matter. I cannot confirm for the Deputy whether the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has spoken to the Northern Ireland Minister, Mr. Ford, but he can take it from me that she will. We need to reflect on the Deputy's third question in regard to having some facility, opportunity or method of allowing people who wish to come forward with their stories to so do in confidence. That is an issue on which Members must reflect in order to do that in the best way possible. As the Deputy mentioned in respect of what happened with the Catholic Church and sexual abuse, it is very much mirrored in what has happened here with IRA sexual abusers who are members of Sinn Féin. It is clear, from my conversations this morning with Maíria Cahill, that a number of clear questions must be answered. One such question concerns the movement of people from Northern Ireland involved in the IRA who were moved down to this jurisdiction. They are still here. People know who they are, people know where they are and people know of their activities. It is time that people spoke up and answered these questions.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	121	I thank the Taoiseach for his response and welcome the fact that there will be a comprehensive Dáil debate on this issue, just as there has been in relation to other issues and scandals - I outlined quite a number. At that time, people did not say that people were being political or whatever in discussing abuse within the Catholic Church. I can recall Deputy McDonald's words in respect of the abuse of children in the Dublin diocese. She said:The report on clerical sexual abuse of children in Dublin exposes how the most powerful men in the Catholic Church in the Dublin Diocese conspired to protect abusers of children. It was a gross betrayal of generations of children.The most powerful men within the IRA interrogated victims of abuse at the hands of leading members of the IRA. That happened.The most powerful men conspired to protect the abusers and swore the victims to silence. It is unpalatable to have to say that. There may be Members in the House who do not like me saying that but there is no getting away from it. It is an unpalatable truth. The difficulty is that the power and fear here was much greater than anywhere else and victims will tell one that.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	124	I will give it serious consideration. I take the advice of people in the House as to how best that might be able to be put in place. The Deputy is correct; the most powerful people in the IRA conspired in this. It is reprehensible that a young woman of this courage and bravery should have been kicked about in the last week. Her goalposts have changed and have been changed deliberately. I note from Deputy Adams's comments last night the first connection with the IRA in his statement outside the Mansion House. Perhaps when he has the opportunity he might confirm for the people of our country down here whether or not Maíria Cahill was required to attend at a meeting with her rapist and three other men to discuss this matter. That is the central issue here: a young woman who was raped and sexually abused being required by powerful people within the IRA to attend at a meeting and having to face her abuser.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	125	I also welcome the debate. I was going to raise it later under the Order of Business. I am also very mindful that there are victims and families affected by abuse watching us. Some of them have been in touch with my office. Sexual abuse and abuse of any kind is wrong. The abuse of a child is a particularly heinous crime. The consequences for victims and their families are devastating. We know this having seen the human cost of abuse right across Irish society. I have set out the circumstances in the North when there was no democratic civic policing service. I have acknowledged that the IRA sought to deal with some cases of abuse when asked to do so by families and victims. While IRA volunteers were acting, in my opinion, in good faith, the IRA was ill-equipped to deal with such matters. IRA actions against sex offenders failed victims. That is a matter of profound regret for me and other republicans. I am acutely conscious that there may be victims who were let down or failed by the IRA's inability to resolve these cases. As Uachtarán Shinn Féin, I want to apologise to those victims. Those who wish to should come forward now and report their complaints to the appropriate authorities - An Garda Síochána, the PSNI or the social services, or the HSE in the South - and they will have Sinn Féin's full support in doing so. Secrecy has surrounded abuse in Ireland. It was taboo to discuss it and some victims were very fearful to disclose it. The only way to face this problem is to support and empower victims in order that they will speak out. To cover up child abuse is to deny the basic humanity of the victim and to shield the perpetrator. It is an unthinkable act of cruelty. Sinn Féin has not engaged in a cover-up of child abuse as some of our political enemies, including the Fianna Fáil leader and the Taoiseach, have alleged.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	148	Let us not forget that the central issue here is that a young woman was raped, sexually abused and required to go before her abuser and three other men from the IRA. The Deputy's deputy leader does not believe this. She has blind allegiance to the Deputy as leader of the party while a young woman with courage and bravery is not afraid to speak out. In the past week she has had numbers of others belonging to the same organisation come forward to her having contacted her about similar stories. I hope these people have the courage to speak out as well. In putting his next question, the Deputy might confirm whether he knows, as leader of his party and Uachtarán Sinn Féin, whether Maíria Cahill was required to attend in a room with three men and her abuser, all members of the IRA, that a second meeting took place some months afterwards, and in the intervening period she was not allowed to go to the PSNI or to the police. The Deputy might confirm from his information from associates who were members of the IRA whether he is aware of any people who were moved down to this jurisdiction to Donegal or to Louth who were involved in sexual abuse of women in Northern Ireland and who are still in this jurisdiction. He might indicate to the House whether he knows anything about any of that because I think the story Maíria Cahill has to tell is not just powerful but will have serious consequences.

I do not know who is not listening here. It is a very simple proposition. The Taoiseach has heard Maíria Cahill's story. All those from Sinn Féin who have met Maíria Cahill accept and acknowledge she was abused and traumatised. She then put a particular version of what occurred.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	200	On 19 December last year, the Taoiseach rammed through the legislation to create Irish Water. The Opposition refused to take part in what was a charade and we walked out in protest. One of the microphones was left on that day and it picked up a Government Deputy saying, "Let them go", with an expletive in the middle. This shows the kind of contempt this majority Government has for those with opposing views. The Government needed to ram through the legislation to proceed with the transfer of €11 billion in assets from county and city councils to Irish Water by 1 January. There are two things Irish people hate, namely, being bullied and being taken for fools. The Government and Irish Water have managed to do both. The process of having to hand over one's PPS number makes people feel bullied. People are infuriated as they will be fined if they do not hand it over. They feel they have been taken for fools. There have been too many examples of this. The partnering with Bord Gáis was supposed to produce significant savings, but there were actually massive start-up costs. It also brought about a bonus culture. People are sick and tired of listening to the propaganda about this. The controversial awarding of the metering contract and almost all other facets of Irish Water do not sit well with people. The approach has alienated those who believe conservation, more so than fixing leaky pipes, is important, including myself. It has alienated people who have data protection concerns and those who are pretty much terrified about the uncertainty and extent of the growing number of charges. The approach has also alienated people who fear the Government and Irish Water are making it up as they go along. The Government is hell-bent on giving the impression that the entire failure is a failure in communications and of the board of Irish Water when in fact it is a far more substantial one. It represents a total loss of trust in the Government. We are now at the blame game. What blame does the Government place on itself for the loss of trust associated with this omnishambles that is Irish Water? What possible difference can the extension of a month make? Does the Taoiseach believe the events of 19 December 2013 will ultimately determine the results of the next general election?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	201	The answer to the Deputy's last question is that the people will decide the outcome of the next general election and make their choices, whenever it is called. The intention is that it shall be in the spring of 2016. That is always the way it should be. People are the masters and those whom they elect here are merely their servants. With regard to Irish Water, I dealt with this matter at length yesterday. It is well known why it is necessary to set up Irish Water. It is to have a public entity enshrined in law that can borrow off the balance sheet for proper investment in infrastructure and treatment plants for high-quality water for drinking, business and industry. I dealt with the question of the unitary board involving Ervia, formerly Bord Gáis Éireann, and Irish Water, which board will be established at the end of November. The board has a particular function. I do not want to interfere in any way with the regulator, who made some comments yesterday at a meeting of the Oireachtas committee. We will follow through on whatever the regulator decides in light of his independent responsibility. It is more than a matter of communications. Irish Water is one of the largest institutions to be created, and it is necessary that it be so. There are challenges with the timescale that has been set out. Most of the complaints I have received are about the mechanics of how Irish Water deals with telephone calls, queries, e-mails, requirements to fix leaks and questions about water supply and treatment-work supplies. The issues on which the Government reflected yesterday are being discussed by Irish Water and the Department. The regulator has independent responsibilities. I hope clarity and understanding will emerge from the discussions in order that people can have confidence in Irish Water and know what they will get for the contributions they make in terms of the improvement of plants and infrastructure, the ending of boil water notices and the creation of a system of water provision that is of the highest integrity and standard. This will be necessary for decades. It has never been dealt with and I know it is challenging and not easy. The system needs to be fair and the charges need to be affordable for everyone. I hope that over the next period we can ensure clarity and confidence for everyone in order that they will know the contribution they will make will be for the important purposes of investment, raising standards and providing water of high quality for domestic, business and industrial use for many decades to come.It is not easy to get an institution such as this running as efficiently as one would like. Clearly, there have been and are challenges and I hope we can deal with those.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	202	I do not know to whom the Taoiseach is listening if he thinks that this is merely a communications issue or teething problems with setting up a utility. It is far more fundamental than that. The way it has been handled has been a disgrace and has caused considerable upset. The 100,000 people on the street were not complaining about their telephone calls not being answered. The impression being given is that we are starting from scratch. The example given was that it is on a par with setting up the electrification of the country when, in fact, as I stated, €11 billion of assets, many of which are first-world assets that have been invested in over decades, were handed over to Irish Water. This is far more important than a communications issue. It is a loss of trust in how the Government has handled this issue, from ramming the legislation through to adding Irish Water to the list of organisations that can require persons to hand over their PPS numbers so the Government could circumvent data protection rules, which is what the Data Protection Commissioner states. I will repeat my question. Where does the Taoiseach place himself in this blame game, which is now focused on the board of Irish Water but which, in fact, points to a political failure?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	203	I place myself, obviously, as Head of Government. The Government made the decision to set up Irish Water and it was the correct decision to make. The Government also made the decision to not have every local authority involved, with a different standard of provision of water and the difficulties that they all encountered. That is the correct decision. The regime that is in place at present with the regulator means, for instance, that bills are capped at €278 for a couple with two children, but also that if the bill is less than that there is an incentive for the consumer to pay that lesser bill. The regulator will make his comments about that in due course. As I stated yesterday, Irish Water has not done itself justice in pointing out what it is doing in terms of its capital programme of €1.2 billion to deal with 126 treatment works that are not up to standard across many other areas of the country. This is a public entity. Fears that this will be privatised or sold are wrong, unfounded and without base. It is the law. This is the provision of a public entity to invest in infrastructure so that consumers can have high standards of production and good quality water monitored by the regulator, who has already stated that he wants a reduction in its cost base by 8% by the end of 2016, including a substantial amount in respect of pay and salaries. This is a case where there are challenges still ahead and we hope to deal with those clearly so that consumers can have confidence that this is a necessary facility and their contribution will go for what it is intended for many decades to come, including investment in infrastructure, the production of high-quality water, treatment works that stand up to scrutiny, and a service to consumers that is not like the service provided in this city at present, which can go wrong and is constantly on a knife-edge. I hope we can deal with all of those in the short period ahead.

Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. a12, b12 and 12 agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 29 agreed to? Agreed. I call Deputy Martin on the Order of Business.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	206	There had been reports that the Government believes that a legal bid by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to quash the findings of the Guerin review would not block a new commission of inquiry into Garda malpractice allegations that were made by Sergeant Maurice McCabe. Deputy Shatter went to the High Court in July to have certain findings against him made by Mr. Seán Guerin SC quashed, but the Guerin report called for a commission of inquiry and the Taoiseach announced to the House that there would be a commission of inquiry. So far the commission has not been established. The Taoiseach might indicate when this inquiry will be established and why the undue delay in its regard. The second item relates to the early years strategy. As far back as January 2012, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, when Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, announced that during 2012, the Department would develop Ireland's first national early years strategy - even though it would not have been the first. The announcement was approved by Cabinet in March 2012, the expert group was established in June 2012, the Minister stated she would publish the expert group report in December 2012, and the expert group report was launched in October 2013. It is October 2014. Three years on from when Deputy Fitzgerald announced this key part of the programme for Government - Deputy Troy has been on this case for some time - can the Taoiseach indicate when will we see it?

I will let him know today. In respect of the report from Mr. Guerin SC, the commission of inquiry is not yet set up. The Government has not finalised its terms of reference. Work is ongoing with the Minister for Justice and Equality. I will advise the House and the Deputy as to the timescale when we expect the commission to be formally launched and the terms of reference approved.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	208	Tá ceist agam maidir leis an mBille um Inimirce, Cónaí agus Cosaint, the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which was introduced here at First Stage in 2010. It has been in committee since. Given that persons are stuck in these direct provision facilities, in some cases for 14 years, this delay is unacceptable.Last month, the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Ms Emily Logan, expressed concern at a committee meeting about the inordinate delay attached to the Bill, which has very real human consequences. I visited the direct provision facility at Mosney in County Louth where some people have been living for up to ten years. Some children born in the facility are still there eight or nine years later. Given that the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, said he would republish the Bill during his term of office, could the Taoiseach explain in the first instance the reason for the delay, and when the Bill will come back before the Dáil?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	209	An immigration Bill is on the clár, as it were. So many amendments were tabled to the Bill that it was considered better to withdraw it and draft a new Bill, namely, the international protection Bill. I have a note on it in respect of the commitment to legislate to reduce the length of time for asylum seekers must spend time in the direct provision system, through the establishment of a single applications procedure to be introduced by way of a protection Bill. Work is under way on it, taking into account all of the amendments that were tabled on the immigration Bill previously. We must also consider the specialist group chaired by Mr. Justice Bryan MacMahon, which is dealing with representatives from all of the organisations concerned with immigration and asylum seekers. It is considering what should apply in the Bill and in the direct provision facilities, which is a subject of interest and focus for the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald. I will provide an update to Deputy Adams on the work that is proceeding in terms of the drafting of the protection Bill. We must await the report of Mr. Justice MacMahon, taking into account the views of all the organisations on how the situation could be improved and expedited. The central issue is that it should not take ten years to decide whether an applicant is entitled to asylum.

You told us that Members are selected to speak on the basis of an administrative convenience, and that if certain people are not included on our list of speakers, you are likely to call them. How do you think it will work in terms of administrative convenience because if any one of us goes to you and says he or she did not get five minutes or ten minutes speaking time, will you administer the entire Technical Group?

It is my preference that parties and groups would arrange their own business, but at the end of the day it is my responsibility in accordance with Standing Orders to call speakers. It is a matter of convenience that lists are prepared in a particular order but it is entirely a matter for the Chair as to who is called. If I receive a complaint that people are not being afforded the opportunity to make a contribution, I have a duty to make certain that they do, irrespective of whether one is a member of the Technical Group or any other group for that matter.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	424	I have referred the issue to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency (the Agency) for attention and to furnish a report on the matter to my Officials. However, as this relates to an individual case, I would not consider it appropriate for me to comment here and I would note that the day to day management of a case is an operational matter for the Agency. As the Deputy may be aware psychological and psychiatric services are provided by the Health Service Executive and that services such as the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams (CAMHS) are currently within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Health. The Government has prioritised development of mental health services, to complete implementation of A Vision for Change, and has provided additional funding of €125 million since 2012 for various new service initiatives. The Health Service Executive (HSE) Service Plan 2014 provides in the region of €766 million for mental health, and the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams (CAMHS) are benefitting significantly through on-going service developments.  I have been informed that the HSE has commenced an initiative to improve various operational aspects of the CAMHS service, including access and use of CAMHS in-patient and community services, and that this involves, for example, looking in greater detail at trends in performance and underlying contributing factors, consultant capacity and availability, and correlation with other related services in regard to the nature or complexity of those waiting for service. This measure is supported by the new posts allocated to CAMHS over 2012-13. I have been advised that the HSE has statutory responsibility to deliver services at local level, and any issues relating to individual cases are an operational matter for the HSE.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	426	Medical card and GP visit card applications are assessed against the HSE’s Medical Card and GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines for the standard medical card or for the over 70's card, as appropriate. In all cases, if an application is assessed ineligible for a medical card or eligible for a GP visit card only, the letter issuing informing this decision will include an explanation of how the application was assessed and the details of the means assessment calculated on the application. In addition, the letter will notify the applicant of the details should he/she wish to appeal the decision or provide additional relevant information for a further review assessment. The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible. The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended. It has established a dedicated contact service for members of the Oireachtas specifically for queries relating to medical cards and GP visit cards, which the Deputy may wish to use for an earlier response. Contact information has issued to Oireachtas members.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	427	I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 124 to 127, inclusive, together. Where a General Practitioner (GP), who holds a General Medical Services (GMS) contract, lives and practices in a centre with a population of less than 500 and where there is not a town with a population of 1,500 or more within a 4.83 km (3 mile) radius of that centre, the GP is entitled to a Rural Practice Allowance. As a result of satisfying the criteria for payment of the Rural Practice Allowance, the GP is also entitled to claim practice support subsidies (Practice Nurse, Practice Secretary and Practice Manager) at the maximum applicable rate which he/she would otherwise only be entitled to claim if he/she had a panel size of 1,200 and over. The GP would also be entitled to claim the maximum applicable contribution towards locum costs for periods of sick leave, annual leave, study leave, maternity leave and adoptive leave. In remote areas, where an alternative to dispensing by the GP is considered not to be feasible by the HSE, a dispensing GP is entitled to receive payment for dispensing to his/her GMS patients. The Rural Practice Allowance has not been abolished. Since 2009, a number of reductions have been applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 (FEMPI) to the fees and allowances paid to health professionals, including GPs who provide services under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme. Over this period, the Rural Practice Allowance under the GMS capitation agreement has been reduced from €20,712.29 to the current annual rate of €16,216.07. This has resulted in an overall reduction in the payments made by the HSE for this allowance from some €3.762 million in 2009 to approximately €3.121 million in 2013.  GPs contracted under the GMS Scheme are paid an annual capitation payment in respect of each patient on their GMS list. Up until 2010, this capitation payment was based on the patient's age, gender and the distance they lived from the GP's surgery. In 2010, under FEMPI, the aspect relating to distance from the GP's surgery was removed as a factor in calculating capitation fees. In this context, it should be noted that the 2010 Regulations imposed a variety of reductions across a range of fees and allowances averaging just over 9% in total. While the reduction in certain fees was more than 9%, the reduction in others was less than 9%. In making such determinations, the Department was mindful of information from the HSE which indicated that 90% of GP consultations take place at the GP surgery and do not involve a home visit – also many of the home visits are undertaken out-of-hours by GPs in co-ops, where the GP has the use of a car and driver funded by the HSE, which they can also use for home visits to private patients. The Department, in arriving at its final determination in relation to the range of percentage reductions also ensured that the reduction in relation to the superannuable fees was kept to a minimum, thus minimising the reduction in the GPs’ pensions at a later stage (superannuable fees were only reduced by 3.5%). In relation to the removal of “distance” as a factor in calculating certain fees, the total estimated full year saving for this measure in 2010 was €5.2 million.While GP numbers are keeping pace with overall demographics, this does not always prevent shortages occurring at local level. GPs once qualified tend to work for existing GP practices or as self-employed contractors - and are free to decide where to establish practice. Isolated rural areas and deprived urban areas, very often with limited private practice opportunities, may sometimes find it difficult to attract GPs to fill vacant posts.The HSE is actively seeking to address this issue at present with the medical organisations with a view to developing practical measures - including reorganising lists with existing doctors in local areas, and through the development of more flexible contractual arrangements which would encourage young GPs to work in such areas. This will be examined as part of the overall GMS contract discussions between the Department, HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation, which will begin shortly. In relation to the particular aspect relating to the breakdown of spend by County for the Rural Practice Allowance, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.

The policy proposals will be informed by the work, last year, of the Review Group on Transport Supports for People with Disabilities and the Inter-Departmental Group tasked by Government to consider the matter. Once approved by Government, the time frame for the introduction of a new scheme will become clearer.
