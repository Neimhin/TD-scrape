The petitioner believes the closure of the DÃ¡il bar would be in the public interest as Leinster House is a place of work and should lead by example. It is proposed that the Committee on Public Petitions deem the petition to be inadmissible under Standing Order 111C(1)(b) on the grounds that it does not comply with Standing Orders. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P0005/18. The petitioner, Ms Elisabeth Hourihane, believes there is an anomaly in the Mental Health Act 2001 which does not address the issue of addiction.
