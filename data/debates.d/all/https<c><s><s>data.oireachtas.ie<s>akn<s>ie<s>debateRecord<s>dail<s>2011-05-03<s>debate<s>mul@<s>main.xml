            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_4">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">The Government has decided that new arrangements will be put in place for the making of appointments to State boards and bodies.  In future, Departments will invite expressions of interest on their websites for vacancies on the boards of bodies under their aegis.  Ministers will not necessarily be confined to those who make expressions of interest, but will ensure all appointees have the relevant qualifications.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">Several Departments have already started this process.  The Department of Transport published on its website an advertisement seeking expressions of interest for appointments as chairpersons of the boards of the CIE companies and the Railway Procurement Agency and also for appointments to the boards of transport, tourism and sport agencies.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has also advertised on its website with regard to vacancies that will arise on the boards of bodies under its aegis before the end of 2011.  The Department of Finance has sought expressions of interest for appointments to the board of directors of the recapitalised banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">The Government has also decided that those who are being proposed for appointment as chairpersons of State boards will be required to make themselves available to the appropriate Oireachtas committee to discuss the approach they will take as chairperson and their views about the future contribution of the body or board in question.  Following that discussion, decisions will be taken by the Minister or the Government, as appropriate, to confirm the nominee as chairperson.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
            <p eId="para_8">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Taoiseach as an bhfreagra sin.  The soundings the Taoiseach has made with regard to the process for appointment to State bodies is welcome.  However, it is a matter of regret that up to 110 people were appointed by the outgoing Government to State boards in the period between the dissolution of the previous Dáil and the formation of the new Government.  We all agree this is not the way to do business and we need to ensure an ending to the "jobs for the boys" approach that has pertained in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">The Taoiseach gave some information on advertisements that have been placed and some appointments made.  Is that an exhaustive account of matters at present?  How many appointments has the Government made since it took office?  I ask the Taoiseach to expand on the level of scrutiny and transparency that will apply in future appointments.  I note that he again referred to prospective chairs of State boards presenting themselves before Oireachtas committees.  When will this process begin?  Can the Taoiseach reassure us that this will not be simply a rubber-stamping exercise?  What kind of discretion will the Oireachtas committees have?  Crucially, will a committee have the power to block an appointment to a State board?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_10">The change here is pretty dramatic in the context of what went on before.  We also discussed this at the last round of Taoiseach's Questions.  This will take effect from the time the Oireachtas committees are set up, which will be in the very near future.  The first person to appear before an Oireachtas committee will be the nominee for appointment to Bord na gCon, for which there has been a vacancy for some time.  The procedure is that the proposed person will appear before the relevant Oireachtas committee and give his or her view as to what contribution he or she can make to the agency or body to which he or she is proposed to be appointed.  The advertisements to be carried by departmental websites or organisations outside the normal remit of Government will carry the requirements as to what is wanted from the personnel who might apply in an expression of interest, in other words the range of specific qualifications or competencies required so that there is a standard that is required which people will know if they apply or put in an expression of interest.  This will take effect as soon as the Oireachtas committees are up and running.  As vacancies occur, as will happen, Departments will advertise on their websites the range of competencies and qualifications so that those who are interested can put in their expressions of interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">The Deputy asked if the committee could block somebody's appointment.  I made this clear before; if a proposed person nominated either by a Minister or by the Government really falls down in making his or her presentation to the relevant committee, obviously the Government or the Minister would need to take that into account, but it is not a function of the committees — they are not blocking committees.  It is an opportunity for the proposed person and the committee to discuss the policy issues in respect of the organisation, agency or body concerned.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
            <p eId="para_12">I appreciate that the requirements and job specification would be set out, which is absolutely necessary.  If the ultimate power of decision is not vested in the committee — if one is to be cynical about it — does it not then simply become an optical exercise?  I do not suggest that the committees should become simply blocking mechanisms, but if one were to scrutinise the candidature of any person for any appointment, surely the logical outflow from that is that the committee would have the power to either accept or reject, to endorse or otherwise the candidacy for any particular position.  It leads me to conclude that perhaps this is simply optics and a rubber-stamping mechanism.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
            <p eId="para_14">Given that an applicant will set out initially his or her vision for the job based on what he or she can bring thereto, what will be the role of the committee in scrutinising performance on an ongoing basis?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_7">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_15">It depends on the organisation, agency or committee involved.  The Government sets policy, as decided by the Cabinet, and a range of organisations, agencies and Departments implement it.  If one wants to see the scale of change, one should note that Oireachtas committees never had the range of competencies required or the necessary experience.  Members were appointed on the basis of friendship rather than competence, as admitted in the House by a former Taoiseach.  That is not the way it should be.  If agencies, organisations and committees are to conduct their business properly, it must be done in the context of implementing and carrying through on current Government policy in the interests of the country and the people.  It would be thoroughly unwise, therefore, of a Government to disregard the view of an Oireachtas committee of anybody appearing before it.  That is why expressions of interest will be made by people who deem themselves to be competent and have the experience and qualifications necessary to express an interest in a position in the first place.  We want far greater transparency than has been the case heretofore.  In the main, the appointments will be confirmed by the Cabinet, or Minister, after the appointees have been proposed and have appeared before the relevant committee to make their case.</p>

            <p eId="para_16">I have two questions, Nos. 2 and 3, on the same issue.  While not wanting to get involved in party political point-scoring, for decades every Government, before its dissolution after a general election, appointed people to State boards as vacancies arose.  On the Taoiseach's last day in office as Minister for Tourism and Trade he appointed a Fine Gael trustee to the board of Bord Fáilte.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">Does the Taoiseach agree that the reforms introduced by a Minister in the previous Government, Mr. Eamon Ryan, went further than those being proposed in that he actually gave authority to a committee to nominate individuals, particularly in the broadcasting arena?  It was a novel approach that he adopted with the sanction of the previous Government.  While what we are witnessing is welcome in terms of advertisements and committees having a chance to discuss a nominee's views, that is as far as it goes.  The power to nominate and confirm will remain with the Government.  It is not the dramatic change outlined by the Taoiseach.  I suggest Mr. Ryan, the former Minister, went much further by giving authority to a committee to make an appointment.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might consider whether the committees of the House should share the responsibility for appointing members to semi-State bodies.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">As the Deputy stated, he is not interested in the Punch and Judy business of the past.  I am concerned about making changes that will apply in the future.  I am not giving committees absolute authority to make appointments but the opportunity to discuss policy with the person proposed by the relevant Minister or the Cabinet as chairperson of the relevant organisation or agency.  That is a big change which goes across the board, and not just in the unique circumstances in which the former Minister, former Deputy Eamon Ryan, made his decision.  This opens opportunities for people who believe they have the qualifications and experience necessary to give public service to the country in the relevant organisation or agency to appear before the Oireachtas committee and discuss not only what they bring to the table but also the Government policy in that particular area.  If the committee finds that the person before it is grossly incompetent, the responsible Minister and the Cabinet would have to take cognisance of that.  However, the way this is structured means that only people with the qualifications, experience and competence would express an interest in the first place.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_31">Given that the policy and the parameters of any State agency are set by the Government and the Oireachtas in legislation, it does not fall within the remit of a new chairperson to dramatically change them.  What one will be examining is the competence, qualifications and the capacity of the person to chair a board.  In that instance, given the majority the Government has in the House and will have on the committees, there is a grave danger that we will get what amounts to a rubber-stamping exercise, unless more teeth are given to committee members and the committees of the House in terms of the actual appointments.  Second, is it just the chairperson who will have to appear before Oireachtas committees and any other appointees will not?  I understood from the Taoiseach's reply that it is only chairpersons.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">I do not believe there should be Oireachtas hearings for the casual filling of vacancies on boards that might not rank in the top three in the order of priority.  The chairperson has the fundamental function of chairing the relevant body or agency and to steer it in the direction, in so far as the committee is concerned, of the relevant element of Government policy.  I am anxious to see how this will operate in practice.  I would like to see the first two dozen cases go before the relevant committees, see how they get on, the reaction and how the process works.  It is a change that does not transfer absolute authority to the committees but there is a clear inference that somebody appearing before a committee, following nomination by a Minister or the Cabinet to be a chairperson of an organisation or agency, had better have the qualifications, competence and experience to chair the board of the organisation or agency in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">The Taoiseach will agree that the committees already have the right to talk to the chairperson of a State agency and, indeed, they frequently do so.  I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider the idea, even on a pilot basis in the case of some State agencies, of sharing the authority with committees of the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">The difference is that previously there was a one line announcement to the newspapers that person X was appointed as the chair of a board, agency or organisation.  The relevant committee had no function at all, other than to welcome the new arrival as the chairperson.  In the case of these chairpersons, the Minister or the Cabinet will make a nomination, the person will appear before the Oireachtas committee, explain what they bring to the board, how they see the future policy evolving and discuss that with the members of the committee.  That is a big change.  If the person appearing before the committee falls down on that job, the Minister and the Cabinet would obviously have to take cognisance of it.  It would be unwise to disregard it.</p>

If the Taoiseach is serious with regard to the new system he proposes, why did the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food rush to make appointments to and to promote people within Bord na gCon?  Rather than the somewhat narrow process he proposes, does the Taoiseach not agree that a far more wide-ranging and democratic process involving the users of the services of State boards should be put in place?  Does he also agree that there should be a much more proactive role for the workers who supply those services?</p>

In the context of some of the outrageous appointments made by the previous Administration — during the general election campaign and on polling day — and in light of what the Taoiseach said about the competency of people appointed to positions on State boards, does the Government have the power to revoke or cancel such appointments or to re-interview those who were appointed?  Most of the appointments to which I refer involved people who support Fianna Fáil and who would probably be opposed to the Government parties.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if these appointments can be revoked or cancelled or if those who were appointed — who were selected because they are friends of the Fianna Fáil Party — can be interviewed again to establish the nature of their competency and qualifications?</p>

Will the proposals regarding reform of the process relating to appointments to State boards extend to dealing with the outrageous salaries paid to executives on such boards?  These individuals are being paid hundreds of thousands of euro at a time when workers are being asked to take savage pay cuts.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">In addition to the reform of the appointments process, will there be a greater level of accountability to the public and to this House with regard to the policies pursued by and activities of the executives and boards of State companies?  Many of these individuals appear to be a law unto themselves and are able to do whatever they like.  We do not seem to be able to obtain accurate information on their actions and the policies they pursue, and we are not in a position to influence those actions and policies.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">Even the Deputy will understand that there is a difference between what will happen in the future and what occurred in the past.  It is clear that there is at least serious intent on our part — and a demonstration thereof — to allow the Oireachtas committees bring before them those who will be nominated to hold positions as chairpersons of State boards and companies.  That is a good development.  The relevant committees will hold public hearings but these will not be interrogative in the same way as US congressional hearings.  However, nominees will be in a position to outline what they can bring to the organisations to which it is proposed to appoint them.  The members of the committees will then be able to question these individuals on both the level of competency and the range of experience they possess.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">In respect of the question on appointments during the election period made by the outgoing Government, I have been advised that it would probably not be worth trying to go down a legal route to remove people who have been appointed.  It could happen where an organisation was being abolished and some quangos will be abolished following analysis by the Government.  The Minister for Health and Children asked board members of the HSE to stand down voluntarily because the structure of the entire organisation was being changed, but this is a slightly different circumstance.  There is no need for Deputy Shane Ross to be suspicious.  The position is as he points out but not in fact.  If an advertisement appears for a position, a number of people express an interest in it and the Minister and the Cabinet find that the range of competencies or experience is not available, they are entitled to move away from the list of those who expressed an interest.  Such nominees have to be nominated by the Minister and approved by the Cabinet after going through the process of appearing before an Oireachtas committee.</p>

Accountability for State and semi-State organisations is part of the Government's focus on the comprehensive spending review.  For years, long before Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett came here, when the Minister for Finance allocated money to a Minister, a Department or an agency, there was never a real analysis of what went on, other than an examination by the Committee of Public Accounts following the making of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which would take place a few years later.  We will now have a real analysis of how the money is being spent to ensure value for money is being achieved, see whether it is worthwhile continuing with a programme or increasing the relevance of another.

            <p eId="para_59">The programme for Government commits the Government to establishing a constitutional convention to consider comprehensive constitutional reform and report on the following matters: the review of the Dáil electoral system; reducing the term of office of the President from seven years to five; provision for same sex marriage; broadening the reference in the Constitution to the role of women in the home to one which recognises the role of the parent in the home; removing blasphemy from the Constitution; the possible reduction of the voting age; and other relevant constitutional amendments that may be recommended by the convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_60">The convention will be expected to report within 12 months of its establishment.  Work has commenced on the preparation of detailed proposals for its establishment and when ready, these will be considered by the Government.  They will address matters such as the structure, composition and terms of reference of the convention, as well as the basis on which it will be established.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">The Government is committed to holding a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad as soon as practicable.  As a first step, it will be necessary to clarify which articles of the Constitution will need to be deleted or amended in the context of abolishing the Seanad and to consider the possible implications of any such deletions or amendments.  These matters are being considered in consultation with the Attorney General prior to the preparation of the heads of a Bill for submission to the Government.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_62">I welcome the proposal in the programme for Government for a constitutional convention.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to the House that the convention's remit will be wide enough to allow for a real debate about radical reform of the Dáil and its relationship with the Government?</p>
            <p eId="para_63">The Taoiseach mentioned reform of the electoral system.  Does that mean merely a reduction in the number of Dáil Deputies or real reform of the electoral system, for instance, moving to a different system such as a single-seat STV system?  Are these issues up for consideration?</p>
            <p eId="para_64">In essence, the convention is to consider reforms to the Dáil and the Government which should be implemented at the same time as the abolition of the Seanad.  We want real reform here, not merely superficial and shallow reform.  We want substantive reform of the way the House does business, of how it is elected, of the relationship between the Parliament and the Executive, and right across the board.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the remit of the convention will be wide enough to encompass that?</p>
            <p eId="para_65">Will the Taoiseach ensure, given it is to report within 12 months from its date of establishment, that immediate consultation takes place between all of the political parties in the House on the nature of the convention and the legislative basis for it?  This is substantive work which should involve all Members of the House in putting a proposition such as this to the people.  Rather than merely presenting a Bill as a <i>fait accompli</i>, perhaps it would be wise to facilitate all-party consultation and discussion on the legislation that will underpin the establishment of the constitutional convention.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">I agree with that last comment.  I do not see why we cannot have a proper discussion about that when it is in the interests of the country and the House and those who are elected and will be elected here in the future, and I am amenable to that.</p>
            <p eId="para_67">The terms of reference will be broad enough to encompass all of these matters.  I hope the constitutional convention will be a more focused and more engaging process than, for instance, the forum on Europe turned out to be when people might have lost interest for one reason or another.  It will include all of those issues Deputy Martin raised about the electoral system such as the relevance of the number of Oireachtas Members elected, but I hope we can deal effectively with changes in respect of the House and the running of the House and the Members of the House.  I have asked the Whip to engage with other whips as an initial point here.  I would like to have real change brought about in the way the Oireachtas and the Houses do their business so that for the session following the summer recess changes are implemented.  Between now and the recess, sometime towards the end of July, I hope we will hold a series of inter-party discussions with the people on a range of proposals on how to change this House, make it more relevant, more challenging, more engaging and more efficient and professional in the interests of the work that people must do.  I know that Deputy Martin and, I hope, everybody else will participate fully in those discussions so that we can make the place relevant for the people whom we serve.</p>

            <p eId="para_68">How does the Government propose to define the composition of the convention?  I have heard various suggested comments, in terms of one third experts, one third the public via a jury system and one third Members of the Oireachtas.  Will the Taoiseach give serious consideration to ensuring that elected public representatives are given a substantive input into the work of the convention not merely at the level of the Oireachtas but at local authority level, and that councillors, perhaps on a representative basis, will have the opportunity to participate in a convention of this kind as well?  In all of the debate on reform of the Constitution there tends to be a theme emerging that the last to be consulted will be those who are directly elected by the people.  The experience of representatives directly elected by the people is a valuable input that needs to be acknowledged and recognised for what it is notwithstanding the need for change and the need for reform and a new type of politics.</p>
            <p eId="para_69">I am interested in getting greater clarity on how Seán Citizen is to be nominated to a convention of this kind.  Has the Taoiseach thought that matter through yet?</p>

            <p eId="para_70">I have not decided on the nature of the make up of the composition yet.  As Deputy Martin will recall from being a Minister from many years, one of the weaknesses of social partnership was that the last people to be informed of the decision were Oireachtas Members.  I do not envisage this would be the case with the constitutional convention.  It will have an inclusivity which will allow elected Members of the Dáil, Seanad and local authorities and ordinary citizens to have their say.  This can be a fundamental platform for the future, leading a democratic drive to make politics transparent, accountable and relevant to the people.  I have no fixed view on the fractions or percentages mentioned; I do not know from where they came.  Suffice it to say I would like to see the convention being inclusive and representing an opportunity for Seán Citizen — to whom the Deputy referred — being represented and being able to play his part, and that it would move throughout the country in the same way as the Forum on Europe and give everybody an opportunity, physically at meetings and also by the use of new communication methods, to voice their opinions.  The convention would report within 12 months on the range of topics given to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_71">I am not any the wiser about the constitutional convention.  I understand the Taoiseach is figuring his way through its composition.  Will he assure us that the convention will be all-Ireland in nature?  This is a matter we have raised previously.  It would be ludicrous to discuss current or future constitutional arrangements and provisions for the country if we were to approach them in a partitionist manner.  As the Taoiseach works out the fractions and percentages, will he ensure that Síle Citizen gets equal billing with Seán, and that youth is considered?  All other stakeholders such as NGOs and various community interests should also be involved because for this to be a dynamic process it has to be genuinely inclusive.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">On the matter of the Seanad, and I am conscious that we are here today just as the election has concluded, nobody with an ounce of wit could defend the current arrangements whereby it is elected by an elite group of Deputies, councillors and third level graduates — although not all of them — and that it is then in the Taoiseach's gift to appoint 11 Members.</p>
            <p eId="para_73">It is the Taoiseach's position to abolish the second Chamber.  We contend that before proceeding to that we need a discussion and debate on the value of a second Chamber.  I understand with such a large majority as that which the Taoiseach commands in this House, he may see it as useful to dispense with the second Chamber.  I do not think he should proceed in haste.  Will we have a debate on the merits of a second Chamber, albeit a radically reformed and functioning one?  When the time comes for the referendum, will the people be given that option or does the Taoiseach propose to simply put the bald proposition that the Seanad as it is currently constituted be abolished?</p>

            <p eId="para_74">As Deputy McDonald knows, all referendums end up with a "Yes" or "No" question, and voter is asked to put an "X" beside the box of his or her choice.  The difficulty in framing the question is always with regard to the consequence of the changes that occur in the Constitution.  I have made clear for some time that the Attorney General is working on a range of Articles which need to be either removed or amended.  To give effect to any referendum one must produce legislation which allows for debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">Deputy McDonald's party has had a number of Senators elected and it may not want it to fade away too quickly to give them a chance.  Perhaps that is what Deputy McDonald is at.  For quite a long time, my view has been that in terms of comprehensive analysis of legislation our current bicameral structure is no longer suited for its purpose.  It is my view this House, as the directly elected forum of the people, will be able to perform a thorough and comprehensive analysis of legislation if the circumstances are changed, which is my intention.  Legislation will be introduced to give effect to the proposal to abolish Seanad Éireann and there will be ample opportunity for the citizens to discuss it.  At the end of the day, it will be the choice of the people.  We can change the nature of our work in terms of drafting legislation, sending heads of Bills to committees at a much earlier stage, the process of committee work and the calling of groups, agencies and citizens before powerful legislative committees.  Review clauses can be built into Bills in order to examine their effectiveness in the 12 or 18 months after they are enacted.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">Seanad Éireann has never been an Upper House.  It has been a second House and second Houses tend to replicate the work of the first House.  It has acted as a brake in many ways.  The work currently under way will be reported on as we proceed to draft the legislation necessary to give effect to that question.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">Given that the Taoiseach's party also had several Members returned to the Seanad, we are not alone in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_78">It may prove extremely short-sighted to decide that, because the Seanad has been a disaster as it is currently constituted and misused, we should use the blunt instrument of abolishing it.  A more considered approach is required, including a public debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">In regard to the Taoiseach's comment on referendums, the practice in this State has been to put a single question which seeks a "Yes" or "No" answer but there is no reason that cannot be modified.  Other jurisdictions make use of preferendums and other mechanisms and I ask him to consider such alternatives.  I would also like to hear his response in regard to a constitutional convention which is all-Ireland in nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">In regard to the 11 appointments he can make to the Seanad, we spoke earlier about stuffing State boards and I assume in this era of political reform and transparency that he does not propose to stuff the Seanad with hacks or friends of the Fine Gael Party or, for that matter, the Labour Party.</p>

            <p eId="para_82">I will give consideration to including a northern connection in the constitutional convention.  That is an important issue and, as I previously stated, the convention will be as inclusive as I can make it.  As Deputy Martin noted, it will have broad terms of reference and I hope it can complete its work within 12 months and that Deputy McDonald will participate in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">In so far as the Taoiseach's nominees to the Seanad are concerned, the Deputy will have to wait until the Seanad convenes to find out who has been appointed.</p>

        <b>    Deputy Michael McGrath</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
             in view of his previous comments that Ireland’s debt position could become unsustainable and in view of all the economic data currently available to him, if he believes Ireland’s debt position is sustainable going forward; the growth forecasts for the next number of years on which he is basing his view; and if the National Treasury Management Agency has advised him on the matter of Ireland’s debt sustainability.    
        [9750/11]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_52">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_85">The State's debt burden has increased substantially over the last number of years as a result of the significant deterioration in our public finances, owing to the economic downturn and the significant level of State support provided to the banking sector.  A gross general Government debt level of €148 billion or 96% of GDP, as it is estimated to have been at the end of 2010, is very high and requires our ongoing, close attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">Both the nominal level of the debt and the debt to GDP ratio are forecast to increase further in the coming years, albeit at reducing levels as we will have to continue to borrow to fill the gap between revenue and spending.  In addition, economic growth remains relatively subdued.  The stability programme update, laid before the House and submitted to the European Commission last Friday, forecasts that the debt to GDP ratio will peak at 118% in 2013 before declining in the following two years to 111% by 2015.  These forecasts are based on my Department's macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts and the advice of the National Treasury Management Agency regarding the debt.  The stability programme update also forecasts GDP growth of 0.75% in 2011, rising to 2.5% in 2012.  For the period 2013 to 2015, GDP is expected to grow by 3% per annum on average.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">The trajectory for the debt ratio depends on the relationship between economic growth, the interest rates applying to the Government debt and the level of budgetary adjustment implemented by Government.  However, there is no one rule that says that if one's debt is above a particular level, it is unmanageable.  A key determinant in the stabilisation of the debt ratio will be the narrowing of the gap that currently exists between revenues and expenditure through further fiscal consolidation.  Coupled with the implementation of policy measures that will assist in boosting economic growth, a primary surplus is forecast to emerge, that is, an excess of revenues over expenditure excluding interest expenditure.  This is scheduled to happen by 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">A further measure which may be referenced in forming a judgment on whether a particular level of debt is sustainable is the proportion of tax revenues that must go towards servicing the debt.  Based on the stability programme update projections, it is estimated that around 15% of tax revenues will be required to service the interest on the State's national debt this year.  By 2015 almost 21% of our total tax revenues will be required for that purpose.  This is undoubtedly a very significant level, but it is worth bearing in mind that it is well below the ratios experienced in the mid-1980s when around one third of the tax revenues generated in the State went towards servicing the interest on the national debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">As the NTMA is the agency tasked with the management of the State's borrowing needs, I and my officials have naturally been in close contact with them regarding our debt position.  The NTMA is in constant contact with market participants and their view on the market perception regarding sovereign Irish debt is a crucial input into our deliberations as it is the markets' assessment of our position which will ultimately determine the rate at which we can borrow.  The agency's view is the same as ours at present, namely, that Ireland's debt position is very large and has grown rapidly in recent years but if we continue to pursue the right policies, it is sustainable.  However, debt sustainability is not a black and white issue and we must do everything in our power to ensure that as much as possible the balance of the arguments reinforces this assessment.  This underlines the reason we must continue to deliver on our commitment to fiscal consolidation, pursue policies that underpin growth and seek to achieve measures that alleviate the cost of our debt burden.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">The stability programme update published last Friday made for sobering reading, particularly with the reduction in the growth forecast for the current year down by a full per cent to 0.8%.  We all accept that growth is the key issue regarding debt sustainability but my question is whether the Department of Finance is still being overly optimistic.  While it has reduced  significantly the forecast for 2011, it predicts GDP growth of 2.5% for 2012, which is higher than any of the other bodies, including the domestic bodies, the ESRI and the Central Bank.  The IMF and the European Commission indicate it will be 1.9% next year; we are basing our figures on 2.5%.  For the following three years, 2013, 2014 and 2015, we are factoring in growth of 3% which we all hope we achieve and even out-perform but even on the figures we have factored in, as the Minister has acknowledged, the debt to GDP ratio will be 118% in 2013.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_56" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_93">The Deputy is correct that the level of growth in the economy is a very important component of whether the debt continues to be manageable but equally important is the size of the debt and the interest rate charged on the debt.  It is a combination of three inputs.</p>
            <p eId="para_94">On the growth rates projected in the stability programme update put before the Houses of the Oireachtas last Friday, the Deputy will have to remember that it is on the estimate of his Government's budget that the adjustments have been made.  The previous figures were those brought before the House by my predecessor in January when the budget was introduced.  A number of things have happened since.  First, at that stage only €10 billion was pencilled in arising from the stress tests and that has now gone up to €24 billion.  As well as that, events in North Africa have pushed up the price of oil, and interest rates internationally are tending upwards.  Various factors are now coming through, therefore.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">It is true to say that the Department of Finance is slightly ahead of the projections of the European Commission and the IMF but the IMF took a €35 billion injection into recapitalisation of the banks and the EU Commission took a €25 billion investment into the recapitalisation of the banks when they were working out their figures.  I said previously when launching the initiative on the banks, and much to the amusement of some of our learned people in the media, that growth is not a static figure.  Sometimes people talk about growth as if it was fixed and that nothing could be done about it.  Obviously, Government policies influence growth as well and I suggest to the Deputy that the policies we are pursuing now will have an influence on growth going forward.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_57">
            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_96">As the Minister has indicated, the projection is that by 2015 the national debt interest repayments will account for 21% of tax revenue but that tax revenue figure is based on a figure which is 27% higher than the 2011 tax revenues.  If that transpires to be more optimistic than the reality, the amount of the tax revenue going in interest repayments will far exceed 21%; it could be 25% or even more.  While we have to plan on the basis of the figures the Department has produced, based on experience and track record we must also prepare for a less optimistic scenario.  Has the NTMA advised on that?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_58" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_97">The Deputy is correct.  All these matters are estimates and projections, and they are the best possible estimate based on the facts, but things are changing rapidly.  Things are changing rapidly internationally and therefore it is not possible to predict; but to get back to the Deputy's original question on sustainability, I believe our position is now sustainable.  Some people make false comparisons with Greece.  The figures the Deputy has quoted seeing the debt peaking out in 2013 at 118%.  The equivalent figure for Greece is157%, and that is before its more recent crisis, and it is tending upwards all the time.  We are not in the same category as Greece.  We are not in the same category as Portugal, and people who talk about sustainability should remember that we are going into surplus on the balance of payments and any country that has a balance of payments surplus is not insolvent when the whole figure is taken together.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">We are giving the Deputy the best figures available.  We will continue to give him the fullest possible information but we will also point out to him the assumptions on which they are based and as the assumptions vary, things change.  For example, the fiscal figures for April, which were published yesterday evening or today, would show that the tax profile is beyond the Deputy's budget estimate for December and expenditure is below the budget estimate for expenditure.  Therefore, for the first four months of the year things are better than on track and we hope that continues for the rest of the year but it does vary and we will not have any degree of certainty until we get the June figures.  It will be early July, therefore, before I would be firm on figures but so far so good.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_59" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_100">The Central Bank of Ireland published the findings of its review of remuneration policies and practices in a number of Irish retail banks on its website on 1 December 2010.  The review assessed whether banks have changed how they remunerate employees, particularly those in senior executive positions, to reflect incoming regulatory standards and the lessons of the financial crisis.  In particular, it examined if banks have ended remuneration practices which fostered inappropriate risk taking or inadequate risk management.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">The review found that while the majority of banks have started to reform their remuneration policies and practices, the balance of the Central Bank's findings were discouraging.  For example, there is little evidence that banks have self-consciously made a link between their risk appetite and their incentive structures exposing the banks and, by extension the State, to the consequences of inappropriate risk taking; the governance and oversight of remuneration practices is poor; and in the majority of banks, procedures to determine remuneration are not clear, well documented or internally transparent.  There was little evidence of consideration of risk or collaboration with risk management functions to ensure remuneration policies are aligned with long-term strategic plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">Issues identified in the review are being followed up individually with institutions by the Central Bank.  Detailed EU requirements on remuneration policies in credit institutions have come into force in Irish law since 1 January 2011 through amendments made in the capital requirements directive.  These obligations are supplemented by extensive guidelines issued by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, which is now known as the European Banking Authority, compliance with which will be closely monitored by the Central Bank of Ireland in assessing adherence with each institution's legal responsibilities.  Enforcement action can be taken by the Central Bank in the case of non-compliance.  These measures will address the significant issues disclosed in the Central Bank's review of remuneration policies and practices which were also highlighted as significant contributors to Ireland's banking crisis in the recent Nyberg report.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">Notwithstanding these developments, recent disclosures regarding payments made to the former managing director of AIB highlight the serious weaknesses that continue to exist in relation to remuneration policies in the covered institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">Following a request from my Department, the National Treasury Management Agency, which has legal responsibility for managing the State's shareholder relationship with the banks, has recently written to the covered institutions requesting that they undertake a review of remuneration practice, that they have further discussion with the Department of Finance ahead of any commitment to additional redundancy payments and that the bank does not commit to further termination payments until the review is completed.  An analysis of severance entitlements has also being requested.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_60">
            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
            <p eId="para_105">People across the country were livid when they read in the newspapers that Colm Doherty was to receive a €3 million golden handshake.  The Minister himself stated that it is his intention to replace all board directors who were appointed prior to 2008.  I put a question on this earlier but the Minister did not deal with it.  Has the Minister got a grip on this issue?  As regards those officials whose contracts he plans to terminate prematurely, has he examined the assessment of remuneration and golden handshakes to which they will be entitled?  How much will the State have to pay off under those contracts?  What is the position concerning public interest directors in those banks?  One of the public interest directors who was there when the package for Colm Doherty was signed up to, is a prominent member of one of the Government parties.  Does the Minister agree with his colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, who told the recent annual meeting of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, that bankers who caused huge losses, brought banks to the point of collapse and almost bankrupted the State, should not be rewarded?  He also said that there was such a fundamental breach of contract that they should not be entitled to the rewards they are seeking.  Is that the Minister for Finance's position?  Does he believe that there will be no more golden handshakes?</p>
            <p eId="para_106">On bankers' remuneration, we know there is a cap of €500,000 for senior bank officials.  How is it then that the CEO of Anglo Irish Bank, Mike Aynsley, received €474,000 in 2010 above that cap, bringing him total earnings of €974,000?  What is the Minister prepared to do about that in future?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_61" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_107">The Deputy has put many questions together, but they are all legitimate and fair.  The former CEO of AIB had been discharged by the bank and received his severance package in November 2010 in the lifetime of the previous Government, so there was nothing this Government could do about it.  We have done our best to find out the full facts of how the remuneration package was built up.  While I have some of the facts, I cannot assure the House that I have the full facts at the moment.  For example, even though my predecessor showed the House that the cap on Mr. Doherty's salary was €500,000 at the time, there was also a separate stream of income contributing to his annual income.  That arose from the fact that in his previous position in the bank he had exceeded his pension pot.  The agreement made with him was that, rather than a stream of money being put into a pension fund which was already at full benefit, the stream was given to him by way of secondary income.  That continued even though my predecessor assured the House that his maximum salary was €500,000 — which, of course, it was — but he was silent on the other stream of income which in effect was treated by the Revenue Commissioners as a second salary.  It was taxed and PRSI was paid on it in the normal way.  When it came to computing his severance package, there were obvious difficulties.  I am not convinced that I have the full picture.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">Another issue which arose was that the gentleman had a long and satisfactory service in the bank.  As the Deputy knows, the position historically with bank employees was that they would retire at 60 years of age.  When he was made CEO of the bank his contract was not time limited, so when he ceased to be CEO his expectation as a long-time bank official was that he could continue to 60 years of age.  As a consequence, he had certain rights in terms of remuneration up to 60 years of age, so the package became very large.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">I have announced that I want a director and management renewal programme from each of the covered institutions.  I also want information about salaries, remuneration, severance packages and everything else.  To be quite frank, I cannot give the Deputy assurances that there are not legal problems in restricting severance packages.  When I get the information I will decide what approach to take.  My position in principle, however, is that the amount of money paid to the former CEO of AIB was an absolute disgrace.  It undermines any concept of social solidarity that — when we are asking the poorest people to contribute and are telling them that everybody should contribute — somebody walks away with €3.5 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_112">I already put that question.  Does the Minister agree with his ministerial colleague, Deputy Shatter, that these bankers are in such fundamental breach of contract as not to be entitled to the rewards they are seeking?  Let us forget about the previous Minister for Finance, because the current Minister is now in charge.  Will he ensure that they will not get those type of golden handshakes when he replaces them, as he has stated again on the floor of the House?  He has said that he will replace all directors who were appointed prior to 2008.</p>

I am examining various approaches.  If one follows the Deputy's initial remarks to their logical conclusion, concerning those who blatantly do not fulfil their contracts, then there is an argument to be made that they should be subject to dismissal rather than reasonable retirement.  I intend to explore that area also.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">In April of 2009, the then Minister for Finance asked the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector to undertake a fresh review of top level public service pay, to take account of the changed budgetary and economic circumstances, the changed private sector pay environment, and to compare pay against that of other countries of comparable scale, particularly in the eurozone.  The report was published in December of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">Previously, the review body completed its last general review of top public service pay in September of 2007, but relevant increases recommended by that review were never implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">As a result of its 2009 examination of top level public service pay, the review body report of 11 December 2009 recommended reductions in pay varying from 8% to 15% generally.  It also recommended that there be no increases in the pay of the higher public service groups, including any adjustments that might otherwise arise under national agreements before the end of 2012.  For Secretaries General, the review group recommended a reduction of 15% for level 1 Secretaries General, that is, Secretaries General of the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance.  The Secretaries General concerned volunteered to accept a reduction of 20%.  This resulted in a reduction in the salary of the Secretary General in the Department of Finance from €285,341 to €228,466 — a decrease of €56,875.  This salary of €228,466 was the same as the salary for the Taoiseach.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">Upon receipt of the December 2009 review body report, the Government decided to introduce a new reduced pay rate for Secretaries General, level 2, appointed after 1 July 2010 to align with the then salary of a Minister.  This level applies to the Secretary General, public service management division in the Department of the Finance.  This resulted in a 15% reduction in salary from €253,635 to €215,590 — a decrease of €38,045.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_132">It should be noted that the Secretary General in the Department of Finance and the Secretary General, Public Service Management Division in the Department of the Finance both accepted a further voluntary reduction in their salaries, by way of a gift back to the Minister for Finance.  This voluntary reduction reduces these salaries to €214,187 which is in line with other existing staff at the Secretary General, level 2, in other Departments.  In order to provide an appropriate differential between levels, the Secretary General level 3 rate was also adjusted downwards for new appointees from the same date.  This salary level, which applies to the grades of second secretary in the Department of Finance, was also reduced by 15% from €221,929 to €188,640 — a decrease of €33,289.  The Department of public expenditure and reform is currently examining the salary levels of certain Civil Service grades.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">Expenses and bonuses</p>
            <p eId="para_134">In terms of expenses, it should be noted that the only expenses payable to the officials covered by the Deputy's question cover work-related travel and subsistence, or recoupment of certain other expenses on a vouched basis.  The information in this regard for travel and subsistence of relevant officials in the Department of Finance and the newly established Department of public expenditure and reform, over a three year period, are as follows:</p>

The figures the Minister read out are pretty staggering even in their reduced form.  Will he comment on the fact that officials in the Department, long regarded as the <i>crème de la crème</i> of the public service, are for some extraordinary reason paid more than other officials at the top level elsewhere in the public service?  We need a response to that, particularly given media reports over the weekend suggesting that those who had a contrarian view to the predominant view in the Department during the property boom were silenced, their concerns were kept quiet and they were told not to raise them.  Those who wished to raise them at a higher level were made to bury them and those who wanted to write articles for the newspapers had to withdraw them.  We were paying these people more for results than anybody else in the public service.</p>

The structure of the Department represents the amalgamation of three separate Departments at various stages — finance, public service and economic planning and development.  The structure also reflects the nature of the work undertaken by the Department, which is different.  The system grew up over time.  That is the position and it will change again as soon as the legislation comes in to put in place the Department of public expenditure and reform because we are dividing the Department.  However, we are dealing with many historic issues and I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that.  As long as I have been in politics, the Secretaries Generals and senior staff in the Departments of Finance and the Taoiseach have been on a higher rate of remuneration than their equivalents in other Departments.</p>

We intend announcing a jobs initiative as committed to in the programme for Government on 10 May.  I anticipate that necessary legislation to give effect to the measures outlined in the jobs initiative will be published shortly thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_169">The programme for Government sets out in broad terms the measures that will be implemented as part of this initiative.  The measures are designed to lift public morale and confidence in the economy, to provide jobs, to provide suitable job placement for unemployed persons and to encourage spending by consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_170">In terms of the specific detail, officials from my own and Deputy Howlin's Department are working closely with other Departments in preparing the proposals and assessing the quantitative and qualitative impacts.  As has been previously signalled, any costs arising in connection with the jobs initiative will have to be counterbalanced by the implementation of offsetting measures.  This will ensure that we will continue to underpin our fiscal sustainability while also bringing forward policies to assist economic growth.</p>

As was mentioned recently, when EU and IMF officials reviewed the bailout agreement, they made it clear that any initiative would have to be revenue neutral and the Minister has referred to that.  The gross costs of what is proposed are significant and I emphasise the word "gross" because we all hope the measures will be successful and that some of the gross costs will be offset by additional economic buoyancy through employment creation, which will reduce the welfare bill and increase the tax take for the State.  However, the gross costs for two of the measures that have been signalled for inclusion in the jobs initiative are significant.</p>

Those two measures alone, therefore, have a gross cost of €1.3 billion.  Hopefully the net cost will be much less but, clearly, that has to be made up.  The Taoiseach recently indicated in the House that it would be by way of adjustment to internal departmental votes, which indicates that it is all spending cuts rather than any other measures.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</p>

When we criticised the budget introduced by the Government, which Deputy McGrath supported, in December, we selected two areas for severe criticism.  First, we indicated that the budget did very little to promote job creation.  Second, we outlined that the Government was receiving the growth figure without trying to influence it.  To return to our previous discussion, it is possible through policy to change patterns of growth in an economy.  Our approach will be to create jobs to build up confidence and give growth.  I wish the Deputy's figures were correct but we do not have the resources to spend the kind of money to which he refers even over time.</p>

            <p eId="para_176">We will approach it in a fiscally neutral way.  Based on our more recent conversations, the agreement we have with the troika is that the span of the initiative is to become fiscally neutral by 2014.  That satisfies it.  We are largely talking about what was in the programme for Government.  It is a readjustment of the budgetary position to focus on job creation and to try to get more growth in the economy.  It is not a big Keynesian initiative.  The resources are not available to drive demand in the economy by huge investment.  It is just not there, so what we are trying to do is to take a situation, especially in certain sectors to see whether we can get more out of it, in terms of growth and jobs.  That is the approach.  It is morale boosting and confidence building rather than a huge spend for demand purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_179">Nominations for appointment and the actual appointments to the commission were a matter for the commission of investigation itself.  Section 8 of the 2004 Act requires the Minister to approve the proposed appointment by a commission of investigation of persons to advise or assist it in relation to any matter within its terms of reference.  In that regard, the commission wrote to the Department proposing the appointment of individuals under section 8 of the Act.  These submissions noted that sanction for the appointment of senior level investigative experts and junior level investigative experts were based on proposed maximum <i>per diem </i>rates, having regard to a number of factors, including the nature and complexity of the work to be undertaken and the short-term nature of the work.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">The amount paid to each individual varied in each case and depended on the number of days that the individual worked for the commission.  It is expected, once all accounts are closed, that the aggregate figure to be paid to the sole member of the commission and those individuals engaged under section 8 of the Act will be in the region of €889,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_181">Overall, there were 21 staff members working on the commission, including Mr. Peter Nyberg.  Five administrative staff, seconded from my Department, assisted the commission and performed back-office support for it.  The cost of these staff was borne by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">I am satisfied that the commission acted in good faith at all times in its selection of staff and that the staff selected were appropriate for the performance of its function, especially in light of the time period the commission had to complete its report.</p>

            <p eId="para_183">I thank the Minister but I am afraid he has not satisfactorily answered the question.  If I could specifically readdress the question to him, it was how the appointments were made and how the individuals were selected.  It is reasonable to ask the question about the arrival from Finland of a man to set up a 13-person commission and how he came to assemble it, particularly when one considers the composition of the commission.  What worries me is that at least eight if not ten members of the commission were current or former bankers.  When one is investigating the behaviour of bankers it seems entirely inappropriate that so many of those people assisting the investigator should also be ex-bankers themselves, whatever their pedigree.  At least two members had a history with AIB while other members came from other banks in the Irish system.  Other members of the commission were employees of the Department of Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_185">Is it satisfactory to the Minister that a majority of those people who were advising the commission, chosen, apparently, by Mr. Peter Nyberg, should be either bankers or former officials of the Department of Finance?  Is it not correct as a result that at the very least we should know how those people were chosen?  What is so unsatisfactory in the response which the Minister has given — he has been fine on the detail of the sum of €889,000 and I do not have any quarrel with that — is that we are not being told who Mr. Nyberg consulted when he decided to put so many bankers on a commission to investigate the banks.</p>

            <p eId="para_186">A total of 21 staff were working on the commission, including Mr. Nyberg himself, and there were five administrative staff from the Department.  When Mr. Nyberg first took up his position the Department of Finance assisted him in the initial preparatory work upon his arrival in this country.  Once formally established the commission recruited staff independently in accordance with the provision of section 8 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  He wished to ensure that the people who assisted him had appropriate experience to address the issues in the terms of the reference which required people with expertise in banking, finance and accounting rather than lay practitioners of goodwill.  The selection criteria included solid, practical, professional experience in banking, lending and credit, credit and risk management, asset liability management, general governance supervision, property market issues and accounting expertise.  That kind of expertise arose from the terms of reference of the commission, which was voted through in the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">One might ask why the commission did not use a competitive tendering process.  Mr. Nyberg himself decided not to pursue that route.  The reasons given were the specialist subject matter of the investigation and the functions to be performed by the individuals retained, the qualification and expertise required and the short timeframe.  Given that he was obliged to report within six months Mr. Nyberg did not wish to spend time in a competitive tender when he could decide himself whom he wanted to assist him in his investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">I do not know about Mr. Nyberg's familiarity with the country.  I do not know whether he had business and banking contacts prior to his arrival.  I met him on the day he presented his draft report to me.  He seemed to me to be a very stable kind of man who would be a person of good judgment.  That is my only experience of him.  He was very interesting in his analysis of what happened.  A lot of people said he should have named names but if he did so the work being carried out by the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda Commissioner and Mr. Paul Appleby might not have been able to proceed.  He stayed away completely from names lest he prejudice any parallel investigation that was being conducted.</p>

His reply confirms my worst suspicions that it was the Department of Finance, again, which gave Mr. Nyberg the initial advice, which brings me back to my initial question, on the appointment of people from the Department of Finance, again, to sit with him on the commission and bankers.  The Minister was not in office at the time.  Does he not find that somewhat alarming, that it is the same insiders once again sitting in judgment on other insiders?</p>

It is reasonable when a detailed investigation of banking files is being conducted that one should send in people who understand lending, risk and banking files.  If I was sent in, I would not find my way around the files and would have no idea of what was going on and if gardaí were sent in, they would take a different line of investigation.  It takes a thief to catch a thief.  Therefore, we should send in a banker if we want to investigate bankers.</p>

             the position regarding the pact for the euro agreed at the recent meeting of EU heads of State; the implications for member States in terms of their ability to decide their own economic policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_95" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_192">On 25 March the European Council adopted a package of measures to respond to the crisis, preserve financial stability and lay the ground for sustainable job creating growth.  The euro area Heads of State or Government also adopted the euro plus pact to complement these measures to further strengthen the economic pillar of EMU and achieve a new quality of economic policy co-ordination, with the objective of improving competitiveness and thereby leading to a higher degree of convergence.  Bulgaria, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania joined all of the euro area member states in adopting the pact.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">The primary focus of the euro plus pact is on areas that fall under national competence and which are of key importance in increasing competitiveness and avoiding harmful imbalances.  As pointed out by the European Council, competitiveness is essential to help the European Union grow faster and more sustainably to produce higher levels of income for its citizens and preserve member states' social models.  The pact rests on four guiding rules.  First, it will be in line with and strengthen the existing economic governance in the Union, while providing added value.  Second, it will be focused and action-oriented and will cover priority policy areas that are essential for fostering competitiveness and convergence and concentrate on actions where the competence lies with the member states.  Third, each year concrete national commitments will be undertaken by each Head of State or Government and progress will be monitored on a yearly basis.  Fourth, the pact will fully respect the integrity of the Single Market.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">In practical terms, the central element of the pact is that every year each member state will be responsible for choosing the specific policy actions that it considers are necessary to achieve the goals of fostering competitiveness, fostering employment, contributing further to the sustainability of public finances and reinforcing financial stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">The euro plus pact is a positive development for the European Union and Ireland.  We are a member of the European Union, particularly the euro area, and benefit significantly from such membership in many ways.  The Union and Ireland will benefit further from co-ordinated efforts to improve competitiveness and sustainable economic and employment growth.  While encouraging best practice and benchmarking, the pact is predicated on each member state taking ownership of and responsibility for its commitments and presenting the specific measures it will take to achieve the goals I have outlined.  That is a sensible way to proceed and will benefit us all in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_196">The Government has rightly and justifiably criticised the previous Government for its policy failures and actions which contributed to the property bubble and crash, the banking crisis and so on.  However, while the Government may be able to excuse itself from what the previous Government did, it is signing up to a pact which will be as destructive of our democratic right to control our economic policy as the IMF-EU package.  The pact, essentially, hands over control of economic policy in this and every country in the European Union to the European Commission and gives it power to decide on an annual basis what it calls "country specific" policies through which it will set out in key areas of economic policy what we must do.  We will have to do what is proposed and the Commission will impose penalties on us if we do not.  Is this not a handing over on a permanent — not just a temporary — basis of control of key economic issues?  Is it not amazing that we are doing this in a situation where the general outline of the economic priorities set out in the euro pact perpetuates the same failed economic doctrine that led to the financial crisis in Europe — a constant obsession with what Mr. Nyberg rightly called in his report the "naive belief in the efficiency of markets"?   It is still all about us being forced to accept the efficiency of markets model to dictate what happens to the economy, which means austerity, cutbacks and privatisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_197">I do not think the Deputy and I will have a fruitful interchange because our philosophical positions are diametrically opposed.  The European Union is good.  In general I agree with the policies being pursued and believe the future of our citizens lies in being at the heart of the European Union.  I am not alone in thinking this.  The Deputy will have noticed that when the socialist experiment failed in eastern Europe, everybody there queued quickly to join the European Union.  They have now all joined.  The same is happening in North Africa where we have the Arab spring and democracy is breaking out at long last in Arab states.  The secondary objective is to have democratic governments and join the European Union or have trade relationships with it as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_198">I do not agree with the premise that underpins the Deputy's question.  The objectives I set out are ones to which we should subscribe because they are the route back to full employment, economic growth and a good lifestyle for the people.</p>

            <p eId="para_199">I supported the revolution that led to the overthrow of the dictatorships in eastern Europe and support the democratic revolutions in the Arab world.  It is precisely because of my commitment to democracy that I am worried about the pact for the euro, on which the Minister has not responded.  This is not about his view of my ideological position but about whether there is a recognition on his part or on that of the European Union of the key responsibility for a particular economic philosophy that let the banks to run riot and cause the economic crisis.  It is not me who is saying this but Mr. Nyberg who said the financial crisis resulted substantially from the naive belief in the efficiency of markets.  Why are we signing up to a pact that will lock in and copperfasten the naive belief in the efficiency of markets to the economic perspective of the European Union and which will force us, regardless of what the Government or the people think, to subscribe to that doctrine, particularly given its role in causing the financial crisis?</p>

            <p eId="para_200">The Minister has said the Government supports the pact for the euro.  Does he support wholeheartedly the pact which states the European Commission will impose financial sanctions on member states which cannot meet the debt to GDP ratio?  Has he asked his Department to carry out any risk assessment of the cost to the State if we cannot meet the targets set under the pact?  Under the pact debt sustainability will be monitored and if it is recognised that a country is not on the pathway to debt sustainability, creditors will be engaged with.  Twelve days ago the Minister rightly was bullish when Irish sovereign debt yields — the Irish sovereign debt ten year bonds — were starting to decrease.  However, he must acknowledge that the percentage figure is now at 10.4% or 10.5%.  It is higher than it ever was.  The markets are telling us that we are on a collision course with debt unsustainability.  Should we not look at the pact and seek to have our debt renegotiated now, instead of waiting to post the date set down in the pact?  Has the Minister carried out that assessment of the financial sections?</p>

It wants to foster competitiveness; I see nothing wrong with that from a citizen's point of view or from the economy's point of view.

            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
            <p eId="para_209">As the Deputy will be aware, under the terms of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008, domestic credit institutions benefiting from the State guarantee were required at the direction of the Minister for Finance to appoint up to two non-executive directors to promote the public interest.  The legal position is that any director appointed to the board of the covered institutions, whether under the CIFS scheme or otherwise, is subject to the requirements of company law in the discharge of his or her responsibilities as a company director.  As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself.  These are the director's so-called fiduciary responsibilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_210">I understand that in addition to their other experiences, the public interest directors currently on the boards of the covered institutions were nominated by my predecessor on the basis of the Minister's assessment of their civic mindedness and sense of where the public interest lies to inform their view of what was in the institution's interest.  I am advised that the Department of Finance held generic briefing sessions on the CIFS scheme in general and on the fiduciary duties of non-executive directors for individuals on the panel from which the covered institutions appointed public interest directors but that there was no job description or scope of work set out for them as this, as I have outlined, was determined under company law.  In addition, for this reason public interest directors did not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or to the Department of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_211">In light of the foregoing and the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances that those institutions have received huge financial support from the State, it is essential to bring legal clarity not just to the role of the public interest directors but to that of the entire boards of those institutions.  Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act, therefore, provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act.  As Minister for Finance, I am strongly committed to ensuring that the boards of the covered institutions act at all times in a manner fully consistent with key public interest objectives for the banking sector.  This will be a major element of my assessment of the board renewal programme that I have recently sought from the covered institutions.</p>

            <p eId="para_213">Will these public interest directors be reviewed in the same way that the other bank directors will be reviewed?  The Minister should at least call them in and ask them to be held accountable.  As the Minister said their primary interest is the public interest.

No, because it would be inappropriate for me to do so.  They do not report to the Minister for Finance or to the Department of Finance.  Their responsibility under company law is to the institution on whose board they serve.  I work with these covered institutions through the chairpersons of the boards and that is my point of contact.

            <p eId="para_221">My predecessor appointed all the public interest directors and he had the same relationship with them as I have.  Their job under company law is to bear in mind the interest of the institution on whose boards they serve.  That is their priority, but there is no reporting back.  When they are considering a particular issue at board level, as well as making the decision in the interest of the bank they are obliged to ask what would be in the interest of the public.  However, they are not subject to direction from the Minister or the Department on that.  They are independent, as are all directors in accordance with company law.  That is their fiduciary position.</p>
            <p eId="para_222">Deputy Doherty's very legitimately asked how long the directors would remain in place and what is the situation for appointments.  First, I will seek a renewal programme from each of the chairpersons and I have asked in the first instance to bring that up to the night of the infamous guarantee in 2008.  That will be one part of it.  The regulator, Mr. Elderfield, is writing or has written to all directors and effectively advised them that he will adjudicate on their suitability to be directors based on their knowledge of banking and financial affairs.  That process will terminate in January 2012.  What I am doing takes it up to 2008 and what he is doing takes it into the area of the new directors.  We will wait to see what happens.</p>
            <p eId="para_223">With the exception of Bank of Ireland, the State is now the majority shareholder in all the other banks.  As majority shareholder, I can instruct how shareholders vote at the annual general meeting.  If all else fails, I can refuse to exercise the voting rights of the shares to put any director back in place at the AGM.</p>

          <p eId="para_229">The Taoiseach will be aware of the latest data showing manufacturing activity continues to grow and has just reached its second highest level in 11 years.  At the same time, the enterprise agencies are reporting a very strong pipeline of investment projects, some of which have already been announced.  Following the practice of his predecessor, will the Taoiseach use his visit to New York to talk to important members of the business community about Ireland's economic message?  Given the strength of inward investment and the support American companies have shown for Ireland in recent months and years, it is clear they already know Ireland is open for business.  Of critical concern to those companies in terms of job creation are the question of corporation tax and the broader issue of the harmonisation of taxes across the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Given the clarity of the policy on corporation tax, the rate of which is accepted at this stage, will the Taoiseach use his visit tomorrow to state clearly Ireland will not accept any proposals on the tax base that would have the effect of increasing the taxes payable by companies that have invested here and which are investing here?  Will he ascertain the latest position on President Obama's Administration's tax policy on US multinationals' overseas activities?</p>

          <p eId="para_231">The Deputy states the obvious in stating exports have been running at a surplus for 21 months and that the interest in investment in this country is still exceptionally high.  I heard first-hand evidence of this when speaking to a significant number of business interests in Washington during St. Patrick's week, as did the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, in New York.  It is indicative of the fact that countries are in a position to buy products coming from Ireland.  I stated previously that Intel, one of the leading companies in the world, is currently spending €0.5 billion on expanding its plant in Leixlip to be in a position to compete for the next wave of fabrication investment.  This will have a direct spin-off effect on Irish industries capable of meeting the very stringent demands associated with elements of the service industry in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The Deputy is aware that the European Commission has legal responsibility to produce legislation.  The legislation on the common consolidated corporate tax base has been produced and Ireland will obviously participate in the discussions, albeit against a background of healthy scepticism suggesting a common base would be bad not only for Ireland but also for Europe.  I will make my case based on that fact.  The Deputy, as a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, is aware, as am I, of what this means for Ireland.  It would represent a massive breach of trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">I raised the question of the US Administration's view on taxation when I was in Washington.  While I cannot speak for President Obama's Administration or the Republican Party, I do not see this as being a priority for either.  The view that Ireland is some kind of tax haven has been dealt with, including by the former Government, and cleared up a number of years ago.  This is still the position.</p>

          <p eId="para_234">Over the past week, Ministers appear to have been sent out daily to brief journalists on the likely contents of the forthcoming jobs initiative.  In fairness, the programme for Government did promise a new approach to discussing budgets before publication.  This is well under way.  The Taoiseach admitted that the Government had over-hyped the jobs budget promised in a wide range of pre-election documents.  We were led to believe a definite economic stimulus would be provided when the Government entered office but it is now to be a revenue-neutral initiative.  It appears from what can be read from the spin of ministerial leaks that a number of the specific initiatives to be announced next week involve renouncing and rebranding initiatives that are already under way.  For example, the smart grid strategic research cluster——</p>

          <p eId="para_237">It is perfectly obvious that jobs, job creation and an injection of confidence into the indigenous economy must be and are a priority of the Government.  That is why the jobs initiative will be announced by the Minister for Finance in the House on Tuesday, 10 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Given that the rate of unemployment is over 14% and that 440,000 are on the live register, we have tried, within the constraints imposed on the country through the IMF-EU deal, to provide an incentive, encouragement and a boost of confidence for employers to hire new workers and expand their businesses, and the elements that will allow this to happen.  I have been surprised at the range of ideas — some were very workable and credible and others were not — that have been flooding in from various sectors throughout the country.  The Minister for Finance will give the full details on the jobs initiative to the House next Tuesday and we will have an opportunity to discuss it.  I make no bones about the fact that it will not sort out Ireland's unemployment problem overnight.  The intention is to provide, within the existing constraints, confidence that will stimulate interest, growth, jobs and opportunities in the economy.  All the details will be available next Tuesday.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">I am sure the Taoiseach will join me in commending the emergency services whose members spent last weekend fighting gorse fires that threatened farmland and family homes.  I have no doubt their sterling work has saved lives.  It is ironic that we see such work being done at a time when the public sector and public servants are under threat from the Taoiseach's Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The Taoiseach mentioned the growth in exports.  The Department of Finance, in its latest economic update for the European Commission, states starkly the Government has achieved a growth rate as near to zero as one could get.  The unemployment rate is at crisis point, as the Taoiseach concedes, and the domestic economy is in a mess.  We still pump expensive money into Anglo Irish Bank.  Although the writing is on the wall and it is now very apparent the austerity approach is not working and will not work, the Government refuses to wake up and smell the coffee.  The Taoiseach now tells us there will be a jobs initiative.  The language being used in respect of the budget is interesting; we are told it will be fiscally neutral, or revenue neutral, and that there will also be counterbalancing measures to give it life.  Will the Taoiseach shed some light on this?  How does he propose to invest in a serious jobs strategy?  What cutbacks or taxation increases does he envisage to facilitate the jobs initiative?  If the Taoiseach wishes to talk about confidence and morale in the country, will he at some point consider that the economic strategy of cutbacks and deflation, so ably passed into his hands by the previous Administration, has not worked and will not?</p>

          <p eId="para_241">I am sure the Deputy will join me in condemning what appears to be deliberate arson attacks by a person or persons unknown in various locations throughout the country.  Vegetation was destroyed as a result of the frost last winter and the current dry weather, so with the strong breeze these fires have become quite dangerous.  I spoke to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and he was in constant touch with the emergency officer in the Department and with the fire officers and emergency services in the counties affected.  I commend the work of all involved in the emergency services, particularly on evacuating people to safety from houses in Donegal.  I also commend the farming community for lending equipment such as slurry tanks and so forth to assist in putting out the fires.  The emergency services also assisted with helicopters.  In Ireland, people are accustomed to praying for fine weather or for rain according to the seasons.  The rain that is threatened for the weekend might well be a benefit in quenching the fires that continue to burn at higher levels on our mountains.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">The jobs initiative will be introduced by the Minister for Finance in the Dáil next Tuesday.  It will be fiscally neutral.  At a time such as this I would love to be in a position to reel out to the nation the benefit of what could be spent of the €3 billion commitment arising from the promissory note to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS, for each of the next ten years, but that is the situation we are in.  Given that constraint on the Government, the Minister for Finance will introduce a jobs initiative that will be fiscally neutral.  He will point out how adjustments and payments can be made for the initiative.  I hope that in the ensuing debate Members will dwell on the reality, and not theory, of what we can actually do.  I hope the package being put together will bring about an understanding of our current position and the truth of the scale of the problem, but within that the opportunity for providing careers and employment, for taking on new workers and for retraining.  All these areas will be covered in the Minister's statement on Tuesday and the House will have the opportunity to debate it in due course.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">In that reality, of course, the decision to pump those billions into Anglo Irish Bank, which the Taoiseach has supported, is not fiscally neutral.  The Taoiseach said adjustments will be made.  I discern from this that we face further cutbacks in order to give life to this jobs initiative.  Can he confirm that?  The Taoiseach appears to be hiding behind language.  When all the evidence suggests that the deflationary cutback model has failed and not proved to be a remedy for our unemployment problem, it is ironic that the Taoiseach would seek to introduce a jobs initiative based on that same deflationary approach.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_244">I would not get carried away with what the Deputy discerns from my words.  A total of €6 billion is being taken out of the economy in 2011 and obviously that is not all about growth and productivity.  This is the first Government in the history of the State to initiate a serious, comprehensive analysis of how taxpayers' money is spent.  That will conclude in September, when the Government and the people will know the true scale of the analysis.  We are pursuing the elimination of waste, duplication and triplication.  There has been allocations of money and nobody knows where it went; we are having difficulty tracing it.  There are huge amounts in some Departments.  All of this must be dealt with as it is important in the context of the Government and the Minister for Finance looking at the bigger picture and examining the efficiency of spending at the conclusion of the review in September.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The situation in which the country finds itself is challenging, but not hopeless.  As a public representative I meet people throughout the country and they have a yearning to get through this recession.  However, they want the truth about the scale of the reality we face so the Government can sort it out, and they are willing to help in that provided their contribution is recognised and is fair.  When the Minister for Finance outlines the jobs initiative on Tuesday, the Government intends to stimulate the indigenous economy so it can complement what is happening in the export sector, where productivity is high and exports have been running a surplus for 21 months.  The first semblance of external confidence is in that sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">It is not the way one would wish to be in Government but that is the challenge we have accepted.  We will meet it and overcome it by working with our people to come through this with a much leaner, more efficient process of doing business in Ireland.  That message must be conveyed throughout the world for the benefit of everybody, both at home and abroad.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">I congratulate the Taoiseach on the marriage last Friday of one of his Ministers of State, who is seated behind him, to a Member of the Upper House.  I hope she will not have any divided loyalties when she is obliged to vote for the abolition by referendum of the House of which her husband is a Member.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The second congratulations I wish to extend to the Taoiseach is on a serious matter.  I congratulate him on what occurred during the recess when he met the Chief Justice, who presumably had come to request something of him.  He was sent off with a referendum in his pocket.  That was most welcome.  It was appropriate that the Taoiseach should address that issue by promising a referendum on the position of the Judiciary and why judges have such a special position of privilege in the Constitution, particularly in view of their salaries.  In view of the commendable reform he has announced regarding State appointments, although he has not gone nearly far enough, I ask the Taoiseach to follow up on that by examining more seriously the appointment of members of the Judiciary.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Appointment to the Judiciary is another area that is blatantly political.  I do not know if Members of the House know how judges are appointed but the judicial advisory board, which is stuffed with political appointees, makes recommendations to the Government on the appointment of all members of the Judiciary.</p>

When the rainbow coalition was in government several years ago, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was established to bring some form of process into being.  The appointment of judges is an extremely serious matter, particularly in the context of their independence from the Executive and in light of the job with which they are charged.

In the context of the future of the Seanad, this is a call with which I strongly agree.  Having established the Global Irish Network in the aftermath of the Farmleigh summit, I am of the view that one of our greatest competitive advantages is our diaspora.

Deputy Martin will recall that when former Senator Jim Higgins was to retire from the Seanad on his election to Europe, he wanted to do so on the basis that his position would go to someone representing the diaspora.  The difficulty was that the groups and organisations which represent the diaspora did not appear to be able to agree on a suitable person for nomination.  It is obvious that complications would arise if an individual put forward to represent the diaspora lived in Auckland or Melbourne.  This is a matter which warrants consideration.

It is ridiculous that we are due to make statements on a document that has not yet been published.  Others elsewhere have had sight of this document but the House has not.  I previously inquired of the Taoiseach in respect of this matter, particularly in the context of the publication of the memorandum of understanding.  I put it to him that he is asking the House to take statements on a document which Members have not seen.  That does not make sense.

On my recent visit to England, I had the opportunity to visit Cricklewood and Kilburn.  While there, I met those involved with the Safe Start Foundation and with the centre for the homeless in Cricklewood.  I also met many of the former Irish navvies who are now resident at the centre.

          <p eId="para_325">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to make a statement on suicide prevention.  There simply is not enough time in the five minutes allowed to speakers to go over all the specifics and complexity of this immense issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Suicide is an area of great interest to me, as it is to many others in this Chamber who will know of someone or a friend of someone who has committed suicide.  Unfortunately, a friend of mine with whom I lived in college and with whom I studied for four years took his own life only 12 months ago.  All that his family and friends are left with are questions.  Could anything have been done?  Did they miss something and did they ever ask him how things were going?  The question can be asked: is this story sad?  It is, and, unfortunately, it is becoming all too familiar.  I fear that we are beginning to treat suicide as merely another problem in the country.  Trying to find a solution to such a massive problem is not easy and we should not think it is.  The time has come for meaningful effort to solve this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">In recent years, I have noted that the number of suicides here is often compared to the number of lives lost on the roads.  Both are tragic occurrences, both destroy families and communities, and yet the way we react to each is very different.  If someone is killed in a road accident, the story will almost certainly be carried that evening on the news, the area will be sealed off and there will be a detailed investigation into why the accident happened and how we can make the scene of the accident saver to ensure an accident does not happen again.  However, when a suicide happens, there is an outpouring of grief over a few days and weeks, and then the commotion dies down. The family, friends and community are left to pick up the pieces and the total number of suicides has gone up by one.  Instead of going on about statistics and figures over the next few minutes, I would rather concentrate on the ways in which we may be able to start to solve this terrible problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">At this point I compliment and thank the groups and individuals who continue to work on this area, many in a voluntary capacity and on extremely low funding, without whose help and support this problem would probably be a great deal worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Before being elected to this Dáil, I was a youth worker for four years with Foróige, which is the national youth organisation.  In the role, I worked with young people from many different backgrounds, but all of whom faced the same challenges.  Youth mental health was a challenge that came up repeatedly.  This also included the areas of self-harm and potential suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">In that time, I became aware of two excellent services that I believe are going a long way to help solve the issues of youth mental ill health.  The first is the big brother big sister programme with is a mentoring programme which partners a young person with a volunteer for up to a year.  This opportunity allows the young person to meet once a week with someone in a friendly and safe environment.  It allows that young person an opportunity to bring up any issues he or she may be going through, express himself or herself to someone from outside the family, but to enjoy himself or herself.  This programme is becoming popular, but, more importantly, has a proven track record in helping build the confidence of a young person and his or her self-esteem.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">Jigsaw is a service which was set up in Galway in 2008 and is a collaboration between Headstrong, the HSE and Mental Health Ireland.  It is aimed at prevention and trying to alleviate the many issues before they become problems.  It is run in a professional manner with excellent staff.  This service was established when it became obvious that youth mental health has needed its own department for many years.  It allows people to drop in for a chat and when they arrive, they are met by friendly staff who are equipped to deal with whatever issues they may have.  The Jigsaw service is about listening.  It is about find out where a young person is at, but, more importantly, to where he or she wants to go.  It understands the concerns of young people in areas such as school or college; work or unemployment; family, friends and other relationships; sexuality and sexual activity; and maybe drugs and alcohol abuse.  The areas I have described cover the areas of youth mental health but, unfortunately, as we all know, mental health issues affect persons of all ages and backgrounds.  I welcome the developments of late that have brought this area away from the old style of thinking and that, for instance, better premises are being built that correctly highlight the importance of this problem, but also that someone who suffers from mental health issues is seen not as a burden on the State, rather as someone who is simply looking for help.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">Finding a solution to this problem will not be easy for many reasons.  It is complex and difficult.  Sitting on our hands waiting for another report will not solve the problem.  We must use every possible tool at our disposal to help solve it.  I believe in a community-based approach, involving local community groups, youth groups, the GAA and any kind of youth club, to help combat the problem of suicide.  This country has the people who have the skills and capacity to help in this area, but they need help to organise properly.  They also need funding to make them effective.  The one thing parties from all sides of the House can do is show that the Thirty-First Dáil is serious about helping to combat the problem of suicide in our communities.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michelle Mulherin</from>
          <p eId="para_333">There is a terrible sense of isolation in rural Ireland, especially in Connacht, and this is reflected in the high rates of people taking there own lives, which is now compounded by the added stress and despair caused by the recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">Since prevention is the title and point of this discussion, I commend the work and initiative of self-help groups addressing the question of social inclusion and I urge the Minister to prioritise and invest in the formation of more such groups, which create networks of support for vulnerable individuals.  I am familiar with the work of such groups in my town, such as Ballina Migrant Health Forum and The Dolmen Clubhouse, which seek to bridge the gap between the vulnerable and professionals.  The emphasis is on getting those affected to appropriate professional help where necessary and creating a platform for various care professionals to help train and inform local members.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I congratulate all those proactive groups around the country, many of which are born from the loss of a loved one where family and friends choose to make a stand in combating this malaise which does not discriminate across social classes.  All is not lost.  Aside from professional views of suicide, there is always personal loss.  It takes many deaths before we become aware of what death really means.  Someone said that while it ends a life, it does not destroy the relationship we had with that life — a father remains a father and a brother remains a brother, and the same applies to a sister, a friend, a lover and so on.  They take something of us from the earth.  So the questions as to why and the multitude of reasons given by professionals who try to make sense of the psychology of it, and by priests on the spirituality underpinning the dreadful decision that brings an individual to this very lonely and dark place, for this is an act that invariably takes place in secret — perhaps we all know this place to a certain degree — helps to comfort those left behind but it never diminishes the loss.  To those left behind, we absolve them from guilt; to those contemplating it, we say, "Reach out and talk to someone".  For my own part, my office will always welcome anyone  seeking help.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_200">
          <from>Deputy Seán Kyne</from>
          <p eId="para_336">I am grateful to be afforded the opportunity to address the House on such an important issue.  There is not a Member of this House who has not been affected by suicide or other mental health issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Since the House discussed this issue two weeks ago, 25 more people in Ireland have taken their own lives.  This is the statistical rate at which people in Ireland are succumbing to the scourge of suicide and is based on the 2009 figure, which showed that 527 people died by suicide.  That figure was a staggering 25% increase on that of the previous year for the number of people who died by suicide, and yet it was only the "recorded" figure.  Experts believe the actual suicide figure is much higher.  It is quite clear that the recession and the economic difficulties are having a direct negative impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Only today 1life, the suicide helpline, revealed that it received more than 700 calls over the Easter week and that half of these were callers presenting with serious suicidal thoughts.  As shocking as the statistics are, they hide the fact that each case of suicide reverberates throughout a community where families, neighbours, colleagues and friends must endure the horrendous pain the loss of a loved-one in this manner brings.  Of all the questions with which family and friends are left, the primary ones are: why? Why did he or she do it, and why did I not see it coming?  However, there are no easy answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">Undoubtedly, the financial crisis and its effects have played a part.  Unemployment, unpaid bills and unmanageable debts all place enormous strain and pressure on people, with, in some cases, tragic and fatal consequences.  Loneliness and isolation are also factors which affect a lot of older citizens, particularly in more rural and remote locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">One figure which particularly concerns me is the number of our young people, particularly young men, who take their own lives and again, we must ask why.  Bullying, discrimination and abuse are just some of the reasons which drive our young people to self-harm or to take their own lives.  Teenagers have many pressures in their lives, such as exam pressure, career worries, peer pressure to fit in or to rebel and issues of how they think they appear to others.  It is well documented that some people are more vulnerable than others, such as gay and lesbian people many of whom have to contend with discrimination, prejudice and abuse, both mental and physical, in our towns, villages and rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">In the United States, it was a succession of several teen suicides among lesbian and gay school students last year which prompted the "It Gets Better" campaign to reach out to gay and lesbian young people via YouTube and social networking and assured them they are neither alone nor without support.  Such a campaign highlights why the Civil Partnership Act, as incomplete at it is, is extraordinarily important in sending out a positive message to Ireland's young gay and lesbian people.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend GLEN, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, and other organisations whose efforts and work were so crucial in securing this significant step towards full equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">We are very fortunate to have a strong network of community and voluntary organisations in Ireland which provide support and comfort to people suffering as well as focus and direction for Government and policy-makers.  Numerous organisations work in the area of suicide prevention and mental health.  Some, such as the National Office for Suicide Prevention and Headstrong, the National Centre for Youth Mental Health, are statutory organisations.  Many more are non-governmental organisations or community groups such as Aware, Console, Shine and 3TS.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">In my constituency of Galway West, as Deputy Connaughton stated Jigsaw is a wonderful organisation which is a support service for young people.  It is a partnership between Headstrong, the HSE and Mental Health Ireland which has been providing support and information via its drop-in service in Galway City since 2008 and recently moved to larger premises.  It is imperative that every community in Ireland has access to such a service which, l am in no doubt, can save lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">Given the constraints on funding, it is more important than ever that we work together to combat the problem of suicide.  I urge greater co-operation, and more sharing of resources and tasks to achieve what are common goals.  As a people, we must ask ourselves what is the point of fixing the banks and the economy if so many of our people are suffering.  We must prioritise the needs of our people.  We must all remember that it costs absolutely nothing to be supportive, to listen, to be compassionate and to be there for family and friends who are suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The old Irish phrase, ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine, is as relevant today as it ever has been, and with that in mind, I will take this opportunity to ask the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that mental health funding be protected and directed towards primary mental health care where it is most needed, which is in the community.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusKirk" eId="spk_201">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk</from>
          <p eId="para_346">I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on this most important of subjects.  It has come into public focus and debate in a much sharper way in recent years for very obvious reasons.  Suicide is not someone else's problem, it is everybody's problem.  An individual dies but the whole community suffers.  A loss of life affects all strands of the community.  Effective action is needed to approach the stigma of suicide and, in turn, help people become more aware of suicide and its impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">In 2009, there were 527 deaths by suicide, and 527 families and communities all felt the huge loss which suicide brought to the area.  This is a major issue which needs to be dealt with.  The more support networks we have, the better the chance for people to talk about how they are feeling and the more lives will be saved.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention is responsible for overseeing the implementation of Reach Out: A National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014.  The main vision of Reach Out is of a society where life is valued across all age groups, where the young learn from and are strengthened by the experience of others and the needs of those going through a hard time are met in a caring way.  Reach Out calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour, in order to foster co-operation between health,education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">In the most recent budget an additional €1 million was provided for the programme for 2011 which will enable the office to build on initiatives to date and bring momentum and new impetus to their activities.  The areas to be targeted are developing both the number and range of training and awareness programmes, including the ASIST programme, to reach the most vulnerable in our communities; improving and standardising the response to deliberate self-harm presentations; developing the capacity of primary care to respond to suicidal behaviour and considering new models of response; and ensuring that helpline supports for those in emotional distress are co-ordinated and widely publicised.  In each of these four areas an emphasis will be placed on the most vulnerable groups identified in Reach Out and more recent research.  The details of these initiatives will be discussed and agreed with the office.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">An initiative established by the former Minister of State, John Moloney, is See Change, run in co-ordination with the national stigma reduction campaign.  The aims of See Change are to reduce the stigma associated with mental health problems and challenge discrimination in society; create an environment where people are more open and positive in their attitudes and behaviour towards mental health; promote a greater understanding and acceptance of and support for people with mental health problems; and empower individual people with experience of mental health problems to gain equality, respect and rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The total funding for mental health in 2010 was approximately €970 million.  Innovation funding of €3 million was provide to Genio through the HSE to support the transition from institutional to person-centred care.  A further €5 million will be provided for Jigsaw, an innovative community-based support service for young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">When in government, Fianna Fáil established the office for mental health and disability.  Special consideration was given in the budget to the mental health and disability sectors, which will ensure a maximum reduction of only 1.8% in the 2011 allocation for the sectors.  The relatively lower reduction, compared to that in other health sectors, was an indication of the priority which the then Minister for State, John Moloney, afforded to this most important area.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">It goes without saying that in areas of economic or health problems, research programmes are vital to finding longer-term solutions to many of the issues, and those affected have varying levels of mental health issues.  The Minister of State will bear in mind the importance and necessity of ensuring co-ordination at European level between research programmes here and those under way in other member states.  Perhaps such co-ordination and availability of information will give hope to those who live night and day with mental health issues and the threat and worry of suicide that a solution may be found, if not in all cases at least in a percentage of them.  At this point in time, we could ask whether stem cell research holds out any prospect of better days ahead for the families unfortunately affected and afflicted by mental health issues and the threat of suicide.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaraConway" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Deputy Ciara Conway</from>
          <p eId="para_354">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le muintir Phort Láirge as an tacaíocht a fuair mé i rith an toghcháin.  I have not had an opportunity to thank the people of Waterford as my maiden speech was on the very important matter of the nomination of the Taoiseach, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their support.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I welcome this opportunity to speak on this matter and it is with mixed emotions that I do so.  Suicide is every family's worst nightmare and traditionally it is rarely discussed.  The public attitude towards mental health and suicide must change if we are to be able to provide for those who need help and for people to be able to accept help.  One in four people in Ireland have a mental health difficulty, which is an alarming statistic, making it an issue of national importance.  Since my involvement with Labour Youth and as I moved through the ranks in Dáil na nÓg, I have always spoken out on this issue.  I have attempted to shine a light on an issue which has been allowed to stay hidden in the shadows for far too long.  I saw first-hand in my work as a child protection social worker and later in my work with Barnardos how suicide and mental health issues affect not only an individual but entire families, particularly children.  It is welcome that €35 million has been ring-fenced in the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services, such as psychologists and counsellors in primary care teams throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The programme for Government states: "We will endeavour to end the practice of placing children and adolescents in adult psychiatric wards."  I have been outspoken on this issue for several years.  There are no services for children between the ages of 16 and 18 because they fall through the net of services for children and adults.  This is a barbaric practice which needs to be addressed immediately.  The problems caused by the admission of young people to adult mental health wards were such that a report was commissioned by the Mental Health Commission in 2010 to investigate the inappropriate care of young people aged between 16 to 18 and examine the factors contributing to their admission to adult wards.  Alarmingly, in the first six months of 2010 the young people who were admitted to adult approved centres included 11 children aged 15 or younger.  In some cases, the children concerned did not even have mental health problems and would have been more appropriately cared for by social services.  A young person should only in exceptional circumstances be considered for admission to an adult psychiatric ward.  The report identified confusion within the psychiatric community in regard to who is best placed to look after young people with mental health problems, particularly those aged 16 and 17 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The State's mental health watchdog has expressed concern about the occupation of scarce beds in child and adult mental health wards by patients who do not have mental health disorders.  What is happening at present is akin to the practice of the past whereby people were inappropriately placed in institutions.  This practice needs to be discontinued.  Young people without diagnosable mental health disorders or with social problems have reportedly been admitted to child and adolescent units simply because there is nowhere else for them to go.  This is a terrible indictment of our system but I am heartened by the new Minister for Health and Children and hope he will work in partnership with the Minister for State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to address this issue as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">The children who are admitted to psychiatric wards are among the most vulnerable people in our society.  Greater investment is needed in community resources if we are to address this problem.  We have to invest in the mental health of our young people and think outside the box in terms of acting to prevent these problems from arising.  The problem will not be solved by individual Ministers because it requires co-operation from the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Skills and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  By pooling their resources, they can ensure the social and emotional needs of our young people are put to the fore over the lifetime of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">Many of the speakers during this debate have focused their remarks on adults but if we are to prevent suicide we need to be proactive in investing in children from the age of three.  A study commissioned in America in the 1970s, the Perry preschool project, invested in young children between the age of three and five and followed them until they were in their 40s to find out how the investment paid off.  The quantitative and qualitative evidence from that study has categorically shown that the investments made an improvement in the lives of the individuals concerned.  Every euro invested in young children provided a saving of €16 later on.  Social scientists in America often base their work on the objective of keeping people out of prison and in this House we have been discussing community service orders over the past several weeks.  If we invest in quality preschool programmes that address the social and emotional development needs of young children alongside the services required to address their concerns as they grow up, they will be given the language they need to seek help and we will no longer have to deal with an unfortunate group of people who on reaching adulthood find themselves in such despair that they chose to take their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">I have the courage of my convictions on this issue and the statistics are available to support my argument.  We have an opportunity to think differently about mental health.  I am keenly aware from my work in the community and voluntary sector over the past ten years that we need to get the most that we can out of the money we are given.  I appeal to all the Ministers involved in this area to push for quality and evidence based programmes that deliver happier and healthier outcomes for our children and young people.  If we invest in the happiness and health of young people, they become more productive workers and people.  The US study indicated that people who received preschool investment went on to be more productive members of their communities, had better relationships in adulthood and were less likely to engage in anti-social behaviour and crime.  If by investing early we can prevent young people from reaching a dark place, it is a no-brainer that we should endeavour to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Given that I also worked in mental health services during my time in social services, it would be remiss of me not to state that some of our most committed people work in this area.  People who have mental health difficulties deserve to be treated in palaces and given the best of services.  They should not be locked away in the dungeons I visited while I worked in mental health services.  We need to open the doors of community services to our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">I ask the Ministers concerned to think outside the box by investing in our young children and ensuring they grow up to be happy, capable and productive members of society.</p>

        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin</from>
          <p eId="para_363">I welcome the opportunity to speak on suicide prevention.  Members on all sides of the House made many excellent contributions on the issue and I will endeavour not to repeat points which were previously raised.  I will focus on younger children, how this society is failing to protect their mental health and what we must change to ensure we intervene at the earliest opportunity to protect the most vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">This country has returned to the days of high unemployment, mass emigration and social despair.  The most tragic by-product is the increasing rate of suicide.  This tragedy is not confined to any particular class or corner of the island but is affecting rich and poor, old and young, male and female.  In 2009, the rate of people taking their own lives increased by a startling 24%.  These are people who see no way out of the despair they feel, whether because of negative equity, addiction issues, unemployment, discrimination or depression.  They took their lives because they could see no hope for their future.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">We can address this national emergency by creating a better society that provides people with the best of services, education, social protection and health care.  However, what about the children who are the victims of circumstances beyond their control and are growing up in households ridden by despair?  They are fragile, impressionable, easily corruptible and can be permanently damaged by the environment in which they live.  What interventions are available to us to care for delicate minds or childhoods filled with nights in which heated words are exchanged by financially crucified adults so close to the brink that they see no way out?</p>
          <p eId="para_366">What about children who live in areas where the only viable economic activity is the drugs trade?  Older siblings get sucked into a hopeless spiral of street corner loitering and low-level anti-social behaviour and often on to full-scale membership of violent gangs, incentivised by easy money, street credibility and a perverse sense of empowerment.  Communities such as these are rarely understood, chronically under resourced and frequently stigmatised with outlandish generalisations by media outlets.  If we accept that it takes a village to raise a child, is it any wonder that children of such a village will grow up with a poor sense of self-esteem, negative self-image and feel totally disempowered and disconnected from the mainstream of Irish society?</p>
          <p eId="para_367">Our education system is charged with the responsibility of identifying, diagnosing and treating children who display a variety of emotional behaviour disorders.  As currently constituted, the system outrageously misplaces resources in a manner that inevitably benefits children from middle-income backgrounds and not those more in need.  Our education supports for those most in need of help are misplaced and poorly structured.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">This happens in two main ways.  First, the allocation of resource teachers is based on the general allocation model introduced by the previous Government, which allocates teachers on the basis of the school enrolment number and not on the basis of need.  As a result, children who attend schools with a smaller enrolment do not receive the same level of support irrespective of the level of need.  This is a crude, blunt and indeed cruel arrangement that must be amended to ensure that our most vulnerable children are supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Second, in the allocation of resource hours sanctioned by the special educational needs organiser, SENO, schools with access to private psychological or clinical assessments receive more resource hours.  Those who depend solely on the under-resourced National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, receive fewer.  School leaders, teachers and school principals are left in an almost impossible position when attempting to provide supports for children who present with specialised care needs.  They have to juggle referral forms and representations to the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, NEPS, agencies such as the Mater Child Guidance Clinic, the relevant social worker, the home school community liaison service and, if they are fortunate, supportive parents.  I have been the principal on the telephone to agencies being told that the child is not suicidal and that I am wasting my time.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">If a parent or parents prove obstructive or difficult, the school is powerless to proceed.  This is just one more glaring example of why our children's rights referendum is so sorely needed.  Our children now live in a society that is at breaking point, in a culture that shortens childhood to maximise corporate profit, in a country that purports to cherish every child equally, but only punishes our vulnerable rather than liberating them.  We must liberate our children from the dark clouds that hang over their minds.  We must empower them with the ability to express their feelings, to understand their circumstances and encourage them to believe that they truly are more powerful than they could ever contemplate.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">We cannot fail them at the earliest stage, the stage when they depend on us the most.  The risk of internalising the hurt permanently is too great, and the potential of becoming another suicide statistic too real.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnHalligan" eId="spk_204">
          <from>Deputy John Halligan</from>
          <p eId="para_372">I propose to share time with Deputy Clare Daly.  Sometimes we are damned with statistics when they are put in front of us but statistics are important on the serious issue of the severity of suicide in Ireland.  The latest statistics show we have the highest recorded rate in our history.  This amounted to 527 deaths in 2009, representing an increase of over 4%.  Anecdotal evidence suggests the figures in Ireland continue to rise.  Some 127 deaths from suicide were registered with the CSO in the second quarter of 2010 and the increase is mainly in men in the middle age category.  Many experts throughout Europe have said there is a sharp rise in people taking their own lives and self-harming over the past year and that this is linked to the recession.  The term recession depression has emerged.  International research indicates that during an economic downturn, suicide numbers increase markedly.  Since the economic crisis occurred in Ireland, there is a clear spike in deaths among people between 25 and 44 years of age.  Social welfare cuts, cuts to invalidity pensions and disability payments hit the vulnerable sections of society disproportionately.  The incidence of suicide is at its highest in these sections.  As mayor of Waterford, I addressed a conference in Waterford on taking the stigma out of mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The statistics were startling, showing that between 300,000 and 400,000 people were presenting with problems, from mild to medium to severe depression and many of those presenting to a general practitioner felt suicidal at one stage.  In Ireland, suicide has become the principal cause of death of men between the age of 15 and 34.  Ireland now has the fourth highest rate of suicide among young men in the EU, behind Lithuania, Finland and Estonia.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Successive Governments have displayed a distinct lack of urgency in dealing with this problem.  The budget in 2010 was €5.6 million, which is a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed.  The HSE moratorium on recruitment had a devastating impact on an overstretched health service.  Over 700 members of staff left mental health care services from 2009 and only 65 were replaced.  That had a major impact on the suicide rate.  Incredibly, more lives are lost to suicide than to road tragedies.  However, the budget to reduce road traffic deaths is almost eight times the budget dealing with suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The Government and Opposition parties should examine a case study.  Scotland had one of the highest rates of suicide but has managed to reduce significantly the number of people taking their own lives by spending €25 million on preventative services.  This shows that resources and allocating money into prevention can reduce the number of people taking their lives.  Scotland has been internationally recognised for its "Choose Life" programme and the education and awareness programme called "see me".  It is internationally recognised that Scotland was able to reduce a high rate of suicide.  Statistics from Scotland show that 600 people took their lives last year, of whom 450 were men.  This was reduced by 87, which is almost a quarter.  This is attributed to the resources and services available.  Officers trained to deal with suicide intervention have been employed in every local authority in Scotland.  They reduced the suicide rate and the number of people presenting themselves with mental health problems.  This has reduced the amount spent on health and mental health services and the prevention of suicide in Scotland.  The budget can be reduced because the death rate and the number of people presenting with mental health problems is reducing.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The causes of suicide are multifaceted and complex.  Some argue it is a fundamental human right to take one's own life.  That is a worthwhile debate.  However, for most people, suicide is not chosen; it happens when pain exceeds resources for coping with pain.  These are not my words, although I would like them to have been.  This is a matter of resources.  I urge the Government to examine the case history of Scotland.  A small amount of money out of a substantial budget has helped to reduce the suicide rate.  I passionately urge the Government to deal with this point.  Let us consider the number of people dying from suicide compared to road accidents, given the amount of money spent.  It is only right that we should put substantial amounts of money towards reducing the number of deaths on our roads but if we put half the amount of money into suicide prevention, going by the Scottish example, we could at least reduce the number of deaths by one third.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_205">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_377">I want to make some brief remarks.  Like other Deputies I, too, appreciate the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  It is appropriate that the House has spent so much time on it because a discussion must take place in society and awareness be raised about these issues.  That is important, but the discussion must be purposeful and have an outcome.  In that sense, regarding some of the remarks made by some of the Government spokespersons in particular, cognisance should be taken of the fact that they are the Deputies who are in power.  It is their Government that has the ability to implement measures which can make the difference in terms of dealing with some of these issues which have blighted so many lives and which are a growing problem in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The point was made during the debate about the way road traffic deaths are treated and the funding that is allocated to that area compared to the lack of funding for suicide prevention, given that suicide results in many more deaths than those from road traffic accidents.  That is true.  It is the case that advice and investment in trying to reduce road traffic accidents has developed here, and we must do something similar in regard to suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Removing the stigma is important.  There is a value even in discussing the issues.  That is important, but it must be linked to the overall position of funding from a number of aspects.  Mental health is an area that must be invested in and the question of overall funding must be dealt with because it is inadequate.  There must be implementation of A Vision for Change.  There must be a development of community-based services but to be honest, we must not laud an expenditure of €35 million as being enough.  It is not nearly enough.  It is hardly five euro per person.  We need resources to back up the services that are necessary but the reality is that we are moving in the opposite direction.  The implementation of severe cutbacks in health, education, social welfare, public sector recruitment and so on will succeed in having a negative impact on dealing with the current suicide problems.  It is not good enough to just talk about the problem.  We must implement measures that assist in dealing with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">It is obvious that suicide is a growing problem in Ireland.  That the only dedicated suicide helpline does not get any funding is a poor indication of our approach.  That organisation takes thousands of calls every month.  On average, it takes 100 calls a day.  It is an indication of the scale of desperation people are experiencing that 100 people make the call.  How many more hundreds are thinking about it but do not know that the resources are available or that they can access them?  Promoting these helplines and the resources available, albeit limited, is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">There is no doubt that the rising suicide figures are linked to the economic downturn and the devastation being experienced by many people throughout this country.  As Deputy Halligan said, this is not just a problem of mental health.  For many people suicide is a rational decision on the part of the people who make it.  The scale of their problems, be it some personal catastrophe or a severe economic crisis which they see no way out of, leads them to believe that is the only way out for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The cases of suicide among taxi drivers was well highlighted by the taxi drivers' unions.  Many taxi drivers took their own lives because economically they were pauperised as a result of decisions that were made including the freeing up of licences.  These people were on the road from morning to evening without being able to eke out any sort of a wage for themselves or their families.  The problem of their mortgages was getting on top of them, and if they give back their taxi plate they are not entitled to any social welfare payment because they were self-employed.  That is severe pressure to put on anybody's shoulder.  They cannot see a way out because we have not given them a way out, and economic policies have not been put in place which deliver for those people a standard of living that enables them to keep a roof over their heads and provide for their families.  Unless we address these issues we will have a continuation of the problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The key problem is for the people left behind after suicide and the questions people ask such as "What could I have done?  Could I have intervened if I had known the severity of the problems?  Was there something I could have done that would have made a difference in terms of the decision the person made to take their own life?".  We must avoid the situation where those questions have to be asked.  Everybody needs to know where they can access the support that is available.  The problem is that there is not enough support available and people do not know about the support that is available.  If this debate assists in that regard, it is welcome but it is not enough on its own.  There must be a massive investment in education and in personal development for our young people in the existing health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Crucially, this debate is linked to the overall economic position facing ordinary people because as a result of the policies being pursued and the fact that taxpayers' money is being poured in to bail out the banks and so on, our services are being cut and people's livelihoods being devastated.  Unless we invest in people's social, personal and overall economic well-being, we will be returning to these issues and finding that the position has not altered at all, rather worsened.</p>

          <from>Deputy Simon Harris</from>
          <p eId="para_387">I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on her appointment.  I have not had an opportunity to do so to date.  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate on proposals to tackle suicide levels within our society.  I take great encouragement from the scheduling of this debate which shows the intention of those on all sides of this House to prioritise mental health.  I am encouraged that we are talking about suicide in terms of tackling the problem as that is exactly what we must set about doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Clare Daly on this issue.  It is not enough for us to just speak about the issue today, tick a box and say, "job done" and not return to it.  I do not believe anyone on the Government side and, I presume, on the Opposition side of the House looks at it like that.  We will certainly not shirk our responsibility on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">We cannot have a discussion on suicide without a discussion on our mental health services as a whole and the way those services are provided in a community as well as a clinical setting.  I recently met an impressive campaigner, Caroline McGuigan, who is the chief executive officer of Suicide or Survive, a charity based in Arklow, County Wicklow, in my constituency.  She had an interesting and simple way of comparing how we think about mental health to the way we consider dental care.  She asked three simple, mundane questions.  Where do we first learn about dental care?  The answer was that we learn about it in our schools.  Do we brush our teeth every day?  One would hope the answer is, "Of course".  If something happens to our dental health such as a toothache or needing a filling, are we embarrassed?  Again, the answer is "No".  These are the issues children learn about in regard to their dental health in our schools on an almost daily basis.  We teach them that it is something that must be looked after every day.  We give them the tools to look after their dental health and they know that if there is a problem or something that needs attention, it is nothing to be embarrassed about.  We must give our children from the youngest age possible in our school system the same tools to deal with their mental health.  We must get to the point where school children see mental health care as part of their development and overall schooling.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">I want to put a few points to the Minister of State for her consideration in regard to the way we will serve the mental health needs of our community.  As I know she will be aware, we must be sure that the involvement of service users is not just tokenistic.  It must be a vital part of the planning process, and anyone I talk to involved in suicide prevention or mental health groups is very keen on this idea.  Those at the coalface of our mental heath service with direct and personal knowledge of its impacts, strengths and weaknesses must be recognised as key stakeholders.  In that regard I am encouraged by the work of the See Change initiative and the support given to this group by the previous Minister of State, John Moloney, and now by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">We need transparency of funding in our mental health services.  Having served as the chairperson of my local Health Service Executive regional health forum, I am only too aware of the current difficulties in this regard.  It is imperative that we are able to work out how much this State spends on promoting positive mental health each year.  This is a huge problem and at a time when we see the HSE board being asked to stand down we must try to clear these lines of miscommunication and get to the bottom of how much this State allocates to mental health on an annual basis.  I implore the Minister of State to contact the HSE and insist that we are provided with a greater breakdown of the way mental health services are funded each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">In any case, it is clear that the annual budget for mental health services can best be described as dismal.  Nobody likes comparing one tragic cause of death to another, but as other Members of the House have said, the success of the Road Safety Authority in reducing the number of deaths on our roads highlights the impact that targeted resources can have.  Mr. Gay Byrne has proved to be a successful and highly effective chairman of the RSA's road safety campaign.  I ask the Minister of State to find a similar champion, advocate or series of advocates for the cause of mental health promotion in Ireland, thus giving a strong and coherent voice to the many stakeholders, advocacy groups and clinicians working in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">We also need to examine seriously the after-care provisions being offered to people who present themselves to our health services.  I am not referring solely to mental health services in this respect.  UK statistics indicate that up to one third of suicide deaths occur among people who have interacted with the health service in the previous 12 months.  These are people who have turned up in hospitals, in community or clinical settings, presenting with some illness, yet within 12 months they took their own lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">A successful system is currently operating in Belfast whereby people presenting at hospitals who exhibit any of the potential indicators of suicidal behaviour are immediately given a referral card.  We should examine the potential for introducing such a system here.  I encourage the Minister of State to examine the legislative perspective of this matter with a view to amending the Health Act 2004 and the Mental Health Act 2001.  Both the Green Paper in 1992 and the White Paper in 1995 recommended that any legislation must deal with outpatient services, but this is not reflected in the current legislation, which focuses on the provision of inpatient care.  I urge the Minister of State to consider this matter when the legislation is reviewed next November.  Let us bring accountability back to this House and the Minister of the day.  The HSE should set a statutory plan each year so that it is accountable to the Minister who, in turn, is accountable to this House.  We can then take political responsibility, once and for all, for mental health services in this country.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_395">At the outset, I want to congratulate you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your appointment and wish you well in that role.  I also wish to congratulate the new Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has responsibility for mental health services.  As a Deputy representing County Limerick, it would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to my constituency and party colleague, Deputy Dan Neville, for his contribution to the debate on suicide prevention.  Since his time in the Seanad, he has championed the cause of decriminalising suicide, thus destigmatising it and placing the debate on a national platform whereby people can speak openly about the subject, as we are now doing.  Great credit is due to Deputy Neville for having done that.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I want to discuss the impact of suicide on families.  There is a temptation to trivialise the issue by categorising people according to statistics, including how they died and the possible causes.  In fact, however, we will never know the reasons that most suicide victims die because in many cases they do not leave notes or other communications.  We are, therefore, left to agonise afterwards and wonder why they felt it necessary to take their own lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">According to a study by the Family Therapy Association of Ireland, mothers experience intense and prolonged grief, along with many psychological and physical symptoms, following a suicide in the family.  Several participants in the study experienced strong suicidal thoughts, while one such mother had attempted suicide herself.  The misuse of medication and alcohol was also identified by some women as a coping strategy.  Other findings of the study concerned the participants' reasons for wanting to die in order to be with their children, as well as the impact of guilt and blame on their belief system.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Unfortunately, suicide affects every community, which is why so many Deputies have participated in this debate in recent weeks.  The National Suicide Research Foundation has found a worrying trend of suicide clusters in Ireland.  A cluster is a chain of suicides by young people in a particular geographical area over a short space of time.  Experts believe that such suicide clusters are becoming more common.  In one instance, a group of 17 young adolescent men from one area committed suicide within 18 months.  The National Suicide Research Foundation has produced a report with information to map suicide in Ireland.  This is operating on a pilot basis in Cork in collaboration with the region's coroners.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Earlier in this debate, reference was made to the role of social networking, including comments that are left by people in the aftermath of a friend's suicide.  The UK police have examined the social networking activities of young people to try to discover their reasons for committing suicide.  It has become common for bereaved friends to set up memorial pages on social networking sites, such as Facebook and Bebo.  Research by the department of epidemiology at Bristol University has shown a connection between media reports of suicide and copycat deaths.  In addition, the research stated it was likely that discussions on websites would have a similar effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">I urge the Minister of State, in conjunction with her colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, to address this problem through the schools system in particular.  In that way, young people could be encouraged to understand the seriousness of what they are doing in leaving messages on social networking sites.  We may find it difficult to comprehend but some young people feel it is possible to communicate with the dead through social networking.  Sometimes, this is a mechanism for them to cope with the grief and mourning they are going through.  It is a cry for help from them, which needs to be addressed, and I think schools are the best venues in which to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">In recent weeks, Facebook launched a facility in association with the Samaritans that allows people to get help for a friend whom they believe may be suicidal.  It allows friends to alert the Samaritans through the Facebook help centre where they can provide content that suggests a friend may be suicidal.  The Samaritans have also launched an awareness campaign on their Facebook page that tells people how to recognise risk factors for suicide among their friends.  These factors include a family history of suicide, easy access to means of suicide, a previous suicide attempt, a history of behavioural disorder, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, family dysfunction, marital status, physical illness, imprisonment and unemployment.  Unfortunately, in most cases, it is scarily obvious that the bulk of deaths by suicide involve young men.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">In primary schools, the SPHE course encourages children to talk about their physical health and well-being.  Teachers should also be exploring mental health issues at a much earlier stage, as well as bringing them up at second level.  Children and adolescents are under massive pressures, including economic ones.  We should not pile any further pressure on our young people, but mechanisms are required to let them discuss such problems in order to relieve them.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I wish the Minister of State well in her new portfolio.  In addition, I acknowledge the work of my colleague, Deputy Neville, in this respect.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ReginaDoherty" eId="spk_210">
          <from>Deputy Regina Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_404">I wish the Minister of State the very best in her role, which is an extremely important one for our society as a whole.  Ireland is a small nation, yet we have one of the highest incidents of registered deaths by suicide in Europe.  There is not a community in the country that has not been affected by suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The programme for Government has set out proposals to develop and improve mental health facilities, starting in the community.  It is proposed that €35 million will be ring-fenced from the annual health budget to build community mental health teams and services for adults and children.  The programme for Government also sets out plans to strengthen the training of general practitioners to deal with mental health issues that may arise in the community.  This is vitally important because a GP may be the first person with whom someone suffering from depression engages.  If GPs cannot service that need or open the door to other services that are available, therein lies the biggest initial problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">It is always said that a general practitioner should be the first port of call for physical illnesses, but we must make it the same for mental health issues.  A review of the Mental Health Act 2001 and the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2004 will take place under the new Government.  The promise we made to introduce a mental capacity Bill, in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, must be delivered upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Recent studies conclude that instances of suicide have increased since 2009.  One reason attributed to the increase in such deaths is the economic downturn and the pressure under which people have found themselves.  It is wholly unacceptable that people should be committing suicide due to a lack of money and resulting pressures.  The stigma attached to depression, however, often prevents people from asking for help.  We desperately need to change this situation.  The greatest sadness concerning suicide is that is it totally preventable.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Amnesty International states that four fifths of mental health service resources remain tied up in hospital-based treatment, which in itself has negative connotations.  We must move away from that and deliver on our promises to give people the option of having access to the services they need at a local community level.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">We must implement A Vision for Change, the implementation of which has been promised to the people for so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">It must be borne in mind that the issue of suicide affects people of all ages.  Perhaps in more recent times our attention has been drawn to the issue among young people by the Think Big campaign launched by Headstrong and, more recently, the Get on Board campaign to increase the awareness of mental health and push the issue to the fore of the political agenda among new and existing politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Alarmingly, 60% of young people said they would not seek help from a health professional if they experienced mental health difficulties.  This is testament to the old Irish attitude of not complaining and getting on with things.  As a Government, we must support voluntary groups such as Headstrong, Aware, Amnesty International, Reach Out and the many other groups which exist to help to bring to an end the stigma attached to depression.  Almost twice the number who die in road accidents die by suicide.  As previous speakers said, the funding for the road safety campaign amounts to €20 million, while that provided for the suicide prevention campaign is €5 million.  Therein lies a big problem.  It is not my intention to make a comparison in the loss a family suffers in either case, but this illustrates the difference in the funding provided for the campaigns and the level of public awareness of the issues involved.  This has to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Education on mental health must start in the community, particularly in schools by improving SPHE programmes; among support groups and voluntary organisations by improving their funding and facilities; and among GPs by strengthening their training to enable them to deal with issues that arise.  Each one of us must take responsibility for the campaign to prevent death by suicide by ensuring we start at home and talking about it to our children, families, friends and work colleagues.  Only when we remove the stigma from depression and the sense of failing and the lack of self-worth for those who suffer from it and replace these feelings with ones of security, hope and trust will it be more acceptable to ask for help.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SandraMcLellan" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
          <p eId="para_413">I congratulate the Minister of State and wish her well in her new position.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I have listened to the contributions of my fellow Deputies on the incidence of suicide in Ireland with sadness and dismay.  It is an important issue and their contributions are valuable.  However, we cannot afford mere posturing on the issue.  We need action and effective measures to ensure that, as elected representatives, we will use our influence to create an environment in which there will be greater understanding and acceptance of people with mental health issues and a reduction in the stigma attached to them and the associated discrimination.  I am lucky to have a platform to say my piece in the Chamber, but we need to remember that we have a responsibility to help to remove the stigma and discrimination associated with mental health problems.  That goes for all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The incidence of suicide in Ireland is at an all-time high.  Ted Hughes once wrote a poem about Sylvia Plath who had taken her own life.  It was entitled "Last Letter" in which he addressed the issue of her death.  The opening line has always stayed with me: "What happened that night?  Your final night."  I often think of it when I hear of suicides and what happened to the people concerned on their final day or night, as well as the loneliness and isolation they must have felt and their sheer desperation.  The final night for many is the result of a combination of factors, including mental health issues, reduced self-esteem, discrimination and social stigma becoming a barrier in accessing services and a lack of support.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">There may be a sum of €8.7 million available to support suicide prevention initiatives which is a good start, but more needs to be done.  The strain imposed by financial difficulties is increasingly becoming a factor in suicides.  It is one thing to give €8.7 million for a suicide prevention programme but another when people's financial difficulties are being magnified tenfold by having to pay the universal social charge.  While it is part of the Government's responsibilities to address this issue, we have a collective responsibility to address it.  Ní neart go cur le chéile.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">It is estimated that 40% of undetermined deaths are suicides.  A total of 527 people took their own lives in 2009, which is astonishing.  It would make one's heart break for the people who were driven to this, as well as their families and friends.  When people attempt to access services, they are faced with an archaic mental health system.  More than 20 years ago the Government ratified a legally binding international treaty guaranteeing everyone in Ireland fundamental human rights — the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which Amnesty International has described as "one of the country's best kept secrets".  I am not surprised it described it as such.  Under the treaty, we are supposed to have a right to health care, but hundreds of children are detained in adult mental health facilities because there is insufficient child appropriate accommodation available.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The Minister for Health and Children has said a child should only be admitted as an inpatient to a psychiatric facility as a last resort.  It would be preferable if no one had to be treated in a psychiatric facility and treatment was delivered within the community, but where that is an appropriate part of treatment, children should be treated in a facility suited to their needs.  There is only a bed capacity of 52 within the child and adolescent mental health service infrastructure which the Government plans to increase to 58 by 2012.  That means six additional beds will be provided in one year, which is inadequate.  The Minister has said he envisages the plan bringing to an end the treatment of children in adult facilities.  However, hundreds of children are in adult facilities.  How, therefore, are we expected to believe this?  Six additional beds are better than nothing, but they will not make the impact the Government believes they will.  Service provision must be based on need.  It is just plain wrong that people are not receiving the help and support they need because of the inadequacies of the health system and the inadequacies of a Government which will not recognise a person's right to health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">We must also be aware of those who are at higher risk of suicide and having mental health issues.  BelongTo is a youth organisation which does great work with gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender, LBGT, young people.  In its submission on the national strategy for action on suicide prevention  its officers quoted extensively from research that demonstrated the high levels of stress experienced by LGBT youth.  According to one Dublin City University research paper, 94% of teachers were aware of verbal homophobic bullying in schools.  The old adage of "sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me" is categorically untrue.  LGBT young people are five times more likely to be medicated for depression, two and a half times more likely to self-harm and three times more likely to attempt suicide.  They are at huge risk.  However, 90% of teachers were not able to find a single mention of homophobic bullying in their schools' policy statements on bullying.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Schools are harrowing places and life is grim for many gay teenagers.  It is imperative, therefore, that action is taken to tackle this issue.  We need to address the problem not only by directly funding suicide prevention programmes and strategies, but also by addressing the root causes of stress and depression.  This is not just the responsibility of the Minister of Health and Children.  The Minister for Education and Skills also has a role to proactively work on the issue and ensure the development of programmes to positively endorse diverse sexual identities in schools and increase support for organisations supporting LGBT youth and their parents.  If the State is not going to provide services, it is critical that the voluntary sector is supported in what it is doing.  Our collective responsibility to address and prevent suicide means we must use our knowledge to propose meaningful and constructive solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">I support Amnesty International's call to use the opportunity presented by the forthcoming review of the Mental Health Act to consider broader legislation to provide community-based mental health services.  International evidence shows this not only improves mental health outcomes, but is also associated with lower suicide rates.  Sinn Féin fully supports this position.  It is an awful reflection on Fianna Fáil, its former Government partners and now the Labour Party and Fine Gael, as well as the HSE and the Department of Health and Children, that Amnesty International, a campaigning organisation for human rights, has to lobby for better mental health service provision because the service provided by successive Governments represents such an outrageous breach of people's human rights; it is a scandal.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention has stated that the increase in suicide is linked to the current economic climate in this country, stating that it is likely to be a "result of the impact of the economic downturn with substantially more people unemployed and suffering from personal debt".</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Surely the Government can see now that its policies which are geared towards cutting the incomes of those who are lowest paid in society are increasing the level of suicide.  It is hypocritical to speak in the Chamber of all the tragedies that have touched people's lives — we all know of someone who has taken his or her own life — and then to ignore the evidence that is presented by a body such as the National Office for Suicide Prevention, which is a part of the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">It is important that the Government, during the review of the Mental Health Act, looks at the evidence.  Evidence-based policy should be based on need and not the minimum that Fine Gael thinks it can get away with providing.  Mental health is a significant component in suicides.  The EU consensus paper on Prevention of Depression and Suicide has stated that the "adequate treatment of major mental disorders... decreases the risk of suicide and is an effective way to prevent suicide in healthcare".</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Ireland still lacks a modern, adequately resourced community mental health service.  Reform of mental health services must be part of a coherent response to suicide prevention.  Better mental health services will mean fewer people dying by suicide.  We need good community-based mental health services which have better outcomes when compared to traditional hospital treatment.  The research proves that, yet four fifths of mental health service resources remain tied up in hospital-based treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Implementation of the reform set out in A Vision for Change has been slow and uneven to date.  Accountability for expenditure on mental health and transparent information on how such expenditure is used to reform the services in line with policy has been lacking.  International human rights law demands that mental health services be continually improved in line with best practice in order to fulfil the right to the highest attainable standard of mental health and avoid social exclusion.  As long as this country fails to implement reform, it will continue to fail to meet international human rights standards.  These failings lead to enormous economic and human costs and needless individual suffering.  The poor response to mental health is also contributing to high national suicide rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The forthcoming review of the Mental Health Act, as set out in the programme for Government, provides an excellent opportunity for the Government to change things for the better.  We must examine what works.  Everyone knows a family that has been devastated by suicide.  Some families have been affected twice and others even three times.  We must educate ourselves to recognise the signs.  We must change things for the better.  I call on the Government to listen to the evidence, and it is being told by the people affected by suicide, and to do something meaningful in order to address the problem.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</from>
          <p eId="para_427">Cuirim fíor fháilte roimh an Aire Stáit, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  Listening to Deputy McLellan I cannot help but wonder whether Sinn Féin seeks an increase in bed capacity and hospital facilities or a more community-based approach.  Perhaps the party could indicate what it wants.  This debate is probably the most important one we will have in this House because it deals with people, those we all know who live in our communities.  At a time when more and more people are under pressure — tá siad faoi bhrú — it is important that the Government and everyone else would recognise the fact.  It behoves all of us to work together to ensure that suicide and mental health problems do not escalate.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">In the past decade, there is not a single community or a single family in this country that has not been touched by the spectre of a death by suicide.  Losing a loved one, friend, work colleague or neighbour leaves a thousand unanswered questions — the most common of which are, first, "Why?" and, second, "Could I have done something to prevent it?"  Those questions shake us to the core of our being.  The possibility of hope and of things improving lie at the essence of our humanity and spirituality.  For many hundreds of people, at a time of deep emotional and psychological trauma in their lives, there does not seem to be a belief in life, there is a loss of hope and there is despair that things will not improve or get better.  The reality is that it can.  It is important that support is provided and that people talk, listen and reach out.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Recently, the <i>Evening Echo</i> reported on 202 deaths in Cork city and county over the past 30 months, as indicated by the Central Statistics Office, of 170 men and 32 women.  At times it appears as if suicide is a single, homogenous act that is becoming endemic across society.  Reporting and presenting on suicide makes it seem as if it is beyond control, predictability or intervention.  The analysis of the statistics and research suggests otherwise.  Certain sections of communities are more vulnerable to death or harm from suicide.  With careful screening and appropriate mental health and community training it is possible to become aware of potential precursors and triggers to some cases of suicide.  It has been proven locally, nationally and internationally that appropriate intervention can and does reduce the number of fatalities from suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">For too long suicide has been a taboo subject which people have been afraid to talk about.  It is important that we seek out reasons rather than seek to deny.  Raising the issue and discussing suicide in this debate increases the opportunity for people to seek help and support.  It is time for politicians and those involved in the mental health area to open the doors and pull back the veils of secrecy and denial so as to allow light and rational debate into this particularly difficult and sensitive subject.  It is essential that we have an open and honest debate about the extent of fatal and attempted suicides and the response of the State at a national and local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">According to WHO data, in 2009 Ireland was ranked 20th out of 26 European countries with a total suicide rate of 10.6 per 100,000 population.  While significantly below that of Lithuania which had a rate of 30.4 per 100,000 we were significantly higher than our neighbours in the United Kingdom which had a rate of 6.4 per 100,000 and Greece which had a rate of 3.5 per 100,000.  The same WHO data reveals that we have a youth suicide rate that is the 4th highest in Europe, which is a worry.  Further analysis shows that in Ireland, over the period of 2002 to 2006 the highest rate of suicide was for young men in the 20 to 24 year age group.  Those and other data clearly show that suicide and suicidal behaviour is a complex, multifaceted societal issue which while individual in focus appears to be responsive to societal and personal risk factors and indicators.  The data also inform us that we must take an individualistic and holistic approach to suicide at a community, regional and national level.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">I do not believe a one-size-fits-all solution can work.  To be fair, neither does the Government.  To be effective and meaningful, intervention must reduce both the level of attempted suicide and completed suicide.  I agree with Deputy McLellan that there is a need for joined-up thinking between the various agencies, statutory and voluntary local bodies, education and social services, business and voluntary or community organisations and agencies committed to positive mental health promotion as well as participation by and acceptance of the role of the ordinary person who is often the first to become aware of the potential of risk or the likelihood of harm arising from suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The establishment of the National Office for Suicide Prevention was an important advancement in the struggle to respond to the level of deliberate self-harm and completed suicide behaviour in society.  In Cork, we are fortunate to have a mental health resource officer who oversees and delivers valuable and essential community supports and training, helping develop skills in individuals, organisations and the community that enable them to respond to suicide.  In addition to general and specific suicide helplines, peer support education programmes for young people in a community-based setting is provided so that young people can offer support to other young people.  We also have the applied suicide intervention skills training, ASIST, which is a two-day skills building workshop in suicide first aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">In essence, there are three basic elements to our strategy for dealing with suicide — at primary, secondary and tertiary places of education; in the workforce; and through local community, voluntary and statutory agencies.  Our first strategy is to support positive mental health promotion; second, to respond in a supportive way when individuals are under stress or strain, for whatever reason, such as alcohol problems, bullying, gay or lesbian issues and money pressures; and, third, it is important to develop protocols of response when suicidal behaviour occurs, aimed at helping to minimise the negative impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">It has been established, through both national and international research, that following a death by suicide, there is an increased probability that a family member or friend will attempt or complete an act of self-harm or suicide.  This is known as a "clustering" effect.  The Irish Association of Suicidology has reported that the media coverage of mental health issues and of suicide can be important determinants and influencers of possible behaviour.  In general, the print and broadcast media have taken a responsible attitude and approach when dealing with these issues and I would like to take this opportunity to commend the work of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>  in this regard.  It has published an important booklet, entitled, Let’s Talk Suicide, which is a valuable asset and tool which should be available to every household.  Perhaps the Minister of State will liaise with the <i>Irish Examiner</i> to arrange for that booklet to be made available to schools.  The booklet forcefully and sensibly highlights the issue in a way that brings home the stark reality of suicide and its consequences.  It also explores the options and supports for people contemplating suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">I would also like to pay tribute to Deputy Dan Neville, who through his sensitive work, commonsense approach and deep humanity has helped and influenced many people.  As a public representative he has done the State a great service and should be complimented on that.  Much of what he has done has been done quietly and below the radar, but he has helped and supported our fellow citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The Internet is a source of much comment as its power and usefulness have transformed and shaped the lives of individuals, families and communities.  Its influence is generally positive, but there is a potential dark side to the Internet that can manipulated by those who prey on the vulnerable and those in need of support.  Some sites on the Internet actively promote and encourage self-harm.  These sites are nihilistic and fatalistic and should be monitored or shut down.  We have learned with child abuse that the Internet is difficult to police and to monitor on a 24-hour 365-day basis, but we must use it to channel positive and realistic messages on mental health and show that there are alternatives to suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Reference has been made to Facebook, Twitter, Bebo and other social media sites, which are of huge importance with regard to the development of technological interventions to responding to suicide and in communicating positive messages about mental health.  We must offer vulnerable people avenues of help which are accessible.  I hope the Government will provide a strategy that will be immediate and offer interventions when people need them most.   As we know, people who commit suicide do so deliberately at a time when helplines and out-of-hours supports are not available.  Smart phones, mobile Internet access and Wifi must be used as a resource to reach out to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">I understand there is not uniform availability of resources across or between HSE regional areas.  Therefore, I call on the Minister of State to undertake a review of the implementation of the recommendations of the Reach Out strategy to ensure that all communities can be supported.  I also call on the Minister of State to call on the HSE to undertake a rigorous review of best practice to determine what measures are most effective with regard to intervention and responding to suicide.  We must do more than just respond to crises so that we feel better.  We must do more than say we need more resources, beds and money.  Given the current era of limited resources and reduced personnel, we must ensure that all interventions put in place are targeted, specific and effective.  We must know what works and why it works.  It is important that when we identify people at risk, they are supported.  We must adopt a proactive and targeted approach to individuals deemed to be at high risk of suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">It is important to recognise the need for consistency in our response and intervention throughout the country.  We must have flexibility in service provision to ensure interventions can be delivered where and when they are needed, rather than be restricted to office hours.  We must also have a regular audit of statutory, community and voluntary groups that provide interventions in order to ensure quality control.  I ask the Minister of State to follow up on this.  We must look at the Internet as a way of promoting support and informing young people they are not alone.  We must increase training and awareness among first responders, gardaí and social workers.  We must also ensure we have a fast-track referral approach, from primary care services to community-based mental health services for those identified as being at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">I thank the Minister of State for her presence at this important debate.  This debate is about people, not about a cold, calculated print-out of statistics.  It is about our fellow citizens.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#NickyMcFadden" eId="spk_214">
          <from>Deputy Nicky McFadden</from>
          <p eId="para_443">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this serious matter.  Like Deputy Buttimer, I would like to acknowledge the great work Deputy Dan Neville has done in this area and his sensitivity in dealing with people and the issues.  I also acknowledge the positive approach the Minister of State is taking towards this issue.  In talking about suicide, we should consider families throughout the country who have lost a member through suicide.  I extend my condolences to all of those people.  The facts and figures on suicide are sobering to say the least.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">As the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has stated previously, provisional figures for 2009 show an increase of 4% in suicide to 527 deaths.  In this era of constant number crunching, it is easy to get bogged down in facts and figures, but 527 is not just a number.  It is the death of 527 Irish men, women and young people who felt there was no other way out but to take their own lives.  This is a sobering thought.  Not only should we be troubled by this fact, we should also consider the families of those people and the profound effect these deaths have on them and the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The increase in suicide rates is mainly seen in men in the middle age group.  There is no doubt that unemployment and serious financial difficulties account for many of these deaths.  The prevalence of suicide in middle aged men is a fact that needs to be addressed without a moment's hesitancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Of course, younger and older people are included in these tragic figures.  It is estimated that suicide rates have increased in the past two years by 24% and self-harm rates by 11%.  Family difficulties, bullying, stress, anger and isolation are also serious contributory factors to suicide rates.  The first step in decreasing suicide rates is to get rid of the stigma attached.  Until quite recently, up to 1993, suicide was considered a crime.  We must urgently remove the phrase "committing suicide" from our vocabulary.  Mental illness should be discussed openly and frankly without any sense of sensationalism or scandal.  Access to mental health services must be readily available to anyone who experiences mental health difficulties.  Having worked in a GP practice, I believe the first port of call for people suffering from mental illness is their GP.  It is important that GPs are readily accessible to people who are in trouble, and receive training on how to deal with suicidal thoughts and related issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">It is not just in GP surgeries that this training should take place.  Schools, youth clubs and other community organisations should be educated in this area.  Discussion and open debate will create an environment where those who are depressed or having suicidal thoughts will be more inclined to talk openly about their feelings, thereby improving their chances of receiving the necessary help and advice.  In schools there should be a greater focus on life skills education.  Students should have access to self-esteem programmes, and learn assertiveness and resilience-building skills to equip them for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">We need a societal change in how we approach the issue of suicide.  Openness, understanding and professionalism are needed to help those at risk.  Greater observance is also needed and we need to know the telltale signs of depression or suicidal thoughts.  I recommend that everyone should attend the suicide ASIST workshop.  I did and it was probably one of the best things I have ever done.  It outlines the telltale signs and gives participants the skills to deal with people at risk of suicide.  Dr. Jacky Jones, a former regional manager of health promotion with the HSE, described the course as the mental health equivalent of neighbourhood watch.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">I commend the National Office for Suicide Prevention website.  To members of the media I recommend reading the media guidelines for reporting suicide and self-harm published by the Irish Association of Suicidology and the Samaritans.  A number of organisations do great work in this area.  Representatives of 1life campaigned outside Leinster House before Easter.  It has a 24 hours a day, seven days a week dedicated suicide intervention and prevention helpline on 1800 24 7 100.  That organisation helped 36,000 callers in its first year and receives more than 3,000 calls every month.  I also recommend the organisation Suicide or Survive which can be contacted at 1890 577 577.  Suicide or Survive provides a range of educational and therapeutic programmes that increase understanding of suicide and play an active role in its prevention in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">People should know that they are not alone and that help is available.  On an individual basis, people should be aware of friends, family members or work colleagues who may be dealing with mental health difficulties.  A simple action like just being a friend to somebody can be the most important thing in the world.  I hope that all the contributions to this debate will help in tackling the risk of suicide.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanGriffinFG" eId="spk_215">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Griffin</from>
          <p eId="para_451">I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I acknowledge the many contributions to this debate made by Deputies from all sides of the House in recent weeks.  I hope some of the very positive suggestions and ideas mentioned here over the course of the discussion can some day be implemented where possible.  Unfortunately, like every Deputy, I have known many people who have died as a result of suicide.  I recently considered the very shocking statistic that three out of 120 from my secondary school year group have died as a result of suicide and most of us have not reached the age of 30 yet.  That is just one example and there are similar examples from throughout the country.  It is a very sad and tragic situation.  I hope that through these statements, along with the actions of the Government and various State agencies, this problem can be tackled and we can see an improvement.  Unfortunately, each death is one too many and any improvement needs to be built on.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">It is an issue that affects every part of the country, crossing geographical and social boundaries.  It will take a very comprehensive approach to tackle the issue.  Our approach to the problem of suicide needs to incorporate actions from every Department and is not simply a problem for the Department of Health and Children.  Many aspects of the problem relate to other Departments and we need a comprehensive approach to the issue.  For example the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has a major part to play.  The links between physical activity and mental and physical well being have been well proven, and that needs to be improved and worked on.  Sporting clubs and organisations that do fantastic work for their local communities have a role to play in helping to tackle this problem.  The Department of Education and Skills has a major role to play in shaping attitudes to the problem, informing our young people and helping to eliminate the stigma that, as many speakers have mentioned, is still a large aspect of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">As Deputy McFadden said, the media need to report suicide incidents in a very sensitive and appropriate manner at all times regardless of the individual involved.  Unfortunately, when a celebrity or well known individual is involved, there seems to be a deviation from the best practice code, which needs to be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Even local government has a role to play.  It has been proven that pet ownership can help to tackle the problem of depression and yet, according to the ISPCA, 30,000 dogs are put to sleep every year.  Britain has a scheme offering those suffering from depression the opportunity to avail of dog ownership with the thinking that people will engage in more physical activity by simply walking the dog and that interaction between humans and dogs can be therapeutic and helpful.  This is only a very small suggestion but could perhaps be considered.  It will not solve the problem but could certainly help.  If but one life could be saved as a consequence, it should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I acknowledge the considerable contribution by Deputy Dan Neville, who has dedicated years to addressing this issue and who has done fantastic work on mental health.  Much work on suicide and self-harm has already been done by the State and State agencies.  When I asked a question about suicide statistics and the problem of suicide in the HSE south area at the regional health forum for that area in February, the response I received was very comprehensive and detailed.  It proved that so much work has already been done in this area.  Unfortunately, however, we seem to be losing the battle.  We need to consider how best we can use our resources and the agencies of the State already working on this issue to try to improve circumstances overall.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Next Saturday morning I will be taking part in the Pieta House-sponsored Darkness into Light walk, which will take place at 4 a.m. in Killarney National Park.  The walk symbolises the move from darkness into light and is in remembrance of a number of locals who died by suicide.  The initiative and similar initiatives need to be welcomed and encouraged.  They all help to eliminate the stigma that is, unfortunately, still associated with suicide in Ireland in 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I will be delighted to attend the See Change campaign briefing on Wednesday, 11 May from 9.30 a.m. to 11 a.m. in the Oireachtas audiovisual room.  I encourage all Deputies to attend.  I know many will be attending, having spoken to them.  The campaign is an example of a positive initiative that needs to be encouraged.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">I sympathise with all those affected by suicide who may be watching this debate on the Internet or who may read the transcript thereof at some stage.  Possibly every household in the country has been affected by suicide, a problem on which we all need to work together to solve.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_461">I join Deputy Griffin in sympathising with all those affected by suicide.  We must address the nitty-gritty of the problem.  There is a distinct link between the economic downturn, especially the rise in unemployment, and suicide.  Amnesty International has made this very clear.  It seems likely that the increase in the suicide rate is primarily a result of the impact of the economic downturn with substantially more people unemployed and suffering from personal debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">One of the main problems with which the Dáil must deal is unemployment because doing so will give people more hope and income and allow them to put their children through college, etc.  The Government is not really dealing with this and will not be able to do so because it has accepted the diktats of the IMF and European Union.  While my point very much concerns economics, it is a key issue.  The suicide rate will continue to escalate under the prevailing economic conditions unless the problem is addressed with real drive by creating jobs.  People Before Profit and my fellow United Left Alliance Deputies believe this should be achieved by putting thousands of people back into the workforce in publicly funded jobs.  I refer to the building of schools, as mentioned in the budget statement, the retrofitting of homes and addressing the water crisis associated with the condition of pipes all over the country.  A national employment programme would make a big difference in preventing the worsening of people's circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">A key cause of suicide is the extremely poor quality of mental health services.  I have experience of people having to rely on public health service psychiatrists, etc.  What generally happens is that one receives an opportunity to sit with a psychiatrist once per month.  The psychiatrist changes monthly, however, and there is no continuity.  Many of the patients are older women and men.  They may have to talk to young women doctors who are probably in the initial stages of training, and this does not help when dealing with the issue of depression.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Amnesty International has identified the poor quality of mental health services in Ireland as a key cause of suicide.  Suicide is preventable and better mental health services would mean fewer people dying in this tragic manner.  Amnesty International makes the point that adequate treatment of major mental disorders decreases the risk of suicide and is an effective way to prevent suicide in health care.  Ireland still lacks a modern, adequately resourced community mental health service.  The Government should address this.  There is an absolute need to prevent suicide and this can only be done by investing in the appropriate services.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The need to move towards a well funded, properly resourced community-based mental health service is crucial.  International evidence shows that good community-based services, by comparison with traditional hospital services, are linked to lower suicide rates.  In Ireland, 80% of mental health resources remain tied up in hospital-based treatment.  This is a model we must move away from.  It represents another appalling failure of the HSE to carry out reform in this area.  Amnesty International claims the failure to reform mental health services means Ireland continues to fail to meet international human rights standards.  As a society, we must meet those standards, and this can only mean resourcing the appropriate services.  How are we to resource the services in the current climate?  The forthcoming review of the Mental Health Act 2001, committed to in the programme for Government, must result in legislation to force the HSE to implement urgent reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Many of the people I have been meeting recently, particularly mothers and fathers of autistic children, who are trying to get their children into schools and have their disabilities assessed, are now being told there is no point in having them assessed because there are no special needs teachers to serve them.  This is an absolute scandal.  It is one of the economic and social issues we must address.  We must be willing to step up to the mark in this regard, put resources where they are needed and impose taxes where we can.  We know there is plenty of money within certain sections of society.  The very wealthy in this country do not pay a cent in tax.  If they were taxed and the money were invested where needed, we would have a way of moving forward.  Until the Government meets this challenge, we will continue to experience the sorry economic circumstances we are experiencing at present and fail to step up to the mark with regard to suicide prevention.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_219">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_467">I congratulate the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services on her appointment and wish her well in her new office.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I agree with previous speakers about the effects suicide has had on families throughout the country.  I sympathise with the families and relatives who have been through this experience.  Unfortunately, many families have had experience of suicide over the past number of years.  Some families would have been aware of mental health difficulties but others have seen suicide occur almost out of the blue.  It is a very important problem to be dealt with as it is a matter of real concern for many people in our community.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">I thank the many voluntary organisations working in this area, such as the mental health organisation, GROW, Aware and others.  There are also many local organisations who are doing exceptional work on this issue on behalf of families and persons with mental health difficulties.  As Deputy Collins said, funding is undoubtedly a serious issue for many of these organisations.  According to today's newspapers, an organisation in Wicklow has indicated that unless its funding can be re-established it might have to close an important and energetic service it has been providing for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Like other Deputies, I regularly encounter people at my clinics who are experiencing unemployment for the first time.  These are people whose families have no history of unemployment.  It can be hugely distressing for people to find themselves in that situation.  I have met people at my clinics who are completely frustrated, distressed and simply do not know what to do.  They have always worked, either in good jobs or in self-employment, and suddenly find that they are dependent on the social welfare or community welfare services.  It is distressing and frustrating for them that they are unable to look after themselves or their families.  The problem of unemployment must be tackled.  If it is, it would deal with at least one aspect of the suicide issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Another matter dealt with by Deputy Collins is young children with special needs and the difficulties they have.  Unfortunately, it appears that the special needs area is being targeted for cuts in the education sector.  Again, if this is allowed to progress, a growth in the suicide figures will become evident.  Obviously, where young people are already experiencing difficulties in a school, social or family setting, those difficulties must be dealt with early or a situation will develop later that will give rise to many social ills, including suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">The number of suicides in the past number of years is a cause of concern.  It opens our eyes and certainly suggests the issue must be dealt with seriously and tackled on an immediate and ongoing basis.  There were 527 suicides in 2009.  It is a terrifying figure.  The breakdown of the figures shows that substantially more men than women take their own lives, with the rate for young men being significantly higher than that for young women.  Young men in the 20 to 24 year old age group are particularly affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">Implementation of the A Vision for Change document is hugely important in dealing with the issue of suicide.  Certainly, the development of community-based services is vital to ensure that services are available on a family and local basis, and not just through the HSE but also through local community and voluntary organisations.  Some people who have mental health issues prefer to deal with non-statutory organisations.  The implementation of the community-based services proposed in A Vision for Change is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">As Deputy Collins said, there are huge resources available to be tapped.  Numerous reports have suggested that approximately €250 billion in assets are in the hands of a small number of very wealthy people in this country.  There is no assets tax on those assets.  If those assets were targeted, there would be huge amounts of money available to deal not only with suicide, but also many other issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  This is the first opportunity I have had to speak before her in the House.  I acknowledge her commitment to dealing with this issue and what has been done already through the ASIST, applied suicide intervention skills training, programme and the See Change initiative.  I also pay tribute to Deputy Dan Neville who, long before he became a Deputy, identified suicide as a major malaise in Irish society.  I recall that as a Member of the Seanad he was one of the first, if not the first, to raise this issue and he has pursued it in the years since.  Third, I pay tribute to all the voluntary organisations who are doing such good work, such as Pieta House, ASIST, Aware, the Samaritans and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">Suicide is the silent killer in our society.  It destroys lives, creates victims and causes devastation to many families in this country.  As Members are aware, there are twice as many deaths by suicide as there are deaths on our roads.  That is a dreadful statistic when one contemplates it.  The two main causes of death among young people are either suicide or road traffic accidents.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_477">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_478">That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_479">recognises that:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_480">the burden of bank recapitalisation severely limits the capacity of the Government to positively lead this country out of recession and back to economic normality;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_481">the burden of negative equity and mortgage arrears severely limits the capacity of the households of Ireland to live happy, secure and productive lives;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_482">the banks, regulators and previous Governments were negligent in allowing the "property bubble" to arise and failed in their fiduciary duties to their customers, especially to mortgagees of principal private residences — the families of Ireland — to whom they had a special duty of care;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_483">the bank guarantee and NAMA have crippled the normal workings of our financial and property markets and have not as yet contributed any positive outcomes;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_484">arising from the unique circumstances that now occur, emergency measures must be used in order to solve the problems caused by earlier, and flawed, extraordinary measures;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_485">real people are living in real houses and making real payments on these "negative equity" homes while their banks are exploiting the financial situation for their private benefit;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_486">the wider economy is in desperate need of fresh credit and renewed banking competition; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_487">the dangers of allowing families to be trapped in a lifetime of debt and lost economic opportunity far outweighs the current selective interpretation of the "moral hazard" of assisting families in negative equity; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_488">resolves:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_489">to instruct the Minister for Finance, as the controlling shareholder in the covered banks, to adopt a policy of using whatever emergency measures are deemed necessary to reduce the unsustainable debt burden being placed on mortgagees of principal private residences in the State; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_490">to ensure that the means used minimise the burden on the taxpayer and ensure that households can contribute fully to our national recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I wish to share time with Deputies Stephen Donnelly, Mattie McGrath, Maureen O'Sullivan, Finian McGrath, Mick Wallace and Clare Daly.  I propose to take ten minutes and the others will each take five.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The Technical Group has brought forward this motion because the next big crisis we will face in the context of banking will relate to mortgage debt.  In fact, it has already arrived.  The motion is an attempt to place it centre stage and try to explore how we might achieve solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">As everyone is aware, in September 2008 the previous Government began the process of socialising bank debts which it transformed into sovereign debt, which led to the necessity for the EU-IMF bailout in November last year.  Despite claims to the contrary, the Government has continued the policy of its predecessor.  It has enhanced the guarantee and further tied the future of the bank bailout with the sovereign debt.  It has missed the opportunity in its policies to be truly radical by bringing forward changes that will put the people first.  The speculators, the bond markets and the banks which, as the Labour Party is so keen to point out at every opportunity, were completely reckless and placed us all in receivership should not come first.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">As the total amount required for the recapitalisation of the banks passes €70 billion and the national debt heads for over 125% of GDP, hundreds of thousands of households are suffering under the burden of ever-increasing mortgage arrears and negative equity.  We must as a matter of urgency develop policies which would assist in lifting households out from under this massive burden and enable them to participate in the domestic economy.  If such participation was encouraged, consumption could be increased and additional revenue would accrue to the State as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">At the end of 2010 over 13,000 mortgages were in arrears for 90 days or more.  Some 31,000 mortgages were in arrears for over 180 days.  The total value of these mortgages is over €8.6 billion.  There is a widely held view that when home owners are in arrears, very few will be successful in re-emerging.  We do not know if the banks have made provision in their estimates for defaults on mortgages.  As they have not told the truth during this crisis, we do not know what the real figures are.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">We are rapidly reaching the point where wholesale repossessions will begin to occur.  The banks have signed up to moratoriums on repossessions, but this is only serving to mask the true extent of the problem.  As house prices continue to fall, the number of households in negative equity of over €50,000 will exceed 300,000, while over 60,000 households will be in mortgage arrears.  In a recent discussion document on the financial crisis the IMF stated efforts by the banks to reduce the burden of household loans had not been adequate.  There is clearly a need for the State to intervene.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">We have a responsibility to the people, not merely the Irish and European banks which created and fuelled the crisis in which we find ourselves.  It is not sufficient to state we must get the banks back working.  This will not solve the problems of thousands of families that are drowning under the weight of massive mortgage debt.  They were conned into obtaining such debt as a result of the policies pursued by the banks which the Government is intent on saving at the cost of our entire society and sovereignty.  The Government is quick to remind anyone who will listen that it did not create the problem, that it was Fianna Fáil which was responsible for doing so.  The current Administration is part of the problem.  It has taken the baton from Fianna Fáil and is now running its race.  The Government must be part of the solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The Minister continually points to an export-led recovery that will solve our woes.  Information released earlier today shows that export figures are the second highest for 11 years.  However, exports are still only approaching the levels they had reached prior to the financial crisis.  If we depend on them at this stage, too many families will be destroyed while waiting for recovery to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The banks have alluded to some policies which they may consider.  On the publication of its disastrous annual results, AIB stated it would consider some form of debt forgiveness.  This is not good enough.  The programme for Government refers to some policy issues which may be pursued, including increasing mortgage relief for first-time buyers for a specified period, putting in place moratoria on repossessions and increasing the use of the mortgage interest supplement.  This is merely tinkering at the edges.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The Government continually states it has a mandate.  It is beyond time this should be used to assist those in real need of help.  The Government should stop saving zombie banks and instead concentrate on saving viable households.  It should assist real people because they, in turn, will restore the economy by using the money they will save on not paying unsustainable debt by making a contribution to ensure we survive the recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The Minister for Finance is, on behalf of the people, the major shareholder in the banks.  As the major shareholder, he can present the latter with policies on mortgage debt that can have real meaning.  He can also ensure these policies will be implemented.  He can call an emergency general meeting and oblige the banks to accept policies that will ease the burden on households.  There are proposals relating to debt forgiveness, increasing the terms of loans or engaging in debt for equity swaps.  If we initiate a debate on a programme relating to this matter, there are other innovative responses which could provide a solution to the problem of mortgage debt.  What we require is a solution which would put the people and their well-being to the fore.  That is what the motion seeks to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">One of the most striking aspects of the entire financial crisis has been how the people are not being considered.  The Government has paid a great deal of lip service, but there are no policy developments we can highlight which indicate that people are being put first.  When someone proposes helping mortgage holders, the first response is, "What about moral hazard?"  What about it?  It is somewhat rich to refer to moral hazard when discussing the banks.  It was they which placed us in the situation in which we find ourselves by offering 100% mortgages, pursuing market share and super profits and providing ever increasing shareholder dividends.  There is no moral hazard in assisting householders to participate in community life without the burden of unsustainable debt.  Households in debt do not spend.  Neither do they invest and the wider domestic economy suffers as a result.  This is evident in each month's Exchequer returns, in the decline in VAT returns and the reduction in consumer spending.  The loss of economic opportunity is the real moral hazard.  The moral hazard is that we will do nothing and leave householders in the hands of the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_222">
          <from>Deputy Stephen Donnelly</from>
          <p eId="para_504">In February I spoke to a woman in Arklow who outlined to me the situation in which she found herself.  She and her husband were self-employed and had recently lost their business.  They are from Dublin, but they bought a house in Arklow because that is where they could afford to purchase one.  They are now in negative equity.  When I spoke to her, she stated they were about to run out of money and that because they were self-employed, they would not receive any assistance from the State.  She indicated that they would default on their mortgage some three weeks later and that they were trying to work out how they might keep their house while also being in a position to afford to buy food for their children.  There are many people who find themselves in similar situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Approximately 200,000 households are in negative equity.  In addition, in the region of 45,000 households are in arrears for more than 90 days.  This does not include all of the restructuring that has happened.  Inevitably, these figures will continue to rise.  We know that jobs will continue to be lost, that wages are falling and that it is inevitable that taxes and interest rates will rise.  The total number of households in mortgage arrears doubled between December 2009 and December 2010 and this number will continue to climb.  Last year the banks were involved in 600 repossessions which occurred during a moratorium, under the provisions of which the banks cannot pursue mortgage holders until they have been in arrears for 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">What is the result of this for those who are in negative equity or arrears?  Those who are in negative equity and arrears are completely trapped.  They are going to lose their homes and under current policy, their debts will make it impossible for them to begin again.  Under existing bankruptcy laws, their debts will follow them forever.  They will not be able to obtain new mortgages or invest in their futures or those of their children.  They are trapped.  Those who are in arrears will ultimately be forced to dispose of their houses in fire sales.  Those who are in negative equity and can afford to pay their mortgages will be obliged to use all of their income to clear dead debts.  These individuals will not be able to participate in the economy or make an investment in their children's education or their futures.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">There are several aspects of what happens in Ireland which make matters worse.  First, we have got the most stringent bankruptcy laws in Europe, so people's debt follows them forever, unlike in the UK and the US where people can start again.  Second, we own the banks and, therefore, any burden sharing we insist be taken by the banks ends up being taken on by the people, which is difficult in the current environment.  Third, we have extremely weak tenant protection.  There is an entire generation of Irish people who will be renting for the rest of their lives.  They will not be able to get out of negative equity.  They will not be able to buy a house anywhere.  They will have to raise their families under circumstances whereby a landlord can give them five or six weeks' notice to leave.  That is a far from ideal situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The question is whether we should help people in this situation.  One argument being put forward is that these people made free choices and they should accept the consequences of their actions.  As Deputy Pringle alluded to, that is a principle we would all understand, but it does not seem to apply to bondholders, where other people bear the cost of their actions.  I agree with the principle and we have to ask who is culpable for these arrears and the huge negative equity.  The people who took out the loans must bear some of the responsibility, but who else is culpable?  We know the banks are culpable.  We know they gave out 100%, 110% and 120% mortgages.  We have plenty of anecdotal evidence that they encouraged people to borrow more and more.  We know the ratio of income to total mortgages taken out increased to a level that was unsustainable.  Should they bear some of the burden?  Of course they should.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">The State also bears some of the burden.  We know the Financial Regulator failed in his duty and we know the previous Government was a cheerleader for the property boom.  It provided tax breaks, let the regulator fail and so on.  Unfortunately, we know the current Government failed to do anything about this when in Opposition.  Its constituent parties were very silent on the issue until it became far too late to do anything about it.  Therefore, the Government, the State, the banks and the people who took out the loans are all culpable and therefore should all share the burden of the debt.  That is a simple principle that we should have applied also to the bondholders, but we decided to do what Europe wanted instead.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">The current programme for Government contains some good ideas and I commend the Government on them.  The programme mentions increasing the interest rate relief for first-time buyers, extending the moratorium for repossessions, fast-tracking personal bankruptcy reform, and bolstering the power of the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, to include binding arbitration, which would allow for burden sharing.  Unfortunately, when pressed on this repeatedly over recent weeks, the Minister for Finance would appear to be dodging the question.  He answers by saying, for example, that it is a matter for the Central Bank.  I encourage the Government to bring forward a serious timescale for when these measures can be introduced.  It would be very useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">We need debt forgiveness for mortgages in negative equity, again following the principle of accountability.  We can use debt for equity deals.  They have been used very successfully in the UK and can be used in this country as a reasonable form of burden sharing.  We need to extend the interest payment protection to people who are working.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_516">I am delighted to speak on this motion and I compliment Deputy Pringle on doing the legwork in getting it put forward.  It is my own fault that my name was not signed to it because I did not get it in on time, but I fully support the motion none the less.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">I also compliment the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.  The difference in attitude since he changed sides in the House is mind boggling, but that is government and this is the Opposition.  None the less, it is not much solace to hard-pressed home owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Home owners are carrying a disproportionate burden of debt and are suffering the hardship of negative equity.  The extent of the property crash and the related banking crisis were the result of reckless bankers borrowing from other reckless bankers who behaved in a speculative way but who are now demanding their money back at any cost.  They were allowed to do all this by the Government of the day and by the Minister and his party, of which I was a part but with which I was very unhappy.  People on the Government side of the House might be unhappy at the moment, but they have to do things when in government owing to the situation with the Whips.  It is an unsatisfactory situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The regulation involved has been described as light touch, but we all know that regulation was non-existent.  The saddest part is that the regulators retired with pensions.  We were told they had contracts but according to any layman's interpretation, the contracts were not fulfilled.  Anyone who is in business knows a contract is a two-way document and that if one person does not fulfil it, the contract becomes null and void and that person suffers the consequences.  Many home owners find themselves in this situation because the paperwork and the legal background for these loans were not properly done.  Tests on the ability to repay were either overlooked or were just paid lip service.  Many loans were given out at 110% and 120%.  Where was the regulation and where was anyone to say "stop"?</p>
          <p eId="para_520">There are many parties to this and the person who signs on the dotted line is expected to have studied the contract.  However, all the advice was flippant and gung ho.  The money was like manna from heaven and there would never be an end to it.  As we saw last week in the Nyberg report, alternative options to the blanket guarantee were not seriously considered either.  When the bank guarantee was brought in, we were all told at very short notice and backbenchers from the Government parties were told it was a doomsday situation and that we had no choice.  We have asked many times since why there were not other options, but it was all hush hush.  I am very suspicious of the whole thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Ordinary people are bearing the brunt of these failures and many people, including young families, are being squeezed to the point of despair.  The previous topic for debate was suicide prevention, and unfortunately many people are being driven to suicide.  It is creating huge pressure and it is unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">I fully support this motion.  We should look at various ways to solve these problems.  We should be able to extend the time limit on the loans.  We should look at the human situation of families trying to live through every day under enormous pressure.  All the money is going into paying off the mortgage, even though many do not succeed in doing so.  In some cases, it is only paying the interest.  These people cannot be expected to play any reasonable part in raising their family with any modicum of self-belief, self-respect or training for the future, not to mind empowering their children to live normal lives.  We all know the expensive pressures on parents with children in schools, at parties or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">People are willing and able.  They must be given a chance.  They must be dealt with fairly.  Why should they be expected to pay for the sins of the developers, speculators and bondholders?  They are being burned.  They are at a new low after just two months, having been promised an awful lot by this Government which has just changed seats and pursued the same policies.  That is very disappointing for them and it does not give them much hope.  We will have to examine possible ways to allow these people to trade their way out of this.  They are willing to do that if given the chance.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_228">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_524">I acknowledge the role of Deputy Thomas Pringle in working on this motion and bringing it before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">There are many groups of people hurting in this country.  One such group consists of mortgage holders who bought property in our so-called Celtic tiger years.  They believed the tall stories about getting on the property ladder and that if they did not do it then, they would never get to own their own home.  They believed the tall stories about 100% mortgages and that they would always be able to make the payments because they were told that the good times would last forever.  They believed the tall stories about the benefits of tracker mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The expression "the dogs on the street" has been applied to a variety of situations, and it can also be applied to this situation.  The dogs in the street knew that the property bubble would burst, that it was just a matter of time before it did so and that it was inconceivable to spend astronomical amounts on a house of four, five and six times its real value.  The dogs on the street knew the foolishness of what was going on, yet our so called experts on banking and finance did not have their finger on the button, but actively encouraged increasing numbers of people to buy into the myth and the lie.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">It is frightening to read the statistics on mortgage arrears.  According to our own economic indicators carried out by the Oireachtas Library service, since September 2009 the number of mortgages in arrears has increased by approximately 18,000.  At the end of 2010, there were more than 40,000 in arrears with a steady increase in the numbers of seriously distressed mortgages.  It is obvious that once a mortgage becomes distressed, it becomes very difficult for the borrower to reverse that position.  What is also obvious from the statistics is that the sooner the customer or borrower engages with the lender or lending institution, the better the chance that the mortgage will not become delinquent.  The first strong action needed, therefore, is for everything possible to be done to ensure the lending institution engages with the borrower in difficulty sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">When I look at the housing section in the programme for Government, it acknowledges that the policy of putting the interests of big developers and bankers ahead of people looking to purchase a home was a direct cause of Ireland's disastrous property boom and bust.  It also states that the Government is committed to helping home owners in distress to weather the recession, and it acknowledges that more protection is needed for home owners with distressed mortgages.  I look at the details in our Private Members' motion and see common ground.  I do not really see where there is space for the Government to vote against this and perhaps that is why there is only one member of the Government is present.  They all agree with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">We are looking for the Minister for Finance to consider emergency measures on this matter.  The programme for Government states: "A more radical approach is needed to protect families in fear of losing their home" — more common ground.  Part of the plan is for the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, to be converted into a strengthened personal debt management agency to support those families in dealing with their debts and provide protection and space for people to sort out their affairs.  The plan is also to make greater use of the mortgage interest supplement to support families who cannot make their mortgage repayments, which it is acknowledged is a much better and cheaper option than seeing families having their homes repossessed and then going on to receive rent supplement.  Other measures that can be considered include paying interest only for a significant time, paying interest on part of the capital, payment holidays, deferring all or part, lengthening the term of the mortgage, which would reduce payments, being flexible to ways of changing the type of mortgage, and a deferred interest scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">It is also important that the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears be respected.  Part of that code is that the lender is obliged to consider alternative repayment options while not obliged to offer one.  The difficulty is where the lender states he is not willing to offer a repayment arrangement.  I note the lender must give the reasons in writing and inform the borrower of other options, but it is not strong enough to prevent repossession.  There is much to commend in that code but I hope the borrower can be assisted in practical ways because there is much form filling, meetings and legalities to be gone through.  The code states that the aim of the mortgage arrears resolution process is to avoid the repossession of family homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">No doubt a terrible injustice has been done to ordinary home owners by reckless and unscrupulous bankers and developers who most definitely are not facing the reality of losing their generally palatial homes, both here and abroad, in the same way that ordinary home owners are facing repossession of their homes.  The Government must put ordinary citizens who are in difficulty first and not allow the banks exploit the financial situation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_229">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_532">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity of speaking to this important motion from the Independent Members.  I also commend my colleague, Deputy Pringle, on bringing this before the House and having this urgent, two-day debate on supporting and assisting householders in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Before I go into the details of the motion, I wish to state that it is a national disgrace what has happened to this country.  Government, bankers, developers and the greedier sections of society ruined our great little country with their gross incompetence, greed and rampant mé féinism.  The founders of the State and those who died for republican and democratic principles must be turning in their graves, especially just after the Easter break.  These fat cats let the people down, let the economy down, let householders down and let themselves down.  It is important in this debate that we all acknowledge that before we start to try to make an effort to clean up the mess.  I say to the Government that when cleaning up the mess, householders and children with a disability should not be penalised by the greed and actions of others.  That is a key point in the broader debate.  There must be a bottom line and cutting special needs services should not be part of any resolution of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The Government has clear choices.  The Independent Members have put forward choices and options for the citizens.  It is a sad state of affairs for the country when only two Government members are in the Chamber listening to the debate.  I hope the householders and the mortgage holders of the country are aware that this important issue facing the people is being ignored by the Government parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">We need a country built on equality and justice.  Ireland was once known as the land of saints and scholars but today it is better known as the land of scandals and tribunals.  Politics and politicians, banking, the church, business, medicine, the law and the Garda have all suffered from erosion of public confidence in the wake of astonishing scandals.  Moreover, Ireland has undergone rapid social, economic and political change over the past ten years which has had a profound impact on our value system.  For example, the decline in authority and influence experienced by the church in recent years has forced many to seek other sources of ethical and moral guidance.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Ireland was a fairly prosperous country, yet this created dilemmas of its own.  Difficult decisions about the distribution of resources raise awkward questions for society.  How is the tension between the rights of the individual and the overall good of society to be resolved and to whom will we all look for guidance?  The political classes, the Government, the church, and the medical or legal professions have all had their credibility seriously tainted by damaging scandals.  That is where we are at in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The motion states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_538">[T]he burden of bank recapitalisation severely limits the capacity of the Government to positively lead this country out of recession and back to economic normality;</p>

          <p eId="para_543">These are the core issues in the Independent Members' motion and we have put forward a number of ideas, some of which the House has heard.  I ask the Minister for Finance, as the controlling shareholder in the covered banks, to adopt a policy of using whatever emergency measures are deemed necessary to reduce the unsustainable debt burden being placed on mortgagees of principal private residences in the State.  I also ask that he ensure that the means used minimise the burden on the taxpayer and ensure households can contribute fully to our national recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">I urge the Government and all the Deputies to look at the Independent Members' motion, to see the reality and pay attention to the detail in order that we can all build up this country again to its proper place among the nations of the world.  While it will be tough, I believe we can do it.  I urge the Minister to listen to the different points put forward in the debate.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_545">Going around from house to house during the general election, I was struck by the level of difficulties being experienced by people, whether in social or private housing.  Most of those in social housing had no work.  Those in private housing had jobs but were experiencing terrible difficulty paying their mortgages.  It was difficult to credit, as I had not been around the entire county of Wexford previously.  Going from house to house, I was amazed at how many people were in trouble.  No doubt the moratorium on repossessions has certainly been a help, but there is an element of kicking the can down the road.  Matters are a great deal worse than we realise.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">We are fairly used to the fact that the banks do not tell us everything first-off.  We were drip-fed the truth over recent years.  I have experience in the construction sector of building and selling apartments and I can assure the Minister that close to 50% of the apartments I sold between 2003 and 2008 are in difficulty.  Given that 270,000 units were built between 2004 and 2008, it is hard to credit that only 44,000 are in the difficult position of being 90 days behind in their payments.  If this is the case, I will be very surprised if the number does not increase dramatically in the coming 12 to 18 months because I am very much aware of people who bought properties from me who are in severe difficulties.  This is having a huge impact on the entire economy.  It is very difficult to see how the economy will recover if people are afraid to spend money.  They are saving the little bit they have to try to deal with their mortgages and to keep a roof over their heads.  It is very challenging.  Their take-home pay is less than it was because of tax and they have less disposable income.  Any opportunity we have of creating more jobs has been diminished by this.  It will be difficult for unemployment figures to go in the right direction if people are spending less money, and God knows this is creating a social misery which is devastating for many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">The notion of debt forgiveness seems unthinkable to many people.  However, we know from history that it has been applied before and it worked.  Roosevelt used it in the United States in the 1930s after the great depression and it worked to great effect.  In this country, in 1932 de Valera introduced a form of it with regard to land tenants who had been repaying money to the British Government for years.  At that stage, the payment was £5 million per annum and GDP was approximately £150 million, so it was a huge amount of money.  De Valera put a stop to it and did a deal with the British; the British sought £100 million and he gave them £10 million.  He took over the debts with the farmers, who were having trouble with the repayments.  He halved the repayments and gave them double the time to make payment.  At the time, the main argument was that debt forgiveness was good for the economy.  It worked, and it was a sensible thing to do.  Today, we are at a place where it is definitely something that needs to be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">I know there are difficulties with it.  I know the dangers with regard to moral hazard, whereby one will behave differently if one knows one will be bailed out if one fails.  The banks are in good contact with their customers and are aware of who genuinely cannot pay and who can.  If work was put into this, we could deal with those in the most trouble and help them out of their situation which would help the economy in general.  If I bought a house in 1995 I would like to see someone who bought one between 2003 and 2008 receive help because I would be better off.  From a selfish point of view, I would be better off even though I bought my house in 1995 if those who bought between 2003 and 2008 received help because not only would it help us see a bottom in the market, it would also help the economy in general and we would all be better off.  If the benefit exceeds the cost it is something the Government should consider.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_231">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_549">As other Deputies have stated, there is no doubt this issue is a ticking time-bomb, and the ticking is getting louder and an explosion is not too far away.  This time last year, almost 30,000 householders had problems.  Now the figure is said to be three times that but, in reality, the figure is probably much more than that.  Hundreds of thousands of people are in negative equity.  People cannot sell or rent and the houses they are in at present are not adequate to meet their needs.  Crucially, they have no way out as they have no ability to meet the repayments being sought from them because their income is falling and mortgages are rising.  Adding into the equation the fact that many of these people have been shackled with mortgages of 30 or 40 years duration, it is quite clear that the situation is totally and utterly unsustainable and at some stage something will have to give.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">It is important that we link this to the overall economic situation and how we got into this mess.  Reckless speculation and profiteering on the property market has had devastating consequences for the entire economy and for everybody as taxpayers and citizens, and those who bought at the height of the boom are victims on the double or treble.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">If one peruses the repossession cases in the courts, one will get an idea of the type of disgusting borrowing practices that were sanctioned by the banks and their culpability in this regard.  In recent weeks, there was a case where in 2008 a 48 year-old man was given a mortgage for 35 years at repayments of €3,000 a month.  This means that for 17 of those years he would have to meet those repayments on a State pension.  This cannot be done and it is an impossible situation to be in.  The banks have to take responsibility for this.  The programme for Government speaks about a radical solution.  However, there does not seem to be much there that would deliver on this commitment.  Extending tax relief and all of the other measures mentioned by Deputies while welcome would not really get to the nub of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">In essence, we are speaking about a roof over somebody's head, which is a fundamental human right.  The starting point must be that this cannot be threatened.  What is the point of stating to people, and it has been said to people who are short a couple of hundred euro in their monthly mortgage repayment that there is no answer to it, that they cannot receive any assistance but instead they have sell the house and perhaps go into private rented accommodation where the State would subsidise their rent to the tune of €800 or €900?  A family would be uprooted with all of the social consequences that go with this, and the cost to the State would be far greater than the cost of making efforts to keep that family in that home.  This situation cannot be countenanced.  There is a long tradition of opposing evictions and repossessions in Ireland and I would actively defend people fighting to stay in their family home.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The Government needs to do much more in terms of the banks.  We own almost all of the banks.  Increasing interest rates on mortgages is unacceptable and can have only negative consequences in driving more people over the edge and into difficulties with repayments.  These institutions have received billions of euros of taxpayers money and are now seeking to saddle us with extra debt through mortgage repayments to restore some of their own profitability.  As the owners of the banks we have to state "enough is enough" and it should be ruled out.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Ultimately, the only solution to this issue is a retrospective revaluation of all the houses bought during the bubble years and for mortgage payments to be revised downward in line with the new value.  Anything else and any other proposal would merely tinker around the edges and would not address the day-to-day difficulties householders have.  In this sense, if one is speaking about being radical and addressing the situation, this is the only solution that can be countenanced.  It is something that is within our remit given the amount of our money that has been pumped in to the banks in this regard.  I urge the Government to consider this as a solution.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_560">notes that there are significant Government supports available to assist mortgage holders who are in arrears and are experiencing difficulties with repayments in respect of their principal private residence, including:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_561">the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme (MIS) which provides an important safety net for mortgage borrowers who get into difficulties and that more than 18,500 families are now benefiting from this support;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_562">advice available through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (a significant portion of the MABS client base are mortgage holders);</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_563">protection to mortgage holders provided by the Central Bank's statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (including a moratorium on legal actions by the lender provided the borrower is co-operating and the mortgage is sustainable) which applies to all regulated lenders; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_564">lender forbearance (at end of the last quarter of 2010 there were circa 60,000 rescheduled residential mortgage accounts while lenders representing the majority of the market are set to introduce a deferred interest scheme in 2011, which will extend present levels of forbearance);</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_568">expresses its confidence in the success of the Government's efforts to deal with the impact on Ireland of the worldwide financial crisis."</p>
          <p eId="para_569">We are all very much aware of the challenges facing our citizens since the onset of the banking crisis and downturn in the economy.  The challenge for Government is to manage constrained resources to ensure that those who are less well off in our society continue to have access to an acceptable level of public services including health and education, as well as opportunities for employment to enable them to support themselves and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">For many individuals the main challenge is retaining the family home at a time when unemployment and reductions in salaries are placing increased pressure on homeowners in making their repayments.  For many with mortgages these problems are compounded by falling property prices, with the issue of negative equity restrictions it imposes on options for addressing rising debt, whether by trading down or moving to a new location where employment opportunities are better.  Increases in mortgage interest rates will exacerbate these difficulties.  As several Deputies drew the attention of the House to these difficulties, there is little need for me to rehearse them.  They are common to constituents in every part of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Before I address what the Government is doing or planning to do to assist those facing these challenges, I would, first, like to address the wider issues of economic policy raised in this Private Members' motion, including the impact of bank recapitalisation, meeting credit needs in the economy and the impact of NAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">As I have stated previously in the House, a key objective of the Government is to strengthen overall fiscal sustainability by separating bank risk from the sovereign.  Clearly, this can be achieved only by returning the banking system to health.  Shortly after we presented our radical plans to resize and reorganise the banks the ECB issued a number of very important announcements related to the continued availability of euro system funding for our banks.  First and most important, it confirmed that, against the background of our decision to recapitalise the banks in line with the Central Bank's rigorous assessment of their capital needs, the ECB would continue to provide liquidity for banks in Ireland and, according to the Central Bank's statement on the night of the announcements I made on bank restructuring, "supports the Irish banks plans to deleverage and downsize their balance sheets".  Second, it confirmed that all marketable debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the Government would be deemed as fulfilling the credit standards required for collateral in eurozone credit operations, irrespective of rating.  In the absence of such a statement, the risk was that the banks' access to ECB funding would have been restricted had there been downgrades of the sovereign.  These commitments are very important in underpinning the capacity of the banking system to meet sustainable credit need because it is impossible for a bank to prioritise new lending when it is experiencing capital or funding problems.  The fact that the ECB will continue to fund Irish banks puts them in a position where they can give credit.  Economies cannot function without access to credit.  Certainly, they cannot grow without access to the credit required to permit such growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">We know that the Irish banks have lent excessively and imprudently during much of the last decade.  As discussed in the recent Nyberg report, credit allocation became heavily skewed towards real estate and development lending and genuine borrowers, for example, in manufacturing and agriculture have seen their percentage share of overall lending reduce annually over time since the end of the 1990s.  My Department has recently published some statistics which show how real estate lending became disproportionately large.  Other more productive sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing were starved of credit in the rush to lend to real estate developers and even to farmers, shopkeepers and solicitors who wanted to become real estate developers.  It is essential to reverse this trend.  I am sure many of my colleagues share my experience of being told by small business owners that they cannot get credit from the banks, only to find after examining their balance sheets that, even though they may be operating in a sector of the economy, their difficulties arise because they invested their profits in four apartments and two houses.  The mortgages on these properties rather than difficulties in their core businesses are pulling them.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The difficulties that brought us to the position in which we find ourselves arose not only from development——</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_233" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_575">Sorry, does the Deputy want me to answer the question asked?  The difficulties arose not only from over-investment in development but from the fact that people who ran profitable businesses in other sectors of the economy used their profits to invest in developments which are now dragging them down.  The stain spreads right across the economy and it is essential to reverse this trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Putting more than €10 billion of lending finance per annum back into the economy is clearly a positive development, but it has the potential to impact negatively on the economy if we repeat the mistakes of the past.  Working with the Central Bank, the banking policy division of my Department will develop safe monitoring tools to prevent the excessive concentration of lending in risky sectors and ensure lending is made in those sectors that, above all, support sustainable employment.  We will proactively encourage lending in the sectors in which we need to see additional growth such as agriculture, manufacturing and the green economy, as well as to allow people to once more buy their own homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The Credit Review Office which was established by my predecessor has a very important role to play in overseeing the lending behaviour of the banks and supporting the implementation of best practice standards to meet the needs of small businesses.  The office commenced operations on 1 April 2010 to ensure Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland achieved their objectives of making €3 billion in new lending finance available each year to SMEs in the period from 2010 to 2012.  While this process has improved somewhat the previous wholly unsatisfactory situation, problems remain.  The most recent quarterly report from the Credit Review Office states "the perception of bank borrowing being difficult to access" has led to some businesses engaging in the "risky strategy" of investing working capital in fixed asset projects.  This puts such businesses in a more perilous position of being unable to trade through difficult trading periods and dampens their investment in improvements or expansion.  However, there are some important positive signs.  The credit reviewer, Mr. John Trethowen, states the potential of borrowers to appeal to the Credit Review Office against their treatment and credit decision has "in itself had a positive influence on the behaviour of these two banks".  It is a step in the right direction, but clearly more needs to be done.  We will build on the work of the office to ensure effective access to enlarged credit lending finance from the pillar banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">NAMA was established as a vehicle to reduce risk in our systemic banks by taking the riskiest loan portfolios off their books and also forcing the upfront recognition of loan losses, while providing these institutions with assets in a form that could be used to access liquidity.  In the context of further deleveraging measures in the banking sector being central to the State's agreement with the ECB, the IMF and the European Union, the deleveraging achieved by NAMA must be seen as a necessary development.  NAMA has realised a significant amount of the deleveraging required if the banks are to be restructured to a size more appropriate to an economy the size of Ireland's.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">With regard to the agency's influence in the property market, when I recently met the board of NAMA, I explained that I expected it to review all options in regenerating activity in the property market as soon as possible.  Following that meeting, the chairman of NAMA recently stated the agency was exploring ways by which it could provide finance for commercial and residential property deals in line with its objective of reinvigorating the property market.  He has also stated he envisages NAMA working with the two pillar banks to identify solutions which will increase access to residential mortgages for its Irish residential portfolio.  In that context, I understand the agency is preparing detailed plans and that it proposes to enter into discussions with the two pillar banks shortly.  In the context of its commercial remit and consistent with section 2 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, it is at all times open to considering proposals aimed at contributing to broader social and economic objectives.  It assures me that it will play a key social and economic role by regenerating activity in the property market through its asset sales strategy and the provision of liquidity for the banks in the form of NAMA securities which can be used as collateral for funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">It is a deeply rooted cultural characteristic of Irish people that they value the ownership of their home.  Unfortunately, the financial crisis has created conditions in which many home owners, through no fault of their own, find themselves in arrears with their mortgage repayments and at risk of losing their homes.  Through its agencies, the State is assisting mortgage holders in arrears in a measured and proportionate manner.  This is undoubtedly the correct policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The mortgage interest supplement scheme, managed by the Department of Social Protection, provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person's principal private residence.  It currently supports approximately 18,500 mortgage holders.  The money advice and budgeting service, MABS, provides a national, free, confidential and independent service operating from 53 offices nationwide.  MABS devotes a substantial amount of its resources to dealing with client mortgage difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The expert group on mortgage arrears and personal debt, which was chaired by Mr. Hugh Cooney and included Mr. Matthew Elderfield, head of financial regulation at the Central Bank, as well as other external experts and senior officials from Departments, published an interim report in June 2010 and a final report in November 2010.  Since the publication of the reports, the Central Bank has revised the code of conduct for mortgage arrears, with effect from 1 January 2011, to reflect many of the recommendations of the expert group, including key recommendations relating to the introduction by all regulated lenders of a standardised mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The provisions set out in the revised code of conduct for mortgage arrears are a very important means of helping all residential mortgage holders.  This code sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears, with due regard to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The code sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrears or in pre-arrears.  For the purposes of the code, a pre-arrears case arises where the borrower contacts the lender stating that he or she is in danger of getting into financial difficulties and-or is concerned about getting into mortgage arrears.  Lenders are required to comply with the revised code as a matter of law but have been given a period of six months grace, ending on 30 June 2011, to put in place some of the provisions of the code.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The revised code includes more detailed requirements for lenders when dealing with borrowers in arrears and financial difficulties.  The most significant changes require that the code will now apply to borrowers who notify their lender that they are facing financial difficulties and may be at risk of mortgage arrears, that is, pre-arrears cases; lenders must establish a mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, and use this framework when dealing with arrears and pre-arrears customers; lenders must ensure communications with borrowers are presented in a clear and consumer-friendly manner and must make available to borrowers aninformation booklet that provides details on the MARP; lenders cannot initiate more than three unsolicited communications with a borrower by whatever means in a calendar month other than correspondence required by the code or other regulatory requirements; a lender must not require a borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type as part of an alternative arrangement offered to the borrower in arrears or pre-arrears; lenders are required to set up an arrears support unit to assess arrears and pre-arrears cases; borrowers can appeal the decision of the arrears support unit and the lender's treatment of the borrower's case under the MARP to an internal appeals board that lenders are required to establish; and the complaints process under the Central Bank's consumer protection code is replaced with an appeals process under the revised code of conduct on mortgage arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">One very important tool set out in the code is as follows.  When a lender is determining the 12 month period, it must wait before applying to the courts to commence legal action and it must exclude any time period during which a borrower is complying with the terms of an alternative repayment arrangement, making an appeal to the internal appeals board or making a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman under the revised code.  Effectively, if a borrower agrees an alternative repayment arrangement for the mortgage with the lender and continues to meet their revised repayments, the lender cannot start legal action against them to seek repossession.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The Central Bank has also written to lenders to issue directions which will mean that lenders cannot impose arrears charges or penalty interest on borrowers who are co-operating with the MARP.  One of the main recommendations of the expert group was for a deferred interest scheme.  This is intended to allow borrowers to pay at least 66% of the mortgage interest but less than 100% and defer payment of the balance for up to five years based on a full appraisal of an individual borrowers circumstances.  Mortgage lenders have been requested to commit to the scheme.  Lenders representing the majority of the market have indicated their willingness to implement the expert group's proposals for a deferred interest scheme or a variation of it.  These are AIB, EBS, Bank of Ireland, Irish Life and Permanent, Irish Nationwide Building Society, Springboard and Start.  While the deferred interest scheme is voluntary for all lenders, those who have signed up in support of the scheme will be monitored by the Central Bank to ensure compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">To implement the recommendations of the expert group regarding the mortgage interest supplement scheme, changes to primary and secondary legislation are required.  I am informed that the Department of Social Protection is formalising an implementation plan that will set out a framework for the future of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">The recommendation of the expert group to amend the local authority needs assessment process has been implemented by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Local authorities have been provided with clear guidelines on the treatment of applicants for social housing support whose mortgages have been deemed unsustainable.  Discussions are ongoing between the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Irish Banking Federation to enable borrowers whose properties are to be repossessed to remain in their homes for a period of time, pending the sourcing of appropriate accommodation by the housing authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">It is my understanding that the Minister for Justice and Equality intends to give early attention to the final report of the Law Reform Commission on personal debt management and debt enforcement, which was published in December 2010.  That report contains recommendations on comprehensive reform of the system of personal insolvency law in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">While all efforts must be made to assist those struggling with mortgages, the Government must be conscious of the overall impact on the taxpayer.  It should be noted that the mortgage arrears and personal debt group did not recommend a formal debt forgiveness scheme.  It set out a list of policy considerations in regard to loan modification techniques, which included the potential impact on borrowers and the taxpayer.  While I share the concerns of Deputies, I must emphasise that any assistance to mortgage holders must be very carefully targeted to ensure there are no additional unnecessary costs imposed on the taxpayer.  It should also be noted that not all those in negative equity are struggling to meet mortgage repayments.  Many considerations must be taken on board and I thank Deputies for their contributions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McNamara</from>
          <p eId="para_591">I wish to speak against the Private Members' motion because it contains an inherent contradiction.  On the one hand, the Technical Group would have this House instruct the Minister for Finance, as the controlling shareholder in the covered banks, to adopt a policy of using whatever emergency measures are deemed necessary to reduce the unsustainable debt burden placed on mortgage holders and, on the other hand, to ensure the means used minimise the burden on the taxpayer and ensure householders can contribute fully to our national recovery.  This side of the House agrees it is essential to the recovery of the State that householders can contribute fully to it but we must not provide that they do so in a way that further burdens taxpayers with debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Most of us in this House agree wholeheartedly on some of the concerns raised by the Technical Group.  Deputy Finian McGrath criticised the lack of members of the Government parties in the Chamber.  Unfortunately, he did not hang around long enough to hear any of us speak or the other side of the argument.  Notwithstanding this, I commend him on indicating his concern on the need for equality and social justice which is shared by Members on this side of the House.  I fail to see, however, how it would contribute to equality and social justice if taxpayers were burdened with further debt, which is effectively what is being proposed by the Technical Group.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The Technical Group proposes in a rather non-technical manner — I have yet to hear a single proposal from it, other than a reiteration of the concerns shared by everybody in the House — that we can somehow magically write off the debt as if it would have no consequences, but it would have consequences because, as those of us on this side are sorely aware, the banks, in particular the pillar banks, require capitalisation to ensure they can again play the role banks play in modern economies.  They can lend money in the economy to allow businesses to acquire the credit they need to survive on a day-to-day basis and people to buy houses from property developers such as Deputy Mick Wallace who has told us 50% of those who acquired properties from him are now in negative equity.  He proposes a system of Houdini economics in which we could all fly clear of the decisions made.  Everyone who took out a mortgage did so in the belief he or she could repay it.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Those of us on this side of the House are fully cognisant of the fact that economic circumstances in the State have changed dramatically.  It is for that reason the Minister for Finance has outlined in considerable detail the Government's proposals and the requirements of lending institutions to ensure account will be taken of the changed circumstances.  However, Deputy Mick Wallace pointed to Eamon de Valera who represented County Clare long before I did and spoke about him refusing to pay back the land annuities as if somehow this was a magic solution without consequences.  It was not without consequences.  First, de Valera's actions led to a land war, as well as an economic war, between the State and its major trading partner which arguably crippled our biggest market for 20 years.  Second, de Valera took these actions in a very different world from the one in which we live.  It was a world in which the State could exist in splendid isolation from its trading partners.  That is not the case today.  We have to exist in a modern world in which international finance and international agreements made by the State must be fulfilled, including the bank guarantee which my colleagues in the Labour Party opposed and which the Government Deputy Finian McGrath supported brought forward.  Each of us is suffering the consequences and every taxpayer is shouldering the burden of that guarantee.  I propose that taxpayers should not be further burdened and that the weakest and most vulnerable should not be saddled with further taxes.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_595">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of my party's amendment to the motion.  Unless someone has been living under a stone in the past few years, we are all well aware of the extent of the financial crisis gripping the country.  We are also well aware of the economic abyss in which we find ourselves and, unfortunately, the banking crisis that was not the creation of the Government.  In many respects, the country is in receivership.  We are dealing with the results of arch conservative, right-wing politics which brought the country to a halt and literally put us into receivership.  To take a particular angle to the debate without being cognisant of the historical context is akin to throwing a dart in the dark.  It is aimless.  In that context, I will confine my remarks to the manner in which home owners are struggling and also the bank bonuses in terms of the culture in the banks which has not been brought to an end in recent times.  We must be cognisant of where we are going and ensure the mistakes are not repeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">One in ten home owners is struggling to pay his or her mortgage and trying to stave off repossession.  A total of 400,000 people are out of work.  The previous speaker was correct when he stated that when people took out mortgages, they did so in good faith and they believed they would be able to repay them.  Unfortunately, given the economic and unemployment crisis, that is no longer the case.  As the Taoiseach put it so well today, we are confronted by a challenging economic crisis, but it is not an impossible one.  With the right decisions we can hope to turn the corner in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Amid the structural changes taking place we must not forget about the thousands of ordinary people who are bearing the brunt of the profound economic crisis brought about by our predecessors in government, Fianna Fáil and its friends in the Green Party.  A recent national survey carried out by the Irish League of Credit Unions revealed many worrying trends about people's financial circumstances, including that 20% of Irish home owners had just €70 left in any one month after they had paid their mortgage and utility bills.  Four out of five people said they were worried that they would not be able to cope if unforeseen expenses arose.  In that context, it is urgent that we introduce legislation to provide measures to assist struggling home owners.  The Minister eloquently brought forward a number of strong points in defence of what could be done in that context, but it is imperative that we drive to take action at this junction to help those facing eviction by the banks, those before the courts because they are facing bankruptcy and those struggling to make ends meet.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Analysts have indicated that the European Central Bank will raise interest rates twice within the next 12 months, with the first of these possible increases most likely to take place either next month or the month after.  That is extremely worrying because we are dealing with people trying to exist on much reduced incomes.  In addition, we have seen the appalling situation in recent weeks where some banks have introduced increased banking charges, which is making it almost impossible for some people to survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Recently I called on the Government to press ahead with legislation promised in the programme for Government to provide relief for struggling home owners.  It is important for us to offer a <i>quid pro quo</i> to those who are struggling.  We have seen the manner in which the banks have been recapitalised and the manner in which the previous Government bent to their every whim and need.  When that is balanced with what the struggling home owner has to face, there is a huge cry for parity of esteem.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The ugly culture of paying banking bonuses sickens people to their core.  The Committee of European Banking Supervisors published guidelines in January which advised governments across Europe on various new EU rules for bankers' pay.  One of these guidelines is that investment banks should be forced to limit bonuses to a set multiple of bankers' salaries agreed with financial watchdogs.  It is important that we press ahead with such measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">There are many analysts and experts in what is a complex area.  Every time we turn on the television the parliamentarian or the politician is sidelined in favour of an expert.  It is experts who got the country into trouble, based largely on right-wing economic policies administered by Fianna Fáil and its friends in the Progressive Democrats and the Green Party.  In my previous incarnation as a Senator there was one esteemed Independent Senator with expertise in banking who championed Mr. Seán FitzPatrick and Mr. Michael Fingleton and berated Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland for not following the practices and business model of Anglo Irish Bank.  Imagine how badly off we would be if they had listened to his advice.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">Ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt don Ghrúpa Teicniúil as ucht an rúin seo a ardú anocht.  Níl aon amhras orm ach go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go dtiocfaimis muid i gcabhair ar dhaoine atá ag fulaingt de bharr an lag trá eacnamaíochta, iad siúd go mór mhór atá i mbaol a gcuid tithe a chailleadh.  I commend the Technical Group on this motion which gives us an opportunity to debate this issue.  Obviously there are aspects of the motion I would not agree with and I will address these later in my contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I have always had a firm political belief that as many people as possible should be facilitated to own their own homes and that there is a huge value to be put on the stability of families through home ownership.  Last Christmas, I was pleased to introduce a scheme facilitating an extra discount for people buying local authority houses.  Anyone who walks around local authority estates can see the houses that have been bought because the owners care for them and do extra work to maintain them.  The stability of society as a whole is hugely aided by a high rate of family home ownership.  I also subscribe to the idea that the State should assist those who have fallen on hard times to hold on to their homes and that doing so is not only good social policy but also good financial policy.  I would make exceptions where people bought trophy homes and also where, for social or medical reasons, people cannot sustain a mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The question is what one can do in practice to assist those who are most in need.  How can one do so in a cost effective manner to ensure a long-term sustainable arrangement for people?  The previous Government looked at this issue and commissioned a report by the expert group on mortgage arrears and personal debt.  I believe these recommendations should be implemented in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">I am surprised there was very little in the Minister's speech about a key issue, namely, a radical restructuring of the mortgage interest supplement scheme, as well as an arrangement for those who could not pay the interest on their loan to pay only 66% of the interest over a five year period.  The latter point was mentioned in the Minister's speech and I understand the banks are facilitating that.  The problem with that, however, is that one is only putting off the evil day which will chase one forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">Whether in business or in private life, I have always believed that if an indebted person starts deferring their debt or takes out more loans, they are just digging a deeper hole.  If the State believes a person has a future, the only way to help is by providing cash.  It is not rocket science.  The mortgage interest supplement provides cash.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">There were also recommendations in the report on how some of the extra money to be spent on the mortgage interest supplement could be recouped from banks.  In particular, there was a recommendation that if mortgage interest supplement was being paid, the banks could not charge any higher rate of interest than the basic rate of the loan.  If they got the mortgage interest supplement directly, the banks would have no greater risk and, therefore would not charge a higher interest rate.  The way forward is to change the terms of the mortgage interest supplement.  During my term as Minister, work was ongoing in the Department of Social Protection in this regard and we had intended to introduce measures this spring.  A schedule has been laid out by my officials to ensure this happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">I agree with Government speakers that there are those who think one can have a general write-off of a huge amount of bank debt on the part of mortgage holders and that there will be no cost to be paid by anyone.  This is obviously untrue.  Any general write-off of debt would require further recapitalisation of the banks by the taxpayer.  An indiscriminate write-off of debts by the taxpayer therefore would not only be very expensive but would also be inherently unfair.  One might be writing off banks' liabilities for people who could well afford to pay.  They made the choice and can afford to pay the piper.  Equally, however, I am totally opposed to those who say that people took out mortgages of their own volition, that it is their responsibility to pay them and that the taxpayer should in no way help those who are down on their luck one way or another.  It is uncharitable to take that attitude, as well as being unfair and inequitable.  In addition, it is a simplistic way of approaching such issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The big question is who should be helped and how.  Anyone who bought a family home at what was the going market rate at the time, even if they purchased it at the top of the market, and who cannot now repay their mortgage because of loss of income or employment should be assisted if they are facing serious difficulties.  The way to do this is to assess individually those in difficulty.  There is no other way of doing it.  People in difficulty should avail of the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which will undertake the assessment along with community welfare officers.  In that way, one could decide who would be helped and the maximum number of households, per million euro spent, could be assisted.  Every household could then be helped according to its individual needs in an open and transparent way.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">There will be those who will argue that we cannot afford to extend this scheme.  I would not agree with this as the direct cost of housing families who lose their homes because of repossession, not to mind the indirect costs to society and the families involved, is much greater than helping people through a temporary period of difficulty.  It is also worth noting that the mortgage interest supplement currently costs approximately €70 million per annum compared with almost €1 billion for the rental interest supplement.  I think it was €994 million at the last count.  What we invest in saving people's mortgages tends to be quite temporary because people get re-employed.  It also tends to be much less expensive than permanent social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">There are those who come up with great ideas, such as making 30 year mortgages into 60 year or 100 year mortgages.  It is total nonsense and irrational because the people we are talking about cannot pay the interest on their mortgages and, therefore, even if they get a total holiday on the capital, it will not solve the problem.  In fact, one of the proposals we had was that where the mortgage interest supplement was being paid, there would be no capital repayments to the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">During my time as Minister, I had prepared a schedule of implementation of the various steps concerning the mortgage interest supplement.  Some of them did not require any legislative change while others required primary or secondary legislation.  All of it was to have been done in the spring of 2011.  It was intended to set up a central mortgage interest supplement processing unit in the Department so that everyone would be treated equally.  The second decision, which did not require any legislation, was that the mortgage interest supplement would not cease until alternative arrangements had been made.  If the person got a job, that was fine, but if he or she did not, the supplement would not cease until alternative long-term arrangements had been made.  The third decision, which could also have been done without legislation, was to abolish the rule stating that a person could not get mortgage interest supplement if their house was up for sale.  That was total nonsense, so that step was to be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The fourth step was to address a provision that caught many couples who were dependent on two incomes.  When one income disappeared, they may have had to live on the lesser of two incomes.  There is a rule with the mortgage interest supplement that even if a person is working more than 30 hours per week, he or she can get mortgage interest supplement.  That was to have been abolished by enacting legislation because there should be no relationship between the hours worked and receipt of the supplement.  It should be based totally on a person's means and outgoings.  The mortgage interest supplement should be calculated solely on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">It was also intended that only interest would be paid to the bank if one was in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  In addition, because the supplement would be paid directly into the bank, the bank would not be allowed to charge any extra interest.  Furthermore, the bank would not be allowed to charge any capital.  Therefore, it could not put pressure on home owners to start clearing capital now that they were getting the mortgage interest supplement on the basis that they would not be getting the supplement if they did not need help.  The bank would be told that the mortgage interest supplement, which would be its lifeline, would not be paid.  There were several ways to pay for it.  The first, which was to transfer people into social housing if the house is repossessed, is way more expensive.  However, the other issue was that we had said MIS would not be paid for the first six months of difficulty or unemployment and following forbearance by the banks, the supplement would kick in if the householders problems were not resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">A general write-off of large mortgages with no connection to the ability of the mortgage holders to pay or their income would be a wasteful and irrational way to go.  Some people say assistance should not be given, but that has never been our way.  We have always given assistance to those who have lost jobs.  By amending the MIS scheme and putting the resources that would otherwise have to be put into social housing into the scheme and getting rid of the crinkles in the scheme in the way I have outlined, we would have the means to directly help only those who need our help.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Those who do not need to be helped by, for example, doubling mortgage interest relief, will not be helped if they are 15 years into a mortgage and lose their jobs and they could have difficulties while many people would be helped who are happy at the moment because their incomes have increased and they have no problems paying for their house, including those who might have taken out relatively small borrowings because they had cash when purchasing.  We must target the resources because they are finite.  There is nothing we can give either by way of bank write-offs or direct support to people that will not have to be paid for by the taxpayer and, therefore, our finite resources must be targeted at those who need them and it must be made clear that the policy that the State has followed for many years in recognising the value of the family home will be protected and those who have difficulties will be assisted.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I have focused on the mortgage issue but, according to the MABS statistics, a huge number of people in severe financial difficulty do not have major difficulties with mortgages.  As Minister, every time I asked MABS officials the average personal debt, I expected them to say €200,000 or €300,000 but they often said it was between €30,000 and €50,000, which was at a low level.  Many people with debt problems do not have mortgages.  They are in local authority houses or in other rented accommodation or circumstances.  They do not own houses but they have problems with credit cards or credit union and finance company loans.  Having received various offers in the post, they took on large debts but the message I have for them is that help is available.  Nobody should go to bed at night worried about this.  They should get help and where this issue is approached in a systematic way by MABS, the problems can be handled and resolved because nobody under our system should go to jail over a debt.  The courts cannot, and do not, order people to pay that which they do not have.  That has been my experience in dealing with people over the years.  If a systematic approach is taken and people approach MABS, they can be helped to alleviate the terrible fear they are experiencing.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_619">There has been considerable media and political interest in the issue of distressed mortgages in recent weeks.  However, this problem is not new.  The number of families struggling to repay mortgages bought at the height of the boom has been steadily growing for the past two years.  Wage cuts, tax increases and increasing unemployment have forced more and more people into mortgage arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">As of December 2010, almost 45,000 households were in mortgage arrears for more than three months, of which 70% had been in arrears for more than six months.  When households in receipt of MIS are taken into account, the total number of people in mortgage distress reaches a staggering 80,000.  This represents a 50% increase in families unable to pay their mortgage since the end of 2009.  In turn, the number of repossessed homes in mortgage arrears almost doubled from 397 in 2009 to 585 in 2010.  These figures hide the reality of the tens of thousands of families who are not in mortgage arrears but who are paying an increasing proportion of their income to service boom time mortgages.  Over the coming 12 months, we can all agree that more of them will cross over into serious mortgage distress.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">In addition to the enormous human cost to individuals, families and communities, there is a massive economic cost in the increasing vulnerability of our banking system and the undermining of consumer spending.  According to the documents released last week by the Minister for Finance and recent Exchequer returns, it is clear that consumer spending is at an all-time low and the Government has had to revise the yield downwards under some tax headings.  This is not only a housing policy issue, as it directly impacts on job creation and the financial stability of the State.  Considering the scale of the problem, it is incredible that the outgoing Government was unable to come up with a set of proposals aimed at addressing it.  It was a little surreal to listen to the contribution of the previous speaker, who was a Minister only eight weeks ago.  Usually, on this side of the House, we say what we would do when we get into government but after 17 years in government, former Ministers are outlining what they wanted to do or what they intended to do.  It is a strange turnabout and perhaps that is the new strategy of these former Government members.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">While the expert group on mortgage arrears and personal debt acknowledged the scale of the problem, it failed to provide sustainable and affordable long-term solutions.  The Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government promises little more than longer moratoria, which simply pushes the problem further down the road, and bankruptcy legislation, the date and detail of which is not yet known.  That the Government parties main proposal is to increase mortgage interest relief from 5% and 10% for first-time buyers shows they do not understand the full extent of the problem.  The Government has signalled its intent to increase the financial hardship of tens of thousands of families across the State.  The updated memorandum of understanding with the EU and the IMF copperfastens that position.  The plan outlined in the programme for Government and the memorandum of understanding is to reduce tax credits, increase tax bands and introduce stealth taxes such as water charges and property charges at the same time as cutting the wages of low and middle earners and reducing social welfare benefits.  All this will push even more families into mortgage arrears and distress.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">In the coming period, Sinn Féin will launch detailed proposals on tackling mortgage distress and the guiding principles underpinning them will be threefold.  First, we will provide a mechanism for people to retain their family home where that option is in their long-term personal and financial interest.  This needs to be achieved with a minimum cost to the taxpayer and both the lender and the borrower will share the cost of the total loss of the value of the asset.  Second, where remaining in the family home is not a viable option, we propose to enable mortgage holders to trade down to a home and mortgage more suitable to their changed financial circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_624">It concerns me greatly that a pipe bomb was found in my home town of Trim two weeks ago.  The bomb detonated and caused some damage to the Wellington monument and to nearby houses.  Is the Minister happy with the security measures being put in place for the visits of Queen Elizabeth II and President Barack Obama given the rise in this type of criminal activity in recent weeks and, more to the point, following the assassination of Osama bin Laden at the weekend?  I read that Garda and Army intelligence officers are concerned that activists, currently keeping a low profile in the UK and Europe, could come here to take advantage of US President, Barack Obama's, visit to launch an attack in retaliation for the assassination.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">Osama bin Laden is dead but al-Qaeda is not and there may be a heightened possibility of retaliation on the UK and the USA.  With visits to Ireland in less than three weeks by the two heads of state of these countries taking place within hours of each other I wish to be assured that security has been stepped up to take the weekend's events into account.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_626">The use of explosive devices such as that employed recently in Trim is a matter of ongoing concern to me and to the Garda authorities, no matter who is responsible for them.  Garda strategies are very firmly focused on disrupting their use and, where sufficient evidence is available, proffering charges and bringing such persons before the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">The House should remember that there are significant penalties available to the courts following conviction for explosives related offences, including a penalty of life imprisonment for causing an explosion likely to endanger life, up to 20 years imprisonment upon conviction for an attempt to cause an explosion likely to endanger life, and up to 14 years imprisonment following conviction for possession of explosives.  As with all such incidents, the incident to which the Deputy refers is of concern and is the subject of an active, ongoing Garda investigation.  Clearly it would not be appropriate for me to go into the details of such investigations, but I appeal to anyone with any knowledge of the matter to share it with the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">With regard to the incident itself, the Garda authorities inform me that at approximately one o'clock in the morning of 21 April a car drew up near the Duke of Wellington monument in the centre of the town.  A device was thrown at the monument which caused a small explosion.  There were no injuries and damage was not caused apart from some scorch marks to the monument.  An Army explosive ordnance device team was called.  It examined the remains of the device which was deemed to be a pipe bomb-type of device.  Nobody has claimed responsibility for the incident.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">I cannot state categorically who was responsible for the incident.  It is quite possible, but not certain, that it may have been some sort of atavistic response to the announcement that Queen Elizabeth II is to visit the country later this month.  Opposition to Queen Elizabeth's visit is the response of a tiny minority of people.  We as a people and this country are fast approaching the centenary of having gained our independence.  It is a testament to our maturity as a nation that this visit will go ahead at this time.  Shortly thereafter we will welcome the President of the United States to our shores — a symbol of the special bond between our two nations.  I have no doubt that the people will give the traditional welcome to those visitors as it gives to all visitors and for which we are, rightly, renowned.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">The Garda Síochána is primarily responsible for the security of the visits of Queen Elizabeth and of President Obama.  I have the utmost confidence in the Commissioner and his officers, who I know are totally committed to ensuring these events pass off without incident.  The Garda Síochána, with the support of the Defence Forces, will continue to make all the necessary arrangements to make sure the appropriate level of security is in place for both visits.  I am sure people generally will understand the security arrangements which have to be made and will co-operate fully with them.  Security arrangements are a necessary feature of visits of this kind to any country and I am sure they will not detract from the great welcome which will be extended to our distinguished guests.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">There are a whole range of security considerations that must be taken into account in relation to the impending visits of Queen Elizabeth and President Obama.  Those considerations are based on an ongoing assessment of the risks involved.  The House will appreciate that it would be counterproductive for me to go into the detail of security arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">Obviously some people will seek to disrupt the visits.  The right to peaceful protest is an important one and one that my Government will always uphold — but we will not tolerate those who seek to break the law to cause disorder nor will we tolerate those who set out to maim or murder.  By their actions they display a barbaric and arrogant contempt for the constitutional civil and human rights vested in all who reside on or visit this island.  The visits will be welcomed by the vast majority of the people.  I reassure the House, that neither I, nor the Government, are complacent about the security measures which will be necessary to make these visits a success.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">These visits are also a statement to the world that Ireland still has much to offer.  For all the difficulties we face, there is every reason for us, working together, to be confident in our long-term future.  No tiny minority should be permitted to cloud that message, nor will they be allowed to so do.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">I apologise for not being available to speak earlier.  The changes to the primary school transport scheme announced in the 2011 budget is having an effect on families and local school communities.  This is a sensitive area and it is having a disconcerting impact on families, school communities, boards of management, parents councils and private bus operators.  I do not know where the changes to the various criteria have come from.  Free transport is a thing of the past.  It is a myth.  People do not have a problem with paying for it.  The issue relates to certainty on where one's children will be educated, continuity and more importantly that siblings would be allowed to attend the same school.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">The amalgamation of small schools has been an ongoing issue for decades.  It has proven detrimental in many cases.  I remember when it happened in my area in the 1960s.  We moved away from that approach and communities settled down and gelled again.  Guidelines were imposed about distances.  I understand the current minimum distance one must live from a school is now 2 km but, more importantly, if there is not a minimum of ten pupils a bus will not be provided.  If there are nine pupils they will not have any place to go, which is unnerving.  What independent evaluation has been carried out?  Previously, when schools were amalgamated the minimum distance one had to live from a school was set at 3 miles.  I never availed of school transport.  As there was no amalgamation we always took the children to national school by car.  Many people have begun to do so again given the significant increase in secondary school transport costs in recent years.  They are willing and happy to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">The change to school transport regulations is a complete bolt out of the blue.  It is a threat to many rural communities.  If one takes a school out of a community much community activity is removed.  Areas become denuded of population as there is no reason for people to live in a locality in the absence of a community network based around a school.  We have seen in the past that communities did not recover when schools closed.  Even farming communities die away and rural areas become more isolated.  The integrity of families is a concern in addition to the costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_637">Bus companies are also concerned about their viability.  Bus Éireann has had the franchise for the organisation of school transport.  What is the cost to it for the administration of the scheme?  The question of unfair competition arises as Bus Éireann has retained the best routes for itself.  If there was open competition in the transport area there would not be a need to close schools for financial reasons.  Two-teacher schools have been asked to submit reasons they should remain open.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">A two-pronged attack is being made on these rural schools.  This will be detrimental unless there is a fair and proper adjudication of the situation.  I am aware of a family where a child of seven years is already part of the scheme and will be able to continue in it for the next six years.  A younger sibling will not be allowed to avail of the transport, however, and will have to travel to school in another county.  As we are aware from sport and the GAA, county boundaries are a big issue in some rural areas.  Schools in towns may be doing all right and have sufficient numbers, but rural schools four miles or so out of town may be struggling with numbers.  None the less, these schools provide a valuable service to the community and the pupils and their families are happy with them.  Now, however, a younger sibling may have to attend the town school.  Will buses taking children to these rural schools be taken off their route if there are not sufficient students, for example, if numbers drop below ten?  There is great uncertainty in this area and I call for an independent evaluation of the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">Bus Éireann should also be obliged to open up the school bus routes to competition.  Private bus owners have provided a good service, not in rich areas but on routes not favoured by Bus Éireann.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this significant issue and look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_242" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_640">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Ciarán Cannon.  I will draw to his attention the comments made by the Deputy and will respond as best I can with the information available to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">A number of changes to the school transport scheme were introduced in the 2011 budget by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.  The changes regarding the primary school transport scheme derive from recommendations in the value for money report of the scheme and relate to the introduction of charges, changes to the so-called closed school rule and changes to the minimum numbers required to establish or maintain a service.  I will now give more detailed information on these changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">With effect from the 2011-2012 school year, a transport fee of €50 per annum will be introduced for eligible primary school pupils, with a maximum family charge of €110 applying for eligible primary pupils only.  Eligible children who hold a valid medical card are exempt from paying the charge.  As a consequence of the introduction of charges, parents now have to apply directly to Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department, for school transport for their children.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">The closed school rule for school transport eligibility purposes was introduced in the 1960s in circumstances where a primary school was closed and amalgamated with another.  No time limit has been applied to the closed school or central school rule.  In some cases, the primary school in question was closed up to 40 years ago and amalgamated with another school.  In some instances, a newer school has subsequently been built in the general area of the original closed school.  Under the current primary school transport scheme, however, the transport provided is to the amalgamated school only, even in circumstances where there is actually a newer school closer to the pupil's home.  A pupil in these circumstances is not eligible for free transport to the newer school.  The closed school rule can operate to distort parental decisions and result in pupils travelling longer distances than necessary or than were they to go to the nearest school.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">The specific changes announced with regard to the closed school rule are as follows.  From the commencement of the 2011-2012 school year, the distance criterion will be applied to all pupils attending primary schools and the exemption under the closed school rule will cease.  This means that children who reside less than 3.2 km or 2 miles from the school of attendance and who are availing of free transport to that school under the closed school rule will no longer be eligible for school transport.  From the 2012-2013 school year, eligibility based on the closed school rule and the central school rule will cease for all new children entering primary schools.  It is important, however, to emphasise that existing primary pupils availing of transport under the closed school rule will retain transport eligibility for the duration of their schooling, provided the requisite distance is met.  Moreover, given that the change in question will not come into being until September 2012, all new pupils enrolling this September will be eligible under the closed school rule.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">To put this issue fully into context, drawing on the report of the value for money review of the school transport scheme, the following facts are relevant.  First, in the 2009-2010 school year, transport services under the closed school rule operated to more than 800 primary schools, with almost 26,000 children — 54.4% of mainstream tickets issued — deemed eligible for school transport under this rule.  Second, according to sample studies undertaken for the value for money review estimates applied nationally, in the majority of cases where such transport has been provided, pupils in fact attend their nearest primary school.  While the application of the closed school rule is referred to in these cases, it does not mean they are not travelling to their nearest school.  Third, the transport of such a significant number of children, some of whom would not qualify for transport on the basis of the distance criterion alone, involves a cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">With regard to the change to school transport eligibility for pupils entering primary school in September 2012,  where eligibility will be by reference to the nearest school, available statistics, based on sampling undertaken as part of the value for money review, indicate that the impact of this element of the change will be limited as the majority of pupils categorised under the closed school rule are in fact attending their nearest school.  Therefore, the majority of families will not be affected by this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">The Department has requested Bus Éireann to conduct a detailed analysis of the on the ground impact for individual schools and the rural communities they serve.  This analysis will be based on the most up-to-date information available on current usage patterns and the information is expected to be available this summer.  The likely effects of this change can then be carefully examined well in advance of the 2012 implementation date.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">With regard to the minimum numbers required to establish or maintain a service, the changes mean that services under the minimum numbers, either single services or those which are part of double tripping arrangements, will be discontinued.  A pick-up density of pupils in a distinct locality on a particular route, increasing from the current minimum of seven to ten eligible children, will be required to establish or retain services.  All services transporting fewer than the minimum number of eligible children, either single services or those which are part of double tripping arrangements, will be discontinued with effect from the 2011-2012 school year.  This brings the minimum numbers required to establish services back to 2002 levels.  It should be emphasised that eligible pupils for whom a service is being withdrawn will be eligible to apply for the remote area grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_649">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and in so far as I have failed to address issues raised by him, I will ask the Minister of State to communicate directly with him.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_243">
            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_650">I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this issue.  The proposal of Bord na gCon to set up a racing franchise and export Irish greyhounds to the People's Republic of China has given rise to considerable concern among animal rights and welfare groups and ordinary dog owners.  I am sure the Minister of State and every Deputy will have received numerous letters and e-mails on the issue in recent days raising concerns about the possible export of greyhounds to a country which has no animal welfare legislation and no regulation, supervision or mechanism for protecting such animals.  There is no ban on the killing of dogs there and we are all aware that some dogs are regularly eaten or are on the menu in China.  Obviously, there is considerable scope for abuse under the circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">It is with a degree of trepidation that we have learned that Bord na gCon is to establish this link with China for a new greyhound industry there.  We have just got to the stage of providing legislation in this country, through the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, and this year we expect to deal with the aptly named Welfare of Greyhounds Bill.  It would be a retrograde step, when we are putting regulatory measures in place in this country to deal with the breeding of dogs, the prevention of abuse in that regard, and the welfare of greyhounds, which form a huge industry in Ireland, and ensuring there is adequate regulation and supervision in the industry, to open up an export market to a country that has no such regulation, measures or supervision and where we would only be in charge at long distance.  We must remember that the People's Republic of China is not around the corner but at the other side of the world.  While we could have the best of regulations here at home, we would have no power on a statutory basis to ensure there were any regulations in the People's Republic of China.  Quite clearly there could be a lucrative contract with Bord na gCon in respect of this commercial matter, but is this a suitable business for Ireland to get involved in unless we can ensure that animal welfare is protected?</p>
            <p eId="para_652">Can the Minister of State allay the fears that ordinary people have about greyhounds exported from Ireland?  There are fears that they would not be properly supervised in their racing career while in China.  There are concerns over how they are to be disposed of and dealt with after they have ceased to be of any use on the racetrack.  If there is no protection for animals we can only imagine the worst may happen in many instances.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has responsibility to grant approval and provide licences for any such export trade.  What detailed discussions have taken place with the Chinese authorities on the project?  Have there been discussions on animal welfare?  Are the Irish authorities in a position to supervise and persuade the Chinese authorities that if such a greyhound industry is established in the People's Republic then statutory provisions would be introduced to protect the welfare of the dogs involved?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ShaneMcEntee" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_244">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Shane McEntee)</from>
            <p eId="para_653">The greyhound racing and breeding industry sustains 11,000 full-time and part-time jobs directly and indirectly, many in rural communities.  It contributes an estimated €500 million into local economies around the tracks, which are spread throughout the country.  An independent review completed by Farrell Grant Sparks in 2009 stated that there is adequate evidence to support a strong argument that the greyhound industry constitutes a major source of direct and indirect employment, gives rise to considerable domestic and export earnings and is a key driver of substantial economic activity, especially in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">Some 17 greyhound tracks are licensed by Bord na gCon, of which Bord na gCon owns eight tracks at Shelbourne Park, Harold's Cross, Cork, Tralee, Waterford, Youghal, Limerick and Galway.  It also has a 51% share in the Mullingar track.  The greyhound breeding industry is very successful with more than 75% of greyhounds now running in the UK being Irish bred.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">Bord na gCon is a commercial State body established under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, chiefly to control greyhound racing and to improve and develop the greyhound industry.  Responsibility for Bord na gCon transferred to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 2010.  The board of Bord na gCon is responsible for leading and directing the activities of the company.  Bord na gCon has repeatedly confirmed its commitment to the highest standards of animal welfare in the greyhound industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is aware that Bord na gCon is exploring possible business opportunities in China and has been in contact with the Department in this regard.  Today I met the chairman and chief executive of Bord na gCon to discuss the proposal.  I made it clear that I am not in a position to approve the project as presented.  It was agreed that Bord na gCon would modify its proposal to exclude the export of greyhounds from Ireland but would continue to explore possibilities of developing the proposal to assist in the management of greyhound racing in China.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">Deputies will be pleased to note that Bord na gCon has demonstrated its commitment to greyhound welfare and in this regard has several initiatives in place to ensure consistent and appropriate welfare standards are met.  These include the attendance of veterinary surgeons at racing and at sales trials, employment of personnel to oversee greyhound welfare and the employment of a welfare manager.  Bord na gCon is also an active member of the International Greyhound Forum, an international group involved in the establishment of welfare standards and education.  A guide to best practice as to the care and welfare of greyhounds is available from the Bord na gCon website.</p>
            <p eId="para_658">Bord na gCon established a welfare committee in July 2009 which seeks to identify ways in which the welfare of greyhounds can be improved.  In addition Bord na gCon also operates the Retired Greyhound Trust which focuses on the adoption and re-homing of greyhounds when they finish racing.  In 2011 it launched a campaign, which is ongoing, to promote greyhounds as pets.  Officials of Bord na gCon investigate any complaints received regarding greyhound welfare and follow up on any issues of concern that arise through their everyday interaction with trainers or owners either on the racetrack or elsewhere.  Any proposal involving Bord na gCon engaging with the greyhound industry in China would have to give due consideration to animal welfare matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">Ireland attaches a high priority to animal welfare and, alongside our EU partners, is working to promote better animal welfare internationally.  The Government is preparing to introduce legislation in the current term which will provide a regime tailored specifically to enhancing the welfare of greyhounds.  The commitment of the Government to animal welfare in general is beyond doubt and is reflected among the priorities in the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">No greyhounds have been exported from Ireland to China in recent years.  Any proposal to export greyhounds from Ireland to China would require the establishment and agreement of export health certification protocols with the Chinese authorities and appropriate transport arrangements would have to be put in place to ensure the welfare of the animals in transit.  The Department endeavours to ensure that all exporters comply with the European Council regulation on the protection of animals during transport and related operations.  All EU member states including Ireland are working to promote better animal welfare internationally and in this regard Ireland has introduced national legislation giving effect to Regulation (EC) No. 1523/2007 of the European Parliament and Council dated 11 December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">The Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2010 passed its Second Reading and was scheduled for Committee and Remaining Stages in the Seanad but was not enacted before the general election.  The 2010 Bill had cross-party support in the Seanad and had the support of Bord na gCon, Dogs Trust and the DSPCA.  The Government intends to reintroduce the Bill very shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">Greyhounds have not been exported from Ireland to China in recent years.  It was agreed at today's meeting that Bord na gCon would modify its proposal to exclude the export of greyhounds from Ireland but would continue to explore possibilities of developing the proposal to assist in the management of greyhound racing in China.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_663">In recent times serious concern has been expressed by the local community and staff members about aspects of the service provided by Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  There have been consistent cutbacks in funding to the hospital in recent years as there have been to other hospitals.  There have been suggestions that one emergency department of the three in the north Dublin area would be closed and that the hospital at Blanchardstown could be the casualty or at least that its emergency service could be reduced to a 12-hour 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. service.  This would have drastic consequences for residents of catchment areas.  Some 35,000 attendances are recorded at the emergency department annually.  Trauma services are in great need in this hospital, which serves a very large catchment area and there is already great pressure on the other major hospitals in north Dublin, Beaumont and the Mater.  If the emergency department were scaled down, it would have a major impact on the community in the catchment area.  It would seriously inconvenience many people who would not have their own transport to travel long distances in the event that they were travelling there themselves.  It would also have a serious impact on the availability of junior doctors coming there to work who would then not get the experience and training they need.  We need an absolute assurance that the emergency departments in all three north Dublin hospitals are maintained on a 24-hour basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">There is a second issue of great concern.  Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown recruited its own junior doctors and was very successful in doing so.  Many young doctors were eager to go to Blanchardstown to get training and experience.  Now the HSE has intervened to stop this and proposes to recruit centrally and then dispatch people to different hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">I am told that between 50 and 60 junior doctors are needed for a number of hospitals and that the HSE is going to far-flung corners of the world to recruit.  This will be extremely cumbersome for Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  There are fears it will make it far more difficult for the hospital to recruit the necessary staff, bearing in mind the linking of recruitment systems generally in many areas.  We need the Minister to ensure hospitals will have the right to recruit locally.  Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown was doing so successfully.  Why fix something that is not broken?  The funding cuts are causing big problems for the community that needs the health service and also for health service staff who are under great pressure.  The flexibility afforded to hospitals such as that in Blanchardstown to recruit directly their own complement of junior doctors is absolutely necessary.</p>

          <speech by="#KathleenLynch" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_246">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_666">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy James Reilly.  The HSE has no plans to cease 24-hour emergency department cover at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  It is incumbent on the HSE to make the best use of available resources to meet the needs of the population served.  In doing so it must consider a range of factors, including changes in medical practice and possible changes in the way hospitals are organised and run.  However, there are no plans to change the current service at the emergency department in Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  The Minister is committed to ensuring acute hospital services at national, regional and local levels are provided in a clinically appropriate and efficient manner.  In particular, he wants to ensure as many services as possible can be provided safely in smaller, local hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">The Deputy referred to concerns about the recruitment of junior doctors for Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  In this regard, the HSE has implemented a detailed non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, recruitment project plan to facilitate and maximise recruitment, to ensure the shortage of junior doctors and any resulting impact on services are minimised and that patient safety is maintained.  In certain locations this can require a flexible reorganisation of services in order that patients' needs will be met in the best possible way.  Typically, where services are affected, it is because there is a shortage of doctors to fill rosters.  In such circumstances the focus is on the safe provision of services.  If there are insufficient numbers of doctors available, the HSE must make alternative arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">The HSE is working with a number of consultants, the Forum of Postgraduate Medical Training Bodies and others to recruit NCHDs in India and Pakistan for employment in Ireland commencing in July.  It has recently progressed the centralisation of recruitment which will support the filling of priority posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">An important part of providing high quality services in the right location will be the national clinical programmes being developed by the HSE.  These inter-related programmes aim to improve service quality, effectiveness and patient access and ensure patient care is provided in the service setting most appropriate to individuals' needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">The Minister is very supportive of the work done by Dr. Barry White and his colleagues in developing the clinical programmes and has had several discussions with him on how best to ensure they are implemented.  He has also made it clear that patient safety must be the overriding priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">One of the HSE's new clinical programmes, the national acute medicine programme, provides a framework for the delivery of acute medical services in hospitals that seeks to improve substantially and standardise care of acutely ill medical patients.  There is also a clinical programme being developed for the provision of emergency department services.  These programmes are aimed at helping each hospital to meet the needs of patients in the best possible way.  The acute medicine and emergency department programmes are clinically led and a whole-system approach is being taken, driven by a quality agenda.  The focus will be on implementation, not just on the recommendations</p>
            <p eId="para_672">The Government is committed to ensuring appropriate services, including emergency department services, can be provided safely in hospitals such as that in Blanchardstown.  The Minister will continue to work with the HSE to secure the best service for patients in the right location.  I thank the Deputy for raising this subject.</p>

            <p eId="para_675">I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 40 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">The Government is strongly committed to implementing a jobs and growth strategy.  We intend announcing a Jobs Initiative as committed to in the Programme for Government on the 10th of May.  I would anticipate that any necessary legislation to give effect to the measures outlined in the Jobs Initiative, will be published shortly thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">The Programme for Government sets out in broad terms the measures that will be implemented as part of this Initiative.  The measures are designed to lift public morale and confidence in the economy, to provide jobs, to provide suitable job placement for unemployed persons and to encourage spending by consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_678">In terms of the specific detail, officials from my own and Minister Howlin's Department are working closely with other Departments in preparing the proposals and assessing the quantitative and qualitative impacts.  As has been previously signalled any costs arising in connection with the Jobs Initiative will have to be counter-balanced by the implementation of offsetting measures.  This will ensure that we will continue to underpin our fiscal sustainability while also bringing forward policies to assist economic growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">Officials are continuing to assess the compensatory measures to be introduced to fund the Jobs Initiative.  In order to ensure the Jobs Initiative is successful, we want to ensure the measures, while fiscally neutral overall, have the least negative economic impact possible.  All of the measures we will introduce will be costed as accurately as possible to ensure that the requirement for budgetary neutrality is respected and that is why we are closely examining a range of options.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">In terms of the effect of the measures being introduced as part of the Initiative, getting people back to work is the number one priority of this Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_682">While the opinion piece in question was headed "Ireland's taxpayers must share the pain" the bulk of the article dealt with the author's views on a number of issues in the area of banking supervision and crisis resolution.  The piece is one of a number of recent public statements by the individual concerned in connection with Ireland.  There was for instance a lengthy interview with <i>The Irish Times</i> in January last when he set out his perspective on, amongst other things, the events that led to Ireland availing of the EU-IMF Support Programme.  The author laid the blame for our current difficulties on the policies pursued by the previous Government and the failures in regulation of the financial sector it had presided over.  The current Government is determined that Ireland will rectify the public finances in a way that is fair to taxpayers and citizens and that will enable Ireland to continue to meet its obligations.  I do not support the author’s inference that Irish taxpayers somehow deserve the austerity that is now necessary to put the country’s finances on a proper footing.  We are acutely conscious of the serious impact on our citizens of the unprecedented measures we have to undertake which are designed to restore our country’s economy and reputation as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">On banking matters in particular, the Government is taking decisive steps to address the difficulties in the Irish banking sector.  In my Statement of 31 March last, I announced the significant reorganisation of the domestic banking sector with the creation of two pillar banks.  This will be accompanied by the significant recapitalisation of the remaining institutions well in excess of currently accepted international norms in order to provide complete confidence in relation to the stability of the remaining domestic institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_684">Deputies will be aware that the ECB has welcomed the recent stress tests assessing the capital needs of Irish banks and indicated its support for the Government's commitment to ensure that the capital needs of the institutions are met in a timely manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">Finally the article also suggests that the integration of independent prudential supervision at European or at least at Eurozone level may well be a necessary development to address the issues that given rise to the current difficulties in the financial sector.  While there is no doubt that there has been a lot of convergence between Member States in the area of financial supervision, there is no appetite across Member States as a whole at this stage for a single EU Regulator.  It is worth bearing in mind that the de Larosière Report specifically stopped short of such a recommendation and the Commission's proposals did not include any such provision.  The most important issue at this stage is to ensure that a system is established to provide greater oversight of the financial system.  The European Systemic Risk Board and the European Supervisory Authorities will achieve this.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_689">The Joint Administrators announced last week the acquisition by Liberty Mutual Direct Insurance Company Ltd (LMDI), a joint venture between Liberty Mutual (LM) and Anglo Irish Bank, of certain assets and liabilities of Quinn Insurance Limited (in administration) (QIL).  They see this as the best option for the policy holders of QIL.  A twelve to fourteen week transition process will now commence, during which time LMDI will obtain all the necessary regulatory consents from parties, including the Central Bank.  At the outset, it should be noted that, under the sales process of QIL, neither I as Minister for Finance, nor the Government, had any role in assessing the Quinn Group proposals recently presented for the future of Quinn Insurance Ltd (QIL) in administration, as this was a matter solely for the Joint Administrators, who were appointed by the High Court.  Deputies will be aware that this sales process was conducted by MacQuarie Group on behalf of the administrators.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">The Joint Administrators have indicated to my Department that the Quinn proposal was only received recently, several months after the closing date for submission of interest.  They say that the proposal was highly conditional in nature as it depended on amongst other things on the State intervening to facilitate the transfer of €2.8bn of debt from Anglo to one of the viable banks and to require that bank to provide a further €500m loan to the Quinn Group, as well as agreement with the bondholders.  As such they saw no likelihood for such a proposal being facilitated in the current economic climate, as the taking on of such loans by other banks was likely to compound their already difficult position and in addition would also be likely to contravene European State Aid rules.  They were also of the view that reaching agreement with the bondholders in relation to the releasing of the guarantees over QIL assets was going to be extremely difficult if not close to impossible.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">The decision in relation to the appointment of the Share Receiver by Anglo is very much a commercial one and I in my role as Minister for Finance had no input into this matter.  While I understand the concern being raised on whether this decision will have a negative impact on the trading of the Quinn manufacturing group following the removal of the Quinn family members and the senior managers from their employment, I am informed that other scenarios might well have prompted court action to put the Group into receivership with the potential for immediate significant job losses.  By comparison the appointment of a Share Receiver gives the Group grounds for considerable hope of a viable future.  This viable future however depends to a large degree on the willingness by everybody, particularly those engaged in several recent negative events, to engage wholeheartedly with the new ownership arrangements, because if this does not materialise then over time this is likely to negatively impact on the trading performance of the Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">Overall, I share the view that the recent steps taken to sell the QIL business to LMDI and to appoint a share receiver to the wider group as being positive and will do a lot to protect jobs in the border region — the protection of which is important for the state and for the local economies in these communities.  The proposal put forward by the Quinn Group was not in the economic or financial interests of the state.</p>

            <p eId="para_696">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has successfully concluded the first and second quarterly programme review mission with the Troika, that is, the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF, which took place between the 5th and 15th April 2011.  The purpose of the quarterly review mission was to evaluate performance against targets to date on all the elements of the programme of financial support for Ireland including fiscal developments, the macroeconomic outlook, progress on commitments in the restructuring of the financial sector and structural reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">The Government is pleased that the Troika mission assessed the Irish Programme to be on track and in their view the targets in the Programme have been met.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">During this programme review, a number of Government members along with senior officials, met with representatives from the Troika and assured them of this Government's commitment to the fiscal targets set out in the EU/IMF Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">In the negotiations with the Troika, the Government set out measures that we would be seeking to include in the revised Programme.  During the negotiations, it became clear that there was sufficient flexibility within the Programme to allow us to include these important policy measures, while respecting the overall fiscal parameters and goals of the programme.  The revised Memorandum of Understanding will now include, amongst others, measures dealing with the Jobs Initiative, the minimum wage and the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_700">No fiscal consolidation targets were changed including the elements related to public expenditure.  During the programme review, the Troika were informed of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure which will be completed in September 2011.  Based on the outcome of the Review and in consultation with the Troika, the Government will introduce budgetary changes which will aim to fully realise efficiencies identified, while securing the overall budgetary consolidation for 2012 to which Ireland is committed.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">This Government is committed to promoting growth and creating jobs which is central to any recovery strategy.  The Troika has agreed to the Government's plan to implement a Jobs Initiative.  The initiative will promote confidence to provide opportunities for people to go to work and for employers to be able to get credit and invest in their business and to stimulate the Irish national economy.  The Jobs Initiative may result in compositional changes between expenditure and tax which will be done on a fiscally neutral basis. The details of the Jobs Initiative will be announced in the Dáil on 10th May 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">The Review will be formally completed with the consideration by Eurogroup, ECOFIN and the IMF Executive Board of the reports by their various staffs on progress to date — and the proposed amendments.  The final documents will be made publicly available when final approval occurs on 15th and 16th May.</p>
            <p eId="para_703">As agreed, the Government will continue to consult with the IMF, the European Commission and the ECB on any changes to the policy measures outlined in the agreed support programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_709">I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 51 and 53 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">The Deputies will be aware that on 22 March 2011, the Central Bank of Ireland published a consultation paper proposing the implementation of new statutory fitness and probity powers for the financial services industry.  In this regard, the Central Bank is seeking views on proposed new statutory grounds which are identified in the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 and will set the requirements for entry into and removal from a senior position within regulated firms.  This Act provides additional criteria on when the Central Bank can use its powers to refuse an application to appoint an individual to a senior position or remove someone, views are being sought on what senior positions should be subject to the new regime.  The Central Bank expects the new regulations and statutory standards implementing the regime will come into effect from September 2011.  The Central Bank has requested interested parties to submit their proposals by 20 May 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">In addition, the Head of Financial Regulation, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, announced that the Central Bank is planning to review the fitness and probity of all existing executive and non-executive directors of banks which have received State support.  The Central Bank will assess any incumbent directors who plan to be in post after 1 January 2012 against the new standards, including competence and track record in the period leading up to the financial crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">The Deputy will be aware that in my statement on the Nyberg Report in this House on 20 April 2011, I set out a number of measures designed to strengthen Bank boards and bank management.  These measures provide that the Chairman of each institution provides me and the NTMA with a Board Renewal Plan, each institution will also be asked to provide a Management Renewal Plan.  The Board Renewal Plan will set out for each institution the steps to ensure that the skills and competence levels of board members are fully adequate to meet the demands of the current and future banking system.  In this regard, a programme of rotation of board members, commencing with board members appointed before September 2008 will be expected as part of the plan.  This will ensure a smooth process which will ensure the succession of incumbent board members who were in place before September 2008.  I expect this succession to be completed by 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">In addition, my Department recently placed advertisements in the national papers seeking expressions of interest from suitably qualified persons for inclusion among those to be appointed or nominated to Boards of Directors of Banks.  This gives all persons who are interested in and qualified to act as Directors the opportunity to advise the Minister of their interest.   The advertising for expressions of interest should ensure a high calibre field from which Directors may be chosen and makes the process more open and transparent.  It is part of the commitments given in the Programme for Government to re-structure bank boards and replace directors who presided over failed lending practices.  Closing date for receipt of expressions of interest is Thursday 12 May. These measures will complement the Central Bank's review of the fitness and probity of the public interest directors in the banks and ensure that people operating at senior levels in financial institutions are fit and proper to undertake their roles.</p>

            <p eId="para_715">As the Deputy is aware, the majority of the State's financing needs over the period 2011 to 2013 will be met through the funding provided under the EU/IMF programme of assistance.  However, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) is planning to return to the markets before the end of the term of the programme once conditions have become more receptive.  The NTMA is in constant contact with market participants and will advise me when it feels that the time is right to re-enter the markets.  While the interest rates at which we can borrow will obviously be a key determinant in this decision, they will not be the only factor.  In any event, it would not be wise to speculate about what these rates may be as this would harm the State's ability to access funds at the most competitive rate possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">The best means to ensure that we can re-enter financial markets at favourable rates is by convincing investors of our determination to restore stability to our public finances and implement policies that will see us return to sustainable economic growth.  In this regard, the Government is committed to implementing the measures necessary to bring our deficit below 3 per cent of GDP by 2015. The upcoming Jobs Initiative will underline our commitment to a policy of consolidating the fiscal position while also providing support to the labour market, thereby assisting both household and business confidence which will in turn help support economic recovery.</p>

            <p eId="para_720">As the Deputy may be aware, a joint restructuring and work out plan for Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society was submitted to the European Commission on 31 January for approval under State Aid rules; this was in line with the timelines agreed under the terms of the EU/IMF Programme.  In accordance with Government policy, the plan provides for the work out of the assets over a period of time that remain in these institutions after transfers to NAMA in a manner that seeks to protect the financial system as a whole and also to minimise the capital losses associated with this work out.  The sale of deposits and corresponding assets, which has now taken place, is included as a first step in the plan.  The plan also provides for the merger of Anglo and INBS.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">It is the Government's intention that while the plan envisages a wind down of the combined entity over 10 years that if possible this will be achieved earlier than that but this depends on a number of variables including market appetite for the assets.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">The exact timeframe for a decision on this plan is a matter for the European Commission in the first instance. However, I announced in my Statement on 31 March that an assessment of the capital requirements of both institutions will be available in May and it is likely the European Commission will await the outcome of this before making a final decision.  The national authorities continue to engage closely with the European Commission and the other bodies on this plan and it is expected that the restructuring plan process will be finalised with the European Commission in the coming weeks.</p>

The recently published Report of the Review Group on State Assets makes a number of recommendations for reforming the economic regulators, including transferring responsibility for their supervision and performance measurement to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation on account of its responsibility for competition policy.  The Government is considering these and other options for reform of the economic regulators in light of current circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_745">I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 177 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">The Joint Administrators announced last week the acquisition by Liberty Mutual Direct Insurance Company Ltd (LMDI), a joint venture between Liberty Mutual (LM) and Anglo Irish Bank, of certain assets and liabilities of QIL.  A 12-14 week transition process will commence immediately during which time LMDI will obtain all the necessary regulatory consents from parties including the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">As Minister for Finance I have had no direct dealings with Liberty in relation to this transaction including the issue of the future of all existing job-holders. However, I have been informed by the Joint Administrators that aside from the redundancies in Manchester all the 1570 in the QIL have been protected for at least two years.  Many of these jobs are in the border areas both north and south and their protection is important for the local economies in these communities. The Joint Administrators have also advised that existing locations will be maintained aside from Navan.  I understand that the Navan jobs will be redeployed to Cavan and Blanchardstown.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">What is also reassuring is that the business has being purchased by a company which has an impressive track record in the insurance industry and which is also very conscious of the importance of ensuring competition in the Irish insurance market and appreciates its central role in providing employment and economic development in the border region and further afield.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">It should be noted that LMDI have purchased the front and back Irish book.  The Joint Administrators are confident that all the UK business written since their appointment is profitable, and therefore in order to encourage Liberty/Anglo to take over this portion of the business (UK front book) they have agreed to continue to write profitable motor policies until 31 December 2012.  Liberty Mutual will administer all aspects of any new and existing policies (including claims handling) and will have the option to purchase the UK front book from QIL at any point up 31 December 2012.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_751">The moratorium on recruitment and promotion, introduced by the Government at the end of March 2009 allows for certain general exemptions in the Education and Health Sectors for the filling of certain key posts as well as for the Local Authorities in relation to certain key posts.  Information in relation to the posts covered by these general exemptions may be sought from the relevant Ministers.  While Departments have been implementing the moratorium in respect of themselves and the bodies under their aegis, there are occasions where a Department needs to fill a post, in either the case of a civil service post or in relation to a public service post in a body under the aegis of the Department.  Such exemptions to the moratorium require the sanction of the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">Each request for an exception is assessed on a case by case basis.  Approval to fill posts is based on the business case made including consideration of, for example:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_753">a. statutory posts which have to be filled for legal reasons;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_754">b. safety related posts where a failure to fill them could leave the state open to potential legal liabilities or for security reasons;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_755">c. in order to ensure the continuity of essential services;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_756">d. where the failure to fill a post could result in a breach of EU/international regulations etc.;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_757">e. some specialist/technical posts are required to ensure continuity of core operations e.g. legal officers; laboratory staff, maritime safety, etc.;</p>
            <p eId="para_758">Departments and Offices do have to exhaust other possibilities such as redeployment, the re-assignment of staff or the re-organisation of work before applying for an exception to the moratorium.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">In addition, as part of the Employment Control Framework 2011-2014 for the Health Sector, the HSE has discretion to fill a limited number of posts on exceptional grounds to support the development of integrated health care and its transformation programme. However, as part of this facility, posts of equivalent value in non-frontline areas must be suppressed for any exception made.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">Details of the individual exemptions sought by each Department in respect of Civil Service and Public Service posts this year are set out in tables 1 and 2, respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">Civil Service</p>
            <p eId="para_762">Table 1 sets out the details of exceptions to the moratorium which have been sought in respect of the Civil Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">Since my appointment on March 9 2011, exceptions have been sought to fill 134 posts of which 13 were refused and 9 are still under consideration. Of the 112 approved, however, only some 14 of these posts will in time involve recruitment of extra staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">In addition sanction has also been given for some 40 temporary posts to the CSO for Census 2011 and there has also been sanction, as is normal, for various temporary "summer relief" type posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">Public Service</p>
            <p eId="para_766">Table 2 sets out the breakdown of exceptions to the moratorium which have been sought in respect of the wider Public Service. My Department has received 6 requests resulting in 20 posts being sanctioned.</p>

            <p eId="para_1361">The position is that there is a commitment in the new Programme for Government to carry out a review of the Universal Social Charge (USC) and I would anticipate that the review will be completed in time for Budget 2012.  I would encourage all interested parties to join the review of the USC by way of submission to my Department.  My Department is currently accepting submissions from interested parties, however, if changes to the USC are being proposed I would request well thought-out and workable solutions to fill any revenue gaps created.  The focus must be on maintaining the €4 billion yield.</p>
            <p eId="para_1362">I should point out that the USC is progressive and when all charges on income are taken together we have a highly progressive taxation system.  Ireland has one of the most progressive taxation systems in the entire OECD.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">Finally, we must have a sustainable, robust taxation system going forward and the USC is part of that system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1365">The Joint Administrators announced last week the acquisition by Liberty Mutual Direct Insurance Company Ltd (LMDI), a joint venture between Liberty Mutual (LM) and Anglo Irish Bank, of certain assets and liabilities of QIL.  A 12-14 week transition process will commence immediately during which time LMDI will obtain all the necessary regulatory consents from parties including the Central Bank of Ireland.  It should be noted that there is no State commitment which is specific to the Liberty Mutual Direct Insurance Company Ltd (LMDI) preferred bid for the business of Quinn Insurance Ltd in direct cash terms, guarantees or underwriting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1366">The Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) is however available to cover the deficit which is expected to arise in the run-off of the remaining parts of QIL not purchased by LMDI.</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">In this regard, I in my role as Minister for Finance may on the recommendation of the Central Bank advance to the ICF under Section 5 of the 1964 Insurance Act such sums as I think appropriate to enable payments out of the fund to be made expeditiously. Any sums of this nature are recoupable over time through the placement by the Central Bank of a levy on the insurance industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">I will consider such a request if it should arise in the same way that I would consider any request of this type no matter who the preferred bidder was.</p>

            <p eId="para_1371">I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 61 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1372">As the Deputies will be aware the Nyberg Commission of Investigation recently published its Report. The main findings of the Commission, in relation to the role of auditors, were:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1373">auditors' commentary regularly focuses only on issues which they consider relate to the accuracy of the historic accounts</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1374">in the absence of an express requirement for the auditors to do so, there appears to have been no challenging dialogue with the covered banks on their business models and their growing property and funding exposures.  Such dialogue could have highlighted the business model risks and might have influenced the banks in relation to their growing vulnerabilities as the Period progressed.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1375">that it was unfortunate that sufficient, timely and challenging auditor dialogue was not used to influence the banks' business models and lending practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">These findings and recommendations raise a number of issues for the audit profession concerning how it sees its own role and its relationship to both client firms and to external statutory and other stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">It is clear however that the Commission of Investigation generally accords with the view that the audit profession should be able to contemplate an enhanced role in co-operation with supervisory authorities, while recognising their respective statutory functions.  This is a view which I generally support and indeed I understand that the Central Bank has commenced a process of engagement with the audit profession to explore the potential for enhanced, regular dialogue between auditors and supervisors and how the profession can best assist the Bank in carrying out its supervisory functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1378">I also welcome the fact that the representative body, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, is itself seeking to actively engage in this debate and is currently undertaking an industry-level review of the role of statutory audit which is considering issues such as the scope of the audit; how the audit profession interacts with and reports to shareholders and the information included in such reports; relationships between auditors and supervisors; and how the profession is regulated.  This review of course extends beyond the audit of financial institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1379">In addition, I am aware that the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) has a statutory role for the supervision of the accountancy bodies' regulation and monitoring of their members.  In this role, the IAASA has contacted the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland (the Institute) with a view to establishing the Institute's regulatory response to the emergence of issues into the public domain in December 2008.  Subsequent to this, the Institute's Complaints Committee, which is the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board (CARB), appointed a Special Investigator to examine the role that any of its members or member firms may have played in events at Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_1380">Separately, in 2010, CARB also initiated a review of the 2008 audits by member firms of the "covered" financial institutions.  The scope of this review, which takes place under the CARB Quality Assurance remit, was approved by its Board following consultation with IAASA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">The review is focusing on the application of appropriate procedures during the audit of accounts for 2008 year end, specifically in respect of loan valuations and provisions for impairments of those loans.  The CARB Board appointed an independent expert to oversee the review and I have been informed that the Board expects to publish a report in the summer of 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_1383">The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) was established on 2 April 2001 under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 for the purpose of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 until the year 2055, or such other year as may be specified by order.  Subsequent amendments to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act provide that the Minister for Finance may direct the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to invest in certain credit institutions, to buy Government bonds and, until 2013, to provide money to the Exchequer for capital purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">The total value of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, according to its most recently-published figures, was €23.2 billion at 31 March 2011.  This figure included €7.9 billion invested in Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks on the direction of the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">On foot of a Ministerial direction, €5.5 billion in cash was set aside as the first part of a phased de-risking of the NPRF in February 2011 in anticipation of its contribution required under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.   This left some €9.8 billion in the Discretionary Portfolio (the assets available for investment at the discretion of the NPRF Commission) at end-March 2011 values.

            <p eId="para_1398">The Central Bank has advised me that the process of issuing new bonds is normally through underwriting, where one or more securities firms or banks form a syndicate buying the entire bond issue from the issuer and then re-selling to investors.  Primary issuance is arranged by these syndicates who contact potential investors and advise the bond issuer in terms of timing, tenor and pricing of the bond issue.  The bond issuer will likely have little knowledge of the original owners of the bonds; also these initial investors may over time sell the bonds to other investors.  Bonds are usually issued in bearer form which means that the purchasers of the bonds are unknown, with the bonds usually held by a securities depository company (e.g. Euroclear and Clearstream).  When paying interest and principal the bond issuer will transfer the required funds to the securities depository company who in turn will pay the funds through to the bondholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1399">The function of the securities depository company is to receive the appropriate interest or principal payment for the entire bond issue from the issuer and to distribute the required amounts to the individual bondholders.

            <p eId="para_1405">Farmers who are registered for VAT account for VAT in respect of all their taxable activities, whether those activities consist solely of farming or both farming and other activities such as the generation of electricity for provision to the national grid.  In turn they are entitled to claim input credit for VAT charged on the installation of renewable energy microgeneration equipment for use in their taxable activities.  In so far as farmers who are not registered for VAT are concerned, they are not in the normal course entitled to credit for, or repayment of, VAT incurred by them on their business inputs.  The Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 25) Order, 1993 provides for refunds to unregistered farmers for tax borne on the "construction, extension, alteration or reconstruction of any building or structure which is designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business".  However, while the installation of renewable energy microgeneration equipment may be the construction of a structure, such a structure is not "designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business".  It is designed rather to generate electricity for wherever required.  Consequently, the installation of alternative energy generators does not come within the scope of the VAT refund order.</p>

As I indicated in a reply to PQ 5399 on 23 March, the Government will only be in a position to decide on the timing and the structure for setting up the Strategic Investment Bank when the necessary detailed assessment and planning work has been done.  Therefore it would be premature to discuss its functions and responsibilities at this stage.

While our external funding partners must be consulted —they are after-all providing significant funding to us —I would stress that the policies currently being followed are those of the Irish Government.  These policies are about restoring stability and repairing our international reputation.

There was no cost to the Exchequer in relation to this report as all costs were met by the Central Bank of Ireland.

However, it is not expected that the State will provide this full amount and the debt forecasts which are contained in the Stability Programme Update recently submitted to the European Commission are predicated upon the State providing €20 billion in capital support, some €10 billion of which is due to come from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and was already factored into the debt forecasts at budget time.  The additional €10 billion which has now been identified will add to the level of debt and this has been taken account of in the Stability Programme Update which was laid before the Dáil on 29 April 2011.  Based on these assumptions, the Stability Programme Update projections of debt interest costs and those costs as a percentage of total tax receipts are outlined in the below table:</p>

            <p eId="para_1491">At almost 21 per cent, the proportion of tax revenues going towards debt interest in 2015 is undoubtedly at a significant level. However, it is worth bearing in mind that it is well below the ratios experienced in the mid-1980s when around a third of the tax revenues generated in the State went towards servicing the interest on the national debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">There is now a general appreciation at European level of the importance of debt sustainability considerations in the pricing of EU and euro area financial assistance loans to Member States.  In this regard, the Heads of State or Government of the euro area decided on 11 March last that the "pricing of the EFSF (loans) should be lowered to better take into account debt sustainability of the recipient countries, while remaining above the funding costs of the facility, with an adequate mark up for risk, and in line with IMF pricing principles."</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">The European Council also decided that the interest rate on the loans to Greece will be adjusted by 100 basis points.  The position in relation to the pricing of Ireland's loans was also considered in the context of wider political discussions but the Council did not take any decision in the matter. The pricing of Ireland's loan is being pursued vigorously by myself and my Department at European level.  The decision on this will be made by Eurogroup and ECOFIN Ministers, and it is being addressed through that forum.  However, every opportunity to present our case on the interest rate is being taken — including the EU/IMF quarterly review which took place last month.</p>

            <p eId="para_1498">As the Deputy will be aware, the European Council has agreed on the need for euro-area Member States to establish a permanent stability mechanism: the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).  The ESM will be activated by mutual agreement if it is indispensable to safeguarding the financial stability of the euro area as a whole.  The ESM will assume the role of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) in providing external financial assistance to euro-area Member States after June 2013.  Access to ESM financial assistance will be provided on the basis of strict policy conditionality under a macro-economic adjustment programme and a rigorous analysis of public-debt sustainability, which will be conducted by the Commission together with the IMF and in liaison with the ECB.  The beneficiary Member State will be required to put in place an appropriate form of private sector involvement, according to the specific circumstances and in a manner fully consistent with IMF practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">The criteria for the debt sustainability analysis to be conducted under the ESM are not set out in the Term Sheet for the ESM which was agreed by the European Council and sets out the main elements relating to the establishment, governance, funding and functioning of the ESM.  There is no definitive means of determining debt sustainability as it is predicated on a range of factors, including assumptions regarding future economic growth, the stock of debt and interest costs.  A key determinant in the stabilisation of the debt ratio will be the narrowing of the gap that currently exists between revenues and expenditure through further fiscal consolidation.</p>

I understand that my colleague, Minister Howlin, intends to give further consideration as to how best to effect reductions in the remuneration of CEOs of Commercial State Companies — while acknowledging that there may be contractual issues in relation to current incumbents — and to bring proposals on the matter to Government shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1701">As I have previously indicated to the House, the Programme for Government  was adopted by the Government at its first meeting as the framework for its work over coming years. It sets out the policies and initiatives to be progressed over the term of the Government to tackle the many and varied challenges facing the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">My Department will be supporting the implementation of the Programme as a whole and it will do this with a more explicit focus on its role as a Cabinet Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1703">The procedures to reflect the new focus are being developed and will be announced shortly.  However, it is not my intention that the Department will exercise executive functions with regard to the Programme for Government generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1704">My Department will have specific responsibility in supporting the Chief Whip in advancing the Programme's proposals for Dáil reform and setting in train the necessary legislation for a referendum to abolish the Seanad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1705">As regards the Governments first 100 days, the Programme for Government specifies that the Government will produce a Jobs Initiative within the first 100 days. Work is well advanced on this initiative with policy plans being developed by multiple Departments and Ministers. Full details will be announced shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">It should be noted that the Government has already made substantial progress in meeting its commitments under the Programme for Government.  For example:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1707">the quarterly review mission under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland has been successfully concluded.  The mission assessed the Programme to be on track and that the targets in the Programme have been met, and agreed to changes to reflect provisions in the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1708">following completion of the solvency stress tests, decisions on the recapitalisation of financial institutions have been made and a comprehensive strategy to reorganise and reform the domestic Irish banks has been adopted.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1709">an integrated decision-making structure for dealing with the financial crisis, in the shape of the Government Economic Management Committee, has been established.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1710">the Nyberg Report has been published and the Government has committed to holding a referendum before the end of the year to strengthen the powers of Dáil Committees to inquire into crucial issues of public concern, such as the banking crisis.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1711">Ministerial salaries have been reduced, as has the cost of Ministerial transport.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1712">legislation is being prepared on political donations and to enable the number of TDs to be reduced.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1713">the number of Dáil sitting days has been increased through sitting during St. Patrick's week and shortening the Easter and summer breaks.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1714">the process of initiating a Comprehensive Spending Review has been initiated; and</p>

         the fact that the new Santos Administration in Colombia has shown itself to be open to pursuing a peace process in Colombia if he will propose that the UN appoint a special adviser on Colombia with experience in peace processes in other parts of the world, in order to support and advise the Colombian Government in the development of a peace process.

            <p eId="para_1738">The Government of Colombia has repeatedly stated its determination to bring an end to violence in Colombia within the framework of the Justice and Peace Law, which provides an overall legal framework for the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into Colombian society.  Since 2004, the Organization of American States (OAS) Mission to Support the Peace Process in Colombia has provided verification and advisory support to Colombia on this process and has supported peace efforts undertaken by Colombian institutions and communities.  Ireland is fully supportive of efforts to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Colombia, and to that end, has provided significant financial support to the OAS Mission to Support the Peace Process in Colombia, including a grant of €100,000 in May 2010.  In order to succeed, a peace process in Colombia must tackle the various social and economic elements underlying the conflict.  Our approach, and that of the UN and the EU, is to assist and influence the Colombian Government in a manner that results in economic and social development while progressively improving human rights standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">In his inauguration speech on 7 August 2010, President Santos set out clearly the conditions for the opening of dialogue with illegal armed groups, including the FARC, namely the renunciation of the use of violence and terrorist acts; the unconditional release of all hostages, the release (and no further recruitment) of child-soldiers; and an end to the laying of antipersonnel mines.  However, the FARC continue to carry out kidnappings and attacks, including the shooting dead of two Colombian soldiers as recently as 22 April.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">In light of the developments I have outlined above, I do not consider it appropriate to seek the appointment of an UN official to advise the Government of Colombia on the development of a peace process in that country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">The Government will continue to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1782">In the strict sense of international law and practice, the question of neutrality does not arise during peacetime but only during a state of war, when the neutrality of a state would be embodied in an attitude of impartiality towards the belligerents.  Ireland is one of a number of States which proclaims to pursue a policy of neutrality or non-alignment in peacetime.  It is a matter for each of these States to determine the nature and characteristics of its policies.  Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality, which has been pursued by successive Governments, is characterised by non-participation in military alliances.</p>

The values on which our traditional policy of military neutrality rests inform Ireland's broader foreign policy, including through our participation in international peacekeeping, our contributions to conflict resolution and peacebuilding, our work for human rights and development, and our efforts to promote disarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">Indeed, it is these very same values which have underpinned and motivated Ireland's long and distinguished record of support for and participation in military operations sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council in the cause of international peace and security.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">The EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), as set out in the Lisbon Treaty, is an integral part and operational arm of the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).  The CSDP is entirely consistent with Ireland's values and interests, including the primacy of the United Nations in the maintenance of global peace and security.  While the CSDP is an evolving process directed towards the achievement of ever-greater effectiveness, successive Treaties since the Maastricht Treaty have stipulated that Union policy in this area shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1786">Ireland's participation in a European common defence is prohibited by Article 29.4.9 of the Constitution.  Any change in that position could take place only with the approval of the people in a referendum to amend the Constitution.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_301">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_1788">The Programme for Government contains a number of proposals that are wholly or partly the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  These include proposals related to repairing Ireland's reputation in the EU and the wider international community; Ireland's Overseas Development Aid programme and its review; matters relating to Northern Ireland; and consideration of the transfer of the passport service to the Department of Justice.  Details on how these proposals are being addressed are outlined below.  While the majority of the proposals will span the lifetime of the Programme, where target dates are applicable these have been included.  The Programme for Government contains an explicit commitment to restore Ireland's standing as a respected and influential member of the European Union and the wider international community.  This work is already underway and implies the need for a broad effort, across Government and administration, of engagement with EU institutions and with EU partners bilaterally, as well as with our international partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">At Government level, Ministers have been availing, in particular, of opportunities to meet their EU colleagues and with representatives of the European institutions.  These efforts will intensify in the coming months.  The channels open to us through membership of wider European-level political groupings are also being exploited.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">I have availed of meetings of EU Foreign Ministers to meet High Representative Ashton and to establish personal contacts with my EU colleagues. Similarly my colleague, Minister of State Creighton has availed of visits to Brussels and Luxembourg to meet representatives of the institutions and her counterparts.  Over the months ahead we will continue to maximise all opportunities arising from our presence at the scheduled meetings of the Council of Ministers to arrange bilateral exchanges with key interlocutors, both among the member States and in the institutions and bodies including the Commission, European Parliament and European External Action Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">On 19  April I invited EU Ambassadors to Iveagh House to set out the Government's analysis of the economic situation facing the country, seek the understanding and support of partners for our course of action, and also to underline the desire of the Government to engage constructively and more widely on the range of issues on the European agenda.  I will be meeting non-EU Ambassadors later this week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">The Irish embassy network plays a crucial part in the process of national recovery. Irish embassies are tasked on the one hand with transmitting the Government's economic message, and the context for it, to key decision-makers in the EU and beyond; on the other hand they provide vital insights on the views and policies of partners.  I have called a conference of all Irish Ambassadors to be held on 1 and 2 June in Dublin, which will have an emphasis on economic and commercial themes, both in an EU and wider international context.  The conference is being organised in conjunction with the main State Agencies in the economic and trade promotion sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">Embassies are already actively engaged in emerging markets, and in the BRIC countries in particular, in-line with the current Strategy for Trade, Tourism and Innovation.  Embassies and State Agencies in these countries have detailed market plans and are actively pursuing specific targets.  This effort will be strengthened with the transfer of responsibilities for foreign trade promotion to my Department.  Discussions between officials regarding the practical arrangements for the transfer are well advanced and it is anticipated that they will be completed shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">In recognition of the important role the Global Irish Network can play in our economic recovery, I wrote to all members of the Network on 20 April drawing their attention to the priorities set out in the Programme for Government.  My letter acknowledged the contribution made by network members in assisting Embassies and State Agencies in the trade and economic area, and indicated that I would be interested in any specific proposals which members may have which would facilitate job creation in Ireland or would enhance the export potential of our indigenous companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">In relation to overseas development assistance, we have made a commitment to review the 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid.  I expect that the review will be carried out over the coming year.  It will involve consultation with the public and with all interested parties, and will take account of the achievements of the aid programme to date and the changes in the national and international context since 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">With regard to the proposal to unite NGOs providing humanitarian aid, officials from my Department have already met representatives of Irish-based humanitarian NGOs to discuss the proposal to establish a disaster and emergency committee in Ireland.  We have also begun discussions with the Irish development NGOs regarding opportunities for job seekers to share their skills in developing countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1797">The Programme for Government states clearly our commitment to the 0.7% GNP target and to seeking to achieve it by 2015.  This is in line with the long-standing UN target for Official Development Assistance, and with the commitment of the European Union.  It is clear that, in current circumstances, this will be a challenging target to meet.  However, the Government was elected to face up to the challenges of rebuilding our society and our economy, of restoring economic growth and our international reputation.  I believe that we can do this without undermining our work to improve the lives of some of the world's poorest people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1798">Minister of State O'Sullivan recently met representatives of Shannon Airport to discuss the proposal that it be made a hub for the storage and distribution of emergency humanitarian supplies.  We will continue to discuss the issues involved with Shannon Airport and to facilitate contact between Shannon and the relevant international humanitarian agencies as the proposal is further advanced in the months ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1799">As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I also have responsibility for leading on implementation of the Northern Ireland sections of the Programme for Government.  The Government looks forward to working with the new Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, following its election in the coming weeks, to advance progress on the full implementation of all Agreements and to drive forward the North-South agenda.  We will have an early opportunity to take forward this important agenda at the first meeting of the North South Ministerial Council with the new Executive scheduled for 10 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_1800">Lastly, with regard to the possible transfer of the Passport Service to the Department of Justice to operate as an Independent Executive Agency under the aegis of that Department, officials in my Department are currently examining the issues associated with this commitment and I expect to take a position on this matter within the coming months.</p>

            <p eId="para_1804">The Deputy's proposal favours tax revenue being solely based on usage of a car, through fuel consumption, rather than ownership upon which motor tax is determined.  This is often argued as the most favourable option from an environmental perspective as it embraces the ‘polluter pays principle'.  In an Irish context motor tax revenue is allocated to local authorities so this complicates the proposal somewhat.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">In addition, motor tax (and VRT) have been reformed in recent years in order to stimulate interest in low emission cars which in turn has led to enhanced sales of more fuel efficient vehicles.  This development has been welcomed by both motorists and the motor trade.  Consequently it would seem premature to effectively reverse this significant policy change at this early juncture.  Furthermore, replacing the revenue collected from motor tax would require a significant increase in excise duty on petrol and auto-diesel.</p>

        <b>Deputy Brendan Griffin</b>
         asked the

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1807">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, that Revenue employs a multi-faceted strategy to deal with the problem of such illicit trade.  This enforcement approach does not by its nature differentiate between counterfeit tobacco product and contraband product on which duty has not been paid in the State.  The strategy involves ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis and ongoing review of operational policies.  It also includes the development of analytics and detection technologies and the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and inland in order to intercept illicit product and to prosecute those involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">Revenue enforcement officers are deployed at all key ports and airports.  Personnel deployed at these locations are regularly supported by additional staff from other areas when specific operations are taking place.  Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations as well as random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Revenue and An Garda Síochána also carry out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations and in checks at inland markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">In July of last year Revenue launched a nationwide tobacco operation, which concentrated additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at various retail points for the purpose of identifying illicit tobacco products.  This resulted in 561 seizures totalling 13.7m cigarettes and 195 kgs of tobacco in the course of the two-week period of the operation.  Two subsequent 3-day operations during 2010 resulted in the seizure of over 1.76m cigarettes and 175 kgs of tobacco.  In two similar operations carried out in 2011, a total of 580 seizures were made, comprising 7.4m cigarettes and 167kgs of tobacco.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">The Revenue Commissioners have established a high level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level, to examine the risks related to tobacco products tax and to oversee and optimise the detection of counterfeit and contraband tobacco products.  This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco.  These include improved profiling of passengers and freight to identify tobacco smugglers and the establishment of a confidential tobacco hotline via which members of the public and the retail trade may report illicit trade.  It also co-ordinates national blitz-style operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">In terms of detection equipment, a second mobile X-ray container scanner, to augment the one first deployed in 2006, was commissioned by Revenue in January 2010 and is now fully operational.  Smaller baggage/parcel scanners are deployed at all major ports, airports and postal depots.  In addition to the X-ray equipment, Revenue also uses a tobacco detection dog.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">This strategy has resulted in the seizure of a total of 178.3m cigarettes (111m of which were determined to be counterfeit) with a retail value of approximately €75.3m and 3,369 kgs of tobacco with a retail value of approximately €1.2m during the period January to December 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">In addition, during the period January to March 2011, a total of 29.7m cigarettes (19.5m of which were counterfeit) and 818 kgs tobacco were seized by Revenue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1823">The Government is committed to ensuring that State agencies are accountable to the Government, the Oireachtas and the public.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Programme for Government sets out a number of reforms that will be undertaken in this area.  These include issues such as appointments to State boards, the role of boards, the extension of the Parliamentary Question system, the introduction of a requirement that chief executives attend the relevant Oireachtas committee on a regular basis to answer questions, and the extension of the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts.  The Annual Output Statements were introduced in 2007 to provide a means of setting out information on the performance of organizations, alongside the presentation of their financial resource requirements in the annual Estimates process.  The Government Programme includes a commitment to improve upon these processes and to sharpen the focus upon performance and accountability.  It is not enough for organisations and State agencies to be transparent about what they are spending; the public are entitled to know what they are delivering, and this is what the Government is determined to bring about.  I will be developing models for progressing this aspect of the reform agenda in the near future with a view to early implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">In terms of financial accountability, many of the non-commercial state bodies are accountable, on a legislative basis, to the Public Accounts Committee.  In addition, the Orders of Reference from Dáil Éireann have given the Public Accounts Committee powers to "send for persons, papers and records", which gives the Committee considerable scope to enquire in detail into public spending and related matters of public interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">In the case of agencies with no specific legislative requirements for accountability to the Dáil, any amendment of legislation would be a policy matter for the relevant Ministers in the first instance.  I will, however, keep the matter under review and would generally agree that, as legislation relating to individual State agencies is renewed, the question of formally designating CEOs as accountable persons to the Dáil should be considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_1836">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. In so far as the supply of printed matter is concerned, three different rates may apply. The general position is that books are zero-rated, newspapers and periodicals are subject to VAT at the reduced rate (currently 13.5%) and stationery and other printed matter are liable at the standard rate (currently 21%). The zero rate applies to printed books, including atlases, children's picture, drawing and colouring books and books of music. The reduced rate applies to newspapers and periodicals, including sectoral publications (sports, fashion, etc.), holiday brochures, prospectuses, catalogues and maps. The standard rate applies to a wide range of printed goods, including stationery, calendars, greeting cards, diaries, yearbooks and posters.   Under the EU VAT Directive, all digitised publications, regardless of their rate when printed (for example, a book liable at zero rate), are treated as the supply of a service liable at the standard rate of VAT. E-books, online newspaper subscriptions and online information services purchased via download over the Internet are also considered the supply of services liable for VAT at the standard rate. The EU position is that digital information services are not the direct equivalent of traditional printed products, including books. Even where the content is similar, the additional functionality (e.g. search facilities, hyperlinks, archives etc) associated with electronic content produces a fundamentally different product.</p>

            <p eId="para_1838">The Valuation Act 2001 which came into effect on 2nd May, 2002, provides for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial property.    The Commissioner of Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters under the Valuation Act 2001, which includes the implementation of the revaluation programme on a nationwide basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">The revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed in 2009 and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown was completed in 2010.  In the next phase, the revaluation of the Dublin City Council area will commence with the signing of the valuation order on 5th May, 2011. This will entail the valuation of circa 25,000 properties and the new list will be published in December 2013. It is intended to roll out the programme to further local authority areas later in 2011 and the necessary process of consultation, as provided for under the Act, is under way with the local authorities of Waterford, i.e. Waterford City and County Council and Dungarvan Town Council. Preliminary work is also under way on the revaluation of Limerick City.</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">The Commissioner is actively reviewing options which might hold potential for accelerating the delivery of the revaluation programme within a shorter timeframe. My officials are also reviewing various provisions of the Valuation Act, such as streamlining the appeals process, to see if greater efficiencies can be achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_1843">I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 110 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">In response to the Deputy's question, my Department holds the copyright in the National Anthem. The principal reasons for holding the copyright are to ensure that it is freely available, to prescribe that performance fees are not to be charged or collected in respect of the use of the National Anthem, and to ensure that it is not used in an inappropriate context and without due deference, such as to render it an object of scorn or derision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1845">Statutory Instrument No. 158 of 1995 European Communities (Term of Protection of Copyright) Regulations provided for the extension of the term of protection of literary, dramatic and artistic works to the lifetime of the author and a period of 70 years after the author's death irrespective of the date when the work is published or otherwise lawfully made available to the public''. As Peadar Kearney's death took place in November 1942 copyright on the national anthem will expire in December 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1846">The state does not hold copyright in respect of the various Irish language translations that have been made since 1917. I am however satisfied that the current version of the National Anthem as published on the Department of the Taoiseach's website is the  appropriate and correct interpretation of the words as composed by Peadar  Kearney.</p>

            <p eId="para_1848">The Stability Programme Update submitted to the European Commission and published on my Department's website on Friday last, 29th April, forecasts the 2012 General Government deficit at 8.6% of GDP.  This forecast is based on the implementation of a budgetary adjustment of €3.6 billion in 2012.  This is consistent with the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland and is in accordance with this Government's commitment to adhere to the aggregate budgetary adjustment for the combined period 2011/2012, as set out in that Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1849">This updated forecast of the 2012 General Government deficit is somewhat higher than the Budget 2011 forecast for 2012, reflecting the cost of additional borrowing associated with the banking recapitalisations announced in March, the weaker economic outlook and its impact on potential tax revenue generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1850">However, the forecast 2012 General Government deficit is within the terms of the revised EDP Recommendation issued by the ECOFIN Council in December 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1851">The 2012 General Government deficit forecast will of course be subject to further revision later this year as more up-to-date economic and fiscal data become available. Taking into account all information — both positive and negative — I will then bring forward my Budget for 2012 in December as is the norm.  At this point, I see no reason to change the aggregate amount of consolidation needed.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1853">The Taoiseach has already made clear to the House the Government's very serious concerns regarding the payments made to the former Managing Director of the bank, particularly in light of the huge commitment of public resources made to support the bank and the public interest obligations which arise from that support. My officials are investigating a number of issues relating to the circumstances in which these payments were approved by the Board and made to the Managing Director. The Deputy will, I hope, appreciate that in order to ensure that these investigations are not prejudiced in any way I do not wish to say anything further on these matters at this stage.  However, I will of course advise the House of the findings of this process in due course.  I also wish to advise the Deputy that following a request from my Department the National Treasury Management Agency, which has legal responsibility for managing the State's shareholder relationship with the banks, has recently written to all the covered institutions requesting that they undertake a review of remuneration practice, that they have further discussion with the Department of Finance ahead of any commitment to additional redundancy payments, and that the bank does not commit to further termination payments until after the review is completed.  An analysis of severance entitlements has also been requested.   In addition, the Deputy will be aware that in my statement on the Nyberg Report in this House on 20 April 2011, I set out a number of measures designed to strengthen Bank boards and bank management.  These measures provide that the Chairman of each institution provides me and the NTMA with a Board Renewal Plan. Each institution will also be asked to provide a Management Renewal Plan.  The Board Renewal Plan will set out for each institution the steps to ensure that the skills and competence levels of board members are fully adequate to meet the demands of the current and future banking system. In this regard, a programme of rotation of board members, commencing with board members appointed before September 2008, will be expected to be part of the plan.  This will provide for a smooth process which will ensure the succession of incumbent board members who were in place before September 2008.  I expect this succession to be completed by 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">Finally, my Department recently placed advertisements in the national papers seeking expressions of interest from suitably qualified persons for inclusion among those to be appointed or nominated to Boards of Directors of Banks.  This gives all persons who are interested in and qualified to act as Directors the opportunity to advise me of their interest.   The advertising for expressions of interest should ensure a high calibre field from which Directors may be chosen and makes the process more open and transparent.  It is part of the commitments given in the Programme for Government to restructure bank boards and replace directors who presided over failed lending practices.  The closing date for receipt of expressions of interest is Thursday 12 May.</p>

In addition, where a severance payment is made outside of the terms of a person's employment contract or is otherwise made on a non-contractual basis, the severance payment is subject to income tax under the rules of sections 123 and 201 of, and Schedule 3 to, the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_3636">I should point out that in Budget 2011 these provisions were amended.  Accordingly, the maximum amount is restricted to €200,000 in respect of  severance payments that can be paid free of income tax and USC depending on a number of factors, including whether there were any previous severance payments made free of tax. Any amount above €200,000 is chargeable to income tax, but may qualify for a relief that reduces the rate of income tax to be charged to a rate equal to the average rate of income tax paid by the person for the 3 years preceding the tax year in which the severance payment is treated as income. The taxable portion of any severance payment is chargeable to USC at the appropriate rate without any similar relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_3637">It should be noted that these rules apply equally to all employees in receipt of severance payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3638">While there are no special rules in the tax code dealing specifically with excess severance payments made to former employees of majority State owned banks, I would point out that the Finance Act 2011 introduced a special regime (which effectively imposes a combined tax, USC and PRSI charge of 90%) on excess bonuses paid to employees of financial institutions which have received financial investment from the State.</p>

The latest date for making the return is 31 October 2011 (or 15 November if filed online), but it may be submitted now.

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3657">Borrowings above the threshold of three times quota are charged an additional 2%.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3658">From 18 January 2014, the third anniversary of the 1st disbursement of the IMF funds to Ireland, an additional 1% is charged on borrowings over three times quota.</p>

            <p eId="para_3660">On 4 March 2011, Ireland's IMF quota increased from SDR 838.4 million to SDR 1,257.6 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_3661">The first drawdown of IMF funds under the Programme took place on 18 January 2011.  The amount was SDR 5,012,425,200, equivalent to some €5.8 billion, for an average life of 7½ years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3662">Due to the quota change, SDR 1,257.6 million of the SDR 5.0 billion drawn on 18 January last is now subject to a margin of 1% instead of 3%.  In annual payment terms, this represents a saving of SDR 25.2 million.  After 18 January 2014, the annual saving will increase by SDR 12.6 million as the 1% surcharge that applies from that date will not apply to the additional SDR 1,257.6 million that is now within three times the quota.</p>

For the same reasons the Government Legislation Programme for the summer session which was published on 5 April does not contain legislation in relation to the Strategic Investment Bank.</p>

            <p eId="para_3685">The Programme for Government sets out that the Government is committed to the future development of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) as a source of future employment growth subject to appropriate regulation.  More than 32,000 people are directly employed in international financial services, in over 500 firms.  Substantial indirect employment is also generated, and the sector contributes €2.1bn in corporate and payroll taxes to the Exchequer.  Accounting for 10% of multi-national employment, international financial services represents an estimated 7.4% of GDP, and 5% of EU international financial services activity is carried out from Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3686">The fundamental goal of public policy in relation to the IFSC is to develop the international financial services industry in Ireland, built upon sustainable, responsible and internationally respected foundations, to maximise not only the number of jobs, but also the quality of employment and the future sustainability and growth prospects of the industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_3687">The Government believes that it is necessary to continue to adopt, articulate and implement a clear vision for the development of the IFSC to demonstrate Ireland's commitment to the promotion and growth of its international financial services industry.  As part of this, work is under way on the preparation of a new strategic review for the development of the international financial services industry.  Advancing the key recommendations of the Strategy through the structure of the IFSC Clearing House Group and other IFSC Working Groups will ensure that progress is advanced within an agreed time scale to be determined as part of the strategic review.</p>

            <p eId="para_3689">Charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.  I have no plans to introduce a VAT refund scheme for charities.  It is not clear that refunding VAT paid by charities is an appropriate method as opposed to grant-aiding the activities of charities using other criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_3690">The tax code already treats charities in a favourable manner.  The tax code currently provides exemption for charities from Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Capital Acquisitions Tax, Stamp Duty, Probate Tax, Dividend Withholding Tax and the uniform scheme of tax relief for donations.</p>

As regards assisting homeowners who are struggling to pay off mortgages, the Deputy will be aware of the work of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt.  This Group produced two Reports, an Interim Report published in July 2010 and a Final Report published in November 2010.

The most significant changes in the revised CCMA include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3694">Borrowers in arrears who co-operate with the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) are not charged penalty interest charges,</p>

In addition, the Central Bank has also written to lenders to issue directions under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which will mean that lenders cannot impose arrears charges or penalty interest on borrowers who are co-operating with the MARP.  Lenders representing the majority of the market have already indicated their willingness to implement the Expert Group’s proposals for a Deferred Interest Scheme or a variation of it.</p>

            <p eId="para_3840">Irish VAT law is governed by the EU VAT Directive.  Articles 146 and 147 of this Directive provide for a scheme whereby persons from outside the EU can claim a refund on VAT charged to them on any goods purchased here that are brought outside the Community.  This is known as the retail export scheme.  The scheme specifically applies to goods and not services, and refunds can be obtained only on purchases of goods, such as souvenirs, gifts etc., bought for non-business purposes, which the tourist or traveller brings with them when leaving the EU.  No refund can be obtained for goods that remain in Ireland, or for any services, such as hotel accommodation, car-hire or restaurant meals.  For the refund to apply, the goods must be taken outside of the European Union by the purchaser.  The basic principle is that the goods are treated as exports and are not consumed in the European Union.  In this context, EU VAT law does not allow for a scheme as outlined by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3842">NAMA has a commercial remit and its overriding objective is to generate a return for the taxpayer. However, within the context of its commercial remit and consistent with section 2 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, NAMA is at all times open to considering proposals aimed at contributing to broader social and economic objectives.  This includes facilitating public bodies in the creation of vibrant sustainable communities.  The NAMA Board has also committed to giving first option to State bodies on the purchase of property which may be suitable for their purposes where these bodies have requirements such as schools, parks, and so on.  NAMA assures me that it will play a key social and economic role by regenerating activity in the property market through its asset sales strategy and through its provision of liquidity to the banks in the form of NAMA securities which can be used as collateral for funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_3843">Indeed, I understand that both the Minister for Housing and Planning and officials of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government have had discussions with NAMA on the issue of social and affordable housing in order to explore potential solutions which would enable such housing to be provided on a commercial basis.  NAMA has also engaged with the Minister and with the Department on the issue of unfinished housing estates.</p>

            <p eId="para_3848">The Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 (CIFS) provided that each covered institution pay a charge to the Exchequer for its guarantee.  The sum of €760,467,567 was paid into the Exchequer on 28 October 2010 in respect of all fees and interest accumulated under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme which terminated on 29 September 2010.  Including payments received under the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme (ELG), over €1.3 billion has been transferred to the Exchequer as at October 2010 as a consequence of the support provided by the State and taxpayer.  A further sum of over €591,000,000 has been received in fees under ELG from the participating institutions since 28 October 2010.  Fees for the CIFS were originally calculated to compensate the State for the cost of the Guarantee.  Fees for ELG, which are higher, were calculated on a basis that included market ratings of risk.  The Deputy will be aware that since the introduction of the Guarantee in September 2008 there have been a number of Government backed initiatives which impact on the operational environment and place specific restrictions and limitations on the covered institutions in relation to the payment of dividends, and also the payment of bonuses to their senior management and staff.  I refer to the publication of the CIROC Report in March 2009 and the subscription agreements for the recapitalization of Bank of Ireland and AIB, and the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, and the later capital injections by Government in support of the EBS Building Society and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  An important feature of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 is the provision which will stem the payment of bonuses for those banks receiving State support by way of capital investment by the Government.  Paragraph 48 of the CIFS provided that a covered institution shall comply with rules governing the declaration and payment of dividends made by the Minister after consultation with the Governor and the Regulatory Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3849">The Deputy is no doubt also alluding to the termination payment to the former CEO of AIB in his question.  I am extremely unhappy about this payment to the former Chief Executive. My officials are in ongoing correspondence with the bank about the payment investigating the circumstances of this payment including whether the bank was contractually obliged to make the payment or whether it could have been avoided.  The investigation will also ascertain at what level the package was approved and whether any further action should be taken in relation to the issue.  This is a complicated legal situation and I do not want to say more about it at this stage.  I hold the view that as much information as possible on this type of issue should be made available to the public and will ensure that this happens at the appropriate time.  I think it is important to point out however a key element of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 is that it allows me as Minister for Finance to impose conditions when providing State support to an institution.  This provision has been used to prohibit the payment of performance related bonuses at AIB in December 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_3861">I propose to take Questions Nos. 153, 154 and 166 to 168, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3862">There is a general appreciation at European level of the importance of debt sustainability considerations in the pricing of EU and euro area financial assistance loans to member states.  In this regard, the Heads of State or Government of the euro area decided on 11 March last that the "pricing of the EFSF (loans) should be lowered to better take into account debt sustainability of the recipient countries, while remaining above the funding costs of the facility, with an adequate mark up for risk, and in line with IMF pricing principles".  The European Council also decided that the interest rate on the loans to Greece will be adjusted by 100 basis points.  The position in relation to the pricing of Ireland's loans was considered in the context of wider political discussions but the Council did not take any decision on the matter.  The pricing of Ireland's loan is being pursued vigorously by myself and my Department at European level.  A decision on this is expected to be made by Eurogroup and ECOFIN Ministers.  It is being addressed through that forum.  However, every opportunity to present our case on the interest rate is being taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_3863">It is not possible at this stage to provide definitive estimates on the level of savings which would arise if reductions were agreed in the pricing of the EU loans to Ireland.  However, I understand from preliminary analysis undertaken by the NTMA that a 1% target reduction in the interest rate could yield overall savings of the order of €725 million over the life of the €12.6 billion European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) loans which have been drawn down so far.  The estimated equivalent annual savings would be approximately €130 million.  I emphasise that these estimates are based on the amounts drawn down to date.  The actual savings that would arise from any interest rate reduction secured would depend on the total amount of funds drawn down from the EFSM and the EFSF and on the maturity profile of any such loans.  The total amount of funding available from the EU and the IMF is €67.5 billion, €45 billion of which comes from the EU through the EFSM, the EFSF and the bilateral loans.  For illustrative purposes, the saving arising from a 1% reduction on the interest rate charged on the full €45 billion available from EU sources would be €450 million for each full year borrowed.  If this €45 billion was held for an average 7.5 years, i.e. the term envisaged in the programme, the total saving would amount to €3.375 billion.  There is no moratorium on interest payments on any part of the funding agreed under the EU-IMF programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3864">As regards the interest rates Ireland is paying, the average (blended) interest rate on the €67.5 billion available to be drawn from these three external sources was estimated to be 5.82% on the basis of market rates at the time of the agreement.  The actual cost will depend on the prevailing market rates at the time of each drawdown and could be higher if market rates have deteriorated.  The average life of the borrowings, which will involve a combination of longer and shorter dated maturities, is 7.5 years.  The interest on Ireland's borrowing from the EFSM is based on the cost to the EFSM of raising funds in the markets plus a margin of 2.925%.  In the case of the EFSF, the cost of funds for Ireland is based on the cost to the EFSF of raising funds in the markets plus a margin of 2.47%, plus the cost of credit enhancement features which can vary over time but which amounted to 0.54% on the loan drawn down from EFSF on 1 February 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_3865">Interest on borrowings from the IMF will be paid quarterly at the IMF's standard interest rate applying to countries which draw on its Extended Fund Facility.  This rate is set by reference to the IMF's basic rate of charge plus surcharges, which vary based on the amount of funds drawn relative to a country's IMF quota and the duration for which funds are outstanding.  The Special Drawing Rights interest rate, which is expressed as an equivalent annual bond yield, is calculated weekly by the IMF with reference to financial instruments of the component currencies in the Special Drawing Rights basket: the three-month Eurepo rate; the three-month Japanese Treasury Discount bills; the three-month UK Treasury bills; and the three-month US Treasury bills.  Up to a threshold of three times a country's IMF quota, as determined by the IMF, a margin of 1% over the SDR rate is payable.  On all funds beyond that threshold, an additional margin of 2% is payable plus a further margin of 1% if the funds are outstanding for more than three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3866">In view of this calculation method, the annual interest cost is variable.  The annual interest amount will be known with certainty when the full year interest payments have been made.  Based on current market conditions, the NTMA has estimated an effective average annual interest rate cost for borrowing from the IMF of around 5.20%, taking into account quota revisions and the cost of hedging and assuming drawdown of the full €22.5 billion available from the IMF.  The interest rate for the UK loan will be the 7.5 year sterling swap rate plus a margin of 2.29%.  Discussions on the Swedish and Danish loan agreements are continuing and the interest rate to be charged forms part of the discussions.  The interest rates and actual interest to be paid in 2011 in respect of draw downs to date is set out in the following table:</p>

            <p eId="para_3907">*The SDR rate on the IMF drawdown reflects the lower rate arising from our recent quota increase. It is lower than the overall indicative rate for this funding as it is the initial drawdown and accordingly a portion of the drawdown attracts a lower rate of interest as it is less than 3 times quota. An additional surcharge is added for any borrowing in excess of 3 times quota that is outstanding for more than three years.  The 5.2 % euro rate shown is the estimated equivalent rate at current market rates and taking account of an expected future increase in Ireland's IMF quota when the full amount of the SDR floating rate funds available under the Programme is swapped into euro fixed rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_3908">**This is the net disbursement amount.  The drawdown under the EFSF is €4.2 billion but some €600 million of this is applied to credit enhancement measures, leaving €3.592 billion available for the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3909">***This is the net disbursement amount.  Taking account of the €600 million in credit enhancement measures in the EFSF funding, the total drawdown amount is €18.4 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3910">****The effective interest rate on the total amount is calculated using the 5.2% euro equivalent interest rate shown above for IMF funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_3911">The interest payments and interest rates for the remaining disbursements in 2011 and later disbursements will not be known until the money is actually drawn down as the amount of interest payable is determined by both the timing of the first coupon payment and the interest rate at which the loan is issued.  As stated in a reply to a parliamentary question on 20 April last, the profile of drawdowns for the external funding is subject to ongoing review.  Following the recent review mission, a revised schedule is being discussed by the NTMA, the EU, the ECB and the IMF.  This profile will be published when it is finalised.  I expect this to take place shortly.  The actual level of drawdown will depend on a wide range of factors including economic growth and the performance of the public finances under the EU-IMF Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3915">The Central Bank of Ireland is not Exchequer funded.  This matter is the responsibility of the Central Bank Commission.  The Minister for Finance had no role in the matter.  The Central Bank has informed me that in light of the requirement under the EU-IMF programme to use consultants under a very tight deadline for urgent financial stability purposes, it was not possible to apply normal tender processes.  However, expert firms were selected from a larger list.  The Central Bank invited those firms to tender and those able to provide submissions at short notice were reviewed.  A selection panel, including a Central Bank appointed risk adviser, was used to assess presentations from firms.  Firms were also asked to provide fee estimation and were then selected.  Firms were chosen on the basis of their expertise and knowledge, with each having a specific role in specified areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3916">BlackRock is a leading global provider of investment and risk advisory services to public and private clients.  It was commissioned to leverage its extensive expertise to provide a bottom-up loan loss forecast for the Irish banks in both a base case and a stress scenario over the next three years and lifetime.  Barclays Capital provided expert advice on banking sector reorganisation and deleveraging issues.  The Boston Consulting Group provided project management resources across the Financial Measures Programme, assessed the loan loss forecasting exercise and contributed to expert advice for the PCAR and PLAR.  The Central Bank has informed me that final cost is expected to be in the region of €30 million, including VAT.  It is important to note that these costs relate to the three firms and third party subcontractors.  The costs also cover additional work that is being carried out during the second quarter of 2011 in relation to the assessment of INBS loan losses and review of Anglo loan loss methodologies.  Details of all firms, including third party subcontractors are available in the Central Bank's Financial Measures Programme Report, which is available at <i>www.financialregulator.ie/industry-sectors/credit-institutions/Documents/The%20Financial%20Measures%20Programme%20Report.pdf</i>.</p>

As with any other potential service provider, BlackRock Solutions is not precluded from responding to any public procurement tenders that may be issued in future by NAMA.  However, under section 45 of the National Asset Management Agency Act, as part of its contractual arrangements with service providers NAMA is obliged to seek to ensure that each service provider makes every effort to avoid or manage conflicts of interest and to declare any such conflict to the agency.</p>

            <p eId="para_3920">I understand the Deputy's question relates to Irish Life and Permanent's sale of its insurance subsidiary, Irish Life Assurance.  The Deputy will be aware from my statement of 31 March 2011 on banking matters that in order to satisfy the Central Bank of Ireland's capital requirements, Irish Life and Permanent must raise substantial equity capital and will require a significant restructuring of its business.  The management of Irish Life and Permanent will produce a detailed capital plan to me shortly.  However, the basic elements of the plan are clear and are reflected in the deleveraging plans it agreed with the Central Bank.  Irish Life will immediately commence a process to sell Irish Life Assurance as well as other non-banking assets.  As I informed the House previously, the life division of ILP is profitable.  However, it is backing up an impaired banking system.  It is being put on the market as a profitable insurance company and unless it is severed from the impaired bank, it will be contaminated by the banking system.</p>

            <p eId="para_3951">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that while corresponding updates of the cost figures are not yet available for the 2009 tax year, the necessary work of assembling the basic data to enable this to be done is ongoing.  No data is available for 2010 or 2011.  As regards reducing tax relief to the standard rate of 20%, I assume the Deputy is referring to individual pension contributions, the tax relief on which is allowed at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate — the standard or higher rate of income tax as appropriate in each case.  A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans — retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts — by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.  The latest full historical data available in this regard is in respect of the tax year 2008.  There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures.  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, it is estimated that the full-year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts would be approximately €500 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_3957">A number of international organisations including the EU Commission and the Financial Stability Board are investigating the potential for various forms of burden-sharing such as debt-write downs, debt-for-equity swaps and contingent capital.  These are sometimes referred to as "bail-in" tools.  No clear international consensus about the specifics of how such tools should work in practice has emerged.  This international work is looking forward.  Burden sharing with current bank debt holders is not being examined by these organisations.  I have already indicated that the topic of burden sharing, including a debt for equity swap, for current unguaranteed senior bank debt was discussed with the EU, IMF and ECB in the context of the Government's approach to restructuring the banking system as set out in my statement to the House on banking matters on 31 March last.  In my statement. I emphasised that it is vital that the proposed three banks — Bank of Ireland, AIB-EBS, and Irish Life and Permanent — are able to operate in the market place following their reorganisation, including regaining access to normal funding mechanisms in due course.  The Government therefore decided, informed by the reservations of the ECB, that these banks will not share the burden with senior bondholders of their constituent banks, whether guaranteed or unguaranteed.  As the Deputy is aware, work is under way to ensure appropriate burden-sharing by subordinated bondholders in AIB, Irish Life and Permanent and Bank of Ireland.  I also reiterated in my statement that it is Government policy to work out Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society in an orderly manner over time and to minimise further injections of taxpayer capital into either institution.  I have made clear that should additional capital be required, the Government will consult the external partners on the timeframe and means of recapitalising those institutions at minimum cost to the taxpayer, having regard to the financial stability impacts in Ireland and abroad.</p>

      </p>

          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_362">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3969">The Deputy will be aware that the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert Group produced two reports, an Interim Report which was published in July 2010 and a Final Report which was published in November 2010.  Since the publication of the reports, the Central Bank has revised its Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) to reflect many of the recommendations of the Expert Group.  As a result, all regulated lenders will have to have in place a standardised Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, borrowers in arrears who co-operate with the resolution process will not be charged penalty interest charges, harassment of borrowers through unsolicited communications will be outlawed and borrowers in financial difficulties but not in arrears will be allowed to come under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process.  When a lender is determining the 12-month period it must wait before applying to the courts to commence legal action, it must exclude any time period during which a borrower complied with the terms of an alternative repayment arrangement, made an appeal to the internal appeals board or made a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman under the CCMA.</p>
            <p eId="para_3970">The revised CCMA was published on 6 December 2010 and came into effect on 1 January 2011.  The revised CCMA can be accessed at <i>www.centralbank.ie</i>.  Lenders are required to comply with the CCMA as a matter of law but have been given a period of six months grace ending on 30 June 2011 to put in place the requisite systems and training of staff necessary to support the implementation of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process.  In addition, the Central Bank has also written to lenders to issue directions under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which will mean that lenders cannot impose arrears charges or penalty interest on borrowers who are co-operating with the resolution process.  The expert group’s recommendations are intended to benefit lenders and borrowers.  It is expected that lenders will co-operate and implement the recommendations or variations of them as soon as possible.  Failure to comply with the revised CCMA may result in sanctions under the Central Bank’s administrative sanctions framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_3971">The Deputy may wish to note that, in addition to the recommendations being implemented through amendments to the CCMA, other recommendations will require legislative support involving my Department and the Departments of Social Protection, Environment, Community and Local Government and Justice and Equality.  In the case of my own Department, a recommendation concerning the scope and the admissibility in court of the CCMA will need further examination and advice from the Attorney General.  The recommendation of the group to amend the local authority needs assessment process has been implemented by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I am informed that local authorities have been provided with clear guidance on the treatment of applicants for social housing support whose mortgages have been deemed unsustainable.  I have also been informed that discussions are ongoing between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Irish Bankers Federation to enable borrowers whose properties are to be repossessed to remain in their homes for a period of time, pending the sourcing of appropriate accommodation by the housing authority.  Changes to both primary and secondary legislation will be required to implement the recommendations relating to the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  I am informed that the Department of Social Protection is finalising an implementation plan that will set out a framework for the future of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3972">The final report of the expert group contained the following recommendation:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3973">The Group notes that, for some mortgage holders who are in negative equity, trading down would produce a reduction in mortgage debt and more affordable monthly payments.  The Group recommends that further consideration should be given by lenders to facilitating trading down by borrowers in this situation.  Such options would have to meet relevant prudential standards, with appropriate controls in place and be in the customers' best interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_3974">Trading down means selling a current property and buying a cheaper one.  Trading down may be an option to reduce the level of mortgage repayments, resulting in more affordable monthly repayments.  This recommendation is aimed at helping mortgage holders to remain as home owners while reducing their level of repayments.  There will be situations in which mortgage holders in negative equity may wish to move home, for example, to take up new employment opportunities.  There is merit in facilitating house moves by those in negative equity in certain situations and subject to certain criteria set down by the Central Bank.  Ultimately, these are matters for lenders and for the Central Bank to decide upon.  Any lender planning to provide a negative equity type product must notify the Central Bank in advance to ensure that appropriate measures and controls are taken as the Central Bank must be satisfied that such a product meets relevant prudential standards and does not lead to consumers being over exposed to debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_3975">As regards changes to personal bankruptcy law, the legislative programme for the Department of Justice and Equality includes a Personal Insolvency Bill that will provide for a new framework for the settlement and enforcement of debt and for personal insolvency.  The Bill will take into account the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement of December 2010.  The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, is in the course of being drafted by the Department of Justice and Equality with a view to publication as soon as possible this year. It will also contain some interim measures in relation to reform of the law on bankruptcy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3979">My Department submitted an application in June 2009 for co-financing assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) towards the cost of guidance, training, entrepreneurship and education programmes for some 2,840 workers made redundant from January 2009 at the Dell computer manufacturing plant in Raheen, County Limerick and at ancillary enterprises.  It was estimated at that time that up to 2,400 people would avail of the supported measures.  This EGF application was formally approved on 22 December 2009 by the EU budgetary authorities and an EU funds transfer of €14.8 million was duly received in my Department.  The Government is providing a matching funding element of €8 million towards the cost of EGF programme measures for the relevant redundant workers.  The European Commission decision states that Ireland shall use the EGF financial contribution by 28 June 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_3980">EGF programme funding is provided by my Department as the EGF managing authority to relevant intermediate bodies who facilitate the delivery of guidance, training, educational and enterprise supports through a range of in-house and external service providers.  The relevant service providers such as FÁS, city and county enterprise boards, Vocational Education Committees and higher education institutions and colleges have under the EGF co-financed programme provided over 2,500 affected persons with guidance supports and over 1,730 with personalised training, education and enterprise supports.  Expenditure to the end of 2010 was approximately €5 million.  A number of other large claims are currently in preparation by service providers.</p>

            <p eId="para_3992">I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding.  The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under the criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Under this system, band 1 is the highest priority rating and band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.  The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 2.2 rating, reflecting the fact that the deficit in mainstream accommodation represents a significant proportion of the school's overall needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3993">The forward planning section of my Department has identified 43 priority areas throughout the country where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level in the medium term.  Factors considered included population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  The area to which the Deputy refers has not been included on this list.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  At that point, options to meet the schools needs will be considered further.  Information in respect of the current school building programme, along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is now available on my Department's website, <i>www.education.ie</i>.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_3995">I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  This includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.  This number is 10,575 whole-time equivalent posts.  This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number.  It also represents continual increases in the number of SNAs over recent years.  For example, there were 10,543 whole-time equivalent SNA posts in place at the end of 2010 and 10,342 at the end of 2009.  It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources, there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with departmental criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_3996">The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011-12 school year.  A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18 March 2011 and intends to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.  My Department and I will be glad to consider any suggestions from school management or parent representative organisations as to how the allocation of SNA resources can best be managed within the context of the overall limit on SNA numbers established.  In this regard I am committed to making whatever improvements are possible to the resource allocation system.</p>
            <p eId="para_3997">In respect of the allocation of resource teaching hours, the Department of Education and Skills is required to ensure that the overall allocation of teaching posts does not exceed the targets set out in the Government's employment control framework.  The Department had planned for a certain amount of increased growth in teacher numbers across the school sector in 2011, in line with increased demographic growth.  In respect of resource teaching hours for children with special educational needs, allowance was made for growth in 2011 over and above normal demographic increase levels.  In 2010, the total number of whole-time equivalent posts provided for resource hours teaching, including under the general allocation model, was approximately 9,600 whole-time equivalent posts.  By comparison, approximately 9,950 whole-time equivalent posts are provided for 2011.  There has therefore not been a reduction in the overall number of resource hours or posts being provided for in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_3998">The Department of Education and Skills asked the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to provide data on the numbers and rate of application for additional resource teaching hours to date this year so that this information can be considered in the context of the Department's employment control framework obligations.  The NCSE has also been asked to pause sanctioning additional resource teaching support hours to allow for collection and consideration of this data by the Department, in conjunction with the NCSE.  This is a temporary suspension of the allocation process in order to allow for consideration and analysis of this issue prior to any decisions being made.  The NCSE has issued a circular to schools advising them that the final date for schools to submit any outstanding completed applications for resource teaching supports is 13 May 2011.  On receipt of all outstanding applications, the Department and the NCSE will be in a position to consider resource allocation for the coming school year, in the context of the Department's employment control framework obligations.  Schools will be notified of their allocations as soon as possible.  In the interim, children who are eligible for resource or learning support teaching can receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools, either though the general allocation model or existing learning support provision.</p>

The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.

            <p eId="para_4004">The decision to remove resource teachers for Travellers from schools was one of the measures taken by the previous Fianna Fáil — Green Party Government in the last budget.  I do not intend to revisit the decision of the previous Government to withdraw resource teacher for Traveller posts.  The Deputy will understand the economic situation means difficult decisions have had to be taken.  The requirements to make expenditure savings and ensure staffing numbers remain within the public service employment control framework prevent me from revisiting this decision.  Both of the schools referred to by the Deputy are DEIS schools and are in receipt of enhanced pupil-teacher ratios.  In respect of such DEIS schools, for the 2011-12 school year, Traveller pupils will be included in the valid enrolment for the purpose of allocating additional staffing under DEIS.  The schools involved will have already received their staffing allocations for next year, taking into account this adjustment.  These decisions broadly reflect the recommendations in the report and recommendations for a Traveller education strategy that an integrated, collaborative and in-class learning support system should be adopted for all children, including Travellers, with an identified educational need.  The strategy aims to enhance access, attendance, participation and engagement for Travellers and is underpinned by the principles of inclusion and mainstreaming with an emphasis on equality and diversity.</p>

            <p eId="para_4006">As the Deputy may be aware, integrating ICT into teaching and learning in schools is a major priority for this Government.  My Department's ICT in Schools programme, guided by the recent Smart Schools and ICT strategy reports, sets out a clear agenda to be pursued in this regard.  This programme focuses on four main priorities — ICT infrastructure in schools, the schools broadband scheme, the development of teacher skills and the provision of curriculum-relevant digital content.  On the infrastructure side, my Department has distributed more than €90 million in ICT infrastructure grants to schools nationwide since November 2009, including an allocation of €4,946.38 for the school to which the Deputy refers.  In addition, the school received an ICT allocation of €30,000 from the school building unit of the Department in March.  This year, I have prioritised work on the other three strands of the ICT in Schools programme, in order to help schools to make the best possible use of the very substantial infrastructural investment already made.  In these circumstances, I will not be in a position to provide additional ICT infrastructure funding to the school to which the Deputy refers.</p>

            <p eId="para_4010">The decision to remove resource teacher for Traveller posts from schools is just one of a range of measures included in the National Recovery Plan 2011-14 to secure savings in the 2011-12 school year.  I do not intend to revisit the decision of the previous Government to withdraw resource teacher for Traveller posts.  The Deputy will understand the economic situation means difficult decisions have had to be taken.  The requirements to make expenditure savings and to ensure staffing numbers remain within the public service employment control framework prevent me from revisiting this decision.  Resource teacher for Traveller posts and teaching hours for Traveller pupils will be withdrawn with effect from 31 August 2011.  Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching should receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools.  A departmental circular, No. 17/2011, advised all schools of this decision on 3 March 2011.  I will arrange for details of the overall number of resource teacher for Traveller posts and details of the teaching which are being withdrawn, itemised per school, to be sent to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_4012">The standardisation of the staffing schedule for gaelscoileanna so that it is the same as that which applies to primary schools generally was one of a number of measures introduced in budget 2011 by the previous Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government to control and reduce teacher numbers.  These changes are effective from September 2011. Given the financial constraints in which this country now finds itself, it is not possible to reverse these changes.  This change will result in a reduction of the order of 50 posts in gaelscoileanna.  There are over 1,500 teaching posts in these schools.  The gaelscoil movement is well established and I do not believe that the growth of gaelscoileanna will be impeded by way of this measure.  The actual impact at individual school level is determined as part of the allocation process for 2011-12 school year and schools were notified in the normal manner.  My Department's Circular 19/2011 includes the criteria under which a school may appeal its staffing allocation and the process for same.  This Government will endeavour to protect front line education services as best as possible.  However, this must be done within the context of bringing our overall public expenditure back into line with what we can afford as a country.  All areas of Government, including gaelscoileanna, will have to manage on a reduced level of resources.  The challenge will be to ensure that the resources that are being provided are used to maximum effect and in a fair manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_4014">The budget measures set out the detail of the reduction in teacher numbers and the revised arrangements for special needs assistants.  These changes are effective from September 2011.  Given the financial constraints in which this country finds itself, it is not possible to reverse these changes.  My Department has advised schools through circulars of the changes and where applicable, schools have also been contacted directly.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.  This number is 10,575 whole-time equivalent posts.  This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number.  It also represents continual increases in the number of SNAs over recent years.  For example, there were 10,543 whole-time equivalent SNA posts in place at the end of 2010 and 10,342 at the end of 2009.  It is important to understand that SNA allocations are not permanent.  The level of SNA support allocated to a school increases or decreases as pupils who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school.  They also decrease when a child's care needs diminish over time.  The recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual principal or board of management.  The board is the SNA's employer and the terms of employment are subject to the conditions of the contract of employment.</p>

This change will result in a phased reduction of 500 over four years in the number of language support teachers through a demand reduction and, if necessary, a change in allocation rules over the period of the national recovery plan.  A first year reduction of some 125 posts is targeted with effect from September 2011 as a result of this budget measure.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_4018">The Deputy will be aware that the programme for Government clearly states that education will be a priority for this Government and that we will endeavour to protect and enhance the educational experience of children, young people and students.  To that end, we will endeavour to protect frontline services in education.  However, I do not intend to revisit the decision of the previous Government to withdraw rural co-ordinator posts.  The Deputy will understand that Ireland is effectively now in economic receivership because of the disastrous legacy of the last Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government.  The requirements to make expenditure savings and to ensure that staffing numbers remain within the Public Service Employment Control Framework prevent me from re-visiting this decision.  The decision to remove the rural co-ordination service from 331 rural DEIS schools is just one of a range of measures, included in the national recovery plan 2011 to 2014, to secure some €24 million in savings in the 2011-12 school year.  The service will therefore be discontinued with effect from 31 August 2011.  This measure will not affect the provision of HSCL services which remain in 200 post primary and 345 urban primary schools participating in DEIS.  DEIS rural primary schools will continue to receive additional capitation funding based on their level of disadvantage, additional funding for schoolbooks, access to the school meals programme, access to numeracy and literacy supports and measures, access to planning supports and access to a range of professional development supports.  The set of measures included in the National Recovery Plan 2011 to 2014 impacts on every sector of the public service and will unquestionably lead to significant challenges for schools as well as my Department in the coming years.  The major challenge will undoubtedly be to seek improved outcomes for children with fewer resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_4136">Rainwater harvesting systems were first introduced for major school building projects in 2008. Since then all major school building projects, where site conditions and circumstances allow and where economically viable to do so, can incorporate a rainwater harvesting system into their brief.</p>
            <p eId="para_4137">While fitting the systems in new schools during construction is relatively straightforward, retrofitting them in existing schools is much more difficult and expensive because of the various dedicated pipe work systems both within the building and externally underground and the amount of making good work that is required in each instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4138">For existing buildings it is more cost effective to minimise the demand for water firstly through installing measures to reduce water usage such as push type spray taps, low flushing toilets, urinal controls, repairing leaks etc. To this end, as part of the Summer Works Scheme 2010, schools were invited to apply for Water Conservation measures.  A list of schools whose applications under this scheme were successful is available on my Department's website, <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_4140">The Deputy will be aware that participation in my Department's July Provision Scheme is an option for all special schools and mainstream primary schools with special classes catering for children with autism or severe to profound general learning disability that choose to extend their education services through the month July. Home based tuition of 10 hours per week for the four weeks in question is provided to children who attend schools which choose not to participate in the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4141">The Deputy will also be aware that educational provision at post primary level for all pupils including those with special needs is structured differently to that at primary level and the July Provision Scheme was piloted in a limited number of post primary schools.  However children eligible for support attending other post primary schools are allocated 10 hours per week home based tuition for the four weeks of July.</p>
            <p eId="para_4142">The Scheme is currently under review and in the interim it has been decided not to expand the current level of provision which includes limiting the pilot at post primary level to that of 2009 and 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4143">As the college referred to by the Deputy is not one of the schools piloting the programme, eligible children attending the college would be entitled to home based support. Details of the scheme for 2011 will be circulated to all schools including the college in question early next term.</p>

            <p eId="para_4153">I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_4154">This number is 10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts. This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number. It also represents continual increases in the number of SNAs over recent years. For example, there were 10,543 WTE SNA posts in place at the end of 2010 and 10,342 at end 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4155">It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_4156">The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4157">The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and intend to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4158">My Department and I will be glad to consider any suggestions from school management or parent representative organisations as to how the allocation of SNA resources can best be managed within the context of the overall limit on SNA numbers established. In this regard I am committed to making whatever improvements are possible to the resource allocation system.</p>

            <p eId="para_4167">Applications from schools for gas, mechanical and electrical works were prioritised for Summer Works Scheme funding this year. Unfortunately, due to the scale of demand for funding under the Scheme, it was not possible to grant aid all applications and accordingly it has been necessary to prioritise some categories of works over others. My Department has sought to prioritise the funds that are available towards works that are most relevant to the health and safety of staff and students alike in our schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_4451">I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_4452">This number is 10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts.  This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number. It also represents continual increases in the number of SNAs over recent years. For example, there were 10,543 WTE SNA posts in place at the end of 2010 and 10,342 at end 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4453">It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_4454">The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and intend to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4455">It is important to understand in relation to the SNA allocation process that SNA allocations are not permanent. The level of SNA support allocated to a school is increased or decreased as pupils who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school. They are also decreased where a child's care needs may have diminished over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4456">I wish to advise the Deputy also that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. The Board is the SNA's employer and the terms of employment are subject to the conditions of the contract of employment.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_4458">I assume that the Deputy is referring to Circular 0070/2010 issued by my Department on 26 November 2010, which outlined that adjustments in salary should be applied, with effect from 1 January 2011, to all relevant staff in the employment of recognised schools or VECs who were not already affected by the pay reductions introduced under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No 2) Act 2009. Some of the categories of staff affected by this Circular included school secretaries and caretakers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4459">The Deputy should be aware that this measure was introduced by the previous Fianna Fáil — Green Party Government. I am aware of the impact this has had on school secretaries and caretakers. Workers across the public sector have taken pay cuts in recent years and the current Government has stated that it will seek to avoid the introduction of further paycuts in return for full implementation of the Croke Park Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4460">The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No 2) Act 2009 determined the criteria for reducing the pay of public servants with effect from January 2010. However, when the Act was introduced, there was a question as to how a public servant should be determined for the purposes of this Act. Subsequently, following receipt of legal advice, it has now been determined that all staff employed by a recognised school or VEC come within the definition of "public servant" solely for the purposes of the Act.  The legislation has determined that all persons employed by a recognised school or VEC, regardless of the source of the money used to fund their salary, the lack of ability of any Minister or Department to determine on their appointment or set their pay rates, and irrespective of whether or not they are eligible for, or members of, a public service pension scheme, are "public servants" within the meaning of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_4461">It is important to point out that the fact that affected staff employed by recognised schools and VECs come within the definition of "public servant" solely for the purposes of the Act does not alter their employment status in any other respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_4462">The legislation does not exempt any individual or groups save for the Judiciary and the President due to provisions in the Constitution. Section 6 does provide a limited power to the Minister for Finance to exempt or vary the reduction in pay rates provided for in the legislation where exceptional circumstances exist or because of an arbitration award. In view of the time lapse involved in reaching a determination on this issue, the Minister for Finance allowed for a temporary exemption from the application of the Act for these categories of staff up until 31 December 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4463">Accordingly, my Department outlined that adjustments in salary should be applied with effect from 1 January 2011, to all relevant staff in the employment of recognised schools or VECs, who were not already affected by the pay reductions introduced under the Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_4465">When the moratorium was introduced the Government exempted Principal and Deputy Principal posts in all primary and post-primary schools and these continue to be replaced in the normal manner.  The impact of the moratorium is therefore limited to the Director of Adult Education, Assistant Principal and Special Duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion. Vacancies at this level arise due to retirements in the specific grades and typically also from the knock on effect of filling Principal and Deputy Principal posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_4466">Some further limited alleviation was introduced for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium. The alleviation arrangements are set out in Circular 42/2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4467">Most of the alleviation arrangements are already in place. Any remaining applications, which include the school referred to by the Deputy, will be examined and prioritised as soon as possible. Individual schools will be notified in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_4482">Section 24 of the Education Act 1998 provides that the appointment, suspension and dismissal of teachers are the responsibility of boards of management.  In the case of VEC schools, section 20 of the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001 provides that the appointment of teachers and other staff are a matter for each VEC.  Removal from office of a VEC officeholder is provided for by section 8 of the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001 and requires a decision of the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_4483">Under Circulars 59/2009 (VEC schools) and 60/2009 (all other schools) procedures were agreed relating to both professional competence issues and procedures relating to work, conduct and matters other than professional competence.  This agreement was made under the terms of Towards 2016 and the procedures were issued in September 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4484">The procedures serve a dual purpose in that they provide a framework which enables schools to maintain satisfactory standards, and for teachers and principals to have access to procedures whereby alleged failures to comply with these standards may be fairly and sensitively addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4485">Issues relating to attendance in defence of court proceedings and terms of settlement are matters for the parties to such litigation.  In the case of disciplinary matters for teachers, this will in most cases be the board of management or VEC.  Outside of the removal of VEC officeholders, I do not have a decision-making role in such disciplinary matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_4497">I wish to advise the Deputy that the enrolment of a child in a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4498">My Department's policy is to promote the principle of inclusive education as envisaged in Section 2 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, Act 2004. The Department, either directly or through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), provides for a range of supports in schools to enable them cater for students with special educational needs which includes additional teachers, Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and specialist equipment. The precise model of provision made will depend on the pupil's assessed disability. A key priority for my Department is to facilitate the maximum possible inclusion of students with special educational needs while always allowing for individuals for whom inclusion with mainstream peers may not be in their best interests or the interests of children with whom the child is to be educated.</p>
            <p eId="para_4499">Some students are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teaching and/or SNA support. In other cases, a more appropriate response for pupils may be to attend special dedicated classes within the school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school. Special classes and Special Schools are dedicated to a particular disability group and operate at reduced pupil teacher ratios ranging from 6:1 to 11:1.</p>
            <p eId="para_4500">The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs. In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services. Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. They act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs. Another specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4501">All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i> www.ncse.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_4504">The student finance website, which is funded by my Department, provides a comprehensive source of information on financial support for further and higher education and it has a specific section which allows students to check as to whether or not their chosen course is approved for a grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4505">Students also have recourse to their local grant awarding body — VEC or local authority — to verify the position.  Information on approved institutions and courses will continue to be made available through these channels and students are strongly advised to make use of them if they have any doubts in this area.  Applying for a grant as early as possible will also help to reduce the risk of accepting an unapproved course as the grant assessment process includes a check on institution and course eligibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_4506">To assist students in exceptional financial need, the Student Assistance Fund at some €5m will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions.

The access offices themselves will also continue to provide support and advice to students to enable them to continue with their studies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4507">In addition, Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000 provides for the introduction of tax relief for fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU Member States as well as in private colleges in this state.  This relief, which applies at the standard rate of tax, is available to full time and part time students and includes distance education courses offered by publicly funded colleges in other EU Member States.

            <p eId="para_4514">Prior to 1999 a local contribution of 15% for primary schools and 10% for post-primary schools was sought for projects built on land not owned by the State.  In 1999 the then Government announced a significant change in the way local contribution was levied, introduced a ceiling on the local contribution and reduced the percentage to be paid locally on school capital projects.  The maximum level of local contribution for new schools was €63,000 or €12,500 in the case of special schools or DEIS designated disadvantaged schools.  In the case of refurbishments or extensions to existing school buildings the maximum local contribution was €31,500 or €12,500 in the in the case of special schools or DEIS designated disadvantaged schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4515">In recent years, a number of measures were taken to reduce further the local contribution burden, these were:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4516">No local contributions were sought for special education projects in mainstream schools, even where the land was not owned by the State.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4517">No local contributions were sought for projects delivered under the Small Schools Scheme or Permanent Accommodation Scheme, a single all inclusive grant was paid under these schemes.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4518">A rolling five year period was used to reduce local contributions for Summer Works Scheme projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_4519">In October 2010 the previous Government approved the discontinuation of the policy of seeking a Local Contribution for all new primary and post-primary projects commencing construction and the rental of temporary accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_4559">The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a Department of Children was announced by the Taoiseach on 9 March and Minister Frances Fitzgerald has been appointed as its first Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_4560">On its establishment the new Department will take responsibility for the National Education Welfare Board and arrangements are being made for the formal transfer of functions from the Department of Education and Skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_4561">It is envisaged that while the functions of the Board can be transferred by Order under section 6(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939, it will be necessary to bring forward legislation to amend certain sections of the Educational (Welfare) Act, 2000 to ensure synchronicity between the respective Departmental functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4562">In that context, in principle, I would see merit in an approach where parents, who have chosen to enrol a child under the age of six years in a school, would be treated under the law in the same manner as parents of children over the age of six years and that the same provisions would apply in such cases. The timetable for the legislation has not been set but it will be given further consideration in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_4576">I wish to advise the Deputy that, as opposed to there having been a reduction in the number of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), there has been a continual increase in the number of SNAs in recent years. For example, there were 10,543 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) SNA posts in place at the end of 2010 and 10,342 at the end of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4577">I intend to prioritise and support special educational services. However, I cannot re-visit the previous Government's decision to place a cap on the number of posts available under the SNA scheme. This number is 10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts. This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number.</p>
            <p eId="para_4578">The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_4579">It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_4580">The NCSE recently issued a circular to all schools advising of the SNA allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of SNA support to eligible schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4581">The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and intend to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4582">My Department and I will be glad to consider any suggestions from school management or parent representative organisations as to how the allocation of SNA resources can best be managed within the context of the overall limit on SNA numbers established. In this regard I am committed to making whatever improvements are possible to the resource allocation system.</p>

            <p eId="para_4584">A review of the criteria and procedures for the establishment of new primary schools has been undertaken by the Commission on School Accommodation and its report has recently been published on my Department's website. It will be necessary to consider the report's recommendations and proposals. In the interim it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except in areas where the increases in pupil numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the provision of new schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4585">The establishment of new schools, including the request for a new school in the area referred to by the Deputy, will be considered in this context.  In line with a commitment given in The Programme for Government I have launched a Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector which will enable all stakeholders including parents to engage in open debate on change of patronage in communities where it is appropriate and necessary.</p>

The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board.

However, actual output will depend  on a number of factors, including attrition rates, the level of repeats and students taking a break in their studies.  Similarity the level of enrolments in 2008 and 2009 provide some indication of the number of dental nurses who may graduate in 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_4649">I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_4650">This number is 10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts. This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number. It also represents continual increases in the number of SNAs over recent years. For example, there were 10,543 WTE SNA posts in place at the end of 2010 and 10,342 at end 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4651">It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_4652">The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4653">The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and intend to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4654">My Department and I will be glad to consider any suggestions from school management or parent representative organisations as to how the allocation of SNA resources can best be managed within the context of the overall limit on SNA numbers established. In this regard I am committed to making whatever improvements are possible to the resource allocation system.</p>

            <p eId="para_4656">My Department's commitment to the National Drugs Strategy is evidenced in the assignment of two senior staff to work predominantly on issues relating to the Strategy from an educational perspective and also in the continued Department representation, at senior level, on bodies such as the Oversight Forum on Drugs, the Drugs Advisory Group and the National Advisory Committee on Drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4657">Due to staffing constraints and the outcome of work prioritisation across my Department which identified capacity shortfalls in several key areas, it is not possible to nominate representatives to all of the 24 local and regional drugs task forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_4658">The Vocational Education Committees (VECs) are represented on the majority of drugs task forces.  Recognising this, the Office of the Minister for Drugs recently invited the Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA) to nominate a representative to the Drugs Advisory Group.  This nomination has been made. In this context, it has been agreed between my Department and the IVEA that VEC representatives of the different task forces will bring relevant issues to the attention of my Department by means of a sub-committee, to be established shortly.  This new approach aims to provide a communication channel between the key education partners in relation to the effective implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4659">I am committed, within the resources available to my Department, to provide support, from an educational perspective, for the National Drugs Strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_4682">My Department has received the proposal known as the Newman Solution and is considering the impacts it would have including funding, on the capacity of the colleges of education to administer an extra year and extended periods of teaching placements and on the school system.</p>
            <p eId="para_4683">The Deputy may be aware that there are significant changes currently under consideration for primary initial teacher education programmes.  The draft national plan on Literacy and Numeracy which was launched in November 2010 sets out national targets covering early childhood, primary education and post-primary education. The targets seek to foster a better culture of reading and more positive attitudes towards mathematics among young people. A key element of the plan relates to Initial Teacher Education (ITE):</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4684">lengthening the Bachelor of Education degree programme for primary teachers to four years and the dropping of many academic subjects in colleges of education in favour of the study of education and literacy and numeracy teaching;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4685">lengthening of H Dip Ed course for post-primary teaching to two years;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4686">longer and more structured teacher practice sessions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4687">The courses are not simply to be lengthened, but to be reconfigured so that there is greater integration of academic and practical elements, and so that the graduates will be reflective practitioners capable of self-direction and applying current research on an ongoing basis to their own teaching.</p>
            <p eId="para_4688">Concurrently, The Teaching Council, the professional body for teachers, has recently launched its Draft Policy Paper on the Continuum of Teacher Education which will bring together Initial Teacher Education, induction and early and continuing professional development (CPD).  The Council sought views, comments and suggestions of stakeholders on this important document which also envisages lengthening of the Bachelor of Education course to a minimum of four years and the post graduate programme for primary teachers to two years by 2012/13.</p>
            <p eId="para_4689">The implementation of these measures would be a significant undertaking by the Colleges of Education, the Teaching Council and my Department which requires, discussion, debate and careful planning and preparation in order to achieve the best outcome possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_4690">I understand that the Teaching Council has also been made aware of the "Newman Solution"  which will be considered in the context of the proposed reforms to primary initial teacher education programmes.</p>

The Programme for Government also outlines the Government's intent to deliver equity in education, prioritise lifelong learning and encourage the development of the international education sector here.

            <p eId="para_4716">The staffing schedule for primary schools for the school year 2011/2012 was published on my Department's website in March 2011.  It sets out in a fair and transparent manner the pupil thresholds for the allocation of mainstream classroom posts for all schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4717">It is not possible to make an exception to the staffing schedule in the case of the school referred to by the Deputy.  School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual matters into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.)  In particular, school authorities should ensure, as far as possible, that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</p>

            <p eId="para_4719">I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support which now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts as well as a temporary suspension of the sanctioning of additional resource teaching support hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_4720">In considering applications for teaching and SNA support for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the needs identified in the professional reports and decide whether the circumstances come within the Department's criteria.  They then consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupil from its current level of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4721">In respect of the SNA scheme, the NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year.  A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE has asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and intend to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4722">In respect of the allocation of Resource Teaching hours, the Department of Education and Skills (DES) is required to ensure that the overall allocation of teaching posts does not exceed the targets set out in the Governments Employment Control Framework.  The NCSE has issued a Circular to schools advising them that the final date for schools to submit any outstanding, completed, applications for resource teaching supports is 13th May 2011.  On receipt of all outstanding applications the DES and NCSE will be in a position to consider resource allocation for the coming school year, in the context of the Departments Employment Control Framework obligations.  Schools will be notified of their allocations as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_4731">While the onus for finding an on-the-job work placement lies with the apprentice in the first instance, FÁS can assist apprentices in this regard through the provision of information on job vacancies at local FÁS Employment Services offices, through its freephone service (1800 611 116) or via its FÁS websiteat <i>www.fas.ie</i>. FÁS is currently implementing a number of initiatives to support registered redundant apprentices to progress in their apprenticeships, including work placements. </p>
            <p eId="para_4732">The 2011 Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme funded by my Department and administered by FÁS aims to facilitate up to 1,000 eligible redundant apprentices to complete the on-the-job training phases 3, 5 and 7 of their apprenticeships with FÁS approved employers in either the private sector or, for the first time, the public sector.  Other initiatives taken by FAS to assist redundant apprentices to progress in their apprenticeships include ‘Changes in Progression Rules' whereby redundant apprentices unable to complete their relevant on-the-job training phases are now permitted to progress to the next Off-the-Job training phase.</p>

Under the ‘Fee Waiver Scheme', FÁS day and/or evening courses course fees are waived for redundant apprentices.</p>

            <p eId="para_4737">My Department has no objection to schools participating in the Junk Kouture initiative, should they wish to do so.  As stated in Parliamentary Question No. 159, which was answered on 12 April 2011, the initiative supports aspects of the Art Craft and Design, Home Economics, Civic Social and Political Education, Science, Business and Social and Environmental studies aspects of the curriculum in second level schools.  Overall, education for sustainable development and environmental awareness and care are significant themes underpinning many subjects within the curriculum in our schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4738">These issues also feature in the Transition Year programme, where each school has the flexibility to design its own programme within a framework set out by my Department.  As part of this, schools are encouraged to provide for innovative activities which develop students' key competences in such areas as research, planning and budgeting, design, team work, and evaluation.  Many schools provide musicals, fashion shows and participate in competitions as part of this approach.  Schools therefore have discretion as to whether they wish to participate in Junk Kouture in meeting the learning objectives of the Transition Year Programme, or in supporting other aspects of the curriculum.  They may also fund participation in the programme from the capitation grants and other programme resources allocated to schools, should they wish to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_4744">As the Deputy will be aware, a value for money review was initiated in October 2010 by the then Fianna Fáil/Green Party government in order to establish the value for money being achieved from state funding of small primary schools.  This review is part of the normal review processes undertaken by Departments on an annual basis on selected areas of expenditure.  I have no predetermined view on the outcome of the review.  Educational quality for the pupils must be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size and organisation, taking into account both the needs of local communities and wider social and cultural factors.  The review should be completed by the end of this year and I plan to consider the review's conclusions when it is finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_4745">The Deputy refers to the changes to the school transport scheme which were announced by the previous Minister and are due to be implemented with effect from September next.  The changes to the school transport scheme are an entirely separate matter to the review of the small schools and were designed in order to achieve necessary savings in school transport with minimum impact to service beneficiaries.  In considering any policy change in relation to small schools, I am conscious that there are many issues to be taken into account.  Among these issues are the locations of small schools relative to each other and to other schools of a similar type and the question of travel distances and transport costs.  I can assure the Deputy I will be taking all these matters into account when considering the outcome of the review.</p>

            <p eId="para_4750">It is my belief that a well planned Physical Education programme has a vitally important role to play in a broad and balanced curriculum for our primary and second level students.  At primary level, Physical Education is one of seven curriculum areas within the revised Primary School Curriculum launched in 1999 and implemented on a phased basis over the period to 2008.  Physical Education was implemented in 2005/6 supported by a national programme of professional development for teachers.  The curriculum includes six broad strands featuring Athletics, Dance, Gymnastics, Games, Outdoor and adventure activities and Aquatics, and is based on a recommended teaching timeframe of one hour per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_4751">In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum.  The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered on the school timetable.  In addition to PE, the importance of healthy lifestyles and physical exercise is also featured as part of the Social Personal and Health Education Programme which is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_4752">Apart from the formal curricula, schools take a range of measures to encourage physical activity among students during the school day and many provide extensive, broad-based programmes of co-curricular physical activities that are highly rewarding for both pupils and teachers alike.  In particular, schools play a major role in nurturing and promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community.  Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland provide extensive opportunities for such participation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4753">The achievement of a minimum of 30 minutes dedicated physical activity per day recommended in the Task Force on Obesity is unrealistic in the context of a number of factors:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4754">The length of the school day and the challenge to cover all the subjects in the curriculum adequately.  Any changes to the length of the school day would require negotiation with the teachers' unions allied with the commitment of significant additional resources.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4755">The necessity to use games/sports facilities to provide for all pupils in each school.  There are limitations to the numbers that can use some resources at any one time.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4756">The fact that primary school pupils have just half an hour for lunch and need to spend at least half of that time eating a proper lunch.</p>
            <p eId="para_4757">It is important to realise that children spend just 20% of their waking hours at school and so their level of physical activity during the rest of the week in just as important.  Indeed, the "State of the Nation's Children 2010" report found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking first across 40 countries in being physically active for at least 60 minutes per day on more than 4 days per week.</p>

            <p eId="para_4764">Financial reporting by multinational companies is being considered in a variety of forums including the OECD, at EU Council and Commission levels, by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and in the US.  Section 1504 of the 2010, US Dodd-Frank Act requires all extractive companies (e.g., minerals, oil, or natural gas) listed on US stock exchanges to publish payments made to governments on a country-by-country basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4765">In the EU, the Council conclusions of 14 June 2010 encouraged the EU and its Member States to work towards exploring country-by-country reporting as a standard for multinational corporations, by encouraging the OECD to pursue its work on  country-by-country reporting, including as regards the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and its Principles for Corporate Governance.  It also concluded that Member States should also support the work of the IASB consultation on a country-by-country reporting requirement in International Financial Reporting Standard 6 "IFRS 6" for the extractive Sector, and encourage the IASB to look beyond the extractive sector.  It is understood that the Board is still deliberating on these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_4766">Earlier this year, the European Commission conducted a public consultation on country-by-country reporting by EU/EEA multinational companies in relation to the disclosure of financial information on their operations in third countries (i.e. non-EU/EEA countries).  In this connection it is interesting to note that the Commission also made a distinction between general country-by-country reporting by multinational companies and specific transparency obligations in respect of payments to third country governments by companies active in the extractive industries.</p>
            <p eId="para_4767">My officials, in consultation, as appropriate, with colleagues from other relevant Departments, will actively participate in any EU proposals brought forward in these areas that fall within my Department's remit.</p>

         the initiatives currently being undertaken to increase Ireland’s trade with and exports to the crucial emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#RichardBruton" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation" eId="spk_444">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_4769">The Government is fully committed to developing and expanding engagement with the key high-potential markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China, as these countries are very promising destinations for the sale of Irish goods and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4770">The agreed Programme for Government sets out clearly that Ireland's economic recovery must be export-led.  That Programme commits us to achieve the maximum growth in exports, including the long-term development of new markets.  In addition, we will position Ireland to develop better trade relationships with emerging economies and the Government has given a commitment to progressively implement the recommendations in the strategy and action plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015, entitled <i>Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_4771">That Strategy takes a two-pronged approach, focussing on particular markets and sectors.  In terms of markets, it identifies potential to further grow our existing key markets — and, most particularly, to increase or gain a foothold in high-growth and high-potential markets, such as Brazil, Russia, India and China.  The targets agreed by the relevant State Agencies — Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland — are to be implemented through a suite of actions driven by a new Trade Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_4772">Key instruments to pursue trade expansion are, of course, Trade Missions and over the last five years, Taoiseach-led Trade Missions have been organised to China and India and several other Ministerial-led Trade Missions have taken place to China, India, Russia and Brazil.  I myself have just returned from the latest Trade Mission to India where I led 22 Enterprise Ireland client companies on a very successful programme of events in that country.</p>
            <p eId="para_4773">A further indicator of commitment is the fact that the Department of Foreign Affairs has expanded its network of Embassies and Consulates in some of those countries and Enterprise Ireland has opened new offices to facilitate Irish companies developing export opportunities there.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland has a dedicated High Growth Markets Unit in Dublin to provide further assistance to client companies doing business in a range of countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China.</p>
            <p eId="para_4774">All the efforts have borne considerable fruit.  Between 2005 and 2010, Merchandise exports to these countries rose by 73% and between 2004 and 2009 (latest available year) services exports rose by 622%.  A key example of this success is the fact that Ireland now has a modest trade surplus with China, a dramatic turnaround from the position only three years ago when we had a trade deficit of €2.9 billion with that country.</p>

            <p eId="para_4851">IDA's strategy document, entitled "<i>Horizon 2020”,</i> sets out the Agency’s targets for the period 2010 to 2014.  The investment targets set out in this strategy include the creation of 105,000 new jobs in Ireland during that period and also includes a target of 50% of these investments to be based in locations outside of Dublin and Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_4852">The challenge in achieving an even spread of investment across the country as a whole is intensified as the sophistication of investments increase.  Competition for foreign direct investment (FDI) comes not just from other countries, but from city regions with populations in excess of one million people.  Dublin is the only recognised city region in Ireland that meets this criterion.</p>
            <p eId="para_4853">In line with the National Spatial Strategy, "<i>Horizon 2020</i>” places renewed emphasis on the “Gateway” regions, which are going to be critical growth areas in the future.  Successful enterprise development and the creation of an attractive location are interdependent.  Regions/Gateways that support strong and dynamic enterprise are crucial to Ireland’s return to balanced economic growth.  There are currently 130 IDA supported enterprises in Cork City and County employing 20,491 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_4854">In addition to attracting new investment to this country, IDA continues to work closely with its existing clients to encourage the expansion of their operations.  The Agency also continues to place a strong focus on transformation within client companies, and has continued to work with existing clients on upskilling programmes, investments in technology uplift and new process developments, in order to deepen their commitment to Ireland.  This encourages further business in areas which are compatible with our skills base and which are sustainable within our economy in the longer term.</p>
            <p eId="para_4855">In selecting locations to show companies, IDA Ireland seeks to include locations which have been affected by closures/job losses.  Typically, a company is shown three or four selected towns, which can meet its requirements for skills, labour, site and/or buildings, infrastructure, etc.  While IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of location, the final decision on location is taken in all cases by the promoting company.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_4857">Given the huge pressures that exist in the labour market, Irish labour market policy is keenly focused on ensuring that general labour and skills needs are met from indigenous labour and from within the workforce of the European Union.  For strategic skills or labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors, Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand.  Our system is demand led and vacancy based as opposed to permit regimes that apply a quota system.</p>
            <p eId="para_4858">Legislative changes introduced in the Employment Permits Act 2006, combined with the administrative measures that my  Department operates where particular difficult cases are brought to attention, are sufficient to counter any issues that arise as a result of the restriction on employees moving employment within the initial 12-month period.</p>
            <p eId="para_4859">In the Employment Permits Act 2006, workers benefited significantly in terms of securing much greater freedom in terms of accessing the labour market.  For the first time, workers were granted autonomy and control over their own employment choices with the ability to apply and re-apply for their own permit.  The Act also allows workers to change their employer after a period of a year and move to another employment in order to take advantage of better conditions or career options.</p>
            <p eId="para_4860">Prospective employers are required to carry out a labour market needs test to justify the issue of permits to non-EEA nationals.  It would be unfair on an employer if, having invested the time and expense involved, a new employee were to take up employment with a different employer after a short period, perhaps in an area where no identifiable labour market shortage has been identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_4861">Although employment permits are employer and location specific, it is the case that my Department currently makes best efforts to facilitate those who encounter difficult situations and who wish to change employers.  In 2010, for instance, almost 1,200 new employment permits were issued in respect of employees changing to new employers.  These permit applications were issued without regard to the normal requirements of advertising the position in daily newspapers and with FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_4862">Additionally, where individual instances are brought to the Department's attention, my Department considers such applications sensitively on a case-by-case basis.  In such cases, the normal labour market economic needs test can be dispensed with.  That gives those individuals full and free access to all sectors of the labour market and to all employers.  In 2010, a total of 92 such applications for new permits of this nature were received of which 70 were granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_4863">I note the Deputy's reference to the Migrant Integration Policy Index.  While the Survey's methodology is not explicit in the Report, I expect that Ireland's rating in respect of labour market mobility of migrant workers has been impacted by the severe economic downturn and the contraction of the labour market which has affected mobility opportunities of all workers.  I would not necessarily agree with some of the statements in the Report e.g the arrangements for changing employment outlined above are not acknowledged.  Similarly, there is no acknowledgement that families of persons issued with a Green Card are entitled to immediate family reunification and that Green Card holders may also establish a business in the State on completion of two years legal employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_4865">Dominance, <i>per se</i>, in any sector of the economy is not an offence under competition law.  However, the Competition Acts 2002-2010 prohibit the abuse of dominant positions in any sector of the economy.  The Competition Authority is the independent statutory body responsible for enforcing competition law in the State and complaints of any alleged anti-competitive practice should be referred directly to it.  It is, of course, open to any aggrieved party alleging anti-competitive practices, including abuse of a dominant position, to take a private action under Section 14 of the Competition Act 2002.  </p>
            <p eId="para_4866">However, in relation to the specific issue of media mergers as opposed to dominance, the Advisory Group on Media Mergers was established in 2008 to review the current legislative framework regarding the public interest aspects of media mergers.  The Group's report was published in 2009, and the eleven recommendations contained therein were considered in the context of a wider review of the operation and implementation of the Competition Act 2002.   It is my intention to bring forward legislation during the course of 2011 to reform aspects of competition law, including implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Group concerning media mergers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4867">I should point out that responsibility for the radio and TV sectors, as well as for digital broadcasting and communications in general, rests with my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Licensing for broadcasters, through the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), is provided for under the Broadcasting Act, 2009.  Ensuring open and pluralistic broadcasting services, as well as the promotion of diversity in control of the more influential commercial and community broadcasting services, are also statutory functions of the BAI under that Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_4872">My Department through the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) provide support to micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases by both financial and non-financial assistance.  There are four County and City Enterprise Boards located across the county of Cork.  The remit of these Boards as part of a nationwide Network is to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulate entrepreneurship at local level across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_4873">To be eligible for CEB grant support an enterprise must be in the commercial sphere, must demonstrate a market for the proposed product/service, must have a capacity for growth and new job creation and must not employ more than 10 people.  CEBs can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.  The forms of financial assistance, which are available, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, include Priming Grants, Business Expansion/Development Grants, and Feasibility/Innovation Study Grants.  The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_4874">In addition, the CEBs deliver a wide range of non-financial supports such as Business Management, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education, and Women in Business Networks.  These supports are designed to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises and to assist new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.  Due to the Boards' unique relationship with their clients and the local business community they can specifically tailor their programmes to meet the evolving needs and requirements of these small enterprises going forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_4875">Due to their unique role within the community, CEBs are considered to be a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business and in that regard, I would advise the promoter to approach their relevant local CEB in the first instance to discuss what options may be available to them and their proposed business venture.

However, IDA Ireland and the company are working closely to construct a "prospectus" setting out the skills and capabilities of the workforce and a profile of the facility that IDA can then market internationally as part of their efforts to attract alternative employment to Castleisland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4882">It should be remembered that Aetna will not cease operations in Castleisland until December this year and, therefore, the current facility will be in use up to this time.  The company is currently reviewing all its options in relation to use of the premises/site from the end the year.  IDA has met with representatives of Aetna twice in the US and has on-going contact with them in Ireland with a view to supporting and advising the workforce at this difficult time and considering all options in relation to finding suitable alternative employment.  IDA has highlighted the skills and capabilities of the Aetna workforce to a number of relevant investors.

            <p eId="para_4886">Job creation is central to our economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.  The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place to support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate both job creation and job retention.  It is only by creating the right environment for businesses to expand that we will see new jobs coming on stream.</p>
            <p eId="para_4887">In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland (EI) activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and Third Level institutions.  At present, there are over 60 EI client companies in Co. Roscommon, employing almost 1,200 people.  In 2010, the agency approved over €1.5m for client companies in the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_4888">EI has approved financial support for a total of five community Enterprise Centres in Co. Roscommon.  These centres are located in Arigna, Ballaghaderreen, Boyle, Castlerea and Roscommon Town.  Boyle Chamber of Commerce has been approved funding in respect of eligible expenditure towards the development of an enterprise centre in Boyle.  I understand that it was Boyle Chamber's original intention to locate the centre on a site owned by Roscommon County Council.  However, I have been informed that <i> </i>the Chamber subsequently developed plans to refurbish an existing building in the town as an enterprise centre, which is part funded by EI.  Roscommon County Enterprise Board (CEB) is funding the refurbishment of this building and EI funded the purchase.  This project is expected to create ten jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4889">As regards the closure of the factory in question in 2006, I understand that a new owner, who would operate a food production facility at the site, is being sought.  EI has been monitoring the situation closely and even though this is a particularly difficult time for the food industry, I have been informed that two of the agency's client companies have expressed interest in the facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_4890">Job creation in Roscommon is also supported by the activities of the Roscommon CEB through a series of programmes and both financial and non-financial assistance are available to a project promoter.  In 2010, Roscommon CEB provided over €340,000 to 16 projects and assisted more than 500 people in their training and mentoring programmes.  During 2011, the Board has continued to support enterprise development in Boyle and throughout the county and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_4896">I propose to take Questions Nos. 277 to 280, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4897">Preliminary data regarding the value and number of export licences issued in 2010, in respect of military and dual use goods and technology is set out in the following table.  Military licences are issued for a limited 12 month period.  They cover the export of specified goods or technology to clearly identified destinations and end users.  All licence applications are carefully examined to determine what exactly is the end use.  My Department consults with the Department of Foreign Affairs in respect of each military licence application before it is issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_4898">Individual dual use licences are also issued for a 12 month period for exports up to a specified amount and to a specific end-user.  Global dual-use licences, which are valid for a six month period, can be issued for dual-use goods up to a specified amount for a number of destinations from a specific exporter.</p>
            <p eId="para_4899">A key part of the licensing process in relation to all types of export licence applications is to ensure, as far as possible, that the item to be exported will be used by the stated end-user for the stated end-use, and will not be used for an illicit purpose, e.g. for use in connection with WMD or for use in an embargoed country.  The checks and balances built into the licensing system facilitate robust scrutiny in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_4900">The criteria taken into account when deciding whether or not to grant an individual or global dual use licence are set out in Article 12 of Regulation 428/2009.  It provides that Member States shall take into account "all relevant considerations including":</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4901">(<i>a</i>) the obligations and commitments they have each accepted as members of the relevant international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant international treaties;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4902">(<i>b</i>) their obligations under sanctions imposed by a common position or a joint action adopted by the Council or by a decision of the OSCE or by a binding resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4903">(<i>c</i>) considerations of national foreign and security policy, including those covered by Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP of 8 December 2008 defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4904">(<i>d</i>) considerations about intended end-use and the risk of diversion.</p>
            <p eId="para_4905">The Common Position referred to at point (<i>c</i>) sets out common criteria against which applications for exports of military goods should be assessed.  These criteria include, inter alia, essential and important considerations such as the impact on human rights in the country of destination, regional peace, security and stability and the approach of the buying country to the rule of law and terrorism.</p>
            <p eId="para_4906">One dual use licence application was refused in 2010.  I do not propose to provide further detail about refusals to grant export licenses due to issues of commercial confidentiality.  Information regarding the value of goods does not represent the actual value of goods exported.  Rather it represents the value of goods in respect of which an export licence was granted.</p>

         his views regarding the waiting period for cases to be heard at the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which can be more than 17 months; the steps he will take to rectify this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [9794/11]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation" eId="spk_458">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_4921">The Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) was originally established to adjudicate on disputes about redundancy, however, the scope of the Tribunal was extended on several occasions since its establishment and now deals with disputes under 18 pieces of Employment Rights legislation.  Members of the EAT panel — employee nominee Members, employer nominee Members and independent Chair and Vice-Chairs — are appointed for fixed terms of office and their services are utilised as required.  My Department is responsible for the administration of claims referred to the Tribunal through our provision of staffing resources, ICT facilities and accommodation for the EAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_4922">The Tribunal has seen a marked increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the significant economic downturn.  Between 2007 and 2009, the number of claims coming to the Tribunal trebled, although there was a slight (7%) decrease in new claims lodged in 2010.  However, the first quarter of 2011 continues to show a high level of claims being submitted and contested.</p>
            <p eId="para_4923">Tribunal Staff are conscious that parties in dispute are anxious to have claims dealt with as early as possible and are working extremely hard to deal with the sizeable increase in claims submitted to the EAT.  In that regard, there has been a large increase in the number of claims disposed of by the Tribunal in recent years.  These efforts have resulted in a 51% increase in cases disposed of in 2010 over 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4924">The increased number of cases referred to the EAT in recent times has, nonetheless, had a strong impact on case processing timeframes.  I am informed that the longest waiting periods at the end of March 2011 ranged from 45 weeks to 86 weeks, although such figures can be somewhat misleading in terms of the very different nature of claims referred to the Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_4925">Although the Tribunal conducts hearings in about 36 locations across the State, where the number of cases is relatively small, the Tribunal may wait until a sufficient number of cases is on hand before hearings in certain locations can be listed so as to maximise value for money in relation to the costs of hearings outside Tribunal HQ.  Once a critical mass of cases is assembled, 5 days of hearings in a single location can reduce the "waiting time" in the area concerned by approximately 30 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_4926">In relation to managing its caseload and costs, I understand that the Tribunal targets areas with the longest waiting period and highest level of claims outstanding, within the resources it currently has available, when scheduling hearings.  I can assure the Deputy that the Tribunal has been pro-active in driving efficiencies as it addresses the significantly increasing demands for its services at a time of significantly constrained resources.  Divisions of the Tribunal are sitting longer, listing more cases per hearing, and seeking to manage the caseload so as to maximise efficiency.  These efficiencies have resulted in improvements in the service provided to individual applicants and respondents and have also resulted in an increase in the Tribunal's output.  In this connection, over 6,000 claims were processed between January and end-December 2010 — the highest number on record.</p>
            <p eId="para_4927">The Tribunal is also piloting the streaming of certain types of cases in particular, in order to increase the number of cases being dealt with and assist parties in these instances.  The Tribunal is also in the processing of developing a "fillable" electronic form, which will facilitate the more expeditious processing of a claim form once lodged.  Furthermore, the Tribunal is piloting a specialist Division to hear claims submitted in relation to redundancy payments which are significant in number and where determinations by the EAT are necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_4928">Most recently, my Department has supported the Tribunal in processing its increased caseload through the assigning of additional Tribunal Secretaries and support from the National Employment Rights Authority of the Department in managing the administration of case logging and document preparation.  Such cross-unit support has been a vital support to the Tribunal in tackling its caseload.</p>
            <p eId="para_4929">All of these measures are being taken against the backdrop of severe resource constraints — both monetary and staffing — and I can assure the Deputy that my Department will keep the workload challenges for the Tribunal under review with a view to assisting it further improve its levels of customer service.</p>

            <p eId="para_4964">The back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare payments to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.  It is a non-statutory scheme with administrative operational guidelines.  A person wishing to pursue BTEA will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others.</p>
            <p eId="para_4965">Progression has always been a fundamental condition of BTEA.  State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one.  This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level.</p>

            <p eId="para_5033">The Department operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.  The back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are long term dependent on social welfare payments to make self employment financially attractive and viable.  Participants are allowed retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment (100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2) and may retain secondary benefits over two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_5034">Payment under the scheme is at the same rate as the primary social welfare payment that qualified the person for the BTWEA at the date of commencement of self employment. Means are not reviewed during the duration of the claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_5035">It may be the case, though they continue to be self-employed, the earnings from the business has reduced to a point where it no longer provides a person with a sufficient income and they may be financially better off to claim jobseeker's allowance. A person does not need to close their business or stop working as self-employed to receive jobseeker's allowance as it is payable if the customer satisfies all the conditions including the means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_5036">The earnings from the business will be assessed in the means test for jobseeker's allowance. The assessment must reflect the income a person may reasonably be expected to get from the business over the next 12 months.  Income for the last 12 months will be taken as a guide but allowing for any factors which it is known may vary.</p>
            <p eId="para_5037">The BTWEA conditions will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changing economic circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_5042">The Department operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.  In the main, to qualify for participation on these schemes an applicant must, inter alia, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum specified period. In general, activation policies operate under the principles adopted in the National Employment Action Programme (NEAP) introduced in response to the European Employment Strategy.  The focus of the NEAP is on engagement with those on the Live Register in order to provide a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education so that they can avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.  The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the employment support schemes and this is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need.  There are schemes such as the Back to Education Allowance scheme which is available to persons signing on the Live Register for PRSI credits which entitles them to the cost of education allowance of €500.</p>
            <p eId="para_5043">The Deputy may also wish to note that persons who are unemployed, redundant or who have left full-time education and are preparing to enter/re-enter the labour market are eligible to participate on FÁS training programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5044">The EU regulations on social security apply to benefits covering particular contingencies such as unemployment and illness.  They are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by a decision to move residence or stay temporarily in another Member state in terms of losing social security rights.  However, this EU legislation does not override the social security systems of the Member states, it merely co-ordinates these.  The Department's operation of employment schemes is in line with EU law.</p>
            <p eId="para_5045">The operation of my Department's employment support measures, in the context of current labour market conditions, is continually monitored to ensure that it continues to support those people who are the most distant from the labour market and whose needs are greatest.</p>

            <p eId="para_5052">I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the average waiting time for a domiciliary care allowance appeal dealt with by way of a summary decision in 2010 was 26.8 weeks, while the average time to process an oral hearing was 49.1 weeks.  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  These include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the deciding officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's inspectors and medical assessors, that is deemed necessary.  As can be seen from the figures, a considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.   In order to be fair to all appellants, these appeals are dealt with in strict chronological order.</p>
            <p eId="para_5053">There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432.</p>

            <p eId="para_5171">I propose to take Questions Nos. 341 and 343 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5172">Under the 1992 Habitats Directive, Ireland agreed to protect various natural habitats which are of international importance, including by designating areas as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs).  Once designated, Ireland is obliged to monitor, protect and, where necessary, restore those habitats and species which are under threat. 55 sites have been designated as SACs for the conservation of raised bog habitat. In 2004, Ireland also designated 75 raised bogs as Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) under the Wildlife Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5173">In 1999, arrangements were announced for the protection of the 31 raised bog sites that had been designated as SACs at that time. This included a 10-year national derogation during which domestic turf cutting could continue, subject to certain restrictions. A similar 10-year derogation applied to the further 24 raised bog SACs and 75 raised bog Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) designated after 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_5174">In May 2010, the then Government confirmed the end of the derogation for domestic turf cutting in these 130 raised bog conservation sites, on a phased basis, with restrictions being implemented on 31 bogs from 2010.  An interim compensation scheme was put in place and land/turbary right owners were notified directly of the restrictions and the compensation scheme. Advertisements were placed in local newspapers and on local radio.</p>
            <p eId="para_5175">In recent weeks, the Government has also announced details of a compensation package for turf-cutters in sites where continued turf cutting is no longer possible for reasons of environmental protection. The compensation scheme will apply immediately to turf cutters on the 31 raised bog SACs, where further cutting is not possible. Similar measures will apply for a further 24 raised bog SACs from the end of 2011. Advertisements have been placed in national and local newspapers and on radio. Landowners and turf cutters have been contacted directly, outlining details of the scheme and how to apply.  The scheme will deliver payments of €1,000 per annum for a maximum of 15 years. As an alternative to financial payments and, where feasible, qualifying turf-cutters will be facilitated in relocating to alternative, non-designated, sites to continue cutting turf.</p>
            <p eId="para_5176">Unauthorised turf cutting or drainage works in the 31 SACs is an offence and is liable to prosecution. Such unauthorised works may also risk future single farm payments, Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS) and Agri-Environment Option Scheme (AEOS) payments, or payments under the National Parks and Wildlife Farm Plan Scheme. Those who carry out unauthorised works, or permit such works to be carried out, on SACs may jeopardise the receipt of future compensation and may be liable for the cost of restoration works.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_5324">I propose to take Questions Nos. 357 to 360, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5325">Scientific advice issued by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) indicated that the European eel fish stock is so depleted that it is now outside safe biological limits. It advised that a recovery plan be developed for the whole stock of European eel and that exploitation and other human activities affecting the stock be reduced to as close to zero as possible. The Deputy will be aware that in this context the European Council Regulation No.1100/2007 established measures for the recovery of the stock of European eel.</p>
            <p eId="para_5326">In 2009 Ireland's Eel Management Plan was approved by the Commission in compliance with Regulation No.1100/2007. Given the critical status of the eel stock, as demonstrated in the assessment contained in the Eel Management Plan, a number of management measures were identified as necessary to reach the targets set in the regulation. These are: closure of the commercial and recreational eel fishery, mitigation of the impact of hydropower, including a comprehensive silver eel trap and transport plan, ensuring upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers and improving water quality, including fish health and bio-security issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_5327">Two bye-laws were introduced in May 2009 to give effect to the National Eel Management Plan put in place to protect our dwindling eel stocks.  These closed the commercial and recreational eel fishery until June 2012.  Under the Regulation, all aspects of the Plan must be reviewed in 2012.  This review will consider, inter alia, whether the eel fishery and market could be reopened in any River Basin District in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of stocks.  At that stage, the bye-laws which were introduced to close the commercial and recreational eel fishery until June 2012 will be reviewed. However, when the last 20 years of poor recruitment is taken into account, it is likely that the adult eel stock in Irish waters will continue to decline for at least the next decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_5328">Barriers to migration in river systems are one of the several factors causing the decline in the eel population. Other factors include fishing, habitat loss, predation, parasites and pollution. Silver eel escapement at hydropower stations is seen as critical in the attainment of the recovery of the stock. ESB is actively involved in the implementation of the National Eel Management Plan management measure to mitigate the impact of hydropower through its operation of a comprehensive silver eel "trap and transport" programme. In tandem ESB will continue to explore longer-term engineering solutions to facilitate eel passage.</p>
            <p eId="para_5329">There is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensation is not relevant or appropriate, given that the closure of the fishery is being applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.  I have no funds at my disposal for a hardship fund for commercial eel fishermen.  I understand a number of former eel fishermen are engaged by ESB to undertake trap and transport operations.</p>

            <p eId="para_5331">The provision of broadband services is a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market. Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.</p>
            <p eId="para_5332">Issues relating to the quality of service provision are, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant service provider and the customer.  The regulation of the electronic communications sector, including regulatory issues surrounding quality, is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</p>
            <p eId="para_5333">In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.  EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</p>
            <p eId="para_5334">The mapping exercise undertaken by my Department at the time of designing the NBS found that broadband services were available in the area referred to in the Deputy's Question and consequently the locality was excluded from the Scheme.  Since the completion of the roll out of the NBS in October 2010, there is at least one service provider offering a broadband service in all areas of Ireland.  Attention is now being focused on isolated cases where broadband is not being delivered due to technical or line of sight reasons.</p>
            <p eId="para_5335">The Rural Broadband Scheme which I intend to launch shortly will address those individual unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas. Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</p>

            <p eId="para_5344">I propose to take Questions Nos. 363, 369 and 370 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5345">The Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff programme (REFIT) was introduced in 2006. It is a support scheme for certain categories of new renewable generation, which ensures a minimum price is paid to producers over a period of 15 years.  All EU Member States have support schemes for renewable generation. Feed-in-tariff schemes, such as the one in Ireland, are by far the most commonly used support mechanism.  Over a 10 year period prior to the introduction of REFIT, renewable generation was supported through the Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) which was a tender based support scheme. Since 2006, REFIT has underpinned a significant additional amount of renewable generation underlining the critical importance of the continuation of a renewable energy feed in tariff system.</p>
            <p eId="para_5346">The REFIT scheme had State Aid approval from the European Commission to accept applications until end 2009. In 2010, my Department applied to the European Commission for renewal of the state aid approval to continue to offer REFIT until 2015. My Officials are finalising negotiations with the European Commission on the parameters of the second REFIT Scheme and a decision by the Commission is awaited. REFIT II will be implemented as soon as state aid approval has been obtained.</p>
            <p eId="para_5347">The renewable value of energy can only be legally traded in the context of the Co-operation Mechanisms set out in the EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC (Articles 6-12). Any decisions to trade renewable energy will be done in that context which includes joint projects with other countries. Where Ireland engages in joint projects in future whereby the renewable value of energy is exported to another country, then it will be the latter's support scheme which will apply.</p>

            <p eId="para_5349">The position of successive Governments over many years is that nuclear power is neither sustainable nor the answer to meeting Ireland's energy needs. This position is shared by several EU Member States. The Lisbon Treaty legally provides for individual Member States to determine their own energy mix.</p>
            <p eId="para_5350">The use of nuclear fission for the generation of electricity in Ireland is statutorily prohibited under Section 18(6) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  Furthermore, Section 3 of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 states that "Nothing in this Act shall be construed as enabling the authorisation of development consisting of an installation for the generation of electricity by nuclear fission".</p>
            <p eId="para_5351">These prohibitions do not include the importation of electricity generated by nuclear energy elsewhere.  Legal advice received by my Department states that such a prohibition, even if realistically implementable, would in any event be in breach of Article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect between Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_5352">It is not technically feasible to guarantee that electricity imported over an interconnector is not generated from nuclear sources. It is not possible to distinguish the flow of electricity across interconnectors by reference to the original source of supply or generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5353">Ireland currently imports electricity from time to time from Northern Ireland, which is in turn linked to the UK electricity market via the Moyle Interconnector.  Electricity imports from the UK will be increased with the completion of the East West Interconnector in 2012. It is the case that nuclear generation forms part of the overall UK generation fuel mix.</p>
            <p eId="para_5354">The safety audit of nuclear plants in the European Union is being conducted in response to the Fukushima accident in Japan and falls within the nuclear safety remit of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Criteria for the review are due to be agreed in May by the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group, where the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) represents Ireland.  The Government is strongly supportive of a rigorous and transparent safety audit of nuclear facilities in Europe including reprocessing facilities such as Sellafield.</p>

While energy efficiency programmes have become the primary focus of SEAI's programmes in recent years, a number of renewable energy programmes remain.  The Reheat and Biomass Combined Heat and Power programmes have a total allocation of €2.997m in 2011.  The Greener Homes Scheme remains open with an allocation of €3.3m in 2011.  SEAI also administers the Ocean Energy Research and Development programme, with an allocation of €13.1m in 2011, and the Renewable Energy Research, Development &amp; Deployment Programme, with an allocation of €2m, which includes support for the International Energy Research Centre which is being established in Cork.

            <p eId="para_5357">Renewable electricity generation is supported under the Public Service Obligation (PSO), which is a fund collected from all electricity consumers.  The PSO which is primarily used to support electricity generation from peat, covers support to renewable electricity generators under the AER (Alternative Energy Requirement) and REFIT (Renewable Electricity Feed in Tariff) Schemes.

            <p eId="para_5391">The situation regarding the taxation of goods vehicles has not changed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5392">In August 2010 my Department issued a circular letter to motor tax offices reminding authorised officers of existing provisions with regard to the taxation of vehicles on a goods basis.  This reiterated the terms of a 2005 circular letter (Circular MT 10/2005).</p>
            <p eId="para_5393">To be taxed as a goods vehicle, a vehicle must be constructed or adapted for that purpose and used solely in the course of trade or business.  If a vehicle is adapted, it must have the same characteristics as a goods vehicle in relation to space and accommodation for carrying goods and it must have limited seating capacity. The vehicle must also be used in the course of trade or business.  Under section 2 of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952, if a vehicle is used in a condition or manner which would attract motor tax at a higher rate, tax then becomes payable at that rate.  In other words, if a goods vehicle is used at any time in a private capacity, it must be taxed at the private rate of motor tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_5394">Under Article 3 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 1992, a licensing authority must be satisfied that it is authorised to issue the licence applied for and accordingly, that it is the appropriate licence for the vehicle.  It is thus open to a motor tax office to seek backing documentation to support an application for a goods vehicle licence, which is in effect a concessionary rate of tax.  Such documentation could include, but is not limited to, a certificate of commercial insurance, evidence of registration for VAT or a Tax Clearance Certificate, or any other document that would assist in satisfying the licensing authority as to the basis for the application. It would not be expected that any person genuinely using a vehicle in the course of trade or business would have any difficulty providing such documentary evidence if requested to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_5395">Form RF 111A Goods Declaration Form, which has been in existence for a number of years and is not a new requirement, constitutes the statement by the applicant that the vehicle is being used in the course of trade or business.  This declaration should not need to be sought at every renewal once particulars of the vehicle have not changed, but it is normally sought at the time of first taxing as a goods vehicle and on change of ownership.  The only minor amendment to this form is that the income tax registration number of the applicant is now requested to support the claim that the vehicle is being used in the course of trade or business.</p>
            <p eId="para_5396">While the legal provisions governing the taxation of goods vehicles have not changed, evidence was brought to the Department's attention that high-powered, high-specification vehicles that would not normally fall into the goods vehicle category are being increasingly claimed as goods vehicles. In that regard, it is important that motor tax offices follow the requirements to ensure a vehicle is correctly taxed.  If a concessionary rate of tax is being claimed in circumstances where it is not warranted, the concomitant loss of income would in the normal course of events have to be recouped elsewhere.  In this regard, all road users should pay their fair share of motor tax in line with the relevant legal provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5397">I intend to review the taxation classes currently in place for motor vehicles.</p>

            <p eId="para_5415">In general, planning permission must be obtained for the erection of an antenna support structure or mast.  Under Article 6 and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, certain classes of development carried out by a statutory undertaker authorised to provide a telecommunications service are, subject to specified conditions, exempted development for the purposes of the Planning Acts.  These include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5416">the attachment of additional antennae to an existing antenna support structure;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5417">the erection of an antenna support structure in place of an existing antenna support structure, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5418">the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, such as lamp posts, flag poles, CCTV poles, electricity pylons and certain public or commercial buildings (other than educational facilities, child care facilities or hospitals).</p>
            <p eId="para_5419">The above exemptions are conditional, <i>inter alia</i>, on the field strength of the non-ionising radiation emissions from the site not exceeding the limits specified by the Commission for Communications Regulation.  In addition, in the case of the exemption for the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, there is a requirement on the statutory undertaker to notify the planning authority, in writing, of the proposed location of any such structure at least 4 weeks before the attachment of the antennae.</p>
            <p eId="para_5420">My Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures in 1996.  The guidelines are intended to facilitate planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, the licensed providers of mobile telecommunications services and the public by providing guidance on dealing with these developments within the planning system.  The guidelines set out a locational hierarchy in relation to the siting of radio masts and advise that free-standing masts should only be located within, or in the immediate surrounds of, smaller towns or villages as a last resort.  If such a location should become necessary, masts and antennae should be designed and adapted for the specific location. In the vicinity of larger towns and in city suburbs, operators should endeavour to locate in industrial estates or in industrially zoned land.  The guidelines further advise that, only as a last resort, and if all the alternatives are unavailable or unsuitable, should free-standing masts be located in a residential area or beside schools.  Under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities are required to have regard to any ministerial guidelines in the performance of their functions.  The Guidelines are available on my Department's website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</p>

The Council's proposal stated that the site concerned was never designated as open space.  My Department visited the site in June 2010 and considered it to be a suitable location for social housing in accordance with Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities guidelines. The Council also confirmed to my Department that the proposed development complied with planning requirements and had obtained Part VIII approval under the Planning Acts.</p>

It is understood that while the status of the investigation is ongoing, the Council is satisfied that there is no objection on the part of the Ombudsman's Office to the signing of contracts to commence work on this project.

            <p eId="para_5482">Under section 230 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and Part 16 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, a licence is required in respect of holding an event at which the audience comprises 5,000 or more people.  An applicant for a licence is required, within the period of two weeks before applying for a licence, to publish a notice of his or her intention to submit an application in one local and one national newspaper.  The notice must give details regarding the event to be held, including the anticipated number of the audience at the proposed event.</p>
            <p eId="para_5483">The licence application must be accompanied by a draft plan for the management of the event, including a draft site emergency plan; a draft traffic management plan; a draft safety strategy statement; and a draft environment monitoring programme for before, during and after the proposed event.  Any person may make a submission or observation about the application to the local authority, which must consult with the Gardaí and the HSE in relation to the application, and may also invite submissions from other persons or convene any meetings or consultations it considers appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_5484">In considering an application for a licence under this section, the local authority must have regard to a number of matters, including any submissions or observations made to it in accordance with the Regulations, any consultations it has undertaken and the matters which may be the subject of conditions attached to the licence.  The local authority may decide to grant the licence, grant the licence subject to such conditions as it considers appropriate or refuse the licence.  Conditions subject to which a licence is granted may include the avoidance or minimisation of disruption to the neighbourhood in which the event is to take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_5485">Outdoor events with a proposed attendance below the threshold of 5,000 persons are not subject to a licence as set out above. However, such events have been successfully managed by some local authorities using section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  A local authority may specify conditions and restrictions as part of a Section 107 notice served under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 in order to prevent persons in the neighbourhood being unreasonably disturbed by noise caused by an event.</p>
            <p eId="para_5486">In addition, under section 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, it is open to any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.  A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available to download from my Department's website, <i>www.environ.ie.</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_5487">As set out in section 7 of the leaflet, a person who is alleged to have caused a noise nuisance can put forward a "good defence" in Court if they can prove they took all reasonable care to prevent or limit the noise by using facilities, practices and methods of operation that are suitable for that purpose. Complying with the conditions of a planning permission or a section 107 notice may be taken into account by the Court in this regard.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5503">In February 2009, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to their overall management of capital and current accounts. These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.</p>
            <p eId="para_5504">The Government set a limit of €200m for the contribution of the local government sector to the deterioration in the General Government Balance in any one year. This was not a new requirement.  However, the downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally required a sharp focus in all sectors, including local authorities, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_5505">In order to stay within the overall GGB limits, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance.  The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equal capital expenditure in the year. Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme. The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_5506">However, within these overall limits, there is additional capacity for non-mortgage borrowing and the expenditure of capital balances on hand by local authorities. Subject to the maintenance of balanced current and capital accounts, and allowing for the repayment of existing borrowings, up to €250m in new loan finance and expenditure of capital balances on hand can be made available to the local government sector annually to fund capital investment in necessary infrastructure projects.  The process of prioritising applications for such projects is near completion and my Department has been guided by local authorities in respect of the most critical projects requiring funding at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_5507">While I appreciate that these GGB requirements impose limitations on local authorities, there are considerable funding constraints at all levels of Government and local authorities cannot be immune to the effects of the downturn in the economy. It is a matter for every local authority, including Fingal County Council, to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources within the GGB limits as set out.</p>
            <p eId="para_5508">My Department will continue to work with all local authorities to ensure that, within the context of the overall GGB requirements, decisions on matters of capital investment are taken in a way which maximise available resources and give the necessary prioritisation to environmental, economic and social infrastructure.</p>

            <p eId="para_5514">I propose to take Questions Nos. 396, 397, 414, 415 and 424 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5515">The Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that the decision making authority for An Bord Pleanála rests with the Board itself and not with any individual inspector who may report on a case.  The Board, in almost all cases which come before it, commissions an inspector's report on the case and it has the benefit of this assessment as an aid to its overall consideration of the matter.  Statistics for the year 2010 indicate that the Board did not accept the substantive recommendation of the inspector in 14.5% of cases.  Section 34(10) of the Act provides that in such cases the Board is required to indicate the reason(s) for not accepting the inspector's recommendation in its decision on the particular case.</p>
            <p eId="para_5516">Inspectors' reports and the Board's decisions are available to the public within three working days of each decision. This provides the necessary transparency to the process and enables the rationale for the Board's decision to be fully understood by all participants in the planning process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5517">Under sections 126 and 221 of the Planning Act, An Bord Pleanála is subject to a statutory objective to determine any planning appeal case within a period of 18 weeks from the date of its receipt, and to determine an application for confirmation of a compulsory purchase order within 18 weeks beginning on the last day for the receipt of objections to the order.</p>
            <p eId="para_5518">Figures distinguishing between residential and non-residential appeal cases are not available. My Department understands from An Bord Pleanála that there would not be any significant divergence between such categories of cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_5519">There are no figures available isolating compulsory purchase orders from the full range of applications which come before the Board for decision — in this regard, compulsory purchase orders are often processed in association with the parallel development consent application.  In March 2011, 74% of all cases which came before the Board, including planning appeal cases and confirmation of compulsory purchase orders were disposed of within the statutory objective period.</p>
            <p eId="para_5520">The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 introduced a range of measures to improve the throughput and performance of An Bord Pleanála. The performance of An Bord Pleanála, and the Department's agencies more generally, remains under ongoing review through mechanisms in place under the Croke Park Agreement. The use of Service Level Agreements in order to optimise governance and performance arrangements in the Department's agencies is also under consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_5536">The Programme for Government proposes the installation of water meters in individual households and the introduction of water charges based on usage above a free allowance. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is currently preparing a strategy to implement these proposals, including the funding of the metering programme. Further details will be made available following Government consideration of the proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_5537">The Department is also preparing legislation to allow for the introduction of domestic water charges. The advice of the Attorney General will be obtained on all aspects of the draft legislation before it is finalised, including compliance with EU legislation and the treatment of households with their own private source of water or without access to a public water supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_5538">The Programme for Government also proposes the establishment of a new State-owned water company. The Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the European Union and International Monetary Fund commits Ireland to undertaking an independent assessment of the establishment of a water utility. The Memorandum also commits Ireland to introducing domestic water charges no later than 2013. The terms of reference for the independent assessment were drafted with regard to these commitments and the proposals contained in the Programme for Government.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5540">My Department held a public consultation on the control of postering for elections and referenda in Autumn 2008. Following on from this, a number of measures, including restricting the number of posters per candidate, were pilot tested during the 2009 Local and European Elections, and local authorities were canvassed for their views on these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_5541">Several local authorities indicated that any restriction on the number of posters per candidate would be difficult to police effectively. There were also concerns that restricting the number of posters per candidate would favour larger parties with several candidates running, while restricting the number of posters per party would disadvantage candidates with running mates. Furthermore there were concerns that any such measures would disadvantage first time candidates and thus interfere with the democratic process. Other concerns included the diverse geographical nature of constituencies, e.g. small urban vs large rural.</p>
            <p eId="para_5542">As a result, no measures were introduced to restrict the number of posters at that time.  However, section 19 (7) of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 was amended by the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2009, to introduce a 30 day time limit prior to an election taking place, during which election posters can be displayed. Prior to this amendment, the relevant legislation had required that election posters be taken down within 7 days of an election; however, no time limit had been specified for the period prior to an election within which posters could be displayed.  While not dealing directly with the number of election posters on display, this legislation ensures that posters are only displayed for a limited period.</p>
            <p eId="para_5543">For the reasons outlined, I have no plans to restrict the number of election posters permitted at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_5661">The report of the Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland was published by my Department in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_5662">Among the principal recommendations in the Report was a greater focus on fire safety, including the introduction of community fire safety initiatives; the enhancement of fire safety legislation, the adoption of a risk-based approach to determining emergency cover as well as new approaches and structures for major emergency management. In addition the Report called for continued capital investment to improve infrastructure and further development of safety, health and welfare arrangements. A great deal has been accomplished in the last decade since the publication of the Report and its key recommendations have been implemented. For example, substantial financial resources were provided to local authorities over the last ten years, and have resulted in a quality fire and rescue infrastructure throughout the country.  Our emergency management arrangements are in line with best international practise and fire safety legislation was strengthened in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_5663">In relation to the specific matter raised in the question, the establishment of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in 2009 addressed conclusively the Farrell Grant Sparks recommendation on revised institutional arrangements at central Government level.  The new structures confirm responsibility for local delivery of fire services, as recommended at paragraph 5.58 of Report, while strengthening the national oversight and leadership role appropriately. The National Directorate, which is located in my Department, has taken over the functions of the Fire Services Council, and is an approach in keeping with the necessary reduction of agencies, while providing appropriate political accountability.</p>

            <p eId="para_5665">The national Building Regulations set out the legal requirements for the design and construction of new buildings, including houses, extensions and material alterations and certain changes of use of existing buildings. The related Technical Guidance Documents provide technical guidance on how to comply with the Regulations.  Part B (Fire Safety)/Technical Guidance Document B sets out the requirements in relation to fire protection as referenced in the correspondence in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_5666">Compliance with the Regulations is the responsibility of the owner or builder of a building. The resolution of problems arising between building owners and builders is a matter for the parties concerned, namely the building owner, the relevant developer and the builder's insurers. Where the construction of a building is the subject of a contract between a client and the builder, enforcement is a civil matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_5667">Enforcement of the Regulations is the responsibility of the 37 local building control authorities who are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, where considered necessary.  Local Authorities also carry out statutory functions as fire authorities under the Fire Services Act 1981.</p>
            <p eId="para_5668">The correspondence in question is a matter for the relevant local authorities whom I understand will deal with the matter as appropriate in line with the standard arrangements in place for the discharge of their statutory functions.</p>

            <p eId="para_5670">The high-level Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments, established in October 2010 following the publication of my Department's National Housing Development Survey database, is identifying practical and policy solutions to address the difficulties associated with unfinished housing developments effectively and promptly.  On foot of the interim analysis and findings of the Advisory Group, which was published on 17 February 2011, initial funding of €5 million is being made available to local authorities to deal with immediate safety issues and works to improve the living conditions for existing residents.  My Department has put in place the necessary arrangements for local authorities to make applications for funding for the most urgent and serious cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_5671">The initial findings of the Advisory Group indicate that action on unfinished housing developments will require:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5672">a collaborative approach by all stakeholders working together to co-ordinate their efforts to resolve the unfinished developments;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5673">an immediate focus on public safety aspects and critical issues affecting residents of developments;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5674">a structured and prioritised approach by local authorities supported by central resources;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5675">the use of Site Resolution Plans and, where appropriate, innovative options such as residents and community involvement, co-operatives and self-build within the resolution process; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5676">national co-ordination and monitoring of regionally and locally organised efforts to tackle the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_5677">I expect the Advisory Group's Final Report to be submitted to me shortly; I will consider its findings and recommendations as a matter of urgency and will bring proposed actions and recommendations to Government for approval.</p>

These costs were met fully from within existing resources of the Affordable Homes Partnership and, since its establishment on an administrative basis, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency. It should be noted that a significant element of the total cost was incurred in the development of the loan processing model which applies to the Home Choice Loan but which has also now been used in the development of revised systems for processing and credit checking of normal local authority house purchase loan applications under other schemes such as affordable housing, shared ownership etc. This new model has been highly effective in improving the loan processing procedures, providing for more rigorous credit checking and allowing for more prudential mortgage lending generally by local authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_5784">Employment equality legislation aims to strike a necessary and appropriate balance between the right to the free profession and practice of religion, recognised by the Constitution and the principle of equality and has done so by providing a qualified exception, of limited scope, in Section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act. Only where it is reasonable to do so and in order to maintain the religious ethos of a religious, educational or medical institution, may more favourable treatment be given under the law on the religion ground to employees or prospective employees. Similarly such institutions may take action, only where it is reasonable to do so, to prevent undermining of the institution's religious ethos by an employee or prospective employee. Application of this provision is, moreover, subject to review by a court or tribunal, such review being on an objective basis and having regard to the need to reconcile the various constitutional rights involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_5785">In the case of admissions to Colleges of Education, the position as regards the Church of Ireland College of Education, whose remit is to provide teachers for the Protestant primary school sector, is that it may reserve places on the Bachelor of Education for students from Protestant backgrounds. The other Colleges of Education accept students of all faiths, non faith or minority backgrounds and publicly identified lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people on their teacher education programmes.

Pending conclusion of these discussions and any discussions the Minister for Education and Skills may wish to have with the education partners, I cannot anticipate what action the Government might approve in this area or whether this will involve amending legislation or other, non-legislative initiatives.</p>

            <p eId="para_5788">In tackling youth crime, the Government subscribes to the principles of the Children Act 2001, as amended, which set out an incremental process of diversion from the formal criminal justice system, community sanctions as alternatives to custody and detention as a measure of last resort. In the case of anti-social behaviour the diversion process includes the use of warnings, good behaviour contracts and anti-social behaviour orders, where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_5789">The Diversion Programme operates in accordance with Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The aim of the Programme is to deal with children who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the offender away from the courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending. The Programme has proven to be successful in diverting young offenders away from crime and anti-social behaviour by offering guidance and support to the young people and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_5790">I am currently awaiting the submission by the Garda Commissioner of the 2010 Annual Report of the Committee appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme. The report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible after it is received.</p>
            <p eId="para_5791">The Programme for Government includes a number of significant commitments which will impact on youth crime.  We will ensure that highly trained Gardaí are freed from administrative duties to concentrate on crime prevention and detection. To this end I will continue to support the changes currently being implemented to free Gardaí from the burden of administrative and financial management of Garda Youth Diversion Projects, thus allowing them to work more closely with the projects on crime reduction/prevention role.  We will build on the existing community policing partnerships and forums to enhance trust between local communities and their Gardaí.  We will attach a higher priority to community policing in order to deliver higher Garda visibility, within available resources, in the neighbourhoods worst affected.  We will give a special emphasis to alternative programmes for young offenders through extensions to the Juvenile Liaison Officer Scheme and the Diversion Programme, and we will examine outcomes-based contracts with community organisations to help reduce re-offending by young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_5792">I will be considering the implementation of these measures in consultation with the Garda Commissioner and with my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in the context of the transfer of functions to her Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_6027">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 7 of 7 April 2011, which indicated the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6028">The programme for Government 2011-2016 undertakes to "establish independent regulation of the legal profession to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints".</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6029">These undertakings complement those structural reforms in the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland aimed at removing restrictions to trade and competition relating to the legal professions and legal costs, namely, to establish an independent regulator for the legal professions and implement the recommendations of the legal costs working group; and to implement the outstanding Competition Authority recommendations in order to reduce legal costs.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6030">I intend to give effect to the various commitments I mentioned by way of the Legal Services Bill which is referred to in the Government legislation programme, announced by the Chief Whip on 5 April. The commitment of the Government is to a strategy that is comprehensive, provides more independent regulation of the legal professions, better regulates legal costs and ensures that the complaints procedures are as effective as possible. The strategy, when implemented, will improve the overall system of delivery of legal services in the State.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6031">In the context of the Bill, I am giving consideration to the question of extending the functions of the legal services ombudsman whose functions at present include the review of the handling by the Law Society and the Bar Council of complaints about solicitors and barristers, respectively, as detailed in that legislation. Of course, although the Bill was enacted in 2009, a legal services ombudsman has not yet been appointed. The outgoing Government had not made that appointment.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6032">Subject to necessary consultations, the consideration of the proposals by the Attorney General and Government approval being obtained, I expect to be in a position to announce details of the Bill's proposals in the not too distant future. It is my objective that the Bill will be before the House for discussion, if not shortly prior to the summer vacation, certainly very early following the Dáil's subsequent reconvening.</p>
            <p eId="para_6033">I have nothing further to add to that reply other than to indicate that the time frame for publication of the proposals is Quarter 3 of 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_6042">The following table shows the number of incidents recorded, by Garda Division, relating to the control of horses in 2010 and in 2011 up to 26 April.</p>
            <p eId="para_6043">In 2010, An Garda Síochána expended €24,600 on the transport of animals of all categories to an animal pound and on veterinary expenses.  Information on costs incurred in placing stray horses in an animal pound could only be provided by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of time and resources.  The figures provided are operational and liable to change.</p>

            <p eId="para_6133">Dedicated victim interview suites have therefore been established in six strategically chosen locations throughout the State, which are used by An Garda Síochána to record interviews with victims.  Work is nearing completion on the establishment of a further facility.  The suites are not attached to Garda stations, and it would not be appropriate for reasons of confidentiality to give details of their precise locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6134">Consideration is being given to locating an additional facility in Mullingar.  A decision whether to establish the facility will be taken in the context of the network of facilities already established and the financial resources available.</p>

            <p eId="para_6136">I am advised by the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INIS) of my Department that the persons referred to by the Deputy have permission to be in the State until 22 September 2011 on student conditions.  I understand they have availed of the special six-month "timed out" permission for non-EEA students, as outlined under the new immigration regime for full-time non-EEA students.  This permission allows timed out non-EEA students to work full-time for the duration of this six-month period and, as an exception to the normal rule, to apply for an employment permit or green card permit without first having to leave the State. This permission is non-renewable.</p>
            <p eId="para_6137">My officials have also informed me that an application for a change of status from Stamp 2 to Stamp 4 was received from the persons referred to by the Deputy on  26 April 2011.

            <p eId="para_6138">I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</p>

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_607">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_6140">The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal.</p>
            <p eId="para_6141">Since 2002, RIA has had in place House Rules and Procedures for asylum seekers living in direct provision asylum accommodation centres.  These Rules set out the entitlements and obligations placed on centre management and residents and, in the event that these are not being met, a complaints procedures to be invoked by either party.  These rules were drawn up by a working party which had an independent Chairman and comprised representatives of accommodation centre management, the Irish Refugee Council, An Garda Síochána, the Attorney General's office, the Health Boards, Irish Commission for Justice and Peace and RIA.</p>
            <p eId="para_6142">Given the passage of time, and taking into account the experience garnered by relevant bodies in the meantime, a new working group was set up in 2007 to review the existing procedures.  Like its predecessor, this group also had an independent Chairman and had representation from NGOs (including the Irish Refugee Council and the Refugee Information Service), the Health Service Executive, RIA, Centre Management and An Garda Síochána.  This Group met on thirteen occasions and a subgroup also met with residents and local NGOs in four accommodation centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_6143">Subject to reservations by the NGO groups involved on the issue of an independent appeals mechanism, of which more below, the Working Group agreed the new rules which were then submitted to NALA (National Adult Literacy Association) for proofing in relation to simplicity of language. This was finalised in November 2009.  The revised rules were laid out in a new question-and-answer format and more clearly explained the complaints mechanism for use by residents and staff alike.  The thrust of the complaints procedure is that issues which arise are best resolved quickly, locally and informally without the need to proceed formally.  In the main, this is how issues are resolved.  However, the rules also provide for a written complaints procedure to be followed in the event that the matter cannot be resolved informally. It also allows for direct referral to RIA in certain circumstances.  It is important to note that if a complaint is made in respect of a decision made by a particular RIA official, the appeal is not deal with by that official.</p>
            <p eId="para_6144">The revised House Rules and Procedures have been translated into 12 languages and are provided to all asylum seekers on arrival at their accommodation centres.  The rules, including all translated versions, are published on-line on the RIA website <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>.  RIA has also held information sessions for residents on the new House Rules in 20 centres in 2010, at which active participation in the complaints process, where required, was encouraged.</p>
            <p eId="para_6145">It needs to be understood that the complaints procedure does not cover the asylum process itself, in respect of which an independent appeals process already exists. Nor does it cover the issue of transfers within the Direct Provision system.  Over and above the House Rules themselves, the interests of asylum seekers are protected through regular clinics in centres, at which residents can speak directly to RIA headquarters staff without local centre management being present. Further, unannounced inspections take place in centres, by RIA staff and by a contracted independent company, to ensure that centres are adhering to their contractual obligations. Also, issues of concern are brought to the attention of RIA by representatives of statutory or voluntary agencies working with asylum seekers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6146">The Deputy will be aware that, in response to concerns expressed by members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in October 2010 to departmental officials appearing before it, amendments were made to the House Rules to further encourage use of the complaints mechanism by residents and staff. Also, RIA will publish shortly on its website aggregated monthly statistics on formal written complaints made under these Rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_6147">The issue of an independent complaints mechanism was a significant feature of the working group discussions which led to the original House Rules and the subsequent revised version.  It was RIA's view that no clear model was cited during these discussions as to what an independent complaints mechanism would look like or how it could be implemented without undue cost and bureaucracy.  The system of direct provision exists within its own circumstances and the RIA is satisfied that the structure of the complaints procedure contained within the revised House Rules is fair and is broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Office of the Ombudsman for internal complaints systems.</p>

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_618">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_6204">As the Deputies know, the Programme of Government, at pages 47 to 51 inclusive, sets out a substantial agenda for reform in the area of Justice and Equality. The initiatives being pursued include those described in the following paragraphs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6205">The scheme of a Legal Services Bill is currently in hand in my Department. A key objective of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland is to return the Irish economy to growth. That programme requires, among other things, that we enact legislation to eliminate barriers to trade and competition relating to the legal profession and to reform the area of legal costs. The structural reforms encompass, first, setting up an independent regulator for the legal profession and implementing the recommendations of the Legal Costs Working Group, and, second, implementing the outstanding recommendations of the Competition Authority to reduce legal costs. Under the Programme of the Government for National Recovery 2011-2016 the Government has undertaken "to establish independent regulation of the legal profession to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints." The proposed Legal Services Bill is designed to achieve the necessary structural reforms. It will be ready for publication in the third quarter of 2011 in compliance with the EU/IMF Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6206">The Criminal Justice (Community Services) (Amendment) Bill 2011, which is designed to extend the use of Community Service Orders, has already completed its Second Stage. It will begin Committee Stage when the appropriate Committee is formed. This Bill gives effect to the Government's commitment to fashion a sentencing system that secures a safer society at a lower cost to the taxpayer. It reflects the principle of restraint in the use of custody, which is a basic principle of European prison law and policy. It also aims to remedy the under-use of Community Service Orders in our penal system. The Bill places a weightier obligation on trial judges to consider imposing a Community Service Order on convicted offenders in cases in which a sentence of imprisonment of up to 12 months is being considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_6207">The Criminal Justice Bill 2011 is ready for publication. This Bill will become one of the key measures in our offensive against white-collar crime. The Bill provides for the suspension in certain circumstances of the detention of persons detained by An Garda Síochána under the Criminal Justice Act 1984. The member of An Garda Síochána in charge of the station where the suspect is being detained will have the power to suspend the detention when he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that doing so is necessary to allow enquiries or investigations to be carried out to advance the investigation of the offence involved. The Bill also grants power to An Garda Síochána to apply to a judge of the District Court for an order requiring witnesses to produce documents or provide information. And it creates offences relating to the concealment of facts disclosed by documents and withholding information. This Bill will better facilitate the investigation of white-collar crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_6208">An emergency Courts Bill for the enforcement of maintenance orders is ready for publication. As the Deputies know, a maintenance order is, in its essence, a court-mandated order requiring one married person to pay money to another for support if they are no longer living together as husband and wife. Problems have arisen in the District Court with respect to the enforcement of certain foreign maintenance orders. The Bill aims to resolve those problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_6209">The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 is ready for Committee Stage. This Bill updates the law governing the entry into, presence in and removal from the State of certain foreign nationals. The intent is to shape a law and procedure that is stringent where appropriate and flexible where appropriate but which is fair, humane, efficient and enforceable. The Bill will keep faith with the Government's commitment in the Programme of the Government for National Recovery 2011-2016 to "include a statutory appeals system and set out rights and obligations in a transparent way".</p>
            <p eId="para_6210">Finally, the Programme of the Government for National Recovery 2011-2016 sets out a commitment to "review the proposal to build a new prison at Thornton Hall and consider alternatives, if any, to avoid the costs yet to be incurred by the State in building such a new prison."  I have appointed a committee — the Thornton Hall Prison Review Group — to review the Thornton Hall Prison Project. The task of the committee is to examine the need to build a new prison at Thornton Hall and consider any alternatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_6211">I am conscious that prisoner numbers have increased from a figure of 3,151 in 2005, when the Thornton Hall Prison Project was first approved, to 4,520 on 21 April 2011, an increase of over 40%. I am also conscious that the 21 April 2011 figure of 4,520 people in prison must be placed in the context of a bed capacity in the prison system of 4,510. Against this backdrop, I believe that a speedy but comprehensive review is needed to determine: first, if new prison accommodation is needed or if greater use of non-custodial sanctions would be a more reasonable option; and, second, assuming for the moment that new prison facilities are needed, if building them at Thornton Hall would be the most cost-effective option.</p>
            <p eId="para_6212">The terms of reference are intended to ensure that all the pertinent factors including economic factors are taken into account. The full terms of reference for the committee are on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality (<i>www.justice.ie</i>). The members of the committee are: Brendan Murtagh, a partner in LHM Casey McGrath; Brian Purcell, Director General of the Irish Prison Service; Judge Catherine McGuinness, retired President of the Law Reform Commission; and Tom Cooney, Special Advisor to the Minister for Justice and Equality. The deadline for the committee’s report is 1 July 2011. After then I will be in a position to make a decision on the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_6213">These items are important planks in a raft of reform measures that my Department is working on. There are other measures in process. For example, on the basis that pre-release offenders need a continuity of practical help to adjust successfully to free society, my Department is working on measures to make the path of the released offender to a law-abiding life an easier one to walk. It would be rash, however, to specify time-frames for the introduction of the various laws and initiatives we are committed to. The Deputies are assured that we will implement the remainder of the Programme of the Government for National Recovery 2011-2016 with all deliberate speed.</p>

            <p eId="para_6215">I have no plans to introduce a Garda Authority or a Policing Board and there is no such commitment in the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_6216">The Garda Síochána Act 2005 makes clear that the Garda Commissioner is accountable to my Department and to me as Minister for the performance of his functions and those of the Force, and of course I am politically answerable in the House in respect of these matters.  The 2005 Act also made the Commissioner the Accounting Officer for the Garda Síochána, and liable to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts in that capacity.  In addition, the 2005 Act established the Garda Ombudsman Commission, which is empowered to carry out independent investigations into Garda conduct, as well as the Garda Inspectorate, which provides expert advice on achieving the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Force.  The accountability of the Garda Síochána has, through these measures, been significantly strengthened.</p>
            <p eId="para_6217">I might also make the point that any comparison with accountability arrangements in other jurisdictions should take into account the fact that the Garda Síochána is rare among police forces in combining security and intelligence functions with policing duties, and should look at the totality of arrangements in those jurisdictions.</p>

            <p eId="para_6219">I am pleased to say that one of the first things I did on becoming Minister was to visit the Mountjoy Prison campus.  I conducted a full tour of Mountjoy Prison including the landings, workshops, school and medical facilities.  I also visited the Dóchas Centre and St. Patrick's Institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_6220">During my visit, I met with prison management and staff.  I was impressed by the commitment and level of professionalism shown by staff working in the challenging environment of a prison.  Again, I would like to compliment them and especially the new Governor, Mr Ned Whelan, for the work done in recent times in improving conditions in the prison.  It is notable that significant improvements can be achieved even in an old prison such as Mountjoy with committed staff under good, committed and determined management.</p>
            <p eId="para_6221">For my part, I am committed to addressing the issue of in-cell sanitation in line with the Government Programme for National Recovery.  A refurbishment project is currently under way in the basement of the C-wing at Mountjoy Prison which will result in an additional 36 cells with in-cell sanitation being installed by mid 2011.  Work has also commenced on a project to provide in-cell sanitation in the remaining 74 cells on the same wing.  This project is expected to be completed by the end of the summer 2011.  Depending on the findings of a post-project appraisal, the Irish Prison Service will consider installing in-cell sanitation facilities in the remaining cells of the prison.</p>

         the powers a garda has with regard to entering private property in circumstances in which he or she has not been invited and is not in possession of a warrant.

            <p eId="para_6250">Members of the Garda Síochána have a wide range of common law and statutory powers available to them to effect entry to private property without either the consent of the occupier or a warrant. These powers are, however, restricted in terms of their purpose and the circumstances in which they may be used. Such restrictions arise from the need to balance, on the one hand, the duty of a member to enforce the law and protect individuals and, on the other, the rights of individuals to ownership and privacy. In addition, the Deputy will be aware that Article 40.5 of the Constitution affords special protection to domestic dwellings, providing that they are inviolable and may not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.</p>
            <p eId="para_6251">Examples of common law powers of entry include the power to enter a private premises (including a dwelling) in order to terminate an affray or to prevent an occupant from causing serious injury to someone else on the premises, and the power to enter in order to effect an arrest. This latter common law power has been superseded in practical terms by the statutory power of entry and search conferred by the Criminal Law Act 1997, section 6 of which permits a member to enter any premises without warrant in order to effect the arrest of a person who is, or who the member with reasonable cause suspects to be, on the premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_6252">Apart from this power to effect an arrest, there are a large number of other statutory powers. Many are aimed at facilitating the inspection or search of a premises for the purpose of ensuring that a particular business is being conducted in accordance with, for example, the conditions of a licence or that nothing unlawful or improper is being carried on there. They tend to concern ensuring compliance with, for example, liquor licensing and gaming laws, as well as public health and environmental standards. Others permit a member to enter summarily where he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that a relevant offence is being committed on the premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_6253">Not all of these powers relate to areas coming within the remit of my Department. Having regard, therefore, to the number and range of powers, I am not in a position where I could provide a list of extant powers that I am satisfied is full, accurate and comprehensive. However, should the Deputy wish me to address a more specific matter relating to my area of responsibility, I would be pleased to provide details on that matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_6255">The confidential reporting system under the Garda Síochána (Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007 commenced operation in June 2008, and the system is continuing to operate.

The Charter contains the contact details of the Confidential Recipients to whom confidential reports may be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_6256">The term of office of the external Confidential Recipient, Mr. Brian McCarthy, expired on 28th February 2011. A follow-on appointment has yet to be made and this delay was mainly due to the interregnum which occurred due to the change of Government.  Under the regulations, certain officeholders and associations must be consulted before any further appointment can be made and it is my intention to appoint an external confidential recipient in the very near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_6257">It should be pointed out that internal confidential recipients, appointed by the Garda Commissioner, are still available to any Garda who is aware of corruption or malpractice.  In relation to the most recent incident at the Corrib protest, this matter is being investigated by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  Finally, with regard to the wider issue of whistleblowing generally, the Government has committed to introducing new legislation in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_6388">I am advised by the military authorities that the total strength of the Reserve Defence Force at 31 March 2011 was 5,728, of which 986 were non-effective, giving an effective strength of 4,742.  A national breakdown of the effective strength of the Reserve Defence Force per Brigade is provided in the tabular statement overleaf.  I am aware that effective numbers in the Reserve have declined over recent years.  The total strength of the Reserve includes personnel who are categorised as effective and non-effective.  As provided for in Defence Forces Regulation R5, personnel are removed from the effective strength of their Units and are placed on the non-effective list primarily for failure to meet minimum training requirements. These personnel remain liable for call out on permanent service or service in Aid to the Civil Power.  Since 2004, with the role of the RDF Review Implementation Plan, the military authorities have increased their efforts to ensure that only those members who meet the requirements remain on the effective list.</p>
            <p eId="para_6389">The number of personnel in the Reserve Defence Force is dependent on funding being available for training. The Deputy will appreciate that there would be little point recruiting personnel if it is not feasible to provide for their training. The funds available for paid training days have reduced from €4.96 million in 2009 to €2.48 million in 2011.  This will allow for the recruitment of a further 200 recruits in 2011 whilst providing training for existing members of the Reserve (based on uptake of paid training over recent years).</p>
            <p eId="para_6390">This level of recruitment was recently agreed with the Military Authorities, having regard to the requirement to maintain the existing capabilities of the Reserve to the greatest extent possible.</p>

In that context the dispersal of personnel over an extended number of locations is a major impediment to the essential collective training required to fulfil those roles.  It also imposes increased and unnecessary overheads on the Defence Forces in terms of barrack management, administration, maintenance and security.  The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective for me as we strive to maximise the effectiveness of the Defence Forces. Whilst no decision has been made in relation to the future of any particular military installation I cannot give a commitment that there will not be further programmes of barrack consolidation.</p>

            <p eId="para_6458">Sneem Fishermen's Co-op applied in 2009 to BIM for grant aid for the purchase of a fishing vessel under the Aquaculture Development Measure of the Southern and Eastern Regional Operational Programme of the NDP 2000-2006.  The application was judged to involve funding of aquaculture activity located in a site designated for protection under the EU Habitats Directive (so called Natura 2000 areas).  The Natura 2000 area where the Co-op's activity is located is the Kenmare River Special Area of Conservation.  In light of a finding against Ireland in 2007 by the European Court of Justice that Ireland was in breach of the Birds and Habitats Directives in relation to its licensing of aquaculture and fishing activities, applications under the Programme for funding of activities connected with an aquaculture site located in a Natura 2000 area were refused on legal advice, including the application from the Co-op.  That Southern and Eastern Regional Operational Programme has since closed.  It is not possible to incur any further expenditure under the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6459">My Department is working with the Marine Institute, BIM, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service on a multi-annual programme to bring Irish aquaculture and fisheries into compliance with the Habitats and Birds Directives.  The Kenmare River SAC is ranked as one of the highest priorities under that programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6460">It should be noted that under article 7 of EU regulation 736/2008, state aid must have an incentive effect.  This means that operations that the beneficiary has already begun to implement cannot receive grant aid.  As the boat in question has been purchased it cannot now be grant aided in retrospect as it would breach EU State Aid rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_6461">However, once aquaculture and fishing activities in the Kenmare River SAC have been scientifically assessed in accordance with the EU Habitats Directive, and subject to the outcome of that assessment, the Co-op may be eligible for support for other future projects under the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme of the current Irish Seafood National Programme 2007-2013.  However, purchase of the mussel boat will not be eligible for funding as each call for proposals under this scheme specifies that projects must not have commenced before an application is made under that call and acknowledged by BIM.</p>

            <p eId="para_6511">Bord na gCon is a commercial State Body responsible for the greyhound industry.  The Board of Bord na gCon is responsible for leading and directing the activities of the Company.  My Department is aware that Bord na gCon is exploring possible business opportunities in China and has been in contact with my Department in this regard.  My Department is considering the Bord na gCon proposal and will form a view based on the case presented to it. Bord na gCon has repeatedly confirmed its commitment to the highest standards of animal welfare in the greyhound industry and in considering the proposal the need to ensure the welfare of animals will be taken into account by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6512">Any proposal to export greyhounds from Ireland to China would require the establishment and agreement of export health certification protocols with the Chinese authorities, and appropriate transport arrangements would have to be put in place to ensure the welfare of the animals in transit. My Department endeavours to ensure that all exporters comply with Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6513">All Member States of the EU including Ireland are working to promote better animal welfare internationally and in this regard Ireland has introduced national legislation giving effect to Regulation (EC) No. 1523/2007 of the European Parliament and Council dated 11 December 2007 banning the marketing, import to or export from the Community of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur.  The commitment of this Government to animal welfare in general is beyond doubt and is reflected among the priorities in the Programme for Government.</p>

The ten recommendations made by the Group were accepted earlier this year and are currently being implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_6516">During 2011 there is a twofold focus to the Department's efforts to tackle this problem. First of all, an extensive nationwide publicity campaign is underway to bring home the message to landowners and farmers of the dangers and the consequences of the illegal burning of vegetation on agricultural land.  A series of advertisements is appearing in the farming press, together with press releases and media articles, with the common theme of the prevention of loss of life, livelihoods, homes, forests and property.  The aim over time is to change the mindset regarding the use of fire in traditional agricultural practices.  Secondly, an enhanced system to notify my Department of forest fires has been introduced, which will result in the better monitoring of burning activities.  More importantly, through follow-up field inspections those individuals found to be engaging in illegal burning will face the consequences of their actions, through penalties under the Single Payment Scheme and Court prosecutions.</p>

            <p eId="para_6525">Eligible land is all land which is subject to an agricultural activity by an applicant such as arable crops, hay, silage, grazing by farm animals or which he/she chooses to top on an annual basis. Land, which was declared on a 2008 Single Payment Scheme application, which gave rise to a payment and was subsequently afforested, can be eligible in certain circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_6526">If an applicant is not producing crops or animals from the land, he or she can chose to simply top it in order to maintain it in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition, a requirement of the Scheme. However, in the case of hill/mountain land or marginal land, or other rough grazing, which cannot be mechanically topped, the only way of maintaining it in GAEC is to graze it with sufficient cattle or sheep. For land to be eligible to an applicant, the farmer must be in control of it for a period including 31 May 2011 and be actively farming it to keep it in GAEC.</p>
            <p eId="para_6527">The Terms and Conditions of the Single Payment Scheme advise applicants, <i>inter alia</i>, as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6528">In order to draw down full payment of SPS entitlements, an "eligible hectare" must be declared in respect of each entitlement. In this context, an "eligible hectare" is land that is used for an agricultural activity and includes land used to grow cereals, oilseeds, short rotation coppice, miscanthus sinensis, protein crops, sugar beet, maize, fodder beet, turnips, mangolds, kale, grass (for silage, or hay or grazing).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6529">Applicants are legally required to declare all the land that will form part of their holding on 31 May 2011, excluding any land that is leased-out or rented-out for any period that includes 31 May 2011.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6530">The person declaring the land on the Single Payment application will be held responsible for any non-compliance with the statutory management requirements under cross compliance or any failure to maintain the lands declared in good agricultural and environmental condition for the period 1 January to 31 December 2011. Lands declared as agricultural land must be maintained as such until 31 December 2011, unless afforested — under the Afforestation Aid Scheme. Any change in the status of declared agricultural land must be notified to the Department.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6531">Applicants declaring rented-in land should satisfy themselves that they will have sole and exclusive use of the land in question for agricultural purposes for the period of the rental agreement.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6532">To claim the direct payment under the 2011 Single Payment Scheme, all of the hectares of land declared by an applicant (owned, rented-in and leased-in) must be subject to an agricultural activity, by the applicant concerned, for a period that includes 31 May 2011. Lands declared as being available on 31 May 2011, for the purpose of drawing down payment, must be maintained as agricultural land for the calendar year 2011, or planted under the Afforestation Aid Scheme in 2011.</p>

They too questioned the speed at which these talks were progressing and supported my call for transparency and a thorough discussion of the impact assessment before any offers are considered.  A number of my colleagues expressed concerns about the impact of a deal for other agricultural products including fruit and vegetables, wine, cereals and ethanol and called for protection for the high environmental and social standards of EU production against imported products that are subject to less onerous requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_6566">I also noted the response of EU Agriculture Commissioner Ciolos, who said that there was no question of offers being exchanged at this point.  He said that it was important first to confirm the level of ambition of the Mercosur side and this would be done at the next round of negotiations in May and that the Commission was striving for a balanced approach with equivalent ambition from Mercosur in key sectors.  He said the EU agriculture offer must be prudent and compatible with the CAP; in this regard the EU had both defensive and offensive interests.  The Commissioner confirmed that the preliminary results of the impact assessment would be released at the end of April and that market access offers would be shared with Member States before they were exchanged with Mercosur.</p>
            <p eId="para_6567">Preliminary reports of the impact analysis have since been released by the Commission and these confirm my concerns that a Mercosur deal would damage EU and Irish agriculture, with the Irish beef sector a particular casualty.  I have asked the Commission to produce the full report as a matter of urgency so that it can be debated thoroughly and comprehensively with the EU Agriculture Council and directly with the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_6568">The initial results bear out the need for extreme caution in these negotiations and for consistency in policies at EU level.  Now that the European Council has acknowledged the importance of the EU agriculture sector as a key driver for the success of the EU 2020 strategy, we need to ensure that our policies are consistent and coherent with each other.  A trade agreement with Mercosur that would allow large quantities of South American food into the EU high-value beef market, displacing Irish and European production, is not consistent with the ambition of using EU agriculture to drive economic recovery.</p>

            <p eId="para_6574">European Commission Regulation No. 504/2008 set out an improved system for the identification for equidae and is binding on all Member States of the European Union.  All keepers of horses, passport issuing bodies and veterinary practitioners are obliged to comply with the provisions of this Regulation.  The enhanced system for identifying equidae has three elements (1) an equine passport; (2) a microchip implanted in an equine to create an unequivocal link between the passport and the equine and (3) the assignment of a unique equine life number to the equine in the database of the approved passport issuing organisation.  I am satisfied the approved passport issuing organisations are operating in compliance with this Regulation this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_6575">Regulation 504/2008 requires that all equines must have a passport, foals must be identified in accordance with the Regulation within six months of birth.</p>
            <p eId="para_6576">Keepers of equines must have passports for their animals in order to be eligible to participate in a wide range of events and activities across the equine sector e.g. thoroughbred breeding and racing, showjumping, competitions, shows, sales and also if certain veterinary medications are to be availed of. Equines cannot be considered for slaughter for human consumption unless they have a passport.</p>
            <p eId="para_6577">With regard to the issue of stray horses the position is that Local Authorities are empowered under the Control of Horses Act 1996 to deal with problems associated with stray or wandering horses in urban and rural areas.  The Act provides for a comprehensive range of measures and enables local authorities to designate control areas, require the licensing of horses within such areas and seize and detain stray and unlicensed horses and to confiscate horses which stray repeatedly. The Act also contains provisions on the identification of horses and criminal liability for permitting or causing a horse to pose a danger to persons or property.  The overall objective of the Act is to eliminate the problem caused by straying or wandering horses.</p>
            <p eId="para_6578">The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is empowered by the Control of Horses Act to make grants available to a Local Authorities towards expenses they incur in its implementation and in this regard my Department provides funding in the region of €2m per annum to assist Local Authorities in their work in implementing the Act.</p>

I recently chaired my first meeting of the High Level Implementation Group and am committed to driving forward the implementation of this strategy to fully achieve the potential of the agri-food and fishing sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_6607">Since Ireland attained Official Brucellosis Free status in 2009, my Department has introduced a number of changes to the brucellosis testing programme which have significantly reduced the testing obligations for farmers.  The changes to date include increasing the age threshold for the annual round test from 12 to 24 months and amending the round test requirement such that herds are now required to be tested only once every two years. In addition, changes made to the pre-movement test rules include increasing the testing period from 30 to 60 days, raising the age threshold for female animals from 12 to 18 months and, in view of the lower risk attached to their movement, to 24 months for bulls.</p>
            <p eId="para_6608">My objective is that Ireland maintains its OBF status and it is important therefore to adopt a cautious approach to any further reduction in controls. In this context, any reduction in the Brucellosis testing regime is given careful consideration by my Department using risk based criteria and takes account of, on the one hand, the fact that the disease continues to be present on this island, and on the other, the desirability of removing costs both for farmers and the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6609">With regard to the request to extend the pre-movement test period to 120 days for cattle entering county agricultural shows, my Department believes that the changes already made to the pre-movement test should provide the necessary flexibility but it will continue to monitor the situation over the coming months with a view to taking a decision on any further changes to the brucellosis control regime in Autumn of this year. The farming representative bodies will be consulted on any policy changes at that stage.</p>

As the person named did not notify my Department of any of the events required under the Scheme for 2008, he is, therefore, ineligible for payment for that year or for any future year of the Suckler Welfare Scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_6613">Under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act 1988, Teagasc has statutory responsibility for the provision of education, advisory and research services to the agriculture sector.  It is a matter for Teagasc and its Board to prioritise activities in the delivery of these services and to allocate its resources in accordance with these priorities. Ministerial responsibility is confined to matters of policy in accordance with the Act and the Minister does not interfere in the day-to-day operations of Teagasc. Accordingly, the future of the Kinsealy Centre is an operational matter for the Teagasc Authority to consider.</p>
            <p eId="para_6614">I am aware that the Teagasc Authority approved a major ‘Change Programme' in 2009 to reorganise and refocus the organisation to meet the significant challenges that lie ahead. The Programme provided for rationalisation measures across the organisation including the advisory office network, research centres, disposal of surplus land and staff reductions. As part of this Change strategy, the Teagasc Authority decided to move the activities and staff based in Kinsealy to other locations with the majority transferring to the Teagasc campus in Ashtown.</p>
            <p eId="para_6615">Teagasc has stressed that the decision to re-locate horticulture services from Kinsealy will not impact negatively on their support for the horticulture sector.  They point out that most of the permanent staff located in Kinsealy are not involved in Horticulture research and training. Teagasc has produced a comprehensive ‘Horticultural Plan' which outlines an alternative model for horticultural research that is less dependent on the traditional type of research infrastructure. They are satisfied that the needs of the ‘Horticultural Research' programme can be adequately met from the facilities proposed for the Teagasc Centre at Ashtown and by conducting more research on producer sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_6616">I understand that Teagasc has carefully assessed the potential costs/benefits attributable to relocating from Kinsealy to Ashtown and they are satisfied that the closure of Kinsealy will give rise to significant annual cost savings.</p>

The person named declared 118.27 ha on this application but the declared area was reduced to 115.90 ha following a commonage review. The application was selected for a ground eligibility and full cross compliance inspection. During the ground eligibility inspection discrepancies were noted in relation to parcels numbers H20917055, H20917047, H20917056, H21408022, H21408024 and H22134039 in that inadequate deductions were made for scrub, trees and a farm roadway.</p>

As per the Terms and Conditions of the Single Payment Scheme, if the difference between the area found and the area declared or the number of entitlements held (if lower) is greater than 3% but not more than 20% of the area found, payment is based on the number of eligible hectares found reduced by twice the difference (in hectares).</p>
            <p eId="para_6627">In this case, as the area declared was less than the number of entitlements held the calculation was based on the area declared 115.90 ha and the application of the penalties for the over-declaration of areas, as outlined above, resulted in the payable area being reduced to 97.09 ha. Full payment on this basis net of modulation issued to the person named on the 21st of December 2010. The person named was informed of the results of the inspection on the 4th of November 2010 and of his right to seek a review and has since contacted the District Inspector for his area in relation to same.

I can advise the Deputy that the HSE is currently reviewing its policy in relation to eligibility for non-ambulance based patient transport services in order that a consistent policy is adopted nationally for these services. The need for patients to travel arises partly as a result of the consolidation of cancer services by the HSE National Cancer Control Programme (HSE NCCP).  There are a number of systems of support in place for cancer patients who have to travel for treatment, through the Community Welfare Office services and the Travel2Care scheme.  The Travel2Care scheme is being implemented on a phased basis in line with the transfer of cancer services to the designated centres and the approved satellite centre, where this transfer of services has caused financial hardship.  This scheme, which is funded by the HSE NCCP and administered by the Irish Cancer Society, provides some financial help towards the costs of public transport such as trains or buses, private transport costs; or petrol and parking.</p>

            <p eId="para_6663">The objective of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to children in the year before they commence primary school.  Approximately 4,300 preschool services, 95% of those operating in the State, are participating in the programme which requires appropriate age related activities and programmes to be provided to children within a targeted age range which spans almost 17 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_6664">Children are eligible for the free Preschool Year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months in September of the relevant year and 63,000 children, or 94% of the eligible cohort, are currently availing of the programme.  In setting the minimum and maximum age limits, account was taken of a number of factors, including the variation in school admission policies and the fact that the majority of children commence primary school between the ages of 4 years 6 months and 5 years 6 months.  In the case referred to by the Deputy, as the child in question was born in July 2007 he will be eligible for the free Preschool Year commencing in September 2011 should his parents choose to avail of this option.  I understand that this issue has been investigated by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children which found no reason to remove or amend the lower age limit, accepting it as reasonable having regard to the various factors which apply.</p>

            <p eId="para_6667">Services have been developed by individual service providers or former Health Boards over time and reflect the individual experience and expertise of providers in meeting local needs.  This has led to variations in the way services are configured at the local level and, in relation to the provision of therapy supports for children with disabilities, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has recognised the need to enhance the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered. The reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years) has been identified as a priority and is a ‘Key Result Area' in the Executive's National Service Plan 2011. National, regional and local level structures are being put in place to progress this initiative, which will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for children with disabilities, including those with autism.</p>

            <p eId="para_6682">I propose to take Questions Nos. 547 and 556 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6683">In common with other public services, the health services are facing significant financial challenges. The key priority for the Government and the HSE in dealing with the serious budget pressures on the health services is to minimise the effect on services for patients to the greatest degree possible. There is, however, a requirement on health agencies to take all appropriate steps to keep within budget and to take early and decisive action to ensure that potential overruns are addressed while maintaining services.</p>
            <p eId="para_6684">As the planned activity and expenditure levels of Croom Orthopaedic Hospital during the first quarter of the year exceeded approved levels, it has become necessary for the HSE to devise proposals to address this issue. I sought an immediate briefing from the HSE on its proposals. I indicated to the Executive that it should ensure that the service plan targets for Croom are at least met and if possible exceeded. This would require a particular focus on efficiency improvements including increasing day of surgery admission rates, and additional day case work. I also insisted  that outpatient waiting lists be addressed, so that patients do not have to wait for unacceptable periods of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_6685">In response to the concerns I raised, I have now been advised by the HSE that a plan has been devised that will realise savings of €2.1m in the current year on the basis of continuing activity at current levels, with no breaches of waiting time targets for hip and knee replacements. This is to be achieved through a combination of efficiency measures agreed with the Clinicians as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6686">Improved management of day of admission for surgical procedures</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6687">Improved management of average length of stay</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6688">Cost control in relation to medical and surgical supplies</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6689">Improved income collection and bed management</p>
            <p eId="para_6690">I am pleased to say that an additional 6,000 out-patients will be seen in Croom through a series of measures in the areas of physiotherapy, pain management and other services. The combination of these measures will result in a major reduction in the numbers of patients awaiting outpatient appointments in the mid-west area.  I am committed to ensuring acute hospital services at national, regional and local level are provided in a clinically appropriate and efficient manner. In particular, I want to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely in smaller local hospitals. Finally, I want to acknowledge the important role that Croom Orthopaedic Hospital plays as part of the health services infrastructure of the Mid-West.</p>

            <p eId="para_6703">The main priority for the HSE's National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) at present is to maximise national uptake in the 50-64 year age cohort.  In the meantime women of any age who have concerns about breast cancer should seek the advice of their GP who will, if appropriate, refer them to the symptomatic breast services in one of the eight designated specialist cancer centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_6704">The NCSS continually reviews and assesses new and emerging evidence in screening benefits, including the optimum age range for screening.  In 2009 it  commissioned a review of the evidence for reducing the lower screening age limit from 50 to 47 years. <i> </i>  The review found that the effectiveness of screening below age 50 remains an issue of debate.  Several randomised controlled trials in screening have included younger age groups but have not confirmed significant reduction in mortality in the 40-49 age group.  The review concluded that while a reduction in screening age might be of some benefit to some younger women, the merits of extending the programme age range downwards from a population-based screening perspective are a matter of debate. The review did not change the overall position that while the case for extending the age downwards is now stronger than it used to be, the case for extending the programme to older women was still stronger. Extending the age range to 69 must therefore be the priority for the NCSS.</p>

            <p eId="para_6706">Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with specified conditions, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, Parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions covered by the LTI.</p>
            <p eId="para_6707">Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, which was introduced in 1999, no individual or family unit pays more than €120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>
            <p eId="para_6708">In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.  Under the Governments proposals for Universal Health Insurance and free GP care at the point of delivery, this issue will be considered and addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_6728">A career break scheme has been in operation in the HSE and, before its establishment, the health boards as part of the wider arrangements in place in the public sector. Career breaks have been offered as part wider family friendly policies in the public sector and indeed such schemes are also offered by some organisations in the private sector. A career break may be allowed for a number of reasons including family and domestic purposes (e.g. care of a relative), travel abroad, and educational purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6729">While line managers are asked to facilitate applications for career breaks as far as possible, the needs of the business or service may require that some applications will have to be refused; the operation of the career break scheme is subject to the operating requirements of the HSE not being significantly adversely affected, in particular that essential service provision is not undermined.  In addition, in 2009 a Special Incentive Career Break Scheme was made available for a limited period, as part of the efforts to achieve a reduction in spending on the pay bill. This special scheme provided an incentive payment of a third of gross basic pay to a maximum of €12,500 per year, for each year of the 3 year period of the career break incentive scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6730">The HSE should normally reallocate or re-organise work or staff, where any vacancy arises due to a career break. The filling of vacancies arising is subject to current Government policy on public service numbers and, in particular, the Employment Control Framework in the health sector.  I have been informed by the HSE that there are currently 930 individuals on or awaiting return from career break across the HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_6784">CORU is the umbrella body responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals. It includes the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and the 12 registration boards to be established under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. The Health and Social Care Professionals Council  was established in March 2007 and has been working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the twelve health and social care professions designated in the Act. The first registration board under the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, with arrangements now being progressed to facilitate the opening of the Social Workers Register to accept registrants of the profession.</p>
            <p eId="para_6785">CORU will announce the opening of the Social Workers Register shortly and this will  mark the start of statutory registration of this profession. CORU will also formally announce the registration fee that will be applicable to registrants of the Social Workers Register in advance of the opening of this first register. The fees will be set by CORU, having regard to the requirement for the Health and Social Care Professionals Council to be self-funding. Fees are eligible for tax relief at the highest rate of tax payable by the individual. CORU has been provided with seed funding by my Department to-date but is expected to become self-funding by charging fees to meet all of its costs. Representatives from CORU, and officials from my Department, have recently met with unions representing the professions, to discuss the operation of statutory registration for the professions concerned and various issues relating to the level of registration fee.</p>
            <p eId="para_6786">CORU will enable health and social care professionals to practice in a regulated manner while providing the highest level of patient care and service, and this positive development is very much to be welcomed.</p>

            <p eId="para_6838">National policy in relation to colonoscopies is that all urgent cases which are assessed by a doctor as being at risk from cancer are seen within a 28 day target.  In 2009 the HSE provided hospitals with national guidelines on managing colonoscopies.  The guidelines included a definition to prioritise patients referred for colonoscopy services into two groups — urgent and non-urgent.</p>
            <p eId="para_6839">I have been informed by the HSE that the Consultant Surgeon and Consultant in Emergency Medicine in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital have reviewed this case, referring to the patient's medical records. All requests for colonoscopy are triaged to ensure that a suitable date is given for the test, based on clinical presentation.  They have concluded that the tests and treatment plans as arranged in this case are appropriate.  I understand the Hospital is to correspond directly with the patient on the issues raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_6880">Within the coming weeks, I will seek Government approval to prepare legislation to regulate sunbed use, in particular to prohibit their use by those under 18 years of age. Other proposals include ensuring that adequate protective eyewear is provided, that information on the health risks associated with sunbeds use is provided, and prohibiting sunbed outlets and retailers from attributing health benefits to sunbed use.  My Department has already completed a considerable body of work in relation to the proposed legislation.  Subject to Government approval, work will proceed on drafting the required legislation.

As part of this review, my Department has sought the views of the relevant nursing unions.

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_6886">In 2010 the Director of the Office of Clinical Strategy and Programmes in the HSE met the Irish Consultant Neurologists' Association (Neurology Faculty) to discuss how best to move neurological services forward in Ireland. Following discussions it was agreed to appoint a number of Neurologists to lead three key national programmes, giving neurological care a major focus in the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_6887">The first programme deals with neurology out patient departments and aims to provide standardised care for neurology patients and to increase access so that patients will not wait more than 30 days for an appointment.  The programme will establish referral guidelines and encourage the increased use of neurolink.</p>
            <p eId="para_6888">The second programme deals with epilepsy services and aims to introduce rapid access clinics to assist with admission avoidance and reduce the number of attendances to emergency departments.  This will include the introduction of twenty four hour, seven day a week telephone access to expert opinion for all health care professionals.  The HSE's service plan has made provision for the recruitment of twenty epilepsy specialist nurses to provide satellite/outreach services to patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_6889">The third programme deals with stroke services and aims to establish robust clinical governance systems for stroke care, including local stroke teams and regional stroke networks. This is due to include access to safe and effective stroke thrombolysis in all hospitals admitting acute stroke on a twenty four hour, seven day a week basis. The HSE's service plan also provides for the establishment of nine new acute stroke units in hospital admitting significant numbers of stroke patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_6890">The setting up of these programmes shows the importance that the HSE gives to neurological care and its commitment to improving access to neurological services.</p>
            <p eId="para_6891">Furthermore, the HSE has emphasised to my Department that all national programmes, including those concentrating on neurology, will have a focus on patient advocacy. These inter-related programmes aim to improve service quality, effectiveness and patient access and to ensure that patient care is provided in the service setting most appropriate to individuals' needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6892">I am being briefed by my Department and the HSE on these important clinical programmes and on the organisation of acute services in each region.</p>
            <p eId="para_6893">I welcome the action plan for neurological care by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, which emphasises the importance of neurological care and raises many issues that these Neurology programmes will address, including a comprehensive plan for improving neurological care including acute services and increasing staffing.</p>
            <p eId="para_6894">The action plan includes reference to access to neurological rehabilitation services. My Department is in the process of finalising a National Policy and Strategy for the delivery of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_6895">The Health Service Executive's National Service Plan for 2011 also includes a commitment to:</p>

         if the necessary funding will be made available to allow Valentia Community Hospital, County Kerry, to serve the needs of the island and the Iveragh Peninsula in the same way as it has done for the past 140 years.

          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_729">
            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_6900">Valentia Community Hospital provides long-term and respite care to older people. It is run by a voluntary organisation, Valentia Community Health and Welfare Association Ltd.</p>
            <p eId="para_6901">In the past, Valentia Community Hospital would have been allocated a lump sum annually by the HSE. As you are aware, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, was introduced in October 2009 in order to address the fundamental inequity in the treatment of public and private long-term nursing home residents and to alleviate the financial hardship being experienced by long-term residents in private nursing homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6902">Prior to the introduction of the Fair Deal scheme, many people in long-term nursing home care experienced unaffordable care costs over periods of many years.  The result was that many people had to sell or re-mortgage their houses or had to turn to family and friends in order to find the money to meet their care costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6903">A fundamental purpose of the scheme, therefore, was to offer assurance to one of the most vulnerable groups in society —those in need of long-term nursing home care —that such care will be affordable and will remain affordable for as long as they need it.</p>
            <p eId="para_6904">In order to achieve these objectives of equity and affordability, Fair Deal involves a fundamental change in the way in which long-term nursing home care is funded and, consequently, the way in which nursing homes and community hospitals are funded.</p>
            <p eId="para_6905">The new scheme supports the individuals in need of long-term nursing home care, not the facilities providing the care. This means that money follows the patients, regardless of whether they choose public, private or voluntary nursing homes. It ensures that these facilities are not being funded for empty beds.</p>
            <p eId="para_6906">In order to qualify for the scheme, all private and voluntary nursing homes, including Valentia Community Hospital, must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This is a necessary feature of the scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person's contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_6907">As stated above, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme only applies to long-term nursing home care. Valentia Community Hospital can continue to have separate agreements with the HSE for the provision of other services, e.g. day care, respite and convalescence. There are ongoing discussions between the Board of Management of Valentia Community Health and Welfare Association Ltd. and the HSE with regards to future service provision. I understand that the Board of Management is currently considering its options and will be supported by the HSE in its decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_6908">Finally, the Government is committed to implementing a comprehensive programme of health reform.  The aim of this reform process is to deliver a single-tier health service that will deliver equal access to care based on need, not income.  The detailed implementation arrangements will be subject to careful examination and I intend to consult widely throughout this process.  The Government has set clear goals for the health service, namely:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6909">a universal health care system with access based upon need,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6910">more care delivered locally through strengthened primary care, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6911">greater transparency and incentives regarding performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_6912">The Nursing Homes Support Scheme will be considered in the context of the overall reforms currently being contemplated. In the meantime, the scheme will continue to apply to long-term nursing home care and, consequently, money will follow the patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_6914">Clinical education is an essential component of the physiotherapy degree programme.  Undergraduate students must complete a minimum of 1,000 clinical placement hours as part of their undergraduate qualification.  The current minimum standards for practice education require students to complete sufficient hours of supervised clinical practice to ensure the integration of theory into practice.  These placements are arranged to ensure that all students have adequate exposure to key aspects of practice in relevant settings in order to equip and enable them to practice safely and in a manner which will ensure the provision of high-quality interventions.</p>
            <p eId="para_6915">The Health Service Executive encourages and provides for the continuing professional development of all relevant health and social care professionals employed in the health service.</p>

            <p eId="para_6918">Children with Down's Syndrome are generally classified as having an intellectual disability.  The majority of children and adults within the mild level of intellectual disability who have support needs can be effectively supported within generic or mainstream child and adult health services. A<b/>proportion representing those with assessed need for specialist services are referred to intellectual disability services. </p>
            <p eId="para_6919">Specialist Intellectual disability services are primarily targeted towards people with moderate, severe and profound levels of intellectual disability. However, some people with mild intellectual disability have specialist needs that will require specialist service supports. Decisions regarding the provision of services are not based simply on a person's level of intellectual disability; best practice in the HSE is to assess each individual case and make the best decisions in relation to that case.</p>

            <p eId="para_6921">It is a specific condition of the 2009 Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement and 2010 Voluntary Early Retirement and Voluntary Redundancy schemes that persons who availed of the schemes are not eligible for re-employment in the  public health sector. In the case of the 2010 schemes this restriction was extended to include the wider public service as well as bodies funded wholly or mainly  from public funds. In the case of the Voluntary Redundancy scheme the re-employment restrictions applies for seven years, after which the approval of the Minister for Finance is required in any cases where re-employment is proposed. The restrictions also apply to re-employment on a contract for service basis in respect of all schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6922">It is sometimes necessary for the HSE to re-engage retired staff on a short-term basis for a variety of reasons, primarily to ensure the provision of locum cover in front-line services. Former staff members may also be engaged on time-limited basis to sit on interview boards for staff appointments. Abatement provisions are applied to any situation where a pensioner is re-engaged, to ensure that the combination of his/her pension and salary does not exceed the remuneration payable to a serving staff member at the same level.  I consider that, other than in the circumstances I have outlined, the re-engagement of retired management or administrative staff members on a consultancy basis is not appropriate and should be contemplated only in the most exceptional circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_6926">The Adoption Act 2010 gives force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-Operation in respect of Inter-Country Adoption. In accordance with Article 46.1 of the Hague Convention, the Convention entered into force for Ireland on 1 November 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_6927">Under the Adoption Act 2010, inter-country adoptions can be effected with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention or with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement. The purpose of this is to ensure that the highest standards of child protection apply to all adoptions, as Hague countries have signed up to a set of minimum standards.  Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention and there are no indications that it has plans to do so.  In these circumstances, adoptions from Russia from the 1 November 2010 onwards can only be effected  under a transitional provision that enables prospective adoptive parents to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague or non-bilateral country if prior to 1 November they had been issued with a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt.  In such cases  the Adoption Authority must be satisfied that the particular adoption meets all the standards of the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_6928">The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has had preliminary exploratory discussions with its Russian counterparts on some legal issues in relation to a bilateral agreement. However, the negotiation of a bilateral agreement in primarily the responsibility of the Adoption Authority, who have indicated that, as the purpose of the Hague Convention is to promote high standards in inter-country adoption,  their first priority is to reach agreements on arrangements with other Hague countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_6929">If discussions on a bilateral agreement with Russia commence it is important to understand that there re a number of key requirements that would have to be satisfied, including that there should be no fees other than reasonable administrative fees, that care within Russia should have been sought for a child eligible for adoption and that the birth family must have given informed consent.  If any of these requirements cannot be met, it will not be possible to enter into a bilateral agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_6930">The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will continue to support the Adoption Authority as required in its work of dealing with countries of origin.</p>

            <p eId="para_7052">The Health Service Executive submitted its National Service Plan for 2011 to the then Minister for Health and Children on 17th December 2010.  This plan set out a budget of €708 million for Mental Health Services for the year, and was approved by the then Minister on 21st December 2010 under Section 31(8) of the Health Act 2004.  Despite significant global budget reductions applied to the HSE in 2011, the reduction of funding for mental health services is limited to 1.8% in the current year. This amount was determined on the basis of reducing costs while maintaining, in so far as practicable, the level of services approved in 2010 and will be spent in line with nationally agreed policy for mental health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_7053">If the Health Service Executive proposes to amend a Service Plan it must submit its proposed amendment to me as Minister for my consideration. The HSE has made no proposals to me along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</p>

Ireland, along with other ILO Member States, must bring the Convention into force via national legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_7091">This obligation has led to the necessity for an enabling provision to be included in primary legislation. Section 87 was included in the Merchant Shipping Act 2010 to address the merchant shipping aspects of the Convention and will enable the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to make regulations to fulfil the State's commitments in relation to merchant shipping aspects of the Convention for Irish ships and seafarers sailing on those ships.</p>

         his plans to review the operation of the State port inspection regime; the number of inspectors currently invigilating ships that use Irish waters or ports; the number of inspections which have taken place during each of the past five years; the number of prosecutions which have been brought for non-payment of wages and breaches of health and safety conditions during each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_7095">Port State Control inspections onboard foreign flagged ships in Irish ports are carried out under the auspices of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on port state control and EU Directives.  These inspections are carried out to check for compliance with International Law.  A "New Inspection Regime" (NIR) for port state control commenced on 1 January 2011 and is based on 100% of ships being inspected in the Paris MoU area over a 3 year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_7096">The NIR is designed to reward quality shipping with longer periods between inspections, whilst penalising operators of poor quality ships with more frequent and more in depth inspections being required on such ships. The number of marine surveyors employed by my Department and who carry out a range of duties currently stands at 27. The Department's surveyors inspect over 400 foreign flagged ships per year and they detain any ship which poses a safety hazard or which does not comply with the international requirements on living and working arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_7097">The total number of inspections completed in each of the last five years was 440 in 2006, 410 in 2007, 434 in 2008, 420 in 2009 and 435 in 2010. With regard to prosecutions for non-payment of wages and breaches of health and safety conditions, the primary responsibility for the compliance with the law on board ships rests with the flag state in each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_7098">The payment of wages on foreign flagged ships is a matter for the flag state where the ship is registered and is a matter for the internal domestic law of that country.  However, non-payment of wages is not in itself a basis for detention of a vessel by surveyors of my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_7100">The terms and conditions of employment on board vessels are a matter primarily for the State, known as the Flag State, in which a ship is registered.  My Department does not have responsibility for the non-payment of wages on board foreign flagged ships which is a matter for the Flag State.  A comprehensive body of Irish employment rights legislation governs the conditions of employment of workers on board vessels under the Irish flag.  This would include legislation dealing with minimum wages.</p>
            <p eId="para_7101">Port State Control inspections onboard foreign flagged ships in Irish ports are carried out under the auspices of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Port State Control and EU Directives.  These inspections are carried out to check for compliance with International Law.  Ireland has consistently supported the International Labour Organisation in its efforts to promote global labour standards for seafarers.</p>
            <p eId="para_7102">A new consolidated Maritime Labour Convention was adopted in February 2006 at the 94th International Labour Conference in Geneva, Switzerland.  Ireland was represented at the Conference by a tripartite delegation consisting of Government officials along with nominees from employers (IBEC) and workers (ICTU).  The new Convention sets out clear principles and rights for seafarers.  EU member states are committed to ratifying the new Convention and it is expected to come into force internationally in 2011 or 2012.  Ireland will continue to work within the Paris MoU and with the other EU member states so as to ensure the development of the necessary port state control procedures that will be required in connection with the entry into force of the Maritime Labour Convention.</p>

            <p eId="para_7106">The maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources and are supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_7107">A total of €375,176,000 has been allocated for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads in 2011.  This year there is an increased focus on directing funding towards repair and maintenance works with over 85% of the grant monies available in 2011 to be spent on such works.  In order to increase the monies available for the maintenance and rehabilitation of road pavements, particularly arising from the severe weather, it has been necessary to reduce the grant allocations for major new road schemes and for major realignment schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_7108">This National Roads Authority received an application from Cork County Council in September 2010 for 100% funding of the R624 Cobh Road Project at an estimated cost of €57.5 million under the Strategic Regional and Local Roads Programme. The funding available for projects under this grant category in 2011 is €20.1 million (down from €87.5 million in 2008). Given the reduction in the available funding and the list of strategic projects competing for funding (including existing projects with financial commitments) the Department is not, at this time, in a position to make a funding commitment to this project.</p>

More generally, the Deputy will note that the Estimates for my Department under the outgoing government's 4-year plan are not sufficent to maintain the existing investment in national and regional roads.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources and are supplemented by State road grants.  However, the initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. A total of €375,176,000 has been allocated in 2011 for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads.  As regards the availability of additional funding, I have directed that the overall transport budget is assessed to determine what scope exists for allocating additional funds for the repair and maintenance of regional and local roads.  Any additional funding made available to local authorities as a result of this process will be subject to the normal assessment criteria relating to State grants.</p>

            <p eId="para_7198">New regulations for eligibility for the Disabled Parking Scheme will come into force on 1 June. The changes to the Scheme arise from a review of the Scheme published by my Department last year.  This review was conducted by my Department in consultation with the two organisations which operate the Scheme, the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association.  The review found that the numbers of parking permits issued and applications being received by the issuing authorities have increased substantially in recent years. With over 80,000 parking permits issued, the imbalance between numbers of permit holders and available parking bays has steadily deteriorated, with severe consequences for seriously mobility impaired permit holders who regularly cannot access appropriate parking bays and are, accordingly, prevented from accessing services. In consequence, the review recommended a change to the criteria for eligibility for the Scheme to shift the focus from eligibility based on a given medical condition to eligibility based on degree of mobility impairment.  Permits will in future be available only to people whose condition severely restricts their mobility.  This means that in future the Scheme will benefit more those for whom it was originally designed.  In cases where passengers with Down Syndrome have severe mobility impairments they will of course be eligible for a permit under the revised rules.</p>
