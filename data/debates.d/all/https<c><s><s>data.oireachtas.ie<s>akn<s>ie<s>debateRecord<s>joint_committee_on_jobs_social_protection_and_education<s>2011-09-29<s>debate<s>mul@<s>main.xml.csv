#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I welcome the following from the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland: Mr. Gerard P. Kilcommins, president; Ms Joanne Richardson, CEO; Mr. Brian Harrison, research and communications executive; and Mr. Brian Cotter, commercial and public affairs director.  I also welcome Mr. Joseph P. Quinlan, author of an American Chamber of Commerce report on US foreign direct investment into Ireland.Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.I ask Mr. Quinlan to outline the findings of his report.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here.  I will speak briefly about the relationship between Ireland and the United States.  There are nearly 200 nations spread throughout the world in which US companies can make direct foreign investment.  When one digs into the numbers it is interesting to discover the depth of the relationship between the United States and Ireland.  The US exports to Ireland at approximately $35 billion are not very big and might give the impression there is not much trade or commerce between the two parties.  However, foreign direct investment and foreign affiliate sales tell a different and powerful story which underscores the relationship that I call "built to last".  With concerns over the global economy, considerable turmoil in Europe, major problems in the United States, the rise of China and so forth, there are many question marks over what US companies will do next in Ireland.  I am bullish or optimistic when it comes to the relationship between US multinationals and Ireland.What does this mean economically?  There is $190 billion dollars of invested stock in Ireland from the United States.  What has that really done?  It has helped to promote economic growth, create jobs, create income and turn Ireland into an exporting powerhouse in the sense that we are not talking about low-end high-volume software, footwear or tennis racquets out of China.  We are talking about very sophisticated exports in the areas of life sciences, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, information technology, software and so forth.  I believe it is a great story, which is not really told well in the United States.  People in the US are not being told what US companies are doing here, the benefits for those companies and the benefit for Ireland.  There are tremendous benefits for US companies from their operations in Ireland in that the more US affiliates in Ireland are successful, the more US multinationals are successful as are their workers and shareholders back home, and the politicians in their constituencies.  It is very important in that sense.  There is considerable upside in this relationship which is unequivocally mutual.Speaking of mutual, it is not just the investment of the United States in Ireland, but there has also been a great surge of investment by Ireland in the United States, which is very powerful and prevalent in Wall Street in construction, utilities and food products.  Irish companies are spreading their presence in the United States, which further integrates and makes for even stronger transatlantic ties between the United States and Ireland.My last comment will really talk to the post-crisis world because there are many question marks over what will happen next.  We still have the eurozone crisis that we have to deal with.  Ireland is front and centre in the sense that it is part of the bailout programmes of financial assistance in the past year or so.  There are tremendous questions about the eurozone and what happens next in the European Union.  I would separate the two.  I work on Wall Street and deal with many clients, with the media and so forth.  There are eurozone problems, which are unequivocally significant problems, but then there is the European Union.  At the end of the day both the eurozone and the European Union will be very strong entities by which to help to lead the global economy.It has perhaps been forgotten that the European Union accounts for approximately 22% of global GDP and 25% of global consumption.  It is a huge exporter and importer and a wealthy market.  What in particular brings US companies to Ireland are the wealth of the EU, the skilled labour force in Ireland and the very pro-business friendly conditions in which companies operate here.I do not see EU disintegration, or any problems there in the medium to long term, doing anything to undermine the very strong relationship between the United States and Ireland.  If anything, I am optimistic and hopeful that what will come out of the eurozone will be a far more integrated European body which will be far more intact and ready for the next storm.  When it comes to the underlying investment outlook, what is very impressive about Ireland is the quality of the companies coming here.  They are best in class.  These include Google, Intel and IBM, which are global leaders which need the leverage and capabilities of Ireland to make them successful.Conversely, when we speak about the rise of China, which is a threat, I also see an opportunity.  To be successful in these emerging markets, US companies must leverage every resource available to them in order to compete, and Ireland is squarely in the mix.  I am optimistic about the road ahead and I do not see any type of pullback from US investment in general, in particular from Ireland.  The numbers for the first half of this year were quite robust, which is not surprising.  When one considers the three years from 2008 to 2010, which were the crisis years, the underlying relationship and investment and trade ties between the United States and Ireland became stronger and not weaker.  This speaks volumes.I thank the committee for this opportunity and I look forward to any questions.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I welcome the delegation.  It is heartening to hear a very upbeat assessment by the author of the important report on foreign direct investment in Ireland.  With regard to Irish investment in the United States, I believe Mr. Quinlan may have mentioned in a broadcast recently the number of people employed in Ireland by US companies.  What is the comparable number employed in the United States by Irish companies?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	4	We received the 2009 figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, BEA, and the figure is 116,000.  However, this number includes banks and non-banks.  The number cited by the BEA for US affiliates in Ireland is for non-banks only.  The BEA has a phenomenal capacity to confuse people, myself included, so it is not apples and oranges.  My estimate for the number of US workers employed by Irish affiliates is approximately 120,000.  We have seen a big increase and it could be due to financial sector employment.  However, we must also remember the United States is the most attractive market in the world for foreign direct investment and the Irish are now involved in this phenomenon.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	5	We are very proud of Glanbia and the Kerry Group, which are major international companies and substantial employers in the United States.  What percentage of overall employment by Irish firms in the US is in food and traditional manufacturing as opposed to financial services?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	6	As a percentage of the 116,000?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Approximately.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Off the top of my head I would state approximately 10% to 15% or 15% to 20% but I would have to examine the numbers.  Services on Wall Street are a major component, as are construction and utilities.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I welcome the delegation.  We are told the big attraction of Ireland is our tax base.  How important is this compared with other factors?  I have heard from companies of factors such as the language, the environment, being safe and being a good place to rear children.  How important are factors such as these?With regard to pharmaceutical companies coming to Ireland, many people cannot understand how the big companies can manufacture drugs here while the cost of buying these drugs over the counter is as high as it is.  Many people suggest that as part of the package when such companies came to the country an arrangement should have been made on this.  Is such an arrangement made in other countries?  It seems to be a logical way forward.  People cannot understand how a company produces a product for 1 cent but the market price is $1 or €1.  It seems to have been a weakness in the past and something that should be examined.  People cannot understand why a pharmaceutical product is a fraction of the cost it is here in Spain, France or Italy, even though it is made in Ireland.Commissioner Barroso spoke about the bank bailout and money being invested, and a tax on business per se.  What effect would this have on possible investment?  Part of President Obama’s programme was to get US companies to relocate back to the United States.  Are companies committed to staying in Ireland?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Mr. Kilcommins will answer the question on pricing.  Unequivocally, there is more to Ireland than low corporate taxes.  Taxes are very important to multinationals but they also seek a skilled labour force, transparency and intellectual property rights protection, and this is a clear differentiator between Ireland and China, for example.  Ireland has nothing to worry about in this particular space.  Multinationals consider a bundle of endowments, opportunities and determinants, including EU access, a skilled labour force, speaking English and intellectual property rights.  The ease of doing business is another area in which Ireland is well ahead of the large emerging markets of which we hear.  Taxes are important but there is more to it than this.With regard to President Barroso's comments, I am against such a tax.  Given the state of the earnings recovery, any determination by government fiat of how a company deploys its own capital is not good for the real economy.  I am not in favour of it.With regard to President Obama enticing companies home, he could do it on a short-term basis and some of the more than $1 trillion sitting offshore could be brought home, but I do not get any sense that US multinationals will be deglobalised.  US companies operating in Europe and Ireland have been investing overseas for more than 100 years and this will not change under one Administration.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Another point on tax is that global foreign direct investment is predicted to grow by 30% in the coming 12 months and by another 11% in 2013.  Given the base of companies and investment we have, this represents significant opportunities for Ireland.  Clarity and certainty over Ireland's corporate tax rate is absolutely a factor when these global companies make decisions on where to place their investments.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The question on pricing is interesting.  Should a company manufacturing in a certain country give a discount to that country for the product being sold there?  Such an act could destabilise the entire worldwide health economic system.  I operate in the medical technology industry and many of the top medical technology companies are based in Ireland.  In terms of medical technology Ireland would be on a par with most countries in Europe, and the pricing of medical technology products would be cheaper here than in places such as Japan.  The issue of disparity in pricing in medical technology products across Europe does not exist in my experience.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The real question is if the companies were ever asked about this.  The information I am getting indicates the question was not asked, despite it being a logical way forward with regard to products.  If we consider the rest of Europe we are getting a rough deal despite products being made in Ireland.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	14	That is not my experience in the medical technology space, although I cannot speak for others.  We can consider what US multinational contribute to the economy.  They have a significant role to play in the recovery of the economy and they contribute €6 billion in total taxes and €16 billion in direct spending for the economy.  That does not include indirect spending from spin-off companies.  We have certainly made a big contribution and will have an important role to play over the next few years as we get out of this.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	15	There appears to be a growing trend of American firms relocating from Ireland to other parts of the world.  The companies involved are well established, bringing much benefit to the Irish economy, although they have also accumulated substantial grant aid in locating here.  What is the opinion of the witnesses in this regard?  It has been indicated that the view that cheap labour motivates US firms to invest overseas runs contrary to popular wisdom, although it is certainly a motive and a factor with many successful firms pulling up sticks and opting to leave Ireland.  There is also outsourcing work in India and China.  The message must go out that we should stop such relocations.  I am glad to hear that our existing rates of corporate tax are seen as favourable to the American investor.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	16	The emerging markets now account for 50% of GDP and are growing at 6%, 7% and 8% per annum.  Any successful US - or Irish - company looking to be successful in the long term must be in these emerging markets.  Typically, it starts with initial trade and later investment.  There is no doubt that US companies are eyeing these emerging markets but they are doing so sceptically, carefully and cautiously.  As long as the EU remains at least a fifth the size of the world GDP with over 500 million people, growing at 2% to 3% per year, US companies will always be here.  This is a big chunk of the global economy.  American companies entering and becoming successful in India, Poland, Turkey, the Middle East and so forth will leverage Ireland in that capacity through exports, etc.What motivates companies to invest overseas is the wealth of the consumer base and skilled labour; US companies do not chase cheap labour because there is plenty of it around.  There is much cheap labour in Pennsylvania and firms do not have to go to China for it.  The Deputy is correct about the trend but he should not think that US companies will abandon this significant platform in Ireland, which is next to one of the largest economies in the world.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	17	To add to Mr. Quinlan's comments, we can consider the investment coming to the country over a short time.  In 2010 over 11,000 new jobs were announced, with 75% of those coming from US companies.  There is no sector in the country that has announced 11,000 new jobs.  In this year to date there has been €17.7 billion of investment, which is up 49% for the first six months of this year.  These are the investment flows to Ireland.Encouragingly, approximately 65% of new investments over the past 18 months have come from the existing base of companies here.  This reiterates the retention of the companies.  The other 35% came from new companies setting up.  There was a regional spread and we have always seen movements since the beginning of investment five decades ago.  There was a Covidien announcement today but in the same week we saw Electronic Arts, Pfizer and Twitter announce new jobs.  Unfortunately, there will be shifts but our numbers indicate that positive shifts outweigh any jobs leaving the country.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Companies move products around all the time and in my own company we have moved basic manufacturing to low-cost locations, replacing it with high-end, advanced, technology-intensive manufacturing.   That is a case of companies transforming themselves, which validates the point we hear about Ireland moving up the value chain and becoming a knowledge-intensive economy.  When companies move out basic manufacturing and bring in advanced manufacturing the point is manifest.  Unfortunately, the negatives seem to outweigh positives but the trends show that the positives outweigh the negatives.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	19	In China, India and Brazil there is some hostility to foreign direct investment and there is much protectionism.  It is now harder to go to China and Brazil.  Russia is not even part of the World Trade Organisation.  Wages in India are rising 25% to 30%.  In Ireland there is a welcoming investment backdrop and the welcome mat is out; it has a AAA rating, as I call it, among multinationals.  This is the difference.  Emerging markets in many cases do not want investment and would prefer to create their own local champions.  That will not be successful in all cases.

#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The delegation is welcome.  I listened to the interview this morning on "Morning Ireland" and it is a pity the message was not being put across on NBC or other American broadcasters because it would have sold Ireland.  The rhetoric from America, particularly from some of the American individuals seeking electoral nominations for the Republican Party, has not been very helpful.  I know there has been some discussion but do the witnesses have any thoughts on this point?Currently a number of high-end multinational companies are finding it difficult to fill vacancies.  The problem is that there are not enough quality graduates coming out of our colleges.  As a consequence we find people coming in from outside Ireland, perhaps from the EU, to take up those employment opportunities.  As policymakers, what can we do for five or six years?  What kind of graduate will be required?  We are advocating the teaching of science and maths and it is a bit late to be starting with secondary schools; the teaching of these subjects is instrumental in primary schools, and the students will emerge in ten or 12 years.  What is the vision of the witnesses for ten or 15 years?  That is when those kids will emerge from education.  I would rather have a child learning maths than Irish, as maths will help generate a job for that student.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	22	We will have a presentation from the Department of Education and Skills but the Deputy has ensured a spot on the news tonight.
#MichaelConaghan	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-party	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-dob	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I welcome the delegation.  The presence of US companies in the Irish economy has brought a very welcome and strong dynamic into the country.  Hundreds of families are dependent for their livelihoods on that.  That should be pointed out.  We know political sentiment in America is changing about what some refer to as the export of jobs from America.  How does the witness evaluate or gauge that?  Is it just political rhetoric in the current pre-election campaigning period or is there a more deep seated origin for it?  Is it likely to become a political game-changer, to use an American phrase?
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Finally, I call on Deputy Tóibín.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I apologise for being late.  I had to attend a pre-arranged meeting.  One of the issues that will arise in the future is energy costs.  Some companies are citing it as more important than corporation tax issues.  How does Ireland and its competitor countries for foreign direct investment compare with the United States in terms of energy costs?  Another issue is the concept of the consolidated corporation tax that is being discussed in Europe.  How would that affect our State's competitiveness?  Third, a data protection investigation is taking place into Facebook at present.  Many social media companies are based in this country.  How could that affect the attractiveness of Ireland for social media firms in the United States who hold information belonging to participants?With regard to Deputy Lawlor's comments, what has been the witnesses' experience of working with the infrastructure in Ireland vis-à-vis identifying skills shortages and how they can be resolved?  There are a number of organisations in the State whose job is to identify potential skills shortages in the future.  Do the witnesses think that interaction has been satisfactory or could improvements be made in the system?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	26	On the question of Irish investment in the United States, to be honest I do not think the Irish American appreciates how much foreign direct investment in the United States helps to create jobs, skills, taxes and so forth.  The most robust part of the United States economy is the south east.  That is principally due to the fact that there are many foreign transplants there, such as automobile manufacturing, from Europe, Asia and so forth.  We have a thriving manufacturing base.  We make a lot of stuff and export a lot of stuff.  It is not in the common narrative of the United States.  The US, to be blunt, is having a Sputnik moment at present.  We cannot do anything right and everybody is beating us up saying we cannot grow again.  We will get over that, but in the meantime the facts and the figures tell a totally different story.The story of Ireland's presence in the US is an untold story that needs to get out among the public.  There is also the story of how much foreign direct investment there is in our economy.  The United States, not China, is the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world.  In the first decade of this century for every $1 China received in foreign direct investment, America got $3.  It helps drive our growth.On the question about anti-export sentiment or anti-globalisation sentiment, in corporate America, and particularly the companies operating in Ireland, there is none of that.  It is the opposite.  There is a mood in America that we will grow at a slower rate and that we must deleverage and pay our bills.  The housing market is three or four years away from correcting itself.  It is a slow growth market which means that corporations must be overseas leveraging any and every asset they can to grow in this bigger global economic pie.  There is an election coming up and an unemployment rate of 9% so there will be debates and sentiment opposing big business offshoring operations, but we have been there before.  It will not change the minds of US corporations.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Deputy Lawlor asked a good question about education.  Companies talk about globalisation.  Certainly, 120,000 jobs in Irish companies in the US are important, but one cannot talk global and not act global.  Pulling everything back home is not acting global.  Companies like to be close to their big customer bases.  We are in Europe, which has a 500 million person customer base.The question about education is very appropriate.  We have seen that for some skills, such as particular types of engineering, ICT, software and some technical skills, our member companies in the past year have found it harder, although not impossible, to fill some positions.  It is taking them longer to do so.  The Deputy asked where we will be in ten or 15 years.  One of the downsides of the boom years - I hate the term "Celtic tiger" - is that children tended to move away from science and technology subjects.  Unquestionably, we are suffering for that now.  What has happened in the last couple of years has caused people to sit up and take notice.  They are wondering what they must do so they will be able to get a job.  When I was coming to the end of my second level education the country was also in a recession and the question in my mind was what I could do that would get me a job.  In fact, the recent trend is that more second level students are turning to science and technology subjects.  That is a good trend.  We will not see the output tomorrow but in four to six years.Our track record in mathematics is not good, as was borne out in the recent leaving certificate results.  There is a concern in that regard.  I do not have the answer on what we must do with our education system.  Somebody asked me yesterday if more money should be spent on it.  The answer is "No".  We must look at what we are spending already and assess whether it is fit for purpose, efficient, whether we are getting quality and if there is quality in the system.  In addition, at present our education system is more like a memory test - how much can one store and download on the day, week or fortnight of the examination.  We must get away from that and develop students' thinking, cognitive, problem solving and creativity skills.  We need to get there fast because time is not on our side.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Deputy Lawlor mentioned foreign nationals coming to this country.  That has been a phenomenon over the last number of years, and a positive one for multinationals.  Where they could not fill the jobs locally there has been very highly skilled labour coming here, particularly from the accession countries in Europe, and helping to fill those jobs.  The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland conducted its annual jobs activation survey at the beginning of July.  The good news on that day was that there were approximately 2,000 jobs open for applicants.  The warning sign was that approximately 35% of those jobs were taking longer than three or four months to fill, which indicates that there was a problem with skills.  There is another positive indicator, and I always like to finish on a positive note.  At the end of June a survey was conducted of the chief executive officers of the existing multinational base.  Over 72% of those multinationals said they would either maintain or grow their investments in Ireland over the next couple of years.  That certainly sums up the positive mood of multinationals in this country, albeit that there are some issues around skills.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The word we are getting from our CEO fora is that energy costs is a concern.  As for what we do about that, some people say that major industrial sites or facilities should generate their own power and come off the energy grid.  I do not know if that is the solution, but rising energy costs are increasing our cost base here so it is a concern.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	31	How do we compare with the United States and with competitor countries who are vying with us for foreign direct investment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	32	It is hard to say.  When one goes to China or India the state has so much money it subsidises energy costs.  One really does not know what the true cost is.  In fact, that is one reason there is over-consumption.  I mentioned in the report that the emerging markets are now setting energy prices.  They are net energy takers, so there has been a role reversal.  My opinion is that on a secular long-term basis, be it in Ireland or the United States, we are facing energy prices at much higher levels than we thought just ten years ago, whether it is the cost of oil or food stocks.  There is a secular long-term trend upwards because we are bringing in new consumers.  They are driving more vehicles, living in air conditioned apartments and working in air conditioned offices.  In the United States the energy costs have bumped up a little.  We have plenty of coal so the utilities have not been tremendously expensive.  However, for the west in general, the US and Europe, our energy, food and staple costs will rise, not decrease.  Hence, we will have increased productivity and it will be carried out in an environmentally friendly and smart way.  There are opportunities there but that is probably for the future.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	34	The position of the American chamber is that this would be the introduction of tax harmonisation by the back door.  That is our firm position on that.  I said before the Deputy arrived that one of the key factors is to have certainty and clarity in our tax system.  An unfortunate consequence of the ongoing discussion on having a common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, which will continue during the next months and years, is that it feeds the greyness and uncertainty about investing in Europe.  That is a big negative about it.  Corporations in the United States understand the position here, they listen to the Government's position and know about the discussions on this concept taking place in Europe.  If a business person in the United States is deciding to invest €500 million or a few €100 million here, in Europe, Asia or Singapore, when there is uncertainty or greyness in the mix that is a factor.  From Europe's point of view, when Ireland wins an investment, Europe wins investment.  Generally, we are not competing for that investment within Europe; we are competing with Singapore, Switzerland or with what is happening in the United States.  The big danger or red flag around the discussions on having a CCCTB is the uncertainty it is creating and will continue to create for future investment decisions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	35	As I understand it, the intent of having a CCCTB was to reduce the cost of compliance operating across the EU.  I read some research recently that suggested that rather than reducing it, it will increase compliance costs by 13%.  That would defeat the objective.  There is some way yet to go in this respect.

We have talked in recent months about how the emerging Chinese middle class is a potential gold mine for our domestic exports.  I understand that only 6% of our exports go to the BRIC economies.  Will Mr. Quinlan expand on his opinion that these economies might be more closed than we had imagined?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	37	That is unequivocal, in the sense that China, in particular, welcomed foreign direct investment early on and such investment helped drive its exports and growth.  China is focused on creating indigenous national champions across various sectors, be it the pharmaceutical, automobile or technology sector.  It favours its cash state-owned enterprises or semi-state owned enterprises at the expense of US and European companies.  The European chamber has been very vocal about the unlevel playing field in China.  The Chinese do not care now.  In the past they needed foreign direct investment but now they are confident they can go down the clean energy route by themselves.  I think they are wrong about that but that is a big issue.India has never been comfortable welcoming foreign direct investment .  There has been some outsourcing in terms of financial services but there is not a great deal of manufacturing industry in India, with perhaps the exception of pharmaceuticals.  Brazil has become much more protectionist.  It has just imposed, I believe, a 50% tariff on foreign made automobiles.  It has been active protecting its currency from appreciating too much as that would undermine its competitiveness.  As I said, Russia is a one trick pony.  It is not even part of the WTO, which tells us that it believes its playing field is the one it has and that is it.  Admittedly, there are investment opportunities in these markets.  Companies must have a presence there.  Irish companies need to be in these markets and to have a presence in them but that is not an easy as it was previously.

I also welcome Mr. Pat Nolan, principal officer, science and technology policy unit; Mr. Eamon McHale, principal officer, local enterprise section; Mr. Gary Dixon, assistant principal officer, industrial relations unit; and all the officials of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I also welcome Mr. Cathal Fitzgerald who is here in the place of Marie Bourke, department manager, educational and skills and labour market policy unit of Forfás.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.I ask Mr. McCarthy to begin his briefing on proposals to ensure there is a better skills match between industry needs and third level graduates and to develop enterprise education in Irish secondary schools and business innovation in third level institutions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I thank the Chairman for the invitation to address the committee.  There is one change in our delegation.  Mr. Thómas Sheahan is here in place of Mr. Eamonn McHale from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.My opening remarks are made on behalf of both Departments.  While the two Departments have distinct policy responsibilities we have a common purpose in supporting enterprise needs, competitiveness and economic growth.  Clearly, close engagement and collaboration between the Departments or agencies in the respective sectors is essential in aligning education provision with current and emerging skills and innovation requirements in the enterprise sector.Members will have before them the detailed submission we forwarded, which outlines important elements of the national policy framework that underpins this area.  It also describes a number of cross-cutting policy structures and arrangements for formal engagement that are in place between the Departments of Education and Skills and Jobs Enterprise and Innovation.  Those formal structures include national councils, implementation groups and senior official groups, as listed on page four of the submission document.  The enterprise sector is also represented on the statutory agencies responsible for curriculum reform and assessment, quality assurance and policy advice across the education system and on the boards of VECs, higher education institutions and FÁS.  Direct advice from industry also informs the development of education policy on an ongoing basis.  I might add that a new education enterprise forum, a dedicated forum, is now being established which will be chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.  Its first meeting will take on 10 October and the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, delegates of which appeared before the committee prior to us, will part of that forum, as will other industry representatives.With regard to skills supply, the expert group on future skills needs plays a key role in analysing and advising on the future skills requirements of enterprise.  The group is mandated by the two Ministers to identify and project skills needs, encompassing both sector specific skills and more generic skills requirements.  The development of appropriate skills for the workplace has implications for curricula, programme design and teaching methodologies at all levels of the education system.  The detailed submission outlines curricula reforms under way based on the advice of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  The council draws directly on enterprise inputs in its work.  Curriculum development at primary and second level seeks to embed core skills in all subject areas.  The key skills identified are information processing, communicating, critical and creative thinking, working with others and being personally effective.At second level, the NCCA is currently finalising advice to the Minister on proposals for significant junior cycle reform.  One of the most important recent curricular reform initiatives was in mathematics, which is a critical skills area for the enterprise sector.  Project maths is being implemented in junior cycle and senior cycle simultaneously and an implementation support group provides a partnership between industry, higher education and second level education to support the objectives of project maths.In addition to these broader reforms, there is growing provision for specific enterprise development education and work experience in schools, particularly in transition year.  The enterprise development agencies and business organisations promote and foster links between schools and the enterprise sector through programmes such as the student enterprise awards, junior achievement, youth enterprise Ireland or young entrepreneur.  These and other mechanisms are aimed at promoting and rewarding entrepreneurship education in schools.Curricular reform is also ongoing in higher education.  As a matter of policy, institutions adapt existing programmes and develop new programmes on an ongoing basis in response to wider needs and demands.  Enterprise advice on course content is sought at institutional level.  Engagement with enterprise is endorsed as a core pillar of the higher education mission in the national strategy for higher education to 2030 published earlier this year.  Enterprise engagement takes a range of forms at sectoral, institutional and individual academic levels.  Some specific enterprise engagement initiatives are cited in the detailed submissions as examples of good practice.One of the challenges described in the national strategy is to mainstream this best practice activity across the board.  The strategy describes a detailed framework and range of recommendations to do this, including structured employer surveys and interaction, increased work placement opportunities, staff mobility into enterprise and a renewed focus on relevant generic skills.  It is important to emphasise that meeting the skills requirements of industry is compatible with broader educational objectives for individual development.  In the dynamic world of work, employers prize core qualities that are generic in nature.  They want adaptable, well rounded, creative individuals, strong skills in literacy, numeracy and technology use as well as communication and interpersonal skills and higher order conceptual skills in problem solving, critical analysis and innovation.  An emphasis on core skills and broader disciplinary foundations is increasingly valued over excessive specialisation.An IBEC survey published last year showed that 75% of employers were satisfied with the calibre of graduates from Irish higher education institutions.  In a recent international survey for European finance Ministers, Ireland ranked 1st for the employability of its graduates.  However, there are important deficits.  The IBEC survey pointed to specific difficulties employers had recruiting graduates from engineering and technology disciplines.  Given the importance of technology-based sectors for employment, addressing this is a major priority.  There have been a number of collaborative strategic responses aimed at addressing this graduate deficit, a number of specific initiatives, including CAO bonus points and ongoing activities under the discover science and engineering awareness programme.  Other outreach and awareness programmes are described in the detailed submission.I referred to related curriculum developments, including project maths.  More recently, joint work has been undertaken to address specific skills deficits in the ICT sector.  An ICT action plan is under development with strong enterprise input.  This aims to boost the supply of ICT skills in the short term through an increase in conversion and up-skilling opportunities as well as measures to enhance the longer term supply of graduates in the field.Providing up-skilling opportunities to equip people for a return to work is an urgent short-term priority.  Springboard, launched as part of the Government's jobs initiative in May, funds part-time higher education and training opportunities for the unemployed and strategically targets funding towards flexible provision in areas where there are identified labour market skills shortages or growth opportunities, including ICT.  Enhancing the flexibility of access to higher education for those in employment is also important in improving skills potential and productivity.  Reform of funding mechanisms in higher education and the development of consistent recognition of prior learning systems will support this.More widely, the higher education sector has a central role in generating the knowledge, creativity and innovation necessary to support new enterprise opportunities and contribute to economic recovery.  Supporting an environment where business innovation can flourish requires a sustained focus on company capabilities in research, innovation and technology and on linking enterprise with research institutions to deliver innovative, market-led products.  The skills and innovation needs of business are supported in higher education through new strategic alliances to have the enhancement of enterprise development as a key objective, by entrepreneurship and business support programmes, by the direct sponsorship of PhD students and by the involvement of employers in development structured doctoral programmes.A number of strategic programmes are run by Enterprise Ireland in the higher education system with a view to commercialising research and development, exploiting market opportunities, supporting business incubation and driving innovation.  More detail on all these elements is provided in the full submission.  We must update two figures in that document.  On page 11, a reference is made to the number of exam sits in the LCVP linked module.  The figure of 14,500 should be updated to 16,386.  On page 12, a reference is made to the number of business sits in the leaving certificate.  The latest figure is 18,038.  My colleagues and I will be happy to take questions.

#AverilPower	unknown-#AverilPower-party	unknown-#AverilPower-dob	unknown-#AverilPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I thank the officials for their opening presentation.  It is good to have officials from two different Departments present.  The submission is valuable, as it gives a good summary of the range of initiatives under way.  I will comment on them before seeking more detail.  The submission refers to work experience in transition year.  I hope when the junior and senior cycles are reformed, it will be ensured all students get work experience and not only those in transition year.  I acknowledge the transition year itself is being examined in the context of whether it should be broken up into units to be provided during each year in second level or whether it should continue in its current form.  It is vital that every student has access to work experience.All third level courses should have enterprise and entrepreneurship content, regardless of whether one is studying business, medicine, business or law.  There should be an emphasis on entrepreneurial skills because regardless of their profession, people need to have an understanding of the business environment.  For example, basic business skills will help a doctor running his own practice to be more successful.  It is also key at third level that every student should have a work placement as part of his or her course.  Some institutions are excellent and provide a good practical component to courses but others provide nothing.  A number of students achieve first class honours in every academic module but they have no experience of the practical side of the career they want to take up.  That highlights a significant gap in the current system.I agree with the aspiration in the submission to place a greater emphasis on generic skills such as literacy, numeracy, IT, communications, problem solving and so on.  I can see how the Department has a direct influence on the school curriculum and, in reforming the senior cycle and addressing the issues I have raised, there are opportunities to make sure key skills are embedded and students are given practical experience.  The national strategy for higher education is a good overall framework but I would like to hear more about how change will be implemented at that level because the Department is more distant when it comes to implementation.  There are examples in the presentation of really good practice that is under way in some institutions and the strategic innovation fund has incentivised many good initiatives, but there are other areas where it has not changed.  How can we have a more systematic change instead of incentivising some institutions to come up with good practice?  How can we ensure the changes take place across the board?  What is the Department's strategy for monitoring change at third level, incentivising it in a broader way than just the strategic innovation fund?  Perhaps there could be core funding so the changes set out in the submission could be implemented on the ground.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	44	There are some good initiatives for teaching and learning development at third level.  One of the challenges that has been identified is systemising it in a context where there is a respect, enshrined in legislation, for academic autonomy.  Individual universities and their academic councils have responsibility for academic affairs.The innovation task force report, which predated the higher education strategy, made a number of similar recommendations for programme content and opportunities for workplace learning as part of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and for the wider availability of entrepreneurship modules across the board.  On the implementation of some of the recommendations, there are system structures in place to promote and monitor progress with wider dissemination.The Higher Education Authority is about to embark on a consultation process on the development of a national platform for teaching and learning, which would be aimed at trying to generalise best practice in teaching and learning developments that in some cases has been fostered by the strategic innovation fund and to disseminate that best practice.  That initiative is under way, in partnership with the universities and other institutes of higher education, to share learning in terms of best practice in teaching and learning innovations, including the wider availability of modules and options such as entrepreneurship content but more particularly around the fostering of core generic skills as part of all programmes.There is another specific recommendation in the innovation task force report on work placements.  It is interesting to look at some of the monitoring reports on progress in the implementation of those recommendations.  Currently, 25% of all higher education courses, according to a study by Cork Institute of Technology across 23 institutions, have a work placement period as part of the undergraduate programme.  That excludes clinical courses that include work placements as the norm.  Around 10,500 students in higher education are completing a work placement period as part of the undergraduate programme.  That might be higher than had been thought to be the case but there is an opportunity to do more in this area, notwithstanding the practical considerations surrounding the availability of work placements in the current job market.  It is, however, an area where we want to go further.An oversight group monitors the delivery of various strands and recommendations in the higher education strategy, including the embedding of core skills in all undergraduate programmes.  There have been specific recommendations on a reorientation of the first year experience of higher education to give a more general experience, where people are exposed to the core skills they will need in the workplace, including entrepreneurial skills.  Responsibility for delivering that rests with the universities and institutions but the structure is in place to monitor what is happening.Funding mechanisms are important when it comes to academic autonomy and the levers a Department has to make progress in these areas.  There is a clear need to further enhance the performance elements of funding in higher education.  The strategy includes a strategic dialogue process, a new mechanism to broker the relationship between the State and independent higher education institutions, where the State effectively, through the HEA, sets out its policy objectives and what it wants to see delivered from a higher education system.  Through a process of strategic dialogue, as described in the strategy, it extracts performance and holds the system to account for performance against that benchmark and links funding to delivery on that performance.  It becomes a question of the type of performance measures built into that process.  If, as a State, we see opportunities for work placements, service learning, a broader based first year experience or specific learning outcomes as part of undergraduate programmes on a standard basis, those are the sort of objectives that can be articulated as part of the strategic dialogue process.  That is part of the challenge that lies ahead in terms of implementing the overall strategy.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	45	There is work experience in transition year for about 50% of the cohort; each one of those students does a work experience placement.  About 5% of the leaving certificate applied course have a placement and in the leaving certificate vocational programme, about 30% of the cohort undergo work experience, with an overlap between the two.  Those are not, however, the only places where innovation and enterprise skills are promoted.  We have that in the business syllabus and programmes like the young social innovators and civic, social and political education, where students must identify a theme, research it, engage in an action project and campaign for change.  There is community awareness and interaction while key skills such as planning and the bringing of an initiative through to fruition are developed.  That is what the EU defines as enterprise when it talks about eight key competences for second level pupils.  We are developing those skills across a system.The major focus of reform now will be the junior cycle.  While developing key skills and promoting creativity and enterprise, I doubt it will be in the form of a work placement because the children are too young and there are supervision issues.  We are trying to enrich the curriculum by encouraging schools to bring learning outside the classroom, involve the community and promote good business links.  There are initiatives, particularly in disadvantaged schools, to provide that.Second level does not have a "one size fits all" approach.  It is important to have programme and subject choice if we are to encourage more children to stay in school until the completion of senior cycle.  While promoting enterprise and generic skills that are critical to employment, we are not yet at a stage where we will have a work experience placement for all students as part of second level.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	46	It strikes me that there is quite a large infrastructure measuring skill needs and developing curricula for the future but on a simple basis some innovation could be useful.  LinkedIn, for example, is a useful social media which connects employers with potential employees.  If the State could develop a social media like that it could, first, quickly link employees with employers who are in need of each other and, second, employers could quickly identify the skills needed.  Such a database would catch the skills need within industry and would also ensure that situations do not arise where there are skills in certain sectors but those skills were not being matched to skills needs in others.It is important in these areas to make sure there are industry representatives on many of these infrastructures that measure skills needs.  An organisation I and some of my colleagues have met is JobFit, which identifies the needs of industry and is led by industry.  It is an organisation of social activists working for long-term unemployed people to bring them up to the necessary skill levels to allow them be employed by multinational companies.Reference was made to JobBridge.  I was struck by the fact that 1,400 positions are being created on JobBridge.  That is not nearly enough.  There are 1,600 people either signing on or emigrating every week in the State.  To date, JobBridge has a total of 1,400 places.  I would encourage the Department to consider that much more energy must go into the immediate crisis that exists.It is good for all of us to be able to see the objectives inherent in many of the different organisations but what would be more beneficial would be for us to see the key performance indicators of all the organisations listed, including the innovation task force, the implementation group, the senior official group and the National Economic and Social Council, to determine the expected outputs of those organisations every month.  That would allow us as a group to measure not just the objectives and the strategy, but the actual outputs and to determine if they are being implemented as the objectives indicators.  If there is a list of the different groups we might be given for the next committee meeting the key performance indicators for each of those groups.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	48	On the first suggestion about using social media, there are opportunities for all public organisations to make better use of social media.  What the Deputy described sounds more like an agency type service in terms of matching vacancies to individuals, which is more akin to a job placement type service.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	49	It would also measure needs because employers would be able to input their skill needs onto it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	50	The approach of the expert group on future skills needs, and others may want to comment on that, in identifying skills requirements would be to examine on a macro level across the economy the immediate shortages or shortfalls in terms of skills provision, and the projected shortfalls, taking account of what is in the pipeline in terms of people in higher education and so on.  It would examine that both on a macro basis involving colleagues in the skills and labour market research unit in FÁS but also in terms of needs that are unique to particular sectors.We would be satisfied that the mechanisms are in place in terms of doing the analysis.  The analysis is not at issue in that we have a fairly good handle on it and there would be a strong involvement of enterprise in the analysis conducted by the expert group on future skills needs in terms of identifying the labour market shortages and labour market skills needs arising from that.  The more intractable issue for an education system is meeting those shortfalls, given the inevitable time lag between the time somebody decides to pursue a particular course of study to when they qualify.  The education system and education outputs, to use that awful phrase, do not tend to respond to needs in real time.  What we have seen in the IT sector, for example, is a good example of that where there has been a significant pick-up in the past two or three years in terms of the uptake of ICT programmes in higher education of the order of 30% in the past two or three years.  What we are dealing with, however, is significant shortages that arise from a collapse in confidence in that sector after the dotcom collapse in the earlier part of the past decade, and this was alluded to in the earlier presentation from the American chambers, in that during the good years students were not going into these technology areas.  It is starting to turn back now but it is not turning quickly enough in terms of providing the supply of skilled people that are needed for industry.Regarding key performance indicators of those various groups, the groups described in the submission take a number of forms.  Some of them are policy groups which are effectively an interaction between people at official level, people in the enterprise sector and other interested parties.  In terms of dealing with policy objectives, they would be clearly set out either in a programme for Government or in strategy statements of Departments.  They are actually policy supports.  They are a support and the responsibility for delivery ultimately rests with the responsible Department.Key performance indicators would be established for individual Departments.  There are targets established in, for example, a programme for Government or in individual strategies.  There is probably a mix in terms of a response to the specific question the Deputy asked on identifying the key performance indicators for these various groups because it depends to an extent on the nature and the roll of the group and whether it is a group responsible for delivering on something or one that is a support to a responsible actor in the form of a Department or agency.  I will ask my colleague, Anne Forde, to come in on some of the other points.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	51	To add to what Mr. McCarthy stated, the expert group on future skills needs is a key part in the interaction between the enterprise sector and the education and training sector.  It is representative of the enterprise sector as well as the education and training sector.  Each year it publishes a statement of activity.  It regularly undertakes research into individual sectors of the economy to identify precisely the skills shortages and the skills gaps and it matches those against the outputs through research undertaken on an ongoing basis by the skills and labour market research unit of FÁS, which also provides the secretariat to the expert group on future skills needs.  There are regular publications each year monitoring Ireland's skills supply including the national skills bulletin and a report on vacancies that exist across the economy.  All of those pieces of research are then transmitted into the further education system in FÁS and they then help inform the ongoing development of provision by individual institution and colleges.

#MichaelConaghan	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-party	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-dob	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I welcome the delegation.  Economies always need skills but it is important to bear in mind that economies can change very quickly and, consequently, skills sets can become redundant very quickly.  Since many of the officials are from the Department of Education and Skills, it is important that we distinguish between education and training in terms of the generation of skills and how quickly skills can become redundant because education is quite distinctive in comparison to training.  To get that balance we could easily skew the education system to become subservient to the economy.  It is about getting that balance and it struck me while listening to Mr. McCarthy that the needs of the economy must almost permeate down to the kindergarten.  Education is a distinctive human encounter whereas training is not.May I talk about a human disposition which is transferable, that is, creativity?  In the primary school curriculum, for example, the key encounters whereby children discover, enjoy and find the measure of their creativity, as well as competence in using it, are the visual arts, dance, drama, mime and so on.  Those are the wellsprings of creativity, but in many working class areas they are hardly taught at all.  Of course we must embrace skills, but there are other things that we can and should embrace fully, without mitigating the importance of the development of skills.

I am new to this game so my questions may sound Noddyish.  I would like to speak a little about what Deputy Michael Conaghan said.  He is absolutely correct.I have three questions.  While I might be young at this game, I taught for ten years in Carysfort College and for 22 years in Dublin City University.  I have had considerable experience and I consider the Department of Education and Skills to be the heartbeat of who we are.  It is the most important Department.  First, has any individual or committee thought about how we get rid of bad teachers?  What do we do about dispassionate, disinterested and inept teaching?  I have seen that in my 32 years.  We always blame the subjects.  However, much of the time the problem is not the subject but the actual person who is handling the subject and is incapable of bringing it to life.

I may not fully understand the committee's terms of reference and the ramifications of that.Second, how much money has been put into research, how much research has been done and how does that research manifest itself in jobs?  Third, has any thought been put into the kinds of knowledge being brought about in classrooms?  What the Department's officials argue for, on the grounds of the need to develop interpersonal communication skills, team-working and consumer awareness, is very important.  There are, however, other important subjects, such as the arts.  We may not be creating disciplines within first, second and third level education that will bring about knowledge of the arts, society, politics, orality and media.  I mention media because we are so defined by them.  The subjects that are coming up, and rightly so, are highly technical.  I am thinking of Project Maths and one or two others.  I am not convinced they are necessarily the subjects that will create and manifest the very things we are looking for, which are creativity, interpersonal skills, management of self and all the things we want people to have in order to live in society.I apologise for the first question,  but it is one that needs to be asked in relation to our blaming disciplines while not looking at how they are being imparted.  It is common knowledge that mathematics was taught by people who were not trained to do so.

It is relevant.  There are people who are teaching our children in a manner that will prevent them finding employment when they leave school as a result of bad educators.  Something must be done about it.  I am sure Mr. Kevin McCarthy is a senior official in the Department of Education and Skills.  I think he could make a comment on this question.I repeat the question I put to the American delegation earlier.  I recently read an article which claimed we are training people for jobs that do not exist.  Many of the students who, five years ago, went into engineering, architecture and law now find there are no jobs available in those areas.  I suffered this difficulty.  Having studied agriculture in the mid-1970s, I could not find a job when I qualified in 1981.  Are we planning for the jobs that will be available?  Jobs are the issue, whether on the cultural side of things or in high-end technical employment.  Are we planning and educating people for the jobs that will be available in five, ten or 15 years time?
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Officials are not in a position to comment on Government policy.  I invite Mr. McCarthy to comment on the contributions that have been made.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Some very interesting questions have been put and comments made.  Deputy Conaghan made a general point as to whether we are talking about education or training, and the need to distinguish between the two in giving people the appropriate skill set to manage in the rapidly changing external environment in which they will live and work.  I agree with Deputy Conaghan.  Perhaps we did not get this point across sufficiently well.  The major emphasis, which underpins curriculum change at all levels of the education system, is on embedding the core skills that people need for living, learning, operating and functioning as citizens in a changing world environment.  Those core skills are capacity to think independently and creatively and to work, communicate and interact with others.  Those are skills for life, which employers are telling us are also the kinds of skills needed in employment.  There is a recognition that the education system cannot be expected to produce the finished article, in terms of employment-specific knowledge.  That is not what employers want.  They want people who are well-rounded, able to adapt, flexible, able to take on new learning and operate in a changing environment.  During their careers employees will operate in numerous jobs in different contexts.  The core skills I mentioned are the ones our education system has a responsibility to impart to students.  I do not see the two as inconsistent.  Meeting the needs of employers is consistent with providing a good rounded education.  This is true of the work the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is doing at primary and second level.  The work that is going on in higher education, where there is now an emphasis on giving a broader based experience, a broader disciplinary knowledge and a more generic first year experience where people have exposure and the opportunity to develop more generic skills, is also perfectly consistent with what the Deputy is saying.I hope people will have increasing opportunities to up-skill and re-skill, do short programmes and continually educate and train themselves throughout their working lives and acquire the skills needed to do a particular job at a point in time.  If we can give people the foundation of a broad-based education with those broad-based skills we will put them in a much better position to operate in a very different employment environment in their future careers.  Students who are graduating now will probably retire some time around 2070.  None of us can envisage what the world of work will be like then.  We must impart those basic core skills.I will not get into the specifics of how we get rid of bad teachers.  It is acknowledged that teaching quality is probably the most fundamental factor in terms of quality of education outcomes from the system.  The literacy and numeracy strategy recently launched by the Minister provides for some particular changes, including in the area of teacher education, extension of the B Ed programme from three to four years, extension of the H Dip programme to two years and an emphasis on continuous professional development for teachers, which I believe are a reflection of the fact that educational outcomes will not be improved unless there is in the classroom the quality of teacher who is equipped to impart the basic skills which people need.  There is a huge emphasis on teaching quality in all of our strategies for change.  Continuous professional development is intrinsic to the roll-out of curriculum change at primary and second level.  My colleague, Ms Kelly, may wish to say more on that issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Ridding the system of bad teachers is not my area of responsibility either.  However, I am aware that the Department has agreed a strategy with management and the unions to deal with ineffective teachers.  The employer is the school board of management and ultimately if a process must be put in train this responsibility rests initially with the employer.  We have invested in increased inspection.  Currently, all inspection reports are published and are available on our website, which brings a strong critical community element to the work of a school and how it is responding to local needs in its area.  This is followed up by a unit within the Department.  There is investment in sustained professional development for those people and schemes are in place to ease and encourage people out of the profession.  Primarily, this is a matter for individual schools and teachers.  While we do have a strategy it is ultimately the responsibility of local schools to progress this in the first instance.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	65	Senator O'Donnell's question in regard to the return on the investment is important in particular in current economic circumstances.  No one can show direct causation but everyone can show huge instances of correlation.  In this regard, we are speaking about the excellence produced by the investment.  Research is a real draw for foreign direct investment, FDI.  The proportion of the FDI investments are categorised every year by the IDA in terms of whether they are research or product driven, the business expenditure on research and development, BERD, figure, which has increased immensely, and other tangible things such as the fact that exports from research intensive industry are much better and are increasing more substantially than in other areas.  There is a whole lot of correlative evidence available, which is not anecdotal to Ireland but is global.  It is what is used in lieu of proving a direct causative effect.  The most economically dynamic countries in the world, including Singapore, Korea and Finland, are investing substantially in research.  Approximately 4% of their GDP is invested in research.

Investment is very definitely not only in the area of what one terms to be hard sciences, but does comprehend significant degrees of humanities.Deputy Tóibín asked a question about indicators.  We will shortly be producing a consolidated report on research indicators across whole spend in the country.  That report, which is nearing completion, will include the internationally comparable details used to compare our investment with that of other countries and also some indicators which are domestically important in terms of investment on return.  We aim to publish that report in approximately a month's time.

#JohnLyonsLab	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-party	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-dob	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I understand the point made.  I am seeking a comment rather than definitive response to my question.  The expert group on future skills has been established.  What future skills do we need?  Is there a litany of skills that we do not already have within the various aspects of our teaching and learning programmes?  The joint reports listed by both Departments today have not identified any such skills in terms of outcomes from the primary school curriculum, which was revised in 1999, and secondary school syllabi, even those which are outdated.  Not one additional skill that is not already part of the existing curriculum at primary or secondary level has been identified.  Perhaps the officials would identify these additional skills.What is important is not developing skills or the sentiments of laying out what the curriculum should achieve, rather it is the method of how this is achieved that is important.  As recently seen in the media, the enthusiastic teacher is each time subject to the assessment process.  They are changing.  Ultimately, we must ensure that the majority of people involved in instilling educational skills in our young people and university goers are motivated to take on, as part of their careers, active learning methodologies and to rid themselves of their didactic approach of talk talk, namely, what I hear I forget and what I do I understand, and so on.  We can have all the expert groups and fancy technology we want telling us of all the skills we need but what is important is the person who makes contact with the people whom we want to have these outcomes so that we have a better workforce and so on.Just as there may be people who need to rethink their careers within the educational field, there are similar people in all walks of life.  People in the private or public sector are often inept in what they do.  I believe all of what is needed already exists and that it is in the delivery process that the link in the chain is broken.  It is almost like people believe we are going to come up with a new chemical element that has been missing in the atmosphere and that this will make things different.  It is simply a matter of good old fashioned methods being used properly.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I welcome the officials.  I believe the document is useful in that it gives us a shape of the direction in which the Department is going.  While words such as "flexible" and "adaptable" are used in the document part of the problem down through the years has been that the system has not been flexible or adaptable.  The terms "graduation" and "internship" are used with this mantra of 12 weeks.  I do not know from which hat that was pulled.  One of the difficulties is how we keep graduates in Ireland.  If a course is offered when they leave education, there may be more of a chance of them staying here.  The system does not show much flexibility in this regard, yet there are many areas in which we do well.  For example, the Connect programme is a digital resource education partnership between South Dublin County Council and some schools in Tallaght.  It has been successful but has not been replicated across the education system.  The overall education system does not seem to be able to adapt to these developments.In the past two years, the expert group completed an analysis of future skills requirements in key export sectors in the economy, such as the green and biopharma-chemical sectors.  The Springboard initiative aims to create 6,000 jobs.  Will these be linked directly to the sectors in question?  Is the system capable of changing priorities if needed?The point about apprentices finishing their training was raised.  There are difficulties for those in their third year of an apprenticeship in the construction industry to get a placement.  As part of their apprenticeship, they get paid and will not get social welfare support.Changes to the curriculum of the leaving certificate have been proposed.  However, the job for co-ordinator of the leaving certificate applied was not filled.  There are proposals to make the junior certificate more flexible but they seem to be dumbing it down.  Concerns have been raised about the dropping of subjects such as history and geography.  Geography is, however, a science subject.  On the one hand, we are talking about the importance of science subjects while removing it from the junior certificate.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Nothing will have a larger impact in a classroom than an excellent teacher.  Giving a teacher the opportunity to acquire such skill sets is difficult.  There is a heavy emphasis on teaching maths, science and technology subjects.  A Teaching Council report on one primary school training college, however, noted the time allocated for religion in the college was four times that for science.  Is the delegation concerned about this finding?  Have the teacher training colleges adequate resources to impart balanced skill sets to teachers?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Picking up on Deputy Lyons's point and the reference to the expert group on future skills needs, and also Deputy Crowe's point about apprenticeships, we are trying to reflect what is happening across the entire education system from primary to third level.  It would be unfortunate if the impression were created that the role of the expert group on future skills needs is to inform the primary and second level curricula.  It is not.  The core skills have been identified.The economy is changing constantly.  When the group was established in the 1990s, it was during the first wave of foreign direct investment into Ireland.  New jobs were being created that had never been created before.  The group's function was to identify what jobs were being created and their skill sets.  To some degree, we are almost back in that situation now.  Up to 300,000 people have lost their jobs.  For many of them, they will not get another job doing what they did before the recession.  The focus of the expert group is to provide opportunities for these people to re-skill.  Apprentices and craftspeople in the construction industry would be a prime example.  People must change their careers and go into a completely different job area.  The value of the research from the expert group is that we are able to identify more precisely where the new jobs will emerge such as in the green economy.  This helps inform provision in the further education system and allow people to respond to those up-skilling needs.The new Springboard initiative is an example of this.  We identified the types of jobs coming up in the biopharma-chemical, ICT, green and food sectors.  The new up-skilling courses were based on this research.  We do not want people re-skilling in an area in which there may not be a job at the end.  While we cannot guarantee there will be a job at the end of the initiative, the research allows us to enhance the prospects of allowing someone to re-orientate their career.FÁS has put in place several initiatives to assist people who lose their jobs before they get their apprenticeship.  Likewise, the institutes of technology, working with FÁS, have devised several new programmes to allow a person without a full apprenticeship to continue to get a level 6 qualification in a related subject, say entrepreneurship.  This would provide them with a passport if they want to go on to further education or, if the chance arises, to complete their apprenticeship later.  The objective is to ensure they have not lost the investment put into their education to date.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The difficulty is getting back into that education stream.  There are more obstacles than help in that route from apprenticeship to further education.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Programmes are in place.  I can forward further information on what is available for redundant apprentices and craftspeople to the committee.
#MarieLouiseODonnell	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-party	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-dob	unknown-#MarieLouiseODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I do not know which area Deputy Crowe was referring to, but there are significant access programmes within third level in cases such as this.My question on interpersonal skills, creativity, interesting thinking and imaginative ways of living was not answered.  Project Maths is not outside the core of RSE literacy, what we used to call the three Rs years ago.  They are fundamental to life.  Will anyone or any group examine the kinds of knowledge?  In universities, the kinds of knowledge were considered to be what should be imparted to young minds.  Has this approach changed in any way?  I understand Project Maths and the practicalities developed, but I wonder whether team work and interpersonal, communication and service skills are the right subjects to be teaching.  Should we be creating other kinds of knowledge and disciplines outside the core disciplines?  This is sometimes done in the primary school curriculum, but it is left behind in second level.  This approach lacks excitement.  Perhaps we should throw in a ball and create one or two subjects on the second level curriculum that might engender excitement.  The arts are a major subject, but I also have in mind food, society, politics, media, the way we work, who we are and psychology.Our current approach contains nothing new.  Where is the excitement?  Is another committee investigating appropriate kinds of knowledge to follow on from the three Rs?  I am not suggesting that we throw babies and baths out with the bath water.  That would be madness.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Regarding creativity and the changing world, it is not about necessary new skills not being taught, but about the ability to apply skills in changing contexts.  Project Maths teaches problem solving that can be applied in various contexts rather than to formulae alone.  This is one example of an area in which we are trying to encourage creativity.  Another is languages, as these subjects are not just about literature.  Rather, they are about film, drama, interpretative skills and creating and responding to work.  In technology subjects, students use ICT and computer-aided design, make tools, engineer and so on.  There is hardly a transition year programme in the country that does not involve a school musical.  Every year, 15,000 students set up their own businesses as part of the student enterprise awards.There is creativity across a range of subjects, but we are concerned by the trend towards rote learning and the gamesmanship surrounding the points system.  If one wants to change teaching, one must change assessment.  It is changing.  Of the 34 subjects in the leaving certificate, approximately 18 have a second assessment component, be it oral, practical or project and portfolio work, that is designed to promote creative skills and active learning.  A key acknowledgement in the proposals of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, on the reform of the junior certificate is that, if assessment does not change, nothing will change.  Under a major change, all subjects will have second assessment components and school-based assessment will form a critical part of the overall approach.  This will be a mix of school-based and externally driven assessments.As the world is changing so much, key transferable skills, being able to apply them in different contexts and being able to cope with change are assuming increasing importance.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Teacher training colleges are being engaged with, specifically in the context of the literacy and numeracy strategy to which I referred and the recommendations on the extension of the BEd and diploma programmes.  This requires an engagement regarding content.  The role of the Teaching Council to which the Vice Chairman alluded is fundamental.  As with the medical, nursing, pharmacy and other professional bodies, this professional body is responsible for the registration of teachers and the registration requirements, namely, the competences of those who qualify from teacher education programmes.  Where the council makes recommendations on programme content in a particular teacher education college, one would expect them to carry weight.  A fundamental change in our system is the professionalisation of the teaching profession through the role of the Teaching Council.
