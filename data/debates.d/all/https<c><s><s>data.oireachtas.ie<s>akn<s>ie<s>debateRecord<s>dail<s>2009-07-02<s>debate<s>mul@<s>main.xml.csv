#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss a matter of national importance; namely, the inequality in our society that sees old age pensioners who, in many cases, can barely afford to eat or heat their homes, and those who are unemployed due to the fallout of the economic crisis caused by Government mismanagement of the economy facing a possible reduction in their entitlements to social welfare, as unemployment figures rise by the minute, with the June figures reaching 12% and, according to the Taoiseach, expected to reach 15% by the end of the year; yet some members of our society are still refusing to share the pain.

Is the proposal that the Dáil shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. a12, motion re by-election for Donegal South-West, agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 26, Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 — Order for Report Stage and Report and Final Stages agreed to?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I assume the Tánaiste wants the Donegal South-West by-election to take place as quickly as possible, a move we support.  I understand there are ten proposals involving a guillotine in respect of business this week and next.  Given that we have had a complete scarcity of legislation on so many occasions in the past 12 months, this is not the way to do business.  No. 26 is the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009, an important Bill which deals with important issues.  I object to the debate on it being guillotined in this fashion.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I also object to this proposal.  The Order of Business presented by the Tánaiste is ludicrous.  Yesterday we had one and three quarter hours allocated for the debate on the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 to which there were 84 amendments on Report Stage.  Three and a half hours were allocated for the debate on the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006, to which there were 41 amendments on Report Stage.  Today, it is proposed to allocate two to two and a half hours for the debate on the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009, to which there are 18 amendments on Report Stage.  It is then proposed to allocate one and a half hours for the debate on Report and Final Stages of the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009 to which there is one amendment.  Finally, it is proposed to allocate four and three quarters hours to deal with all Stages of the European Parliament (Irish Constituency Members) Bill 2009, relating to the method of payment to Members of the European Parliament, to which, I understand, no amendments have been tabled.It would be possible to take these three Bills today without any guillotine if they were ordered the other way around.  We could deal quickly with the European Parliament (Irish Constituency Members) Bill 2009 and the one amendment to the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009.  That would leave a decent amount of time to deal with the 18 amendments to the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009.  All of this business could probably be done without any guillotine.  However, it seems the business of the House is being ordered for the convenience of Ministers, not with a view to dealing comprehensively with legislation.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I ask the Tánaiste to reverse the order of the Bills in the sensible manner I have suggested.I also draw attention to the arrangements for next week.  By my count, there are 12 proposals involving a guillotine.  Four of the items of legislation the House is being asked to deal with next week are entirely new and have not appeared before the House thus far.  Two of the Bills have yet to be published, one of which deals with the forthcoming referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  Among all of this, 90 minutes will be allocated next Tuesday for the debate on Committee, Report and Final Stages of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009 which has far-reaching implications for the criminal justice system.  Whatever Members' views on its content, 90 minutes is hardly sufficient time to allow the degree of scrutiny a Bill of this type requires.It is not unusual that we find ourselves in a position at the end of a Dáil session where the Government is using the guillotine to push through legislation, either to get it out of the way or to minimise the amount of public attention it will receive.  However, on this occasion, it has taken the use of the guillotine and the ordering of business to a new level of ridiculousness.

It only remains for me to indicate that the Sinn Féin Deputies oppose the imposition of a guillotine in regard to the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009.  With the tabling of 18 amendments and the import of what is involved, it requires more time than is being offered.  At the same time, it may well be the case that the guillotine will not be needed in the sequence the Tánaiste and Chief Whip have presented.  We should allow each Bill to have its natural time.  Just as the Government has been surprised in the past, it could be surprised again.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Several references were made to next week's business, with which we are not dealing today.  We will certainly take on board the views expressed by Members.  The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 has gone through Second and Committee Stages during which Members had an opportunity to say what they needed to say.  We are now dealing with Report and Final Stages.  The legislation must be passed as quickly as possible in order that we can allow the new licensing and renewal system to be put in place.  The Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009 is of regulatory importance and also needs to be passed by the House as soon as possible.  The same urgency attaches to the European Parliament (Irish Constituency Members) Bill 2009.  Perhaps if the House aimed to have the Order of Business agreed to before 1 p.m., there might be more time for the debates on these Bills.  Given the circumstances, I am not in a position to change the order on the basis that it has been agreed with the Whips.

In the past, we have had experience of legislation being guillotined and issues have subsequently arisen that have caused some difficulty.  This morning, I listened to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who said he had to seek advice from the Attorney General overnight because he did not understand the difference between a granny-flat in the garden or one attached to a house.  I received a letter today from a family whose father suffers from dementia and is in a nursing home full-time.  They have been trying for the last 12 months to sell that house but cannot do so due to the market situation.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	64	They will now have to pay this tax.  I was interested in the remarks made yesterday by the Taoiseach who said that we need to have a thorough discussion about the NAMA legislation, which is right and proper.  I want to know when the legislation will come before the House, for two reasons.  First, there is a crisis with substantial numbers of people with whom banks will not deal because they are in the pre-NAMA phase.  Reuters reports this morning that there has been a change and that NAMA will only acquire loans of €5 million or over on the books of the Bank of Ireland and AIB.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The point I am making is that there will be further substantial job losses unless some movement is made in bank credit and overdraft facilities in the meantime before NAMA becomes operational.  In that context, and arising from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government having to go to the Attorney General in the middle of the night, when NAMA acquires a substantial number of houses from developers will they be paying the €200 tax on the second and third houses the Minister is talking about?

Given the crisis facing Europe, including Ireland, it is important that the Commission has a President as soon as possible after the European Parliament elections.

Either we appoint a Commission president under the Nice treaty or the Lisbon treaty.  We need a President of the Commission appointed quickly.  The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, knows this.  If the Ceann Comhairle will not allow the question now, will we get clarification next week as to why the three Fianna Fáil MEPs are acting in contravention of what the Taoiseach himself said at the heads of government meeting?  He announced, rightly, that he would support Barroso.

I understand that the Dáil is possibly going to come back for a week on September 18 and then recess for the Lisbon referendum, which will possibly take place on 2 October.  Is it true that at that point we will take the NAMA legislation, or will we even have the legislation by then?  Will we have the heads of the Bill by the time we go into recess next week?

We had been led to understand that the report would be presented to the Government before the end of June.  Presumably, the Government would have been in a position to inform the House about the report and possibly publish it before the summer recess.  It would appear that the report will not be available to the Government.  There have been reports in newspapers suggesting that it might not be available to the Government until the autumn.  When does the Government expect to receive and consider the McCarthy report?  Can we be given an assurance that the report will be published?  The content of that report will have major implications for public finances and for the organisation of public services.  It is important that we all have access to what is in that report.

There has not been a promise to do so, so we are straying outside the strict rules.  Anyway, it appears you have something to say briefly.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I will be very brief.  I now understand from the Tánaiste that this will be presented to the Minister for Finance next week, and will be considered by the Government thereafter.  Will it be considered by the Government before it breaks for its own holidays?  Can the Tánaiste indicate to us when that will be?  When will that document be laid before the House?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	147	It will be highly likely that it will be made available once the Minister for Finance has received it.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Highly likely?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I am talking about it being made available to the Cabinet.  As I am only one member of the Cabinet, I am not in a position to make a decision as to whether it will be published or not until the Cabinet meets to discuss it.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	150	Can the Tánaiste indicate when a local government Bill will be brought forward to implement the commitment to freeze commercial rates in local authorities, in the interest of protecting employment?  There is a Bill before the Seanad at the moment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	151	The Local Government (Charges) Bill 2009 will be brought before this House next Thursday.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	152	There is a commitment made in the programme for Government, in the context of the local elections, to freeze commercial rates for the purposes of protecting employment.  The Tánaiste's Department was involved in that as well.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Fine Gael are running the councils now with Sinn Féin.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	154	That is a matter for the Deputy's party now.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	155	We know our responsibility.  We also know about the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	156	Fine Gael has the power to change that in every council in the country.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I think the Bill to which Deputy refers is in the Seanad, and on that basis, it will be a matter for another place.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	158	Can I take it that the commitment given by Fianna Fáil and the Tánaiste is not being implemented?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	159	Did the Deputy read that fully?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I did.  I did not have to go to the Attorney General while the Minister was asleep.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	161	Over to the Deputy.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	163	Fine Gael has the power to do that on every council.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	164	It was a desperate and cynical attempt to get votes which did not work.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	165	We can have this conversation elsewhere.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	166	The issue refers to the local government manifesto on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  It indicated that if we were returned as a majority we would implement those changes.  Given that we do not have a majority, then it will be a matter for the Opposition.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	167	That is the most cynical response I have ever heard.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	168	So the Tánaiste is saying that there is no intention on behalf of the Government to bring forward legislation to freeze commercial rates, as it has done in the past.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	169	Can I ask about the consumer and competition Bill?  There is a price war ongoing in our supermarkets.  That is ultimately going to end up with increased prices for consumers, lack of choice, possible market domination in some areas and ultimately job losses, which is most serious.  We have reports from Forfás, the Competition Authority, and the National Consumer Agency that look at baskets of goods, comparing them and wagging their finger.  When will we see the Consumer and Competition Bill, which will amalgamate the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	170	Work is ongoing on that Bill.  I hope to have it in the next session.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I would like to ask the Tánaiste a question about the Údarás na Gaeltachta Bill.  She is from the Gaeltacht herself.  Two hundred badly needed jobs were approved by the Údarás.  A total of 22,000 people went on the live register last month.  We have over 420,000 people unemployed in this country.  The Údarás has approved 200 jobs, but it has no funding.  What is the Tánaiste going to do about it?  The embargoes of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland have been lifted.  Will the Tánaiste speak to the Minister for Finance, provide that money for the Údarás and provide badly needed jobs for the Gaeltacht areas and for rural Ireland?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	172	We cannot discuss the policies of Údarás na Gaeltachta.  I call on the Tánaiste to speak on the Údarás na Gaeltachta Bill.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	173	Tá an ceart aige.  Níl pingin amháin fághta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá sé in am rud éigin a dhéanamh.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	174	Tá an Tánaiste agus an t-Aire, an Teachta Ó Cuiv, ag déanamh gach iarracht maidir leis na rudaí seo i dtús báire.  Níl dáta socraithe go fóill don Bhille.

It was promised that the chief executive would be in place by January of this year.  When will the Dublin Transport Authority be in place to deal with these emergency situations?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I will revert to the Deputy on that.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	177	Fine.  In view of the fact that the report of the commission of inquiry into Leas Cross is in the hands of the Minister for Health and Children since 10 June, why has been delayed by the Cabinet?  Why has it not been debated in this House?  Why is the Government delaying its publication?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	178	As I told Deputy Gilmore earlier, the question, which is appropriate, relates to reports to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	179	There is no date or decision on that.  The Cabinet has not yet considered the report.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	181	We are not delaying it.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	183	In view of the breakdown in the relationship between the Minister for Health and Children and the pharmacists, which will result in serious hardship and risk to patients, is it intended to reintroduce the Pharmacy (No. 2) Bill which was on the legislative programme up to approximately six months ago and which was mysteriously dropped from it?  Is it intended to reintroduce it to enable the House have a full debate on this vital issue?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	184	We are awaiting the full enactment of the Pharmacy (No. 1) Bill before we consider whether more legislation needs to be introduced.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Does that mean patients may suffer and the services provided by pharmacists will be seriously undermined?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	186	What it means or does not mean is not relevant now, unfortunately.  The Deputy will have to discuss that when the Bill is being discussed.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	187	The Tánaiste said the Pharmacy (No. 1) Bill must be fully operational.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	189	Does that mean the Pharmacy (No. 2) Bill will not be introduced at all?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I will ask the Minister for Health and Children to revert to the Deputy.  The decision was to drop this legislation until we finalised the full enactment of the Pharmacy(No. 1) Bill.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I wish to raise two items.  Perhaps in preparation for the session after the summer recess, the Ceann Comhairle, in his position as Chairman of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, might have the inadequate acoustics in this Chamber addressed.  On several occasions, it has been impossible for Deputies located in different locations in the Chamber to hear the Chair.  An example of that was this morning in regard to tomorrow's Order Paper.  I was unable to hear what the Ceann Comhairle proposed and, belatedly, I must record that I oppose it.  Those are the facts of the matter.  I record that I would have opposed the proposition in regard to the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009 and will do so again at any opportunity open to me.In regard to the expected publication of a new schedule of legislation by the Government in September, can special efforts be employed over the summer recess to address the significant backlog in promised legislation from the Department of Health and Children?  I speak specifically about long promised legislation about which the Government stated it is not possible to indicate when publication will take place.I am concerned about two Bills, in particular, the Nurses and Midwives Bill and the eligibility for health and personal and social services Bill.  Each of these is hugely important and I appeal to the Government not to produce a promised programme of legislation in September which will again confine this important legislation to the margins, not to be realised for God knows how long.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	192	The heads of the Nurses and Midwives Bill were approved in March with an expectation that the legislation would come in next year.  I will ask the Minister to get an update on the eligibility for health and personal and social services Bill for the Deputy.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	193	On what legislative basis was the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority set up?  Was it under primary or secondary legislation?

#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	195	Does it have autonomy in determining policy?  Is it accountable to the Minister?  This stems from a question which was disallowed by the Ceann Comhairle in which I asked for an inquiry——
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	196	This question must be disallowed as well.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	211	On Tuesday night last, the Aviation (Preclearance) Bill passed through this House and was supported all parties.  The Minister for Transport will probably come down to Shannon Airport to launch the facility with fanfare at the end of July.  I wish to get assurances from the Tánaiste.  There are rumours that our national airline, Aer Lingus, will not use this facility in Shannon Airport when it comes into operation on 30 July.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	212	We cannot have a question on who is or who is not going to use the facility, as Deputy Breen well knows.

I understand an hour and three quarters has been rostered next week for Committee and Report Stages.We usually come into the House to ask for more time after the event.  I ask the Tánaiste if she will discuss this again with the Chief Whip.  Given the landmark nature of this Bill and its departure from the established criminal justice system, there is a necessity for us to be provided with time on Committee and Report Stages to deal with the very important issues which arise.

Given that the Whips were apoplectic about the fact they were of the opinion I misled the House, which I did not do, the Chief Whip has advised that there was agreement on the business but that the Whips were opposed to the way in which it was proposed.  As I said to Deputy Rabbitte, we will look at additional time being made available for that legislation next week.

Tá sé mar cheart bunúsach ag pobal an Dáilcheantair seo ionadaíocht iomlán a bheith acu sa Dáil.  Tá dualgas daonlathach ar an Rialtas dáta an fo-thoghcháin a shocrú anois agus iarraimid orthu é sin a dhéanamh inniu.This by-election should be called now so that the people of Donegal South-West can have their full representation in the Dáil and the representative they elect can take his or her place here on the resumption of the Dáil in the autumn.The democratic representation of the people of Donegal South-West must be restored to its full quota at the earliest opportunity.  We must not see a repeat of previous situations where constituencies have been left for more than a year without their proper representation.  Sinn Féin is taking the lead in calling for this by-election to be held at the earliest opportunity.County Donegal was, by and large, left behind by the Celtic tiger and is suffering the highest levels of unemployment in the State with 10,000 people losing their jobs last year.  The infrastructure deficit in the constituency is massive.  It has no railway link, little access to broadband, local and regional roads are in a state of disrepair and it is not connected to the national gas grid.  The fishing sector is on its knees as a result of Government inaction, the fundamentally flawed EU fisheries policy and over-regulation.  Cancer services are to be withdrawn from one of the hospitals serving south Donegal along with massive cuts in home help hours.  The future of the Gaeltacht is in question as it continues to contract.All these issues need to be addressed and it is, therefore, essential that Donegal South-West has its full democratic representation restored without further delay.  There is a special obligation on the Government to hold this by-election since it created the vacancy.  Fianna Fáil's EU election strategy for the European Parliament North West constituency fell asunder when its candidate and MEP Seán Ó Neachtain pulled the plug at the last minute.  The party was forced to draft in former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, as both a proven vote-getter and a Donegal representative, with the view to thwarting the challenge of Sinn Féin's Pádraig Mac Lochlainn.If the Government refuses to accept this motion today, it will be rightly concluded that the prospect of Sinn Féin electoral success in County Donegal was again a determining factor because Sinn Féin Senator Pearse Doherty would be a front-runner in this by-election.

Our system is flawed in that only the Government can give the people that opportunity and trigger the process of calling a by-election to fill a vacancy that arises during the Dáil term.  That should change with a constitutional obligation for a by-election to be held in a set period after the vacancy arises.  It should not be determined by what is politically expedient for the party or parties in office at the time.The last thing the Government wants to do is to face the people again after its drubbing at the recent local and European elections.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach announced the latest disastrous unemployment figures and actually tried to put a positive spin on them by saying the rate of increase was slower since January.  Who does he think he is fooling?  The Taoiseach should let the people of Donegal South-West decide.  Let the Government put its record before the people.  Then it might be compelled to finally come up with some attempt at a coherent strategy for the retention and creation of jobs, something it has failed to produce so far, even though we are in the depths of the worst unemployment crisis ever experienced.The Government must not drag its heels on this by-election writ.  I remind the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Fianna Fáil Deputies of the words of Pat The Cope Gallagher himself calling for a by-election in Donegal South-West in 1986.  He told the House it was "morally and democratically wrong" for the then Fine Gael-Labour Government to oppose the holding of the by-election.

When writs are moved for by-elections, it is usually as a result of a sad event such as the passing away of a Member as occurred in the last two by-elections caused by the deaths of two long-serving Members, Séamus Brennan and Tony Gregory.  As was said earlier, this is a different occasion with the writ being moved under different circumstances and I formally congratulate our former colleague, Pat The Cope Gallagher, on his recent election success.With him going to Europe, however, there is a democratic deficit in Donegal South-West.  As a Member for the constituency, I believe the 67,000 constituents are entitled to the same parliamentary representation as any other constituency from Donegal to Cork.  Donegal South-West needs full representation in the House to highlight its needs and difficulties.  The economic crisis is having a more severe impact on Donegal than on any other county.When the Government came to office two years ago, unemployment in Donegal was at 8,500.  Today, approximately 20,000 people are unemployed, an increase of over 100%.  I do not know of any other county where this has happened.  The economic and industrial base of Donegal has severely contracted with many factories shut such as Hospira in Donegal town, with the loss of 600 jobs, Parian China and James Likely in Ballyshannon and Herdsman and Nena Models in the Finn Valley.  Tourism, fisheries and agriculture, the lifeblood of the county's economy, are at a low ebb.  More shoppers are going across to Northern Ireland due to unfavourable trading conditions.  The people of Donegal South-West should have an opportunity to give their verdict on the Government's performance in the past two years.

The people of Donegal South-West should have an opportunity to cast their verdicts on the candidates in the by-election following the election of former Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher to the European Parliament.  It is a democratic position that needs to be filled.

We believe in principle that by-elections to fill vacancies in the membership of the Dáil, whether as a result of a Member's death, resignation or election to the European Parliament, should be held at the earliest opportunity.However, the timing of the motion needs to be taken into account.  If it were passed today, the by-election would be held between 23 July and 30 July.  Other than August, we cannot think of a worse time to hold a by-election.  It would be at the height of the holiday season with many families on holidays, some out of the country.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	254	It would probably result in the lowest turn-out in a by-election in the history of the State.  I am sure even Sinn Féin members take holidays at some time.  For any party, mobilising party personnel, whatever about candidates and voters, would be difficult coming up to a long weekend.  I am not sure either as to what businesses in Donegal South-West would feel about election posters and canvassers descending on them during the busy summer period.  Sinn Féin's wish may well be to have the by-election held on the same day as the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty, which I understand is due to be held at the beginning of October.  That will not be possible if this motion is passed today, however.The Labour Party is not happy with the situation that has developed over the years, whereby Governments use their voting power in the Dáil to defer by-elections for an unacceptably long period.  That has happened on numerous occasions.  In the most recent cases, the vacancy in Dublin South caused by the death of Séamus Brennan was left unfilled for almost a year, while the vacancy in Dublin Central caused by the death of Tony Gregory was left unfilled for almost six months.  In the past, seats have been left vacant for almost two years.Previous speakers have suggested that the Constitution should require writs to be issued within a specific period of time.  I do not think such a constitutional requirement is necessary.  I suggest that the Constituency Commission, which makes a determination every few years on the appropriate number of Deputies to represent every constituency, should have a role in determining how the Order of Business is carried on in this House and how writs are actually proposed.  It is simply not acceptable for the Government to deny the people the level of representation to which they are entitled by refusing to arrange a by-election in Donegal South-West, in my own county of Cork or in any other part of the country.  As soon as a seat becomes vacant in this House, there is a democratic deficit.  Every constituency should have its full democratic entitlement in this House.  It should not be possible for the Government to use its majority in this House to prevent the holding of a by-election.This is not an appropriate time to consider amending the Standing Orders of the Dáil that govern what happens when a vacancy occurs in the membership of the House.  When that time comes, however, I suggest that we should put in place a system whereby the writ for a by-election is automatically issued after a specified period of time — three or four months, for example — if a motion issuing the writ has not already been passed at that stage.I would like to conclude by referring to an issue that is significant in this context.  The European Parliament election takes place on a five-year cycle.  It can almost be predicted that at least one candidate who is a sitting Member of this House will be elected to the European Parliament every five years.  I suggest that we should prepare for that possibility in advance of every European Parliament election.  When a Deputy is elected to the European Parliament, the Opposition should not have to wait for the Government to use its discretion to issue the writ for the by-election.  The people of Donegal South-West and every other constituency deserve better treatment.  We need to find a means of tidying up this long-standing issue.

Like Deputy McGinley, I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Gallagher on his election.

Anyone who knows Mr. Gallagher will not doubt that he will admirably represent the interests of the people of Donegal South-West when he is in Brussels as an MEP for the huge Ireland North West constituency.  I do not agree that the constituency is under-represented at the moment.  Along with my colleague, Deputy McGinley, I will continue to represent the entire constituency in this House.  We will continue to work as diligently and closely as humanly possible.I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House that although the Donegal South-West constituency faces many of the same difficulties and challenges as other constituencies, it has benefited from substantial investment over recent years.  There have been significant improvements in its infrastructural development, for example.  I refer to Aerfort Dhún na nGall, for example.  Tá níos mó postanna i nGaoth Dobhair faoi chúram Údarás na Gaeltachta.  I was appointed as Minister of State at the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands after a considerable number of jobs had been lost in the area.  I concentrated specifically on developing new employment opportunities for the people of the Gaoth Dobhair area.  That has been achieved.  Almost €90 million has been invested in broadband services, metropolitan area networks and other technical infrastructure.  More than €100 million has been spent on modernisation projects in our schools.Despite the challenges we all have to address, sustained support will continue to be given to the Donegal South-West constituency.  Job retention and creation will continue to be a central element of my work as a Deputy for Donegal South-West and as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We will continue to work on the introduction of the job stabilisation fund.  We are dealing with the due diligence on export credit insurance, which is hugely important.  Agreement on the conduct of lending has been reached between the banks and the small and medium enterprise sector.  I hope the credit supply clearing group will be supported by the Department of Finance, which has sanctioned research into the real problems that are affecting access to credit and working capital, which is a hugely important issue.  We are revamping our public procurement policy so that it better supports small and medium sized enterprises.  It is important to emphasise that jobs will continue to be created and retained in Donegal South-West.  New opportunities will be offered to people in employment.  The new initiatives in question are being developed in conjunction with the social partners.  We will continue to have huge activation measures that will not just benefit the people of Donegal South-West, but the people of all the constituencies we represent.  I assure the House that the Government will keep the issuing of the writ for the Donegal South-West by-election under review.

In page 8, to delete line 10 and substitute the following:"(b) by the deletion of subsections (4), (5) and (6),(c) by the substitution for subsection (7) of the following:"(7) For the purposes of this Act, a document shall be deemed to be a true copy of an original document if it has been certified as a true copy of the original document by—(a) the issuing judicial authority, or(b) an officer of the central authority of the issuing state.”.”.Section 12 of the European Arrest Warrant Act provides for the transmission of European arrest warrants and supporting documentation.  Section 8 of this Bill amends section 11 of the Act to allow for the use of modern means of communication and transmission of documentation.  The amendment substitutes the text of section 12(7) of the 2003 Act, which defines a "true copy" for the purposes of the Act.The purpose of the substituted text is to simplify the procedure for certification of two copies of documents.  It removes the references to the seal of the issuing judicial or central authority.  These references are considered incompatible with modern means of transmission of documents provided for in the amendment to 12(3) by section 8 of the Act, which provides for the transmission of documents by any means capable of producing a written record.  We discussed this on Committee Stage.

In page 8, to delete lines 19 to 42, to delete page 9 and in page 10, to delete lines 1 to 9.In this amendment I propose the deletion of section 10.  Section 10 intends the deletion and substitution of section 13 from the 2003 Act.  The original section 14 is preferable to the one proposed here and that is why I propose its deletion.  Under the original provision an alert meant the document that indicates that an European arrest warrant had been issued by a judicial authority and, where the subject had not been convicted of the offence, a statement by the judicial authority confirming that a decision to charge and try the individual had been made.  Under the current provision, gardaí may arrest a person on the basis of an alert, before they have an EU arrest warrant, only where they believe on reasonable grounds the person is likely to leave the State before the arrest warrant can be provided.The substitution defines an alert as that which appears on the Schengen Information System.  The express requirement that was in the previous act of judicial authorisation in the originating country and the requirement for urgency are both removed.  The original section required the gardaí to inform the person arrested immediately of his or her right to consent to be surrendered.  The new section removes that ability for the person.  This might lead to court time being unnecessarily taken up with people who are happy to be surrendered.The original section also provided that the High Court must direct the release of the person if the EU arrest warrant is not produced within seven days, whereas the new section has extended this to 14 days.  This extension of detention is unwarranted given that the gist of the rest of the Bill is to modernise the mechanisms for communication in light of new technologies.  If anything, there is less excuse for delays in the production of the necessary documentation.  The increase from seven to 14 days is not warranted, given new technologies.In general, section 10 is to have the same impact as an European arrest warrant and there is a real danger that innocent people will be deprived of their liberty for up to two weeks due to the proven inability of some law-enforcement agencies across the globe to ensure the data on their central databases is accurate and updated.  Alerts may issue where arrest warrants do not exist.  This section of the Bill provides that the alert on the Schengen Information System will be equivalent to an EU arrest warrant.  It will give rise to automatic Garda power of arrest without warrant, and then the High Court can remand the person in custody for 14 days prior to the production of the warrant to which the alert relates.  That is if a warrant exists, given the dangers of inaccurate data.  The scope for error on the Schengen Information System and the implications of the errors are grave, so we must be careful where we extend the period during which we can deprive people of their liberty.When the Schengen Information System was operating in only 13 countries, there were 125,000 access points.  If it is to be extended across all member states and, potentially, across the new common security areas with the United States and others, we are talking about almost 500,000 access points.  The greater the number of access points, the more people have access and the greater chance data might be lost, stolen, corrupted or whatever else.  We must bear that in mind when we extend the period of detention.  I propose that we delete section 10 and remain with the existing section 14 of the 2003 Act.

There is not much difference between the texts of this one and the existing section 14 except that in the new text a person may be remanded for a period not exceeding 14 days pending production of the warrant to the court as opposed to seven days.  Already under the existing section 14 the remand can be only in custody whereas under this new section the remand, although it is for 14 days, can be in custody or in bail, at the discretion of the court.  This is not excessive when one considers the type of work that needs to be carried out in the preparation of the warrant.  The section contains many protections for persons arrested under its provisions.  It requires that the person arrested must be brought before the court as soon as may be after arrest and that all subsequent matters should be dealt with by the High Court.  It will be a matter for the High Court at its discretion to decide on the appropriate period of remand pending production of the warrant in each case and whether such remand should be in custody or on bail.  Of course if the warrant is not produced to the High Court within the period specified then obviously the person must be released.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.

I understand what he says about it being a Council decision.  However, not everything in this section is a Council decision and I do not believe the change from seven days to 14 days is a Council decision.  I welcome the fact that a person can be granted bail.  Why does the Minister not just change the existing seven days to be held in custody or on bail rather than increasing the potential number of days a person may be held in custody to 14?  Given the new technologies available it should be possible to ensure that material required to be transferred between jurisdictions under a European arrest warrant can be supplied more quickly?  As most of these arrest warrants are standardised forms which need additional details to be inserted, the process is not as complicated or as long drawn out as the Minister suggests.  If an alert is made on the Schengen information system, the jurisdiction making the alert should prepare the arrest warrant at that stage so that there will be no undue delay when somebody is arrested in another jurisdiction under this facility.  I will press the amendment.

Section 12 of the 2003 Act requires that warrants that are not in English or Irish should be accompanied by a translation into either of those languages.  Obviously there is a difficulty over a period and that is one of the reasons for extending the time to 14 days.  The courts have also made it clear that the central authority should ensure that all warrants are correct in form and content and clear in the translations provided before they are presented to the court.  There is a very strict undertaking.  I cannot accept the amendment.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 11, to delete lines 40 to 45.When I try to struggle with this section of the Bill again, it reminds me of the Taoiseach's famous remark that he did not read the Lisbon treaty, for which he was somewhat unfairly pilloried given that he was involved in the negotiation of it.  It is also fairly hard going to relate and cross-reference the sections that refer to my amendment.  As we know Bunreacht na hÉireann endows us with the Supreme Court — a court of final appeal — having appellate jurisdiction from the High Court and the lower courts, subject to certain exceptions that are provided for in law.  At the same time as the Supreme Court has that appellate jurisdiction, we in this House are gradually moving to reduce the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in specific cases.  Here again we are doing precisely that.Notwithstanding that extradition concerns very fundamental personal rights, this section limits the right of appeal to cases where either the High Court or the Attorney General allows it.  That is a departure from the existing situation.  At the moment either side may appeal without leave.  However, this section would constrain it only to cases allowed by the High Court or authorised by the Attorney General.  There is a further unfairness in the sense that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a party to European arrest warrant applications.  It seems unfair that his colleague at the Cabinet table, the Attorney General, has the power under the legislation as framed to decide whether the Minister can appeal or whether to refuse the defendant the right to appeal as the case may be.  I do not see a pressing need to limit the right of appeal as proposed.I have looked over the earlier debates and the explanatory memorandum.  As happens increasingly nowadays, the explanatory memorandum will outline matters that are not of great importance and avoid giving the substance.  In this case the explanatory memorandum does not bother dealing with this point at all.  I am concerned at this reduction in the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.  If the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform believes there is a logjam in the Supreme Court on matters that it might be considered should not be in the Supreme Court, that is a matter of reviewing the structure of the Courts Service.Let us consider the measures we have enacted recently, including the Water Services Act 2007, the Criminal Justice Act 2007, the Prisons Act 2007, the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 and the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Act 2005.  We have gradually constrained or reduced the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.  As I mentioned on Committee Stage in the circumstances we are discussing that could also limit the State's freedom in certain circumstances.  I reviewed what the Minister said on Committee Stage.  He has not explained why he thinks it is necessary to similarly reduce the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in this case to either where the High Court allows it or the Attorney General sanctions it.  This is appalling.  History will view us harshly in terms of the manner in which we now make law in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The position of the Dáil as compared with the position of the Executive is being gradually eroded with more Ministers believing this House is a rubber-stamp for legislation.  There were a number of weeks in this parliamentary year when the cupboard was bare in terms of legislation before this House.  Currently, there are four live justice Bills on the floor of the House for completion before 10 July on which major points such as this are not being teased out or discussed.Deputy Flanagan stated on the Order of Business that a Bill with which we will be dealing next week will inevitably find its way to the Supreme Court, and sooner rather than later.  We will not have an opportunity to even debate matters in respect of that Bill that require to be teased out.  I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say in regard to whether there is a general Government theory as to the type of issues that ought properly proceed to be decided by the court, which is a change in direction.  If the problem is a logjam in the Supreme Court we should have an open discussion on the matter in terms of the solutions that might be on offer.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	274	Deputy Rabbitte referred to the role of the Attorney General in terms of certification.  That provision was deleted from the Bill on Committee Stage.  The point was made on Committee Stage that if the Attorney General sat at the Cabinet table it might be viewed that he had some role in this area and as such that provision was removed on Committee Stage.The effect of the amendments would be to delete subsection 16(12) of the 2003 Act and to leave the text as is, namely, an appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law only.  I mentioned on Committee Stage that the Attorney General had advised that appeals are in many instances being lodged on frivolous and vexatious grounds for the purpose of delaying surrender.  The Attorney General advised that the right of appeal should be restricted to a point of law of exceptional public importance, certified as such by the High Court where it is in the public interest to do so.  As I said on Committee Stage, section 15 relates to where a warrant for surrender has been received and the person consents to surrender and subsection (9) allows a person, who has consented to surrender to withdraw his or her consent at any point prior to surrender, a right which pertains even up to the steps of the aeroplane taking him or her to the receiving country.Operational experience has shown that the provision has been availed of on many occasions on vexatious grounds purely for the purpose of delaying surrender.  The Attorney General has advised the abolition of this section and inclusion of the new section 3A, which also provides that an appeal to the Supreme Court should be on a point of law of exceptional public importance where it is in the public interest to do so.  A similar provision in relation to appeals to the Supreme Court has, therefore, been included through sections 11 and 12 of this Bill in sections 15 and 16 of the European Arrest Warrant Act.  Deputies do not appear to have tabled amendments to section 11.Deputy Rabbitte referred to pressure on the Supreme Court.  There is no doubt that appeals against European arrest warrants, which are in many cases lodged purely for the purpose of delaying surrender, do contribute to pressure on the Supreme Court.  I make the point that following a High Court order for surrender, a person has 15 days in which to lodge an appeal.  There is, therefore, no delay in surrender between the making of the order and the lodging of the appeal.  However, once the appeal is lodged surrender is postponed until the Supreme Court judgment is issued.  The Supreme Court prioritises appeals where the applicant is held in custody but it can take from two months, where a case is prioritised, to more than a year for a judgment to issue.  Since the coming into force of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, 64 appeals have been lodged to the Supreme Court.  I am advised that the majority of these did not deal in any shape or form with significant points of law.  To date, the Supreme Court has issued judgments in 28 of these cases, only three of which were upheld with the remaining 25 being dismissed.  In these cases, the majority of the grounds of appeal were repetitious.  For example, a number of appeals were made on the basis that the Act was unconstitutional and that the framework decision had not been properly approved by the Oireachtas.  Six appeals were withdrawn, some of them after seven months.  Obviously, the persons involved benefited from the postponement of the surrender following the lodging of the appeals in these cases.There are currently 30 appeals awaiting hearing.  Some appeals lodged in 2007 and early 2008 have been waiting a year or more for hearing.  No hearing date has as yet been set in respect of the majority of these cases.  Given that even cases on the priority list will probably take two legal terms to get through, it is likely that the delay in hearing the majority of cases will increase with a resultant delay on surrender.  We are now amending an Act only passed in 2003.  It must be emphasised that this is a surrender rather than a trial for an offence, although the person will obviously have to go before a trial when he or she enters the receiving the country.  I believe it is only reasonable that we allow an appeal to the Supreme Court but only as is suggested by the Attorney General, namely, that it be on an exceptional point of law when in the public interest so to do.  It is for the High Court to decide on that issue when the appeal is lodged.

The Minister stated that of 28 appeals heard, three were upheld, which is interesting.  There is no mention, other than the Minister's earlier reference, of vexatious cases.  The Minister stated that people had benefited from the delay in surrender but I do not believe anybody benefits from a period in custody.  The benefit may be that they were in custody in Ireland rather than in another jurisdiction.  I have a problem with this section, which is the reason I supported the amendment.There are people who might consent to their surrender and who, having considered the full consequences of their surrender, might on the steps of the aeroplane opt to avail of the right to appeal.  In the past, under the watch of former Deputy and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, this House agreed to an increase in the number of High Court and Supreme Court judges to deal with the workload, thus ensuring no overdue delays in this area.  I do not know whether the increased number of judges has resulted in a reduction in the backlog of cases to be heard.  Were there no backlog, the courts would have no difficulty dealing quickly with the number of cases referred to by the Minister.  Repetitious appeals could be dealt with more easily than appeals made on new points of law.  I would prefer if the Minister would accept the amendment to ensure people have the right to a proper appeals process when they withdraw their consent in this instance.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	276	The Minister states one of the reasons for his limiting the right of appeal is that it is being used as a device to prolong the decision making process.  The Minister's point of ensuring there is no subversion of justice would be catered for under section 12(g)(13), which allows for the remand of a person in custody.  If there were difficulties with vexatious or unfounded appeals that are made to frustrate the process, it would be dealt with easily by remanding the person in custody, which might meet the Minister’s concern.The Minister looked to the matter of delay and backlog but rather than dealing with it expediently, by refusing entry to the process and debarring people an opportunity to engage in the process, he is dealing with the issue improperly.  Perhaps the Minister could address the backlog by looking to the structure.  There is a need for a separate division which would act as a court of civil appeal that would deal with the Supreme Court business in a way that would be fair and progressive, rather than the way he is dealing with the issue by introducing legislation that will restrict the right of appeal and debar a citizen from engaging in the process.  This expediency is not in the public interest.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	277	We are trying to streamline the process as much as possible.  Under the 2003 Act the court has an obligation to vindicate the rights of anyone before it based on the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  It must take those into account.The High Court can decide under section 12(g)(13) to remand a person in custody or on bail pending the appeal.  If he is remanded in custody, he would wish to have the case dealt with as quickly as possible.  There is always an obligation on the courts to hear an appeal as soon as possible.  The significant workload of the Supreme Court must be looked at and Mrs. Justice Denham is working on a report on the structure of the Supreme Court.We are where we are, however, and it is the experience that there are people who, having consented to surrender and gone through the process, as they are literally about to get on an aeroplane, lodge an appeal knowing it will delay matters further.  This aspect has been used in the vast majority of cases as a device to delay the surrender.  Doing that delays the decision on the innocence or guilt of the person involved so we are trying to ensure that if there is an appeal, it is a matter for the High Court to decide.  We are not trying to circumscribe those with a genuine point of law from going to the Supreme Court on an exceptional matter if it is in the public interest to do so.

We have made our arguments and it is clear the Minister is not minded to take them on board.I have pointed to this practice of narrowing the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.  It is evident in diverse legislation that has been brought in by the Minister, even where the arguments about vexatious claims or calculated delaying tactics do not apply, and we have moved in this direction in legislation over recent years.  If the workload or character of some of the issues coming before the Supreme Court is such that restructuring is necessary, it should take place but we should not be passing legislation that narrows the right to appeal.I take the point about the excision of the Attorney General, I was working on the Bill as initiated rather than as it has come through Committee Stage.  That is the right step and I welcome it but people will still have to go to the High Court for a decision on the making of an appeal and that is unnecessarily restrictive.

In page 13, to delete lines 23 to 27 and substitute the following:"(1B) For the purposes of subsection (1), where a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Sergeant states that he or she believes that a person may not be in the State, the statement is admissible as evidence that the person may not be in the State.".".This is a technical amendment.  Section 16 amends section 33 of the Act of 2003 which deals with the issue of the European arrest warrant by a court in the State.  The current text of section 33 requires the court to be satisfied that a person is not in the State before a European arrest warrant can be issued.  The section is being amended to allow the court to issue a European arrest warrant once satisfied that a domestic warrant exists for a person and that a member of the Garda Síochána believes that the person may not be in the State.  The purpose of this amendment is to align the text 16(d)(1)(b) of the Bill with that of 16(a)(1)(b) so that both provisions refer to the fact that the person may not be in the State.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	280	Perhaps the Minister might advise as to the burden of proof.  In the original text there is a definite requirement that the person not be in the State.  Certain levels of proof should be required.  Here the belief of the garda that the person is not in the State is accepted as evidence of the person not being in the State.  The Minister is reducing the burden considerably.  For a garda to say he or she may not be in the State will be admissible as evidence.  I would have thought a requirement to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the person was not in the State was more suitable.  The Minister is watering this down in the amendment to suggest that the person may not even be in the State.  I ask him to clarify the level of burden in terms of the evidence required.

The current text of section 33 requires the court to be satisfied that the person is not in the State.  We want to amend this to allow the court to issue a European arrest warrant once it is satisfied that a domestic warrant is in existence and a member of the Garda Síochána believes the person may not be in the State.

In page 21, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:"(5) Draft orders to be made under this section shall be brought by the Minister to the Select Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for the purposes of consultation and debate.".These amendments are to ensure that the Oireachtas Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, or whichever committee is dealing with justice issues, is allowed to debate and suggest amendments to draft orders or guidelines produced by the Minister under this section.There has been much debate about this section and some of the lobbies we have received are askew in their interpretation of this Bill.  However, there are issues which are not sufficiently clear in the legislation, which means there is doubt.  We are told some of the issues will be dealt with via orders or guidelines from the Minister.  Rather than leaving that to the Minister, we need to ensure there is democratic accountability and that Members of the Houses, and members of the committee in particular, have a say.  In this way we can ensure the points raised by those involved in gun clubs and similar are considered.Due to the major growth in gun culture, the industry that has developed in this area has been growing so fast it is getting out of hand.  However, there is an industry which employs people and has a legitimate sporting purpose and whose activities include paintballing and airsoft and so on.  Some people have invested considerable amounts of money in building up businesses based on the previous rules about firearms and they believe that if they do not have some input into the guidelines their businesses and opportunities will be at risk.Some gun lobbyists believe that all types of weapons should be legalised and that high-calibre weapons can be used for legitimate sporting purposes.  Our society should not go down the road of the US in terms of gun culture.  We have seen allegations in the newspapers about what has been happening in terms of the law being flouted and holes being picked in existing laws, so that we have Irish mercenaries training here and going abroad.  In one case it seems a person was fatally wounded.Gun clubs should be properly regulated and I welcome the relevant sections of the Bill in this regard.  However, this needs to be kept under review.  The Minister has an amendment in this regard, which is welcome to a degree, but all it does is ensure a report is obtained about the number and classes of certificates and authorisations issued under the Acts; it does not cover guidelines, orders and so on.  There is no guarantee that the orders or guidelines will come before the committee before they are issued to allow the committee a suitable role in liaising with those involved in legitimate sporting activities, farming groups that might be affected, and so on.  A proper committee structure should be built around this with reviews on an annual or biannual basis, or more frequently if the Minister is inclined to issue orders more often.  At least then Members with an interest in this field could give advice to the Minister and suggest changes that could make his orders or guidelines more workable.  That is the intention of these amendments.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I am inclined to agree with the principle of the amendment but perhaps most of what Deputy Ó Snodaigh has said will be covered by the annual review proposed by the Minister.  This debate has certainly shown that the area is extremely complex, not only in terms of legislation passed by the House but in terms of the significant number of statutory instruments attaching to the various Bills as well as the various decisions of the High Court.  We have legislation of a primary nature; we have legislation of a secondary nature, by way of regulation; and we have legal principles established by litigation in the courts.  There is a role for this House as the Chamber of Deputies in putting together a framework that is accessible and representative of the common good.I did not know until recently that such things as the licence fee were decided by way of regulation at the whim of the Minister and that we do not have an opportunity, either in committee or in the House, to pass comment either way.  I was surprised to learn of the varying categories of licence fee.  Up to recently the cost was €66 per gun and it is now €99 per gun per year.  This was introduced by way of regulation, the publication of which was minimalist.  We did not have any opportunity to query, question, authorise or approve it.  I ask the Minister where the money goes, because it certainly does not go towards the industry.People who are engaged in rural and country sporting pursuits, which is a long tradition here, did not have any opportunity to make worthwhile submissions.  Even where a submission is made, there is no onus on the Minister or regulatory authority to deal in any meaningful way with queries of a justifiable nature that may arise from time to time.  It is an expensive business but the State has put nothing back into the sport over the years.  For a rural sportsman engaged in hunting pursuits, there may well be a licensing charge of more than €500, which is a considerable sum.  There is also the issue of the potential for tourism arising from hunting and sporting pursuits in rural areas.  It is important that there be an arena for discussing regulations or draft orders, as referred to in the amendment, so that we have an opportunity from time to time to discuss these matters.We are dealing with a complex and detailed area of law, and this Bill will add further to that complexity.  It will be difficult for persons engaged in these pursuits and their advisers to deal in a comprehensive way with the existing legislation let alone any future changes.  As the previous speaker observed, regulations can be made at the drop of a hat.  This will make it difficult for people to plan for and invest in the sport.  It is important that there be a measure of accountability in this regard.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	287	The case for these amendments has been well made.  It is very reasonable and I see no reason it should be resisted.  What is proposed in these amendments is somewhat nuanced and different from the annual review promised by the Minister.  We have put through much legislation in this area in recent years, a good deal of it under the chairmanship of the Acting Chairman.  It would be interesting to have time to review its performance and to discover how frequently resort has been had to new measures which we were told at the time were absolutely urgent and essential.  For a small country, we are becoming more centralised and bureaucratic.There is an attachment not only in rural Ireland but among many urban dwellers to the sports to which Deputy Flanagan referred.  Given that the circumstances leading to the 1972 ban no longer hang over us, there is no reason that we should not have regard to the arguments advanced.  I support the reasonable case made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh for these amendments.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	288	We are all agreed that this is an extremely complex area of legislation.  As such, the minutiae of which gun qualifies under one category or another for certification and licensing are best left to statutory instruments.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh is proposing in these amendments that all such statutory instruments must be discussed in committee prior to their implementation.  There would be great practical difficulties in such an approach.  There are already frequent complaints from the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights that there is insufficient time to examine proposals laid before it.  It is one of the busiest committees in the House.  I am not sure there would be great support for the proposition that every statutory instrument in this area, let alone across the broader spectrum of justice, must be discussed before being implemented.The best solution is the one recommended by Deputy Flanagan in his amendment No. 9, which I am taking on board via my amendment No. 10.  This provides for an annual review of the operation of the legislation which will provide Deputies with an opportunity to raise issues of concern to them, including the question of fees.  I am not sure where Deputy Flanagan received his information regarding an apparent licence fee of €99 per year.  There is no such charge.  This legislation provides for a three-year licence, but for some three months running up to the renewal date, people will be able to avail of their new licence free of charge.  This is being done to allow for the bedding down of the new regime and in recognition of the more than 200,000 licences already in operation.  The changes will be made on a graduated basis to manage the workload.  There will be one fee for the new three-year licence.For the reasons outlined, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 7 and 8.  However, I accept the spirit of amendment No. 9, the substance of which is addressed by my amendment No. 10.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	289	We should discuss amendments Nos. 9 and 10 in conjunction with amendments Nos. 7 and 8 because they are all related.  I would be inclined to withdraw my amendments if I could be confident that the proposed annual review of the operation of this legislation will deal with more than just the number and classes of certificates.  Such a review should also allow for examination of any issues arising from new guidelines or draft orders issued by the Minister.I have proposed that draft orders and draft guidelines be examined in committee.  Those involved in these pursuits should be allowed an opportunity to influence developments or at least to have their say in terms of what changes are coming in future.  It is a complex area and it makes sense that we should take into account practical advice as to whether particular guidelines or orders will be feasible in practice.  In the case of previous legislation, for example, we saw that one of the provisions, relating to refilling bullets and the use of home-made bullets, was never triggered because it was clearly impractical.The growing popularity of activities such as paintballing and airsoft makes them a significant tourist attraction.  Those operations have invested substantial sums in insuring their properties and businesses and investing in equipment.  The groups I met, which I presume also lobbied other Members, were not satisfied with the time they had to prepare for these measures and to put forward their suggestions on the operation of gun licensing.  The Minister has in the main produced a good Bill, but I am concerned that orders and guidelines he issues in future may not receive the detailed scrutiny they deserve before being implemented.

Only certain issues can be addressed in the legislation and detailed background guidelines are required to ensure people fully understand its implications on a case by case basis.  The guidelines were compiled by the firearms policy unit of the Garda Síochána in conjunction with the firearms consultative panel.  I can send a copy of the guidelines to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights shortly after they are published by the Garda Commissioner to give Members an opportunity to examine them.The Bill is urgent and must be enacted in mid-July to facilitate implementation of the remaining sections of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, under which a three-year firearms licence will be introduced.  Under this new legislation, provision will be made for a transition phase during which time all licences which are due to expire on 31 July will be extended.  The extension will be for a minimum of three months up to a maximum of 12 months, from 1 November at the earliest until 31 July 2010 at the latest.  The extensions will be assigned on a random basis to facilitate the phasing in of the new three-year firearms licence and will ensure all licences will not expire on the same date in future.  On the enactment of the Bill, the Garda Commissioner will write to each licence holder and outline the period for which the licence has been extended.  Given that there are approximately 230,000 such licences, this will be a major undertaking.

I note the content of amendment No. 10 in the Minister's name and propose to withdraw my amendment in its favour.Deputy Ó Snodaigh made a good point.  I ask the Minister to discuss the amendment with the Garda Commissioner because it will not be sufficient for the Commissioner to produce an annual review consisting of a half-page sheet produced in purely statistical format.  The Commissioner's annual review should amount to more than a chart showing a compilation of statistics.  If the Minister indicates what he believes such a review will comprise, we can reach agreement on the matter.  The review should debate the issues, discuss the weaknesses of the law and where further changes are required and the areas in which the Commissioner and the Minister would like to see further changes.  It should not be confined to a set of statistics.

I propose to cite an example to highlight the effects of these provisions.  The Minister or his officials will have received a torrent of correspondence from those engaged in the airsoft sport.  I did not know what the sport entailed, but its representatives explained it to me in their own terms when they visited me.  They are terrified by sections 9G and 9H which I suspect we will not reach.  These sections essentially provide that, on the word of the Garda Commissioner, sales of certain realistic initiation firearms would be restricted from a specified date.  The representative groups argue that if there is a sudden outbreak of public frenzy, as occurs from time to time, and pressure were to be exerted on the Minister to shut down the airsoft sport, it would have calamitous implications for those who earn their living from the airsoft sport because of the significant time lag between the importation of these types of firearms and their sale and disposal in this jurisdiction.  They could be left with an expensive consignment on the high seas if the sport were to be shut down, as the representatives graphically put it, after one Joe Duffy show.  Can the Minister give any assurance to the people concerned?  While the Bill provides for an annual review, does the Minister envisage circumstances in which the fear of this group would be realised and the sport shut down on a whim, leaving them holding the baby, so to speak, or does he regard this fear as a misapprehension and without foundation?  I am informed airsoft is a growing sport.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	296	An amendment has not been tabled on this issue.  It is necessary to include the relevant provisions because the number of those engaged in airsoft has dramatically increased, as have the numbers and types of airsoft guns.  It is not uncommon for people to have weaponry which, to all intents and purposes, are imitation weapons.  While I accept that people use these weapons in a sport, if this weaponry proliferates to the extent that it is readily available throughout the country, the security forces will have justifiable concerns.  In a combat scenario, for example, a bank robbery, it will be difficult to ascertain whether a gun is a real or imitation weapon.The power to which the Deputy referred is necessary to ensure that if the position gets out of hand, the legislation may be applied in such a way as to ensure restrictions are imposed on the sale of the weapons in question.  In a recent well publicised incident in my constituency children were using these types of guns to shoot and maim dogs.There is anecdotal evidence that some of these imitation weapons are being adapted with stronger spring mechanisms which could inflict serious or lethal injuries on animals or people.  Considerable attention will be paid to this area for the simple reason that restrictions are needed to ensure these weapons are used solely for sporting purposes.  In light of the strong advice I have received from gardaí and my officials, as well as the anecdotal evidence presented by a number of Deputies, we should proceed carefully.I would welcome annual reviews of the legislation because I do not doubt other Members share my unease at the increasing number of these weapons.  One would need to be an expert to recognise some of them as imitations rather than real weapons.

A regime could be put in place for the forensic testing of guns.  By making annual or triannual tests a condition for licence renewals, one could determine whether a gun has been adapted.  A regulation could be introduced requiring imitation firearms, and airsoft guns in particular, to be painted a different colour from genuine firearms.  They could, for example, be painted pink or blue.  If the guidelines or the draft orders were brought before us, we would be able to discuss these issues.  GPS tracking systems could be installed in guns, although practical difficulties arise with some types of weapon.  These measures could at least prevent weapons from falling into the hands of children.  Airsoft and paintball guns could carry the same restrictions as other weapons in terms of secure storage.We need to take on board the concerns expressed by those who have invested in the industry while also being mindful of the dangers to which the Minister referred.  Several of my constituents who are involved in airsoft activities have spoken to me about people who have invested substantial amounts of money because they were not aware of the restrictions being introduced in this Bill.  Perhaps they should have investigated further, however.I welcome these amendments but I want to ensure that the annual reports laid before the House are discussed by the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  Many reports are simply sent to the Oireachtas Library without receiving the discussion they deserve.  Interested parties would be able to make submissions to the committee in advance of a review.

In page 23, line 50, after "shooting" to insert the following:"save and except any firearm used for legitimate and controlled sporting purposes as may be specified in Regulations".Members will recall our debate on Committee Stage regarding the Minister's intention to ban handguns.  Amendment No. 11 would preserve the ability to hold a handgun or other firearm used for legitimate and controlled sporting purposes.  Since our Committee Stage deliberations, I received correspondence from the president of the world governing body of IPSC which arises specifically out of comments made by the Minister.  The president states:I have been following the emergence of efforts to ban the ownership and use of firearms in Ireland with the exception of those used to compete in the Olympic shooting sports.  The proposal is using the sport of IPSC shooting, which is not an Olympic sport, to draw a line between those shooting sports that are acceptable and those that are not.Based on what I have read in the newspapers and followed in debate during a meeting of the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights on June 18th, it is necessary and critical that facts about IPSC shooting be known.By way of background, the International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC) was founded as a shooting sport in 1976 and recognized as a sport in over 80 countries...IPSC is an international sport, emphasizing safety and safe gun handling, accuracy, power, and speed, in high-level competitions around the world.Although the early beginnings of IPSC were martial in origin, the sport developed just as karate, fencing, and archery had developed from their martial origins into well known, internationally recognized sports.  As a point of fact, many Olympic sports today have their origins in military training exercises including the Olympic equestrian sports of dressage and eventing, and the Olympic Biathlon of skiing and target shooting, and like these sports IPSC is a civilian target shooting sport.I noticed with interest that the term "extreme sport" was used many times to describe IPSC shooting.  I believe it would have been invaluable to the discussion to have a firm understanding of the term "extreme sport" and what kinds of sport define the term.Generally speaking, "extreme sports" is a media term for certain activities perceived as having a high level of inherent risk and danger.  IPSC as the internationally governing body does not allow or condone the promotion of IPSC as "extreme sport" because IPSC does not fall within the definition of that term, nor does it in the minds of promoters and marketers of extreme sports.IPSC has an exemplary safety record and incidents of injuries are so rare as to be less than what is recorded for any Olympic sport let alone any non Olympic sport...Arguments for banning non-Olympic firearms make a sharp distinction between stationary targets and moving targets harkening to Olympic level shooting of stationary targets as the only acceptable shooting that should be allowed.  I draw attention to the sports of skeet, trap, and sporting clay shooting wherein the targets indeed move.  IPSC competitors do have some moving targets, but they are designed to ensure a 0% margin of error in safety and the vast majority of targets are in fact stationary.I would also like to set the record straight about remarks that IPSC creates settings that are combat based such as home invasions or hostage scenarios.  These are simply and boldly a misstatement of the facts.  The IPSC does not allow any element of a competition to create such scenarios.  Further, the use of humanoid targets is banned.The suggestion that air pistols and paintball guns should be substituted for the firearms appears to contradict other statements that IPSC shooting itself trains combatants. It defies logic that air pistols and paintball guns are acceptable even though they could just as effectively serve as criminal training tools.  This statement is made only to illustrate that it has no relevance because IPSC is a recognized lawful, civilian sport recognized as such around the world.I wanted read that letter in the context of the debate.  Having regard to the fact that our debating time is unduly restricted, we may not have the opportunity to engage in the type of detail that is necessary in dealing with this issue.  I say that as someone who does not have any experience in this area of sporting pursuit.  I do not believe there is any large gulf between what the Minister is trying to do and what Members would wish him to do in this respect.  I plead with him, however, not to be so restrictive in his regulations as to ban sporting pursuits that have not only been pursued here but are internationally accepted as sports and involve international competitions of some repute.  I am anxious to promote the amendment and trust that whatever regulations the Minister intends to introduce, as he has indicated he will, there will be an exemption or exception in respect of legitimate sporting pursuits of a controlled nature.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I am minded to support Deputy Charles Flanagan's amendment.  Amendment No. 12 in my name is framed differently and is aimed at roughly the same purpose.  We have a big problem with guns in our society.  We have seen an increase in the number of unlawful killings with people being murdered as a result of gangland feuding, which is profoundly disturbing.  We have even seen innocent bystanders being caught up in the mayhem that is going on in gangland crime.  They lost their lives even though they had no association with the criminal fraternity.I do not envy the Minister's task in seeking to provide for the safety of our citizens.  It seems to me, however, that the outright ban on practice shooting is a different issue.  We have a problem with guns in Ireland, but it is one that concerns illegal firearms.  It would appear that there is no great difficulty in importing guns illegally into this jurisdiction.  In addition, there is no great impediment for the criminal fraternity to access illegal guns.  I wonder therefore if the appropriate reaction to that problem is to clamp down on sporting handguns and sporting clubs, effectively putting a certain kind of sporting endeavour out of business.Deputy Charles Flanagan put that letter on the record, but the Minister will know that we received a detailed document, which I presume he also got, rebutting claims and assertions by the Minister on the last occasion.  The document goes through the matter in great detail.  It is immensely regrettable that we do not have sufficient time to deal with this legislation.  Although we are only dealing with an early section of the Bill, it looks like this will be the last amendment to be debated.  I do not have time to go into the document we received, which challenges assertions made by the Minister.  It also challenges some of the opinions on which the Minister relied on the last occasion.Why is the Minister so focused on this objective in the Bill?  I listened carefully to what he said on Committee Stage.  I also listened to the interaction in the House, yet I am still somewhat in the dark as to why this has such a high priority for the Minister.  The only conclusion I can come to is not that these clubs are not strictly and rigorously supervised, regulated and licensed, and that great care is taken with the weapons, but that the Minister fears some people may be taken aboard by some of these clubs who will use them for training purposes and will subsequently use the skills garnered for nefarious purposes.  That is the best shot I have been able to make at what we are talking about.  A fair amount of opaque language has been used, as well as dramatic assertions and reliance on the opinion of people in other related sports criticising this one.  The impression I have formed is that the Minister fears a person could join one of these clubs and become skilled in the use of firearms and subsequently use those skills for anti-societal purposes.  If that is so, I share the Minister's concern, and I acknowledge why he would be thus concerned.  That is why I have framed my amendments the way I have, to leave the Minister the power in making regulations to ensure that in the matter of vetting prospective members of such clubs, the necessary care is taken so that kind of person is not granted admission.  That is a more reasonable approach than taking the drastic action of shutting down entirely the particular sport that has been at the sharp edge of the debate on this section.Will the Minister reconsider the extreme position he has taken up to now, given the information furnished to him and the arguments advanced in the House so far?
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	303	Perhaps the Minister has changed his view.  Many members of the public and of this House believe the Minister's measure is good because there is a public perception that it is a good measure, but it is not a good measure.  Satisfying public perception should not be a basis for public policy.  The proposal put forward by the Minister targets legitimate users of firearms, rather than criminals.  We have a case where a scumbag murders a completely innocent individual, and all of a sudden several thousand innocent people are penalised.  I challenge the Minister to provide any research that shows a correlation between the increase in legitimately held hand guns and any increase in their use in crime.There is much research from those in favour and those against gun use.  They can paint whatever picture they want, but it is important that the Minister produces research to show that there is a correlation.  I do not believe there is.  The real reason for crime and the use of guns in crime is social deprivation.  Bringing in such a measure will not only not address the problem, it will assist in distorting the reasons we have crime.  The public perception will be that we have taken a measure that will assist in dealing with crime, even though we have not addressed the social deprivation issues.  We would be far better off if we talked about putting in additional classroom assistants to address the issue of dyslexia, rather than banning hand guns.  This decision is wrong and I hope the Minister has the courage to reverse it.  When guns were banned after the Dunblane massacre in Scotland, the use of handguns in crime increased over the next few years.I support this amendment.  I do not believe innocent people should be penalised to satisfy public perception, and this section will do nothing to address the difficulties with crime.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	304	We had no legalised handguns here until 2004.  The former Minister for Justice, Des O'Malley, banned hand guns in the early 1970s, so there were no legalised hand guns here for more than 30 years.  As a result of a series of High Court decisions, the number of hand guns increased since 2004 to about 1,800 today.  The decision in 2004 centred around the suitability of the person rather than the suitability of the gun.  The judgment given in the case meant that if Deputy Timmins got a licence and was found to be a suitable person to carry a firearm, he would be entitled to have a small pistol, an AK 47, a Biretta, a Magnum or a Glock.We had to do something about this.  Judge Charelton stated in a case that it may be that the proliferation of pistols and high calibre rifles has not been noticed and that no general policy of permission for the private use or possession of hand guns is being pursued.  He went on to state that a reasonable person would be entitled to feel alarmed at the increase in the number of handguns.  I took my lead from that.  I did not make the connection between illegal handguns and crime with what I am endeavouring to do, which is responding to the direction given by a High Court judge.  God forbid, if something like that which occurred in Dunblane happened here and we had done nothing about it having been warned by Judge Peter Charelton, then we would have had to answer why we did nothing to respond to a High Court decision on a challenge against the licensing regime at that time.I accept that 99.9% of the people who carry firearms here are excellent people.  We have been very lucky with the people we have in the gun clubs here, and I have been assured by the Garda Síochána and by my staff, who have experience in this area.  Unfortunately, in recent years since 2004 there has been a desire to bring legalised hand guns into this country.  I have asked the Garda Commissioner and every senior garda whether this is the right way to go and whether we should allow hand guns.  They all say "absolutely not".  One of the main reasons is due to ease of concealment of these hand guns.When there are 1,800 licences here, we obviously have to address that.  This legislation will allow people to continue to have a licence for a hand gun, but on a much more restricted basis.  It will exclude quite a number of existing hand guns that people legally possess at the moment.  Many of them have Glock pistols, Magnums and other guns that would never be included in sport, no matter how sport is defined.The effect of what the Deputies are trying to do is to legalise practical shooting.  The definition of practical shooting, according to the US Practical Shooting Association, is that "shooters take on obstacle-laden shooting courses — called stages — requiring anywhere from six to 30 plus shots to complete. The scoring system measures points scored per second, then weights the score to compensate for the number of shots fired."  Somebody here referred to extreme sport, and the USPSA states "If shooting has an "extreme" sport.... practical shooting is it."I know that Deputies have been inundated with representations since I originally stated that it was my intention to severely curtail  hand guns.  To be fair to organisations that had difficulties with this legislation, they have made it quite clear that they do not wish to have practical shooting or dynamic shooting, which effectively mimics combat.  They do not want to have this in the country.  Des Crofton is the director of the National Association of Regional Game Councils, representing 28,000 gun licence holders in the country.  We asked for the association's view on practical shooting, and he sent a letter to us on 25 June and it stated the following:One of the matters discussed is the issue of practical and dynamic shooting.  I wish to confirm that the associations in attendance at the meeting in December 2008 unanimously decided that practical pistol shooting was a cause of serious damage to the reputation of traditional shooting, as practised by Irish shooters heretofore, and was giving an undeserved bad impression of competitive pistol shooting generally.  The associations present also unanimously determined that with immediate effect, none of them would approve of or support practical pistol shooting.  This was the position then and to my certain knowledge, that remains the position today, as none of the associations in attendance at that meeting have given any indication that they have changed their position.. . .Even today, I have received emails from both the NTSA and the NASRPC, both of which reiterate their previously stated opposition to practical shooting...However, I am concerned to hear that the impression has been given to some politicians that practical shooting enjoys support from some of the organisations or associations which met in Leixlip last December.The Shooting Sports Association of Ireland representative wrote a letter in which he stated:I am well aware of the Minister's concern with practical or dynamic shooting, and I give a personal assurance that they will be neither promoted nor condoned by any of the 35 or so affiliated clubs and ranges.  I welcome the majority of the steps in the legislation, and in particular, the co-operation of the Department of Justice and the work of the Garda unit.  I take on board the stance regarding practical or dynamic shooting styles, and I accept that fully.  It will not be part of shooting in Ireland.Under this legislation, the State will take over the process of certifying and insuring shooting ranges.  The State Claims Agency has been asked to give its view in this regard.  It has stated that on no account should the State be involved in any way in indemnifying any range which participates in practical shooting.  On Committee Stage I read the opinion the assistant commissioner, Mr. Walter Rice, had given on practical shooting and it is important to do so again in order that people will be under no illusion about what we are talking.  He said practical pistol shooting or new activities which mimiced combat or confrontational shooting scenarios were developed as a more realistic training method for military and police personnel and that shooting at human shaped targets would not be considered as legitimate firearm use or possession.  Therefore, if engaging in such practice was considered as a legitimate reason for possessing or using weapons, there would be concerns that this type of shooting could be seen as a way of training individuals in the use of these weapons with a view to engaging in criminal actions.  He went on to recommend that practical shooting which clearly could be compared to combat shooting, not target shooting, be removed and banned as this type of training in weapons use was not legitimate and could be utilised by criminal elements.  I cannot add further to this.I came at this issue afresh.  It is not a sport in which I wish to participate.  Deputies in the House probably do not realise what is happening in practical shooting.  While people would have been brought to some ranges, they would not have engaged in the practical shooting at issue here.The International Practical Shooting Confederation was mentioned.  The Department has monitored with concern the development of the IPSC which organises competitions in which people shoot their way through multi-stage target courses based on real life combat scenarios.  From a cursory look at the Internet one will see that these activities are marketed as being at the extreme end of handgun sport.The Garda Síochána and the reputable representative bodies of those engaged in firearm shooting, including handgun shooting, are against this.  The Deputies in the House perhaps do not realise what is involved.  I have heard the argument that it is a sport; it is not.  The evidence our people and the Garda have received about what has been going on in a number of practical shooting ranges indicates that it amounts to nothing other than a mimicking of combat style shooting.  I strongly urge Deputy Flanagan to desist from pressing the amendment.

The difficulty I have is that the guns about which we are talking have been licensed.  While the Minister has given some explanation of his knowledge of and anxiety about this matter, the difficulty I have is that very little is done about the guns which are held illegally.  Only last week the Ulster Bank branch in Cootehill was raided and some of my best friends were held up.I refer to the drugs brought into the country.  Guns are brought in with them.  I hope the Minister will take an active a role in ensuring these guns are dealt with.  We heard one of his predecessors, former Deputy Michael McDowell, talk about a gun amnesty, a condition of which was that one had to say what was done with the gun and from where it had come.  If we want to control guns, this is a strange way to go about it.

Instead of an outright ban, I suggest the Minister introduce a capped number of licences which could be monitored and reviewed each year in line with the amendment we considered earlier.The outright ban on bull's eye shooting as a legitimate target sport is over-restrictive and an over-reaction.  The Minister is using the argument about extreme sports and the darker side without adducing sufficient evidence to bolster his claim.  In so doing, he is denying legitimate static target shooting enthusiasts an opportunity to continue the sport which is accepted internationally.I regret we do not have sufficient time left, as this is an important amendment.  Representations were made to many Government back benchers whom I would like to give an opportunity to pass through the lobbies on the issue.

When I explained the reality of dynamic practical shooting, they fully accepted the position.  It is as I said and nothing else.  As people knew this legislation was coming up, they tended to ease off.  There is a desire to operate on that basis and I cannot concede on the issue.  As I said, I do not wish to move against those persons who are genuine in their participation in a sport, not something which, in certain circumstances, is operated as a business in terms of training in the use of very serious weapons.  I suggest Deputy Flanagan does not understand what is involved and is taking on board exactly what people are telling him.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	327	As the Deputy will be aware, on last Thursday, 18 June, the inspectorate of the Department of Education and Science published a whole school evaluation report on the school referred to in his question.  The evaluation described the quality of educational provision at the school as highly unsatisfactory.  I have expressed my clear concern about the serious weaknesses that were identified in the report, including poor teaching and learning, inadequacies in child protection policies and unacceptable standards in the general management of the school.As part of the whole school evaluation process, the inspectors who conducted the evaluation have made detailed recommendations and have directly advised the school authorities and staff of the improvements the school must undertake.  In light of the seriousness of the weaknesses evident in the school, senior officials from the Department have met the patron of the school and the chairperson of the school's board of management on a number of occasions to impress on them the need for change and improvement in the operation of the school.  The representatives of the school have accepted the report's findings and recommendations.  The patron has confirmed that steps have been taken and progress has been made in respect of a number of the report's recommendations.  Officials from the Department will hold further meetings with the school authorities to ensure all the issues raised in the report are addressed.  Departmental inspectors will continue to visit the school in the next school year to monitor progress and provide advice as appropriate.The Department of Education and Science has engaged frequently with the school in question since 2003, when concerns were identified by the departmental inspectorate and other concerns were brought to the Department's attention.  The school has been visited several times each year.  Extensive advice, support and guidance have been provided to staff and principals of the school and the chairpersons of its board of management.  This action was supported by other officials in the Department, who engaged with the management of the school to insist on improvements being acted upon.  Some progress was achieved at the school, especially in the 2005-06 school year when a newly-appointed principal, supported by the local inspector, implemented several improvements.  These improvements were not supported by the then school management, regrettably, and the principal left the school.At this point, inspectors and departmental officials met representatives of the management of the school to insist on improvements being made and regulations adhered to.  The inspectors continued to monitor the work of the school.  A new board of management and chairperson were appointed by the school's patron in January 2008.  The whole school evaluation was another step by the inspectorate to assess the improvements being acted on and set the agenda for change in the future.  I assure the Deputy that my officials will continue to engage closely with the patron and the board.  The quality of the school's work will be monitored through inspection visits during the coming school year.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Is the Minister not utterly embarrassed by the fact that the Department of Education and Science, over a period of five years, chose to do nothing while this school was in crisis?  Is he not utterly embarrassed by the fact that nothing was done about these problems, even though they were flagged by the Department's inspectorate and the Irish National Teachers Organisation as long ago as 2003, 2004 and 2005?  The entire teaching staff of the school resigned en bloc because of the crisis the school found itself in.  Does this not highlight the utterly dysfunctional hands-off approach of the Minister and the Department, which failed to intervene at a much earlier stage in this school and possibly in other schools throughout the country?Does the Minister accept that it took five years for the Department to introduce new measures in the school to ensure that its children are protected and, more importantly, receive the same standard of education we would expect to be given to any other child in the country?  Does he accept that an utter disaster befell the school in question because of his failures and those of the Department of Education and Science?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	329	The first thing I want to put on the record is that I accept that there have been difficulties in this school since 2003 or 2004.  I accept that the inspectorate was aware of the difficulties in the school.  I do not accept that the inspectors were not working with the board of management, the principal and others within the school to ensure that an improvement is brought about.  One does not want to close a school.  We prefer to provide supports for the school to bring about improvements and work in partnership with both the principal and the board of management.The Deputy will understand and accept that in 2005, for instance, the school having been visited on a number of occasions, it was indicated to the board of management and the chairman in particular that he was to put a proper scheme in place in line with every other national school in the country — and a principal was then appointed to that school who identified areas where improvements should be made and tried to introduce them.  Unfortunately, this principal left the school after about 12 months.  We then took it over under the whole-school evaluation system.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	330	Will the Minister confirm to the House that the chairman of the board of management in question was also the person who represented the Islamic education board, which is the patron body for two schools in this country?  In that context, will he confirm to the House that in 2007 his Department withdrew funding to the Islamic education board, because in his own words, concerns were raised in relation to the operation and representation of that organisation as a primary management body?  Will he outline what exactly the concerns of his Department were that led to this very dramatic and unprecedented step of effectively refusing to fund one of the seven patron bodies in this country?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	331	There are two issues here.  One is the payment that is made to the patron body of the particular group or organisation such as that made to Catholic or Protestant representative bodies.  This Islamic education board indicated that it was the patron body for Muslim schools.  The imam withdrew recognition of this group as a patron of Muslim schools.  In those circumstances the Department withdrew the funding on the basis that it was not the imam's recognised patron.  Those were the circumstances in which this grant was withdrawn.  As the Deputy knows, a proper board of management is now in place.  The imam has appointed a new board, which has accepted the full recommendations in the whole-school evaluation.  The board has advertised for a principal and we are working very closely with it to ensure that the children who attend the school will have a proper education system in place for them.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	332	Is it the case that the Minister has audited accounts for the patron body in question?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	333	The Minister has audited accounts for 2008, as supplied by the present board of management.  We have a commitment from the board and are working with its accountants on the furnishing of audited accounts for the previous years.On a point of clarification, I should point out to the Deputy that there are and could be legal difficulties in some of the issues pertaining to the previous board.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	334	The Minister better believe it.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	335	My Department is progressing work to improve systems within the Department to facilitate access to accurate and up-to-date information on individual schools to ensure more efficient use of official time and to reduce the administrative burden on schools.The Department began the process of rationalising internal databases several years ago.  The aim is to have one central data holding for core information on schools, teachers and pupils.  It is intended that all new and existing systems will eventually pull information from this centralised database.  In 2007, the first element of the new central database was introduced and involved  the rationalisation and standardisation of certain core information about schools.  The benefits of this approach are clear and mean that by keeping only one primary source of school information all staff in the Department have immediate access to the same accurate information.While this work was being progressed, priority also had to be given to developing an on-line claims system for schools, OLCS.  The OLCS is now being used in 3,800 schools around the country and has created significant administrative efficiencies for the Department and individual schools.  Other developments include the introduction of geographic information technology which has greatly improved the capacity of the Department to identify the location and quantity of new school accommodation needed to cater for population increases.Like any organisation, the level of progress will depend on available financial, human and IT resources and how they will need to be deployed given emerging priorities and wider public finance constraints.  With regard to implementation of the Cromien report, a programme of structural reform of the Department was approved by Government in 2001.  The main elements of this programme were the establishment of the State Examinations Commission and the National Council for Special Education, the establishment of regional offices and the transfer of the institutes of technology to the Higher Education Authority.In addition to the reforms approved by Government, the reform of the Department included regulatory reform and appellate processes to underpin key allocation functions, along with the implementation of efficiency measures designed to bring the Department's procedures and processes more into line with modern administrative practice.  A range of measures have been introduced since 2001.Other recommendations are in course of implementation and some recommendations are not being implemented at the current time or have been overtaken by events.

Such data would be contained in electronic format such as that carried by most kids on their mobiles, as a standard instrument.Can he explain why, at this time, after the recommendations of the Cromien report his Department has not got any of that?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I can only respond to the Deputy to the effect that any of the information or tabulations he has required have been presented to him.  I can think back to the projection on enrolments 2008-30, the details on pre-fab locations in primary schools and details on primary schools in the ownership of the Minister for Education and Science.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	342	That is a very good question, as regards the details——
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	343	The Deputy has asked me a question and I should like to be allowed the opportunity to reply to it.Deputy Quinn is a former Minister for Finance, a very responsible position and I have always said he did an excellent job.  At that time, as a Deputy who served in Government with him, I recall Deputy Quinn asking various Departments to prioritise.  In this instance, looking back on the Cromien report, can Deputy Quinn say that the decision to set up the examination commission was a bad one?  Can he not say that the position we took by setting up and putting in place the special education commission was a good one?  Does he believe that all of the important outstanding items mentioned by Cromien have been put in place?  The Deputy has a difficulty with one issue.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	344	No, I have not.  There were 98 recommendations in Cromien in 2000.  How many have been implemented?  What is the number?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I cannot——

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	348	It is not.  I have asked the question before.  The Minister has no clue.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	349	On the Cromien report and the information Deputy Quinn seeks on the ownership of schools, my Department undertook a pilot in Kildare.  It cost €1 million to implement.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	350	The Minister is worse than I thought he was.  It is like the voting machines — a sum of €1 million.

That is what the Department did and rightly so, and we stand over it.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	352	The Minister is even more incompetent than I thought.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	353	On the morning of 3 June 2009 a superintendent distributed in error the leaving certificate English paper 2 which was scheduled for the following morning, 4 June.  When he realised his error he immediately retrieved the incorrect papers and distributed the correct papers.  The State Examinations Commission was notified of the problem at exactly 3.55 p.m. by the principal of the school.  The commission immediately took steps to establish whether the contents of the paper had become known and security compromised.  My Department was notified of the position at approximately 5 p.m. that day.The commission concluded from its investigation that the integrity of the English paper 2 examination had been significantly compromised.  As the commission could not guarantee that the correct supply of contingency papers would be delivered to 100% of the over 2,000 leaving certificate examination centres by 9 a.m. the next day, there was no option but to re-schedule the  paper.  The examination was rescheduled and held on Saturday, 6 June.The core responsibility of superintendents is to safeguard the security and integrity of the examination papers.  They are provided with detailed instructions to assist them in the discharge of their duties.  Support and training is provided for any superintendents who have not engaged in this work before.  There are clear and comprehensive documented procedures to be gone through to ensure the correct paper is distributed for each session of the examination process.  In this case, none of the documented procedures were carried out correctly by the superintendent.I asked the State Examinations Commission to investigate the matter fully, to report on the circumstances that required the rescheduling of the exam and the measures needed to address any weaknesses identified and to minimise the risk of any future recurrence.  I am due to receive the report tomorrow.  I will arrange to have the report placed on my Department's website when I have had the opportunity to consider its contents.I fully appreciate that the re-scheduling of the examination, although unavoidable, gave rise to distress and inconvenience for students.  Both the commission and I have apologised to students and their families in media broadcasts for the inconvenience caused.  I take this opportunity to apologise again for what was a stressful disruption in the examination process.  In addition, I thank school management, principals and staff, and Bus Éireann and school transport providers for their excellent co-operation and organisation, which ensured the re-scheduled examination ran smoothly.  I particularly thank the school principals whose support was assumed and was, most generously, given.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	354	From the Minister's reply I take it that he is to receive the report tomorrow.  How convenient that is when we are debating it in the Houses of the Oireachtas today.  This is another fine mess which happened on the Minister's watch.  It is easy in this case to make the superintendent the fall guy for another systems failure in the commission or the Department.  We must be the only country in the western world where a problem such as this arises in one examination centre and the entire system is knocked out for every other student sitting their leaving certificate examination.  If anything describes the dysfunctional nature of the Minister's Department it is this.Is the Minister telling this House that had the information from the supervisor been given to the examination commission earlier, contingency papers would have been arranged and provided for in all the examination centres?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	355	Yes.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	356	So the fault lies at his door and nobody else's.  Did the Minister also say his Department became aware of this a good two hours after this problem emerged?  I find it astonishing, given that the leaving certificate is the big deal for the Department of Education and Science annually, that the Department would know of this two hours after it emerged and that proper procedures were not put in place.  What is the cost of this monumental cock-up?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	357	The principal of the school contacted the State Examinations Commission at approximately 3.50 p.m. or 3.55 p.m.  The Department of Education and Science was contacted at approximately 5 p.m.  Every year there are hoax calls into the commission indicating that some paper has been compromised and an evaluation must be carried out to check to see what exactly has happened.  In this case the commission carried out an evaluation and was satisfied from the information available that this paper had been compromised.  In the circumstances the Secretary General of the Department was contacted and I was contacted as a result.We examined how we might get the papers out in time for the next examination the following morning at 9 a.m.  We were in touch with An Post and all the bodies that might make this possible.  It became apparent that a 100% guarantee of delivery by 9 a.m. the following morning could not be agreed.  In the circumstances we decided on the next best option, the Saturday morning.  This made it difficult for students and parents, and the commission apologised for the inconvenience caused.  I also apologised.  We are delighted the examination went off without a difficulty.  All centres had papers and the examination was conducted in a professional manner.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	358	While the Minister might be delighted by that, I suspect the students did not feel delight.  The Minister said he will receive the report tomorrow.  Will he make it public?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I already indicated I would.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	360	So we will get a chance to see it tomorrow.  What is the cost of this mistake?  Why was the paper in the hall in the first place, given the clear procedures set out for security for superintendents?  This is the fundamental question which needs to be asked, and it may come out of the report the Minster will receive today or tomorrow.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	361	The papers are held in a safe and are clearly annotated and marked.  There is a process by which the superintendent of the examination collects the relevant paper and has it co-signed by two students who will identify that the examination paper has not been tampered with and opened.  Those two students will sign that paper.  There was in this case a further note in the envelope indicating that a second English paper was due the following morning.I must wait for the report on this but it would appear that due diligence was not acted on in this instance.  No matter what we say, in all these matters there is human failing.  Human failing was involved here.  It is not my business to make the superintendent a fall guy because the superintendents are employed directly by an independent body, the State Examinations Commission, and it is a matter for it to deal with what arises from the failures there.  I will examine the report and any recommendations in it.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The cost will be more than €1 million.  We still have not received all the cost implications from Bus Éireann and a number of other sources.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	364	The list of acceptable qualifications for home tuition providers has not been changed.  The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for preschool children with autism.  The home-based July provision scheme provides funding for an extended school year for children with autism or a severe or profound general learning disability.  The scheme is intended to provide education appropriate to the child's educational needs.The Deputy will also appreciate that as home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are qualified to give education to the children concerned.  It is reasonable to expect that a person, providing an education to a child in the child's home outside of the normal school structure, is fully qualified.Some parents had advised of difficulties in sourcing fully qualified teachers.  The Department therefore has allowed for other qualifications.  However, the guidelines to the scheme have in recent years advised of my Department's preference for a fully qualified teacher.  In this school year, the home tuition, and more recently the July provision, application forms were amended in format and additional text was added to clearly state the Department's preference for a fully qualified teacher.I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department has continued to sanction alternative tuition providers where parents have shown that they were unable to source a fully qualified teacher.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	365	Is the Minister of State suggesting that a person recently qualified from teacher training college with a BEd is more qualified to teach a preschool child who may be non-verbal and autistic than somebody with a diploma or degree in early child care studies who might be a qualified social worker with qualification in PECS, ABA, early childhood studies, Lámh and perhaps child protection?  I draw the attention of the Minister of State to a letter sent in respect of such a person who is not a qualified person but who has eight years' experience.  The letter pointed out that this tutor would not be eligible to deliver the tuition next year.  Appendix A to the home-based July provision been changed.  In the past it was "either-or" and now no preference is given.  A person with a qualification in autism only is now not allowed to teach and will not be allowed to teach in the future.  Would the Minister of State not agree that is a backward step and that children will suffer?
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I do not concede it is a backward step.  The Department awards approximately €36,000 for home tuition.  While I do not suggest we should count the cost in money terms, it underlines the commitment.  The inspectorate made recommendations on foot of the fact that people with few qualifications were engaged in home teaching.  Some exceptions were made in cases when parents have been unable to get a qualified teacher.  I do not want to read out the full list but it is important to recognise its existence.  In some instances people have suggested that a qualified nurse or psychologist might be suitable.  The reality remains that the benchmark here is for a qualified teacher.  I do not believe it is a backward step.  It is in keeping with the demands of the inspectorate and more importantly it is in the best interests of the children concerned.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	367	There are some preschool children who are non-verbal and not toilet trained.  Would the Minister of State not agree that these people need special help from people who are experienced and have the training appropriate to their needs?  The recent changes will result in the appointment of only people with a teacher qualification.  Such people might have a BEd only and no experience of or qualifications in autism, which appears to be acceptable to the Department.  However, another person with relevant experience and qualifications is not accepted.  I ask the Minister of State to review this with a view to allowing the flexibility required in order to provide children of that age with the best possible support and the tutoring they require.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I accept the Deputy's genuine concern.  However, I must remind him why this change was brought about.  Before the inspectorate made its recommendations there was a list of people providing tuition, including people without a leaving certificate or post-school qualifications and who had not previously worked in a school.  It is a big forward step to insist that people with the minimum qualifications as a qualified teacher should in the first instance be the people to provide that tuition.  I accept there may be occasional circumstances in which the parents might have involved a psychologist or someone from another area of expertise.  However, those are the exceptions.  I must hold the line given that 130 people are providing tuition without qualification, which concerns me.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	369	As the Minister indicated to the Deputy on 23 June 2009, the patrons of the school in question have informed my Department that they will be closing the existing school in 2012.  When trustees or a patron body decide to close a school, the Department's main concern is to ensure that the best interests of the pupils are looked after and that there will be sufficient student places in existing schools in the general area for students who would have normally enrolled in the closing school.Given the budgetary constraints and the timescale involved, it was not possible to construct a new post primary school building in advance of the closure referred to by the Deputy.  Accordingly, my Department has agreed in principle to enter into a lease arrangement for the existing school building and site.  It is my intention that departmental officials will consult with the relevant stakeholders regarding the issues of patronage and the other practical arrangements relating to the establishment of the new school entity as soon as the leasing arrangement has been finalised.Pending the establishment of the new school, the existing school will continue to operate under its existing management and admissions model.  In the longer term, the purchase of a site and the construction of a new school building is the intended solution for this location.  However, this must have regard to the availability of financial resources.  At this point, it is not possible for me to indicate when a new school building will be ready for occupation.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I welcome that the Minister of State and the Department have agreed in principle to lease the existing Seamount school in Kinvara.  We need clarity on an agreed lease with the Sisters of Mercy and the trustees.  They have given a ten-year extension to the period of the lease to allow the school to continue.  They want to leave the idea of trustees of the school.  There is confusion as to who will be responsible for the appointment of trustees during the period of the lease.  Under the 1998 Act it is clear that the trusteeship of Seamount during the lease period is the responsibility of the trustees of the existing school as a voluntary Catholic school.  Correspondence involving the acquisitions section of the Department shows confusion and indicates responsibility for identifying and recognising the new trustees for this enterprise will reside with the Department of Education and Science.  I should appreciate if the Minister of State would give clarity as to who has responsibility for the appointment of the trustees in these circumstances.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I thank the Deputy for his interest in this issue.  I acknowledge his role in finding a solution.  Consultation on the lease is continuing and I hope this leasing arrangement can be put in place by 1 September, provided we can get agreement following consultation with all the stakeholders.  Consultation is also taking place regarding the trustees and until we finalise the discussions on the lease it will not be possible to bring this issue to finality.  As I understand it, the Department of Education and Science will have the primary role in determining who will be the patrons.  The Department is open to submissions and will actively engage in consultation on the issue.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	372	Will the Minister of State guarantee that there will be full consultation with the education partners at local level in the Kinvara area?  Will the terms of the lease currently being negotiated relate to the Department of Education and Science and the trustees and only them?  The idea has been floated that there might be an outside patronage group involved.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	373	The Department is hopeful that the lease issue will be finalised in time for the coming academic year, commencing on 1 September.  While the Deputy did not raise the following issue in his question, the commission on school accommodation has recommended a new school building and that issue and others such as whether it will be a coeducational school, patronage and the number of possible pupils need to be addressed.We are open to active, constructive engagement and consultation on the patronage issue.  Obviously, the Deputy's input in this regard will be invaluable.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I assume the Deputy's question relates to the recent decision to pause the increase in funding for the centre in question.I am pleased to advise the House that funding for the centre has not been blocked.  Indeed, funding provided this year has allowed for an increase in the number of staff at the centre.  The Department has put on record that it is anxious to continue to work with the centre to develop additional programmes.Given the current economic climate, a thorough review of all educational projects and programmes requiring expenditure was undertaken.  I am sure the House appreciates that the level of competing demands within the education sector and the overall demands on Government finances has meant that it was not possible to provide additional funding to fully develop all projects currently under way.The outcome of this process means that the Department is, unfortunately, not in a position to provide the funding required to expand the centre as had been intended this year.  It had been intended that a major capital project would commence on site and that significant additional personnel would be recruited over the course of the next 18 months.  However, it simply was not possible for my Department to provide the additional funding at this point in time.I must stress that this decision does not mean that funding has been blocked.  The centre will continue to be enabled to provide services and to develop some additional services.  The Department is anxious to ensure the continuation of ongoing training and research programmes.  I can assure the Deputy that the Department will keep expansion of the centre under review in the context of improved financial circumstances.I wish also to assure the House that the Government will continue to prioritise funding to ensure that pupils with special educational needs will continue to receive an appropriate education, a commitment reflected in the allocation of more than €1 billion in 2009 to support pupils and young people with special educational needs.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	375	Has the Minister of State had an opportunity to visit the Midleton Centre for Autism?  I and other colleagues visited it some months ago and saw at first hand the extraordinary work taking place there, bringing together children from the North and South on a collaborative basis to try to deal with many issues attached to autism.Will the Minister of State accept that there was an implicit agreement on the part of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of the Republic to fund the capital programme and outlay attached to this particular centre and that without that funding, which has been paused, the centre will not be able to develop its full potential?  Will he provide further information to the House on the nature of the pause in capital funding currently taking place?
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	376	While the Minister has visited the centre, I have not yet had an opportunity to do so.  As this matter comes within my area of responsibility, I will take the opportunity to visit the centre during the next six weeks.The pause in funding in this regard is the same as that which applies in respect of every Department in terms of spending given the current economic situation.  We believe that when the upturn takes place we will be in a position to fast track issues of importance such as this.The Deputy made an important point in regard to North-South projects.  This project is one on which we entered into agreement with our counterparts in the North.  However, careful consideration must be given to all projects when funding is tight.  Very difficult decisions had to be taken.  The reality is that the Department cannot provide funding to every project currently under way.  The Department is aware of the sensitivity that attaches to North-South projects, in particular those providing services in the area of special needs and has contacted our counterparts in the North to explain the difficulties in which we find ourselves, while reaffirming our commitment in this regard.The level of ongoing research and training at the centre gives credence to the Department's commitment to reactivate funding in this area.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	377	The Northern Ireland Minister expressed surprise to hear of the Department's decision not to proceed with capital funding for the Midleton Centre for Autism.  Was the Minister for Education in Northern Ireland informed in advance of the decision being taken?  Will the Minister of State indicate to the House the scale of the pause?  This unique project in Midleton is about bringing together children and their parents in a residential setting for a number of days or weeks to deal with the issue of autism on site.  Without capital funding, it cannot progress.  It is important the Minister of State points out the scale of pause involved.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	378	The Northern Ireland Minister for Education, Ms Ruane, was made aware of the decision.  I reiterate the Government's commitment to education by way of its €1 billion investment this year in support of children with special needs.  I am not in a position to state the length of the pause or what will be its impact.  However, the matter raised by the Deputy is being prioritised within the Department, as has been made clear.It is important to state on the record that the Minister meets regularly with his opposite number in the North to discuss a wide ranging agenda consisting in the main of special educational needs, educational under-achievement, teacher mobility and so on.  The Government is committed to providing the best it can given the scarce resources available.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	379	The leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, has been in existence since 1994 and its introduction was designed to enhance the vocational dimension of the leaving certificate.  This two-year programme combines the traditional academic strengths of the leaving certificate with a focus on self-directed learning, enterprise, work and the community which are included in the link modules.There are currently 508 second level schools offering the leaving certificate vocational programme and the programme is taken each year by approximately 10% of second level pupils.  Participation in the programme is supported by an enhanced pupil:teacher ratio and by the provision of professional development support to schools and teachers.  My Department received applications from ten second level schools for approval to introduce the programme in their schools from the commencement of the 2009-10 school year.The first point to be clarified is that teaching resources will continue to be provided to the 508 in receipt of such resources and that it is the ten applicant schools that will not receive additional resources.  In framing the budgets in October and April, a range of difficult choices had to be faced by Government across all areas of public expenditure, including in the field of education where in future a ceiling will apply in respect of the overall number of teachers.  Clearly, any expansion of the programmes must be considered in the context of existing policies and available resources.The first priority is to maintain existing service levels to the greatest possible extent.  In the context of the limits on overall numbers employed in the public service and how they are to apply to the schools sector, it would not make sense to expand this service and further increase the upward pressure on teacher numbers at this time.  The Department has, however, outlined to the schools concerned that those that wish to provide the leaving certificate vocational programme from within their existing staffing resources will be facilitated.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	380	The Minister of State is all heart.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	381	It is called kicking the matter to touch.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	382	A number of schools involved have been visited by the relevant professional development support service to discuss their proposed participation in the programme.  Some schools have expressed an interest in providing the programme from within their existing staffing levels.  Given that during the years approval was given regularly to schools wishing to introduce the leaving certificate vocational programme, it may be the case that schools which have submitted an application might have expected the application to be granted.  The Department did not give approval at any time to any of the ten applicant schools.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	383	Therefore, the upshot is that the Minister of State will allow the ten schools to take part in the leaving certificate vocational programme but will not give them any money; that will be the position from next September.  I am not sure who made this decision — the Minister of State or the Minister — but departmental officials were touting for schools to offer the programme in March.  In April the ten schools in question were informed that funding would be provided but then on 10 June they received letters telling them there was no money and that they could not have the scheme funded in September, despite the fact that teachers had been trained for it, kids were ready for it and timetables had been drawn up.  The carpet was pulled from under them.  Did the Minister of State make the decision?
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	384	The programme will continue to be provided by 508 second level schools.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I know that.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	386	We are dealing with ten applicant schools.  In the current difficult financial position the priority is to maintain existing services, that is fair to say across the Department, rather than to expand.  I do not have responsibility for the area in the Department; it was a decision made by the Minister in consultation with departmental officials.  It was one that was necessary, however, given the difficult financial position we are in.  Some schools have still expressed the desire to participate in the programme.  There was an expectation because sanction had been automatic in previous years that it was just a question of applying.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	387	Having regard to current economic circumstances, did the people who made the ultimate decision know some of their colleagues were out the previous week encouraging others to make applications?  If that is the case, one side of the Department does not know what the other is doing.  Does that not make manifest our assertion that the Department is essentially dysfunctional?  If the Minister of State knew in October that there would be no money available, why did he allow people to go around looking for others to participate in the scheme and then, within days, send a letter from another section in the Department to them stating there was no money available?
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	388	It was clear from the budget in October 2008 and the supplementary budget in April that a ceiling would apply to the overall number of teachers.  That was the background to the decision and I have nothing further to add.  I do not believe the Department is dysfunctional; I fully support the views reiterated by the Minister. The Department is trying in difficult circumstances to maintain existing programmes.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	389	Does the Minister of State realise that these are mainly early school leavers and that the benefit of the programme to them is enormous?  If there is a failure to recognise this within the Department, the situation is serious.  How can any Minister say to schools that they must provide the programme within existing budgets that have already been cut to the bone?  The schools do not have the resources to operate the programme.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I take on board the point that we should concentrate on disadvantage in education.  For that reason the commitments given on the junior certificate schools programme are being honoured under the DEIS programme, as well as commitments given in the programme for Government and elsewhere.  We are trying to target our resources; that is why the commitment to expand the junior certificate schools programme is being honoured.  In this case, we were talking about ten schools and difficult choices had to be made.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I am asking on the floor of the House that the Minister of State reconsider this decision for the ten schools out of 780 post-primary schools.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The schools have been contacted and we have had discussions with the professional development support service to see what its intentions are.  We will see what arises from that process.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	393	The passage of the Student Support Bill will facilitate progress on the two significant pillars of an overall programme of legislative and administrative reform of student grants, the development of a single unified grants scheme and the consolidation of the administration of student grants within the VEC sector.  Amendments to the Student Support Bill are at the final stages of preparation and the Department is working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to finalise any outstanding matters.The introduction of the new administrative arrangements will have to be considered in the current and prospective economic and budgetary context.  The situation is being kept under continuous review in the context of progression of the legislation, the availability of resources and emerging developments in transforming public services.The Department is continuing to work closely with the IVEA and other relevant stakeholders to develop the new administrative structures required to support the efficient delivery of the new unified grants scheme.  A fundamental review of the entire business process is well under way, with a view to ensuring consistency of application and a more streamlined and effective service for students.  This includes matters relating to application, assessment and payments arrangements.Significant progress has been made on a number of these issues.  Where there are opportunities for the introduction of early service level improvement, the Department has endeavoured to work closely with the relevant stakeholders to make improvements in the shortest possible timeframe within the existing arrangements.  These include the introduction of a downloadable version of the application form and guidance notes for the first time in 2009 and the commencement of a test phase which will provide for maintenance grant payment by electronic funds transfer to a limited number of students for the forthcoming academic year.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	394	Forgive me for thinking the Student Support Bill was introduced by the Government and that Second Stage was concluded a year ago.  When will Committee Stage of the Bill be taken, given that before the last general election, the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, issued five specific press statements to the effect that from September 2009 we would have the new, unified system operational in every local authority?
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	395	The hope is we will have it ready for the autumn and be ready to present it then.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	397	The Minister of State said a number of amendments were still being worked on in the Attorney General's office, which was not known when Second Stage was concluded.  How many amendments are we talking about?  I understood there was general support in the House for the Bill on Second Stage and that there were no outstanding legislative difficulties.  What is causing the delay?  Is the delay in the Department or elsewhere?
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	398	One of the legal considerations for the Attorney General concerns the introduction of grant support for part-time courses.  The economic circumstances are not exactly benign for the prospects of funding short-time or part-time courses but it is hoped that an enabling amendment will be added to the Bill to facilitate that in the future when resources become available.

If the Deputy has details about the circumstances we would be delighted to see them so that we can determine why a blockage has occurred.  The purpose of this Bill is to transfer these matters to the VEC sector.

In June last year I hosted a conference on the governance challenges for future primary school needs and the need to provide an opportunity for patron bodies, the wider education partners and others with an interest in the future of our primary education system to collectively reflect on the challenges we face in shaping the system to respond appropriately to changing societal demands.Participants at the conference considered the long-term challenges of organising and developing our system of school governance to accommodate societal change and new parental demands and aspirations will be subject to consideration.  The conference also dealt with a range of associated issues such as the challenges of capacity constraints, the provision of choice for parents, ensuring whole community inclusion in our schools as well as the implications of societal change on enrolment policies and approaches to the teaching of religion in multi-faith environments.  Discussions focused on the particular challenges of ethos and inclusion for patron bodies, under old and new patronage models, including the model to be piloted in two community national schools, Scoil Ghráinne, Phibblestown, and Scoil Choilm, Porterstown from September 2008.  While I would not rule out the possibility of holding a further forum on school patronage in the future, I believe that considerable further thought must be given to the timing and format of such an event.My Department is currently consulting directly with patrons about specific areas where the establishment of new schools will be required and how emerging demands in these areas will be addressed and, as part of the process, will be seeking details of any schools where a change of patronage might potentially be relevant.  A review of procedures for establishment of new primary schools is being undertaken by the commission on school accommodation.  Among the range of issues being considered is the issue of patronage including the criteria that must be met to become a patron and the circumstances where changes to patronage may be warranted.I believe it would be premature to embark on a national discussion on school patronage until these matters have been progressed.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	415	Is the Minister familiar with the comments of probably the largest patron in the country, with responsibility for one seventh of all the primary schools in the country?  I refer to Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, who said at a Dublin gathering of the IPPN that the dominance of his patronage was a legacy of the past which no longer reflected the needs either of his church or the community.Is the Minister aware that his Department has stopped the patron body of gaelscoileanna, An Foras Pátrúnachta, from moving its patronage model to a level of permanence?  I refer specifically to Coláiste Chill Dara in this case, where the Department is refusing to allow its status to change from conditional to permanent, thereby blocking its funding.  The Minister cannot make a decision on extending patronage to Educate Together for secondary schools, even though his Department is planning schools in the Lucan area.Whatever form it takes, the archbishop has suggested a forum.  I am aware that officials from the Department met with him after his comments at Kilmainham.  This is not an issue about new schools but one where an existing patron of existing schools says he does not want to have them.  How does the Minister deal with that?  We also have problem with a patron who, according to all the evidence in the public domain, is not carrying out its duties in regard to Cabra.What role is there in this for the Department of Education and Science?  Its documentation suggests there will be an extra 100,000 pupils by 2013 on top of the existing 500,000.  Does the Minister accept there is a crisis in patronage that must be dealt with quickly?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I met with representatives of Educate Together last week and indicated that I would give consideration to its application for patronage at second level during the summer months.  However, I saw this as a serious policy issue and one I would have to bring to Government, which I propose to do.My officials met Archbishop Diarmuid Martin in late 2007.  We wanted to discuss statements he had made prior to that on the possibility of divesting patronage of primary schools in the archdiocese.  We also had a separate meeting with Bishop Leo O'Reilly, who is the chair of the Bishops' Education Commission.  We asked Archbishop Martin to let us know if he had specific locations in mind.  He said he had no specific locations in mind where one or more schools under his patronage could transfer to another patron but that it might arise some time in the future.  The discussion centred on the different issues that might arise and the need for such changes to be planned and managed.  It also focused on the desirability of individual schools to enter into consultations with all stakeholders, such as parents and teachers, and it was agreed that the archbishop would make contact with us at an early stage if an opportunity arose to change patronage.  Archbishop Martin has never made contact with us on that matter.  At the recent IPPN conference the archbishop made a statement on similar lines, as a result of which we will consult directly with him again to see exactly what he has in mind.  We will also consult with Bishop O'Reilly but the Department is not certain the Archbishop of Dublin and the chair of the Irish Bishops' Conference are in unison on this issue.  It is only right and fair that we get a clear indication from the Catholic Church of its views on patronage across the country.

Can we have a seminar in which everybody can hear what the participants are saying?  Archbishop Martin has an obligation to the Minister in exercising his duties as patron because the Minister is paying the tab for the 477 schools — 93% of the total — which are involved in Dublin.  The current operator is saying he is a reluctant patron and I can understand some of the difficulties.  However, instead of polite conversations with officials, can we hold the dialogue in the open?  Some officials are characterised in the Ryan report as having a culture of deference so can we help to weaken that deference?  This concerns the futures of all our children.

Equally, however, I held a conference in June of last year in Kilmainham at which representatives all of the main patrons spoke.It is important to remember that there is also a commission on school accommodation in place.  I emphasised to the commission that I wanted it to report to me in respect of school patronage.  I see this as a working forum in progress in respect of patronage, particularly as all the patron bodies are represented on it.

It was not, therefore, the Minister's decision to hold that conference but he was obliged to give  a speech at it.  However, let us leave that matter to one side.I believe the Minister has an open view on this matter.  If ever there was a need for a talking shop in respect of a particular matter, then this is it.  Such a talking shop would have to be in operation for a long period because there are no easy solutions in respect of this matter.

I request that the Minister reconsider this issue during the summer recess.  I understand that the deadline regarding the submission of working papers to the commission on school accommodation is set for later this month.  If, therefore, I wanted to submit my views, I only have a number of weeks in which to do so.  At the very least, the deadline should be extended because this matter does not merely involve Bishop O'Reilly, Archbishop Martin, Deputy Quinn or me——

However, I must be informed as to the exact position.  I have put in place the commission on school accommodation, on which all of the patron bodies are represented and to which they are all providing of their expertise, and I would like to await the results of its deliberations.  In addition, particular groups have indicated to me that they are seeking movement in respect of the matter of patronage.  I have also put in place two model schools, in the form of pilot projects, and I want to measure the success of these schools and discover what can be learned from their operation.  This is particularly relevant in the context of the forum we will obviously need to establish some time in the future.What is being done in this area is work in progress.  It would be premature to establish a forum at this stage.  I intend to await the results of the commission's work and the evaluation of the operation of the model schools.  At that point, it would be important to establish an open forum.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	431	In order to improve the information systems available to my Department  in respect of primary and post-primary schools, my Department's forward planning section uses geographical information system, GIS, technology which contains a certain level of information on all schools in the country at both primary and post-primary level.  I understand the planning and building unit recently gave a demonstration to the members of the Joint Committee on Education and Science on the use of the GIS.  A range of demographic information is linked to the relevant schools and this allows the Department to map various demographic scenarios at local level.To further expand and improve the capabilities of the system, arrangements are being made to conduct a survey of accommodation at primary and post-primary level which will be linked to the GIS.  It is intended that this will establish the position in respect of the extent of all school accommodation.  The specifications for this inventory are being finalised at present.As the Deputy will be aware, I also recently instructed my Department to compile information on school ownership details on the basis of files available in the Department.  In general, the Department's property management files contain details of indentures entered into by the State with the respective school patrons.  The primary purpose of these indentures was to protect the interest of the State in buildings constructed on sites not in its ownership.  Due to the fact that this system of indentures has been in place since the commencement of the primary school system, the vast bulk of these legal documents predates the introduction of modern information technology systems.  Indeed, many of these documents predate the foundation of the State.As part of scoping out the scale of the exercise relating to establishing the ownership details of school properties, my officials recently met representatives from the Property Registration Authority and the Chief State Solicitor's office to ascertain the extent of the work involved and to determine if the information could be obtained by other means.  However, it is clear that it will not be possible to obtain this information other than by a painstaking process of researching each individual file.  It is also clear that compiling a comprehensive database of school ownership will be quite a complex task and will take some time to complete.  I have asked my Department to provide me with a preliminary report on the timescale of this exercise and a full assessment of what is involved in terms of both staffing and financial resources.In the meantime, my Department is finalising a list of school details setting out the names and addresses of schools, their roll numbers and details of the patron of each national school.  I will arrange to have this information forwarded to those Deputies who have requested it as soon is it has been compiled.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I thank the Minister for his reply and I sympathise with him in respect of the difficulties he is experiencing.  The Minister did not establish the Department of Education and Science and was not responsible for its operation over a long period.It is incredible that some form of basic spreadsheet on which the information to which the question refers is not available.  Deputies were treated to a very good presentation by officials from the Department's offices in Tullamore and were suitably impressed.  In order to obtain the kind of lateral productivity to which many people have recently referred, I suggest that the Department work in conjunction with the VECs — which have a great deal of expertise at their disposal — and local authorities in respect of this matter.  We should ask the engineering and planning departments of the various local authorities to carry out a conditions analysis in respect of existing schools.  Those who work in these departments are public servants and they are not doing anything at present because there is no building work taking place.  Some of the larger VECs have the capacity to do precisely what I have suggested.Obviously, however, none of this has happened.  We are going to be hit with a tsunami in the near future, with 25,000 additional pupils entering the system each year.  Beginning this year and on the assumption that there will be 30 pupils per class, there will be a need for an extra 760 classrooms per year.  The Department is not equipped to deal with this increase in demand and will only be able to do so it if receives assistance.  I suggest that such assistance should be obtained from within the public service and that the Minister should not plead that there is a lack of resources.

Last year, however, as a result of outstanding co-operation on the part of county and city managers, the Department accurately predicted what would be the level of demand.  I am confident that we will continue to anticipate the emerging needs, particularly in light of the co-operation that exists among the various entities.  The current system is similar to a one-stop-shop and I am delighted with the current level of co-operation.  I thank local authorities and city and county managers for that co-operation.  What we are doing appears to be working extremely well.  The new GIS system can continue to expand.However, I must consider priorities and as a former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn is aware of how one prioritises one's spending within a Department.  On foot of the exposition I have provided to him, he can see that putting in place the information he seeks will be an extremely difficult and long-term process.  How strategic is this in the shorter term?  Is it more strategic for me to spend money that will ensure I can put a roof over the children who will attend our schools in the present generation?  Is it more strategic for me to understand that there are indentures in place that will protect the investment the State has made over time?  At a time of limited resources, my emphasis must be on providing accommodation for the pupils who will enter the system and I consider that to be my first priority.  I do not wish to take from what Deputy Quinn seeks to achieve, nor does this take from my desire to achieve it either, but the pace at which this can be done and the difficulty relating to collating all that material, some of which predates the establishment of primary schools, means this is a difficult and onerous task that will not be delivered within a short time.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 11, to delete lines 38 to 47 and in page 12, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following:"(a) by the deletion of subsection (6)”.This amendment is similar to one I tabled on Committee Stage last week but which has been changed slightly to reflect the full intent.  The purpose of the amendment relates to the Bill's provisions, which represent some progress.  This Bill requires that loans lent on a preferential basis to directors must be disclosed both to the public and to shareholders.  This will prevent a recurrence of what happened with Mr. Seán Fitzpatrick in respect of the concealment of his loans in the past.  While this represents progress, Fine Gael does not believe it goes far enough.  We are concerned by the fact that loans made on preferential terms to connected persons, that is, to spouses and children of directors in the main, will not be disclosed to the public and will be disclosed only to the shareholders.  That is fine in respect of AIB or Bank of Ireland, because such information will be disclosed to a large number of shareholders, of whom there are hundreds of thousands in those companies, both institutional and individual.  However, this is not the case with Anglo Irish Bank.  Consequently, as a shareholder of both AIB and Bank of Ireland, I will be made aware of loans made on preferential terms to directors of those companies.  However, I will not be made aware of loans made on preferential terms to the spouses and children of directors of Anglo Irish Bank, even though I probably am more liable for that company as a taxpayer than I am as a shareholder of the other two companies.  The only person who will be in possession of such information will be the Minister for Finance.  While Deputy Brian Lenihan holds that office at present, someone else could so do in future.  While the only nationalised bank at present is Anglo Irish Bank, there could be others in future.  I do not believe the Oireachtas should give the Minister for Finance that exclusive discretion, either now or in the future, for Anglo Irish Bank or for any other bank in the future.I have tabled this amendment to ensure that preferential loans that are made to persons are put in the public domain.  Were there a commitment from the Minister for Finance to the effect that he would be prepared to make such information available, this legislative provision would not be necessary.  However, in the absence of such a commitment, it is necessary.  People have lost trust in banking and politics and Members have a major job to do to restore trust in both.  It is not right to give the Minister for Finance power to conceal the identity of spouses and children of directors who receive loans on preferential terms from a nationalised bank.  It is important for the Houses of the Oireachtas to vindicate the right of the public to know the preferential terms on which spouses and children of directors are getting loans from a nationalised bank that is backed up with our capital and by our sovereign guarantee. The Minister of State will argue that this is a matter for the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  However, while I understand that argument, I do not accept it.  First, we have decided to put specific provisions into company law relating to the banks in this regard.  Consequently, it is not as though the Minister himself believes there is such an absolute separation between what may be appropriately included to in the Companies Acts and what may be appropriately included in legislation pertaining to financial services.  I also do not believe that power and decisions always should be ceded to ombudsmen, agencies or regulators.  Perhaps this country would be in a better position, had the regulators not been given so much power to decide on their own part how regulations should be enforced in the financial services industry.  There is an important role for the Houses of the Oireachtas in the restoration of confidence in politics and trust in the banking system.  That means ensuring that members of the public, who are the de facto shareholders of this nationalised bank, will have the same access to information about a company they own as do the private shareholders of AIB and Bank of Ireland.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I am not caught up by the tone or tenor of Deputy Varadkar's amendment.  Were Members to continue in that vein, it would be possible to regulate businesses out of existence.  As for talking about trust in politics, if Members continue to speak in that vein, they will perpetuate the myth that no one is trustworthy.  The de minimis thresholds of €2,500 or €3,000 in this regard are peanuts and in addition, an aggregate amount will be disclosed.  While I do not come from a business background, business must be allowed to continue in some form.  The fact that one big avalanche of which all Members are aware took place does not mean every business carries on in that fashion.  Moreover, I understand the Financial Regulator will be involved.  How many more people must become involved in poking their noses into every bit of business?  I do not hold a brief for business people in so far as I am not a business person and I do not come from a business background.  However, as a self-employed person, I know the amount of scrutiny to which one is subject and to which one must comply is considerable.I have made the point previously that those who enter politics are subject to fairly significant intrusions.  I acknowledge the case has been made that assets could be put into a spouse's name or something similar.  However, my understanding is that a register will be kept of such transactions.  As Deputy Varadkar noted, the Minister of the day will have a shareholding in this regard.  That means he or she will have an obligation to act in the public interest and on behalf of the public.  Moreover, one of the 15 constitutionally-bound members of the Executive will have a role in this regard.  Ultimately, having reflected carefully on this issue, I am prepared to give the Minister's views on this issue a fair wind and a fair opportunity.  I understand that further regulation and further legislation dealing with this particular issue is forthcoming and that the banks themselves will be obliged to maintain a register that must be furnished.  The Minister of State might pay attention to this point.  My understanding is that the register must be furnished under pain of penalty.  It is no longer a nice option, it is mandatory and carries penalties.  As someone who, in another guise, must examine the legislation that passes through this House it sometimes borders on prurience.  The Labour Party will not support the amendment, it will abstain from it.  I have concerns about sections 5 and 6 of this Bill, of which the Minister of State is aware.We are enacting legislation because of the particular circumstances but the Government is throwing out much legal precedent and common law applicable in every common law jurisdiction.  I am loth to be a signatory to this.  That is why I asked for this to be furnished in a report to the Dáil.  It is my intention to be vigilant in that regard because I am deeply concerned that someone can arrive, bring all and sundry and load up the tractor and trailer, taking everything in the place including privileged documents and those with lawyer-client privilege.  I have grave concerns and I will not wait until the game is over before saying this.  Rights are involved and in the rush to trammel rights sometimes bad law is made.I am well aware of the background circumstances that have led to this Bill with which we have co-operated.  As Labour Party spokesman, it would be remiss of me not to signal a degree of discomfort in respect of some aspects of this Bill.  I say that with no vested interest, other than as a lawyer who reads Bills and watches them operate subsequently.  I will be very vigilant on the operation of these sections.  They should be used only as a last resort.  That is why I seek a report on their operation on an annual basis.  I understand the Minister of State will facilitate this.Deputy Varadkar has given valid reasons for the tabling of this amendment.  I do not hold the same view.  His views are as plausible and well-founded as mine but the measure in the legislation is more than adequate.  It will be complemented by subsequent legislation and financial regulatory control.  We used to talk about triple locks but we will have the whole place locked in.  Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore said that to make accidents impossible would be to make work impossible.  In other words, we can never insure against every risk.  We could get to the stage where the amount of regulation means we may not get people who want to be directors or part of a business set-up.  We must be careful to strike a balance.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	440	The net effect of Deputy Varadkar's amendment is to delete the original as well as my proposed amended version of section 41(6) of the Companies Act 1990, a subsection that exempts companies that are licensed banks from the requirements that apply to companies in general to disclose in annual accounts prescribed details about loans made to directors and persons connected with these directors.  Section 8(1)(a) of the new Bill substitutes a new section for section 41(6) of the 1990 Act and differentiates between the positions of directors and persons connected to directors as follows.  For the directors, the net effect of the substitution is that, from now on, any company licensed as a bank will be required to disclose in its annual account details all loans to individual directors where these exceed a minimum level, as referred to by Deputy Penrose.  This will be the case where the loans are on ordinary or favourable terms.  For those connected to directors, details of their loans will continue to be exempt under section 41 from disclosure in the annual accounts.  However, the latter sections of Part 3 of the Companies Act 1990, as amended by the current Bill, will require aggregate disclosures in the accounts about loans to connected persons and detailed disclosures through a register and a statement that must be made available prior to the AGM of the licensed bank in question.  In both instances, disclosures about connected persons will only relate to loans made on favourable terms.If accepted, Deputy Varadkar's amendment would lead to detailed disclosure in the annual accounts of all loans above the minimum amount, not only to directors but to persons connected to directors of the institution.  It would not apply only to preferential or favourable term loans but to any loans made to a person connected to a director.  We must be conscious of the right of ordinary people to go about their business in privacy as long as they are not in breach of legislation.  I encourage Deputy Varadkar to re-examine this.According to Deputy Varadkar's amendment, all loans would have to be declared by people connected to directors.  I am married to a bank manager but let us suppose she was promoted to the position of director of the bank.  One may also have a brother, a sister or a spouse appointed as a director of a bank.  In such cases all loans to the person would have to be disclosed.  That is a fundamental infringement of the right of someone to go about business that is not anything other than legal.  Favourable term loans must be put on a register, which is available to the Financial Regulator.  The Financial Regulator already has authority through the Acts of the Oireachtas to insist on disclosure of loans if he deems it necessary.I understand why Deputy Varadkar is pursuing this because of the circumstances that arose in a bank that is now nationalised.  To put it in perspective, the Minister for Finance is the representative of the Irish people as a shareholder of Anglo Irish Bank.  He has the authority to publish material and the Financial Regulator has authority to inspect and ensure that no favouritism is granted to directors or shareholders of Anglo Irish Bank, or in this case the Minister for Finance.  Apart from the fact that it is unnecessary, there are many other reasons this amendment cannot be accepted.  We have discussed the matter on numerous occasions.  I could go into the detail of it but the general principle is that individuals related or connected to directors and lawfully going about their business in acquiring a loan from licensed banking institutions in this State should not be exposed to any further vigilance, as long as they are in compliance with laws and there is no favouritism shown.I urge the Deputy to accept our bona fides in respect of the review of financial regulation in this country, as has been announced by the Minister for Finance.  The Central Bank commission has been appointed.  We are examining other areas of financial regulation to ensure strong corporate governance and enforcement of corporate governance in the context of finance.Deputy Penrose is correct, one wants regulation appropriate to the risks involved.  A knee-jerk reaction can have unanticipated results.  If this amendment were accepted, it would have unintended consequences and would be a flagrant infringement on the right of an individual to go about his or her business.  Deputy Varadkar should not pursue this and should accept our genuine belief that the Financial Regulator already has the necessary authority and power vested in him by the Houses of the Oireachtas in legislation.  The register must be filled and is available for inspection by the Financial Regulator at all times.  There is a severe penalty in regard to breaches and, equally and as important, the Financial Regulator can make regulation requiring publication of such loans if he or she so wishes.There are plenty of safeguards and these will be enforced.  Ordinary people should not be penalised because they may be related, possibly even without consent.  It is blatantly wrong to put them at a disadvantage.  If this were any other piece of legislation, I am sure those opposite would have very serious views on this issue of somebody being penalised because of a relationship with somebody in a position like that.

The difficulty I have is largely philosophical.  When a bank or other company is nationalised and becomes a State-owned company, all citizens become shareholders.  Although in law the Minister for Finance is a shareholder, in my view a nationalised company belongs to all of us and we are all shareholders.  These are the ordinary people I care about rather than the people who happen to be related to a director of a company.  It is their interests I am trying to put first.Somebody who is a shareholder in the AIB or Bank of Ireland can get this information and has access to that register.  In the case of a company like Anglo Irish Bank, which is now nationalised, the people do not have access to that register as only the Minister and Financial Regulator have such access.  There is more secrecy in reality around a State owned bank than there would be around a privately owned bank, which I cannot accept.The intention of the amendment was to relate to favourable loans.  There is a diminished threshold, which can be set at €200,000 or €300,000, so that we are not taking into account mortgages of €400,000.  The intention of the amendment relates to a disclosure of loans to connect to persons where loans are on favourable terms.If it is the case that the Minister is prepared to commit to bringing in his own amendment to this end, I would be happy to withdraw mine.  If he cannot introduce an amendment to require disclosure of loans on favourable terms, I will have to push the amendment as it stands.  We agree on the matter of the diminished threshold in that we are not talking about small loans but significant loans.  If the Minister can commit to bringing in his own wording to connect it only to persons on favourable terms, I would be happy to accept it because that is the intent of the amendment.  If he does not make that commitment I will push the amendment to a vote.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I support Deputy Varadkar's amendment.  I understand that people in public life are in a glasshouse for all of their time in public life at least, if not well beyond it.  It is unfortunate that in some cases, family members of public representatives happen to be in that category.  I have instanced a case in the past where, for example, the son of a former Minister for Justice made headlines in a way that was grossly unfair and unreasonable to both the child and the former Minister.  I can understand some of the Minister's point on protecting people in that category who happen to work in a bank.The difficulty is that coming off the back of recent experience in the banking sector, we have seen Anglo Irish Bank and a network of others prepared to weave a carpet of deceit and deception.  We are told no rules or laws were broken and nobody has been charged or put in jail.  That has left a very bad taste in everybody's mouth.  The only solution is for the Minister of State to accept Deputy Varadkar's amendment and come back to review it in three, four or five years' time, after a proper regulatory regime has been put in place and when it has begun to engender some trust in the public.  That is the best way to handle this in a way acceptable to all of us.I am a director of an enterprise which is on the Members' register for all to see.  I understand the point made by Deputy Penrose on having some care in the matter of administrative burden.  I hope I am not going against Deputy Varadkar in this as that is not my intention.  This burden carries a significant cost and there is a bureaucratic process that brings about much hardship on businesses right across this land.  This comes at a significant price to those businesses, particularly the smaller and medium-sized businesses that can ill afford it not just at this time but at any time.The balance is to protect not just workers but other businesses associated with the companies in question, which are trading and dealing with them.  It is most important that those people have protection as well.  I acknowledge the concern of Deputy Penrose and the Labour Party in that regard.  I support the amendment and I would like to see the Government accepting it with an undertaking to review it in a few years.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I have stated on numerous occasions that plenty of legislation is passed in the Houses of the Oireachtas that gives adequate powers of enforcement to the Financial Regulator to inspect favourable loans that must be placed on a register.  Equally, those favourable loans must be declared to shareholders 15 days before an AGM of shareholders.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement also has access to that register so there are plenty of people capable of inspections.With regard to the Minister for Finance being the sole shareholder of the nationalised bank, as far as I recollect we went before the people and those of us in this Parliament were elected.  A Government was formed and the specific purpose of anybody in this House is to act in the public interest.  The Minister for Finance is charged with a responsibility as shareholder and will act in the public interest and be held to account in this Parliament.From the political perspective, there is adequate accountability for those in this Chamber in how they are first elected to office and then held to account by this Parliament.  There should be enough confidence in this Parliament to hold any member of Government to account to ensure the public good and interest is upheld.Favourable term loans must be placed on a register and there is an inspection process by the Financial Regulator and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  On Committee Stage I indicated that the reason licensed banks are in company law is because there was not a strong corpus of legislation relating to financial regulation.  The long-term intention is to try to migrate those towards the financial regulatory area.  That is where they would be best enforced.

I also extend my sympathy to the unsuccessful candidates and compliment all candidates, successful or otherwise, on the extensive campaigns undertaken by them in seeking election to represent Ireland in the European Parliament.  It is only through the willingness of candidates of all political persuasions to put themselves forward for election by the people that a true democratic mandate is provided for elected representatives at local, national and European level.I also express satisfaction that 11 out of the 12 MEPs elected in this jurisdiction belong to mainstream groups in the European Parliament — the Christian democrat, liberal and socialist groups — and are committed to supporting the ratification of the Lisbon treaty, now augmented by the decision of the European Council containing the legal guarantees and assurances plus declarations which the Irish Government had been seeking.  They should put to rest genuine fears about the impact of the Lisbon treaty on Ireland.  With regard to the group that my party will now be joining, I look forward to the development of a liberal republican philosophy.The introduction of this short Bill which was passed by the Seanad without amendment on 16 June reflects a further step in the development of the European Parliament, which is, along with the Council and the Commission, among the key institutions of the European Union.  With its members directly elected every five years throughout the 27 member states of the European Union, it is a unique institution: a multinational, multilingual Parliament of 785 members and 23 languages.The principal function of the European Parliament is to provide for and support the democratic accountability of EU decisions to ensure the right decisions are taken in respect of the European Union as a whole and in respect of specific national and regional concerns.  The role of the European Parliament does not usurp the role of national parliaments but is complementary to it.  This complementary role has evolved steadily since the first direct elections in 1979 when it was still essentially a consultative body.  It now has a range of real powers which enhance the democratic accountability of the European Union.The Parliament's role with regard to legislation and budgetary matters is particularly important.  The European Parliament shares European legislative powers with the Council and examines, modifies and occasionally rejects European proposals from the Commission.  The influence and role of Parliament has developed and it now has a significant impact on the daily lives of European citizens in important areas of policy, including environment, transport, social policy and food safety, where it has full powers of co-decision.  The services directive and the chemicals regulation, REACH, directive are two recent examples of major European legislation which the European Parliament played a decisive role in shaping.The Parliament also shares budgetary powers with the Council.  It has a powerful role in adopting or rejecting the annual EU budget and helping to distribute financial resources between different community programmes, which has a significant impact on the daily lives of European citizens.  The Lisbon treaty increases the number of areas in which the European Parliament will share the task of law-making with the Council of Ministers through co-decision, and the budgetary role of the Parliament will be also strengthened.The current legislative provision for the payment of MEPs in Ireland, the European Assembly (Irish Representatives) Act 1979, provides that Irish MEPs should be paid an allowance equal to that paid to Members of Dáil Éireann out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  During the passage of that legislation through the Oireachtas, the view was expressed by some Members that it was not appropriate for one Parliament, the Oireachtas, to make provision for the payment of Members of another Parliament.  It was also pointed out that the European Parliament was expected shortly to develop and adopt proposals for a unitary system for the payment of all MEPs.  However, it was not until December 2003 that the European Parliament finally addressed the issue by voting in favour of a formula establishing, inter alia, the principle of the independence of MEPs and parity of treatment between them.Implementation arrangements were developed by the European Parliament having regard to the opinion of the Commission.  These were approved by the Council of Ministers in July 2005.  Accordingly, the proposals developed have the full agreement of all member states and the expressed agreement of the three major institutions of the European Union.  The agreed implementation arrangements are set out in the decision of the European Parliament, 2005/684/EC, adopting the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, and will come into effect later this month.  The legal position in regard to the statute is that the terms of the statute, in so far as it is addressed to member states, are binding by virtue of European law.  Legislation at national level is required to give effect to certain provisions of the statute.  The European Parliament (Irish Constituency Members) Bill 2009 addresses this requirement.The purpose of the Bill, as set out in the explanatory memorandum, is to change the current statutory provisions providing for the payment of Irish MEPs by the Oireachtas by revoking the European Assembly (Irish Representatives) Act 1979; make statutory provision for current MEPs who are re-elected and wish to continue to be paid by the Oireachtas; confirm that the existing pension scheme, the European Assembly (Irish Representatives) Pensions Scheme 1979, SI 387 of 1979, made under the 1979 Act remains in force to discharge existing and preserved benefits; and provide a statutory basis for certain tax, pension, administrative and conflict of interest issues.Section 1 is a standard provision setting out the definitions of terms used in the Bill for interpretation and other purposes.  The overall thrust of the statute adopted by the European Parliament is to apply a single system of payment for all MEPs with effect from the new parliamentary term beginning later this July.  However, the measures adopted by the Parliament facilitate a period of transition for existing MEPs who were re-elected in the recent elections.  Section 2 provides for current MEPs who are re-elected and exercise the option available to them under the statute to continue to be paid under the Irish national system.  The salary paid will continue, as at present, to be the same rate as a salary for a Member of Dáil Éireann.Section 3 empowers the Minister to make, amend or revoke a contributory pension scheme for Members and former Members of the European Parliament.  It provides continuity for the existing scheme established under the 1979 Act by confirming it remains in force.  Continuation of the existing scheme is required to enable the discharge of existing liabilities due to former MEPs and to preserve accrued benefits for current MEPs.Section 5 of the 1979 Act provides for the disqualification of Irish MEPs for membership of or employment by certain bodies.  The relevant bodies are detailed in the Schedule to the Act.  Section 4 of the new Bill makes similar provision.  Section 5 of the 1979 Act sought to extend the then existing limitations in the individual statutory provisions for each of the bodies which generally were designed to ensure a person should not, at the same time, be a Member of the Oireachtas and a member of a board or staff of a State sponsored body.  It would not have been practical at the time to seek to amend each of the individual statutory provisions for each of the bodies to deal with the issue of membership of the European Parliament.  Therefore, the matter was addressed in the 1979 Act by section 5 and the associated Schedule.The opportunity was taken in the new Bill to review and update the Schedule.  The outcome of this review is that changes in circumstance, legislation and status affecting the bodies require that only ten of the 41 listed in the Schedule to the 1979 Act be included in the Schedule to this Bill.  One additional body has been proposed by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for inclusion.  The Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited, INPC, is a legacy State company established under the Companies Act by the Government for oil trading purposes during the oil crises in the late 1970s.  The memorandum and articles of association for the company exclude membership in the Oireachtas for directors but do not include a similar exclusion in respect of membership of the European Parliament.  To maintain consistency, the opportunity is being taken to include this in the Schedule to the Bill.Section 5 inserts a new section 127 A in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This section makes provision for the application of national taxation provisions to the salary paid by the European Parliament, subject to avoidance of double taxation of the salary.  It provides for the granting of a credit against Irish tax due on an MEP’s salary of an amount equal to the tax paid by the MEP for the benefit of the European Union in respect of that salary.  The section also clarifies under which income tax schedule an MEP’s salary is taxable.Section 6 is a technical amendment of the Ministerial, Parliamentary and Judicial Offices and Oireachtas Members (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001.  For the avoidance of doubt, it confirms that service as an MEP for which the Member obtains preserved or paid pension benefits from the European Parliament cannot be treated as pensionable service that can be also transferred and reckonable for the purposes of the Oireachtas pensions scheme or the European Assembly (Irish Representatives) Pension Scheme 1979.  In practical terms, it affirms the principle that service can  be utilised only once for pension credit purposes.Section 7 provides for a legislative basis to enable the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to conclude a service agreement with the European Parliament to act, on a recoupment basis, as a paying agent in respect of certain costs.  The European Parliament has sought the agreement of all national parliaments to act as paying agents.  The proposal from the European Parliament relates only to the costs of parliamentary assistants to MEPs, that is, the cost of a contract of employment and the cost of a contract for services provided locally.  The proposal requires that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission will act simply as an agent for making certain payments on behalf of the European Parliament.  Funding, rates, liability for costs and so on remain a matter for the European Parliament.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is amenable to the request made by the European Parliament, and enabling legislation is required to facilitate the conclusion of a service agreement.Sections 8 to 10, inclusive, are standard provisions providing for the repeal of the 1979 Act, expenses incurred in the administration of the Act to be paid out of moneys provided by Oireachtas, the Short Title of the Act, and designating when the Act comes into force.The current annual cost to the Exchequer of funding salaries for MEPs is €1.2 million.  The implementation of the European Parliament decision will involve the Parliament assuming the cost of funding of salaries for MEPs from July 2009.  This will potentially provide a maximum €1.2 million per annum reduction in costs to the Exchequer, but this sum may be reduced somewhat depending on the number of MEPs who qualify for and avail of the option to maintain their existing salary provisions from the new parliamentary term beginning this month.  Current funding of pensions for former MEPs, which amounted to €0.6 million per annum, will continue in the short term but will reduce over time as existing liabilities under the pension scheme are discharged and future liabilities for MEP pensions are met by the European Parliament.I remind Members of the need to give legislative authority to the provisions of this Bill in compliance with our European obligations before the beginning of the 2009 European Parliament term commencing on 14 July.  Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20563	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	454	Although this Bill does not represent a dramatic step forward in the development of the European Union, it is nevertheless welcome.  The establishment of the principle that the European Parliament is independent, has the authority to set its own pay levels and that there should be equal treatment of Members from different member states represents important progress.  It marks a certain coming of age of the European Parliament as an institution that organises its own affairs and acts without fear or favour.It is ironic that the Lisbon treaty raised the ire of many people.  In the aftermath of the difficulties experienced with the Nice treaty, the purpose of the Lisbon treaty was to try to make the system of decision-making more democratic, open and transparent.  For example, the treaty introduces initiatives such as the right of ordinary people to petition for changes in European policy and the right of domestic parliaments to wave yellow cards in the face of actions from Europe.It proved extraordinarily difficult in the campaign on the Lisbon treaty referendum to convince people that, rather than being a conspiracy to grab powers to the European Union, the treaty constituted an attempt by a unique body to make itself more democratic.  The ideas in the Lisbon treaty could not have been developed in a more democratic manner.  People from the "Yes" and "No" sides in all parliaments participated in the debates on how the European institutions could be made more democratic and open.  It was a pity, therefore, that these efforts were rejected.We need to take a step back and explain to ourselves and members of the public what a unique and wonderful institution is the European Union.  We have never had its like in the history of world affairs.  The EU is a body which seeks not only to resolve issues peacefully but to do so in a democratic manner.  The European Parliament holds to account other institutions and every country is given a say in the system through a fair and balanced weighting mechanism.  Would we not die for an opportunity to have the United Nations develop in a such an open, democratic and accountable manner and have the interests of its members taken into account and fairly represented?  Instead, the UN has vetoes, insiders and second class members.As a unique experiment in the history of mankind, we should cherish the uniqueness of the European Union and the value of what it has done, specifically for Ireland.  We face problems which domestic action alone will not resolve.  Many of the most alarming crises confronting us, whether financial, humanitarian or in the areas of climate change and crime, have developed dimensions that reach far beyond our borders.  It is not possible for the Irish Government or people to wield influence over the forces arraigned against us unless we work together with other countries.  We can achieve much more by working together on these major issues than we can separately.The wonderful feature of the European Union is that it can achieve great things but only in areas where we, the people, choose to give it authority.  The EU has developed in perfect balance.  It does not attempt to use the old ultra vires rule that one can stray into any area one chooses.  We protect the powers we do not delegate to the European Union to be shared.  The Union’s strength is that it can act only in areas over which we have given it authority.  Many of the red herrings raised during the debate on the Lisbon treaty referendum showed a lack of understanding of this basic principle underpinning the European Union.We cannot approach the forthcoming debate by lecturing people because we believe they should know better.  The problem is that we, who see the benefits of the treaty, have not been successful in selling it and encouraging people to understand what is being done.  We must learn from this.  I welcome the efforts of this Parliament and the Government since the Lisbon treaty referendum to broaden understanding and to deal with some of the canards which emerged during the campaign on the treaty.While I believe we are in a position to go to the people with a better understanding than previously, I worry that time will be needed to mount an effective campaign.  We are entering into the silly season when opportunities to plan and develop a campaign could slip from agendas.  It is important, therefore, that we get to grips with this issue and hit the ground running when the House returns following what many people regard as a well earned break.I welcome the Bill which will, I am sure, receive broad support.  I will raise one or two issues on Committee Stage and seek clarification of several points arising from its sections.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I, too, welcome the Bill, which is timely given that a new set of Members of the European Parliament was recently elected and a new Commission will soon be appointed.  I congratulate all the MEPs who were duly elected, in particular, the three members of the Labour Party.  An increase of a couple of hundred percent is welcome in any election.  In addition, after many years, Proinsias De Rossa will no longer be on his own.I also extend my sympathies to the losing candidates.  It is no mean challenge to contest a European election.  It is difficult enough to contest a local election, not to speak of a Dáil election, but in European elections each constituency has hundreds of thousands of people and, with the exception of Dublin, is spread over a number of counties.  In such circumstances, it is extremely difficult to get one's message across and extremely challenging for anyone who puts forward his or her name.  It is commendable and enhances our democracy that many individuals chose to do so.I welcome the process and outcome of the European election.  It is difficult to believe that the first election to the European Parliament was held just 30 years ago in 1979.  At that time, the Parliament was a mere consultative body rather than a real parliament but it has rapidly developed into a fully fledged parliament.  The changes in the Lisbon treaty will give it virtually 100% participation in all decisions made in the European Union, while the extension of qualified majority voting gives it a partnership role with the Council of Ministers.  This is the way forward.  The three great institutions, the Commission, Parliament and Council of Ministers, are to be joined by the Heads of State, which will become an institution in the European architecture in their own right, if the Lisbon treaty is ratified.The Bill before us further enhances the independence of the European Parliament, moving it a step away from national parliaments to which salaries and payments are now tied.  While the payment will continue to be tied to national parliaments, the paymaster will be the European Parliament.  In addition, the system whereby salaries had parity with salaries in the national parliament was out of kilter because one had 27 different salaries for Members of the European Parliament.  Under the provisions of the Bill, we will have parity of treatment and all MEPs will be paid the same salary.  This is the correct approach, one which establishes the independence of the European Parliament, and the sooner it is implemented, the better.This is an opportune time to restructure the payment, eliminate the current anomaly and create parity.  It is a bonus that the €1.8 million Ireland pays on salaries and pensions will now be paid by the European Parliament.  The other side of the coin is parity of treatment for each member state.  This will increase the cohesion among Members of the European Parliament.  Previously, there was a large disparity between Members from the former Eastern Bloc states and, for example, Ireland.The extra powers conferred by the Lisbon treaty will significantly strengthen the European Parliament as a legislative assembly and payments for MEPs will now be more transparent.  After 50 years of existence, the complex architecture behind the European Union, including the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the Parliament, are finally beginning to settle into a recognised and semi-permanent state.  It is unlikely there will be much more institutional tinkering because the Lisbon treaty is dedicated to creating structures which can accommodate further enlargement.  Only time will tell if the reversion to one Commissioner per member state is a good idea.Now that we are moving down the road towards moulding the structures of the European Union, it is time we paid more attention to the role of national parliaments.  Since we joined the EEC in 1973, the Oireachtas has scarcely progressed its structures to take account of membership.  Given that approximately 75% of legislation comes from the European Union, the Oireachtas plays an important part in transposing European directives.  Where we do not confer competence, however, Europe has no entitlement to interfere in our affairs.  We have not moved with the times in this regard.  Nearly 30 years after the establishment of the Joint Committee on European Affairs we finally established the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny.  The Labour Party proposed the establishment of the sub-committee in the aftermath of the rejection of the Nice Treaty in 2001 so that the Oireachtas could be made aware of what went on in the European Union.  Our entire involvement with the EU comprises two committees which seldom see the light of day.  Plenary discussions are virtually never held on EU matters.  The Taoiseach returned from Europe with a set of guarantees which we discussed for 80 minutes.  The only members allowed to contribute were the party spokespersons on Europe.  This is a serious matter and we need to address it.  We have spent an inordinate amount of time on the development of EU institutions and if we vote for the Lisbon treaty we will put in place the final stage of this process.  However, we have spent no time on reforming our own House or responding meaningfully to our participation in the EU.In the Lisbon treaty, the EU is telling national parliaments they should play a more significant role at every level of decision making.  The work programme is not proposed by the bureaucrats in the Commission.  They are entitled to be involved in its drafting but so are national parliaments.  We can demand that the programme includes serious issues such as transport, climate change and agriculture.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	457	This is how Members earn their money.  Europe is pushing parliaments towards a more central role but we are not taking a similar initiative to avail of the opportunities that now exist.  We can establish a stronger link with EU institutions and, in particular, with our MEPs so that important issues are raised at the outset, when we are composing legislation, rather than at the end, when we are transposing it.  That is one way by which MEPs can earn their salaries.  The Government operates at the Council of Europe but elected representatives can player a bigger role in the activities of the EU.The German constitutional court recently decided that the Lisbon treaty does not undermine the German constitution but that parliamentary mechanisms were required to ensure maximum participation in the treaty's provisions.  The German courts told legislators what they needed to do before they could fully ratify the treaty.  More than anything else, this legislation is about the principle of payment, how it will take place and the type of payment.  It is also about whether the payment of new members of the European Parliament will be struck not at the level of Members of the Oireachtas or any other EU national parliament, but at 38.5% of the basic pay of a judge of the European Court of Justice.  Courts of justice are certainly not on their uppers at present; they are doing quite well in that respect.  Most judges could volunteer to take a little cut in their payments, as we have seen in our own case.  I acknowledge, however, that the principle is important.I seek clarification on the national taxation side of it.  As I understand it, provision is made for the salary to be paid by the European Parliament and the Irish Government or the Oireachtas will act as the agent for payment.  The European Parliament will be the paymaster, but the Bill states that there will be no double taxation.  That seems to suggest the taxation that will take place is national taxation.  If the national taxation is the only one that takes place, we are reintroducing a new principle which will not be along the principle of parity of treatment.  It will undermine that if all national tax codes of the 27 member states will kick into place for that payment.  I would like some clarification on that matter to see if there is a common taxation of all MEPs' salaries.  Otherwise, it would seem that by simply applying national tax codes of member states one will be reintroducing the flaw that was there when the salary was tagged on to the salary of each national parliament.I suppose we will have to accept the idea that MEPs are barred from membership of certain bodies.  Members of the Oireachtas have been disbarred from membership of a range of bodies, including quangos, but in some cases one wonders why that situation is required.  If it is now established that members of parliament are to be disbarred by virtue of being members of parliament, then I would be inclined to agree that the principle should also extend to the European Parliament.I welcome the legislation and hope that it will prompt a wider debate in this House along the lines I have suggested.  We need a full-scale debate on our entire relationship to the European Union, not just concerning MEPs salaries.  The debate should include how that relationship has developed over the decades and what structures are pertinent to our present and future participation.  Maybe the time to do it is when, hopefully, the Lisbon treaty has been passed.  That will be the time for a broad-ranging discussion on the implications of the Lisbon treaty, the enhancement of EU structures and how the Oireachtas can maximise and optimise our involvement in the EU.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I wish to thank the spokespersons of the principal Opposition parties for their support for this Bill.  I strongly agree with most of the points that have been made.  Deputy Bruton was quite right to underline the point that the Lisbon treaty is intended to bring in more democracy at European level and not to take powers away from people or states.  I regard the EU as the greatest peace process in history at a regional level.  It seems utterly perverse that it should be misrepresented as an organisation in danger of becoming militaristic and aggressive.  I cannot for the life of me understand why the president of the Czech Republic, who lived under Soviet domination, should represent the EU as being in some way a reincarnation of the Soviet system.  I find it very hard to get into that mindset.Deputy Costello made the point that the Bill strengthens the independence of the European Parliament.  I believe the institutional balance is broadly a good one with some fine-tuning that is being provided in the Lisbon treaty.  There are opportunities for greater intervention and scrutiny by our own Parliament.  At the same time, however, I sometimes think that some of the things said on this topic may not always be completely realistic.  There is a mass of legislation and decision-making going on in the EU, so there must be a certain division of functions for things that are done at European level and those done at national level.  Given the complexity of the issues involved, I am not sure it is always realistic to think that we can monitor everything that is going on.  We must be prepared to delegate some of it, but we should certainly keep a close eye on the more important issues and, if necessary, make an input into them.Deputy Costello raised the issue of taxation of salaries.  Article 12.3 of the statute provides that it is a matter for each member state to consider whether national taxation provisions should be applied to the MEP's salary paid by the parliament, subject to the proviso that double taxation is avoided.  In the statute, the European Parliament considered that it would be appropriate to allow member states to apply national taxation provisions on MEPs' salaries if it so wished.  It is a discretionary provision and it is considered appropriate that as the current MEP salary at national level is subject to national taxation provisions, the latter should also be applied to the European Parliament salary.Section 5 inserts a new section 127A in the Taxes Consolidation Act.  To avoid double taxation this new section provides for the granting of a credit against Irish tax due on an MEP's salary of an amount equal to the tax paid by the MEP for the benefit of the communities in respect to that salary.  The section also clarifies under which income tax schedule an MEP's salary is taxable.Section 5(1) outlines the income tax schedule under which an MEP's salary falls to be charged to income tax of the State, and section 5(2) outlines that where a tax for the benefit of the European Communities is in respect of the salary of an MEP, such tax will be allowed as a credit against Irish tax due on that income.This legislation makes the necessary provision for the transitional elements of the statute adopted by the European institutions in July 2005.  The statute is the culmination of many years of discussion and negotiation among MEPs and similar discussions among and between the principal institutions of the European Union.  As a result, it represents the views and considerations of all member states and for the first time establishes a single and transparent system for remuneration of MEPs throughout the European Union.  The statute on which this Bill is based forms a single, universal and transparent set of terms and conditions under which all European parliamentarians will work.  It fulfils a long-standing ambition of the Parliament and reflects the growing role of the Parliament in the affairs of the European Union.The important and increasing role of the European Parliament is again reflected and enhanced by the Lisbon treaty.  The treaty increases the number of areas in which the European Parliament will share the task of law-making with the Council of Ministers through co-decision, and the Parliament's budgetary role will also be strengthened.  One of the key trends in the Lisbon treaty is the strengthened role it gives to both national parliaments and the European Parliament.  The European Parliament, directly elected by EU citizens, gets important new powers in the EU legislative process, where in many areas it is placed on an equal footing with the Council, representing the governments of the member states.Under the treaty, the usual method of legislating will be the "ordinary legislative procedure" contained in Article 294 TFEU, which involves co-decision between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  The move to the ordinary legislative procedure as the standard decision-making process for Union legislation represents a substantial democratisation of the EU legislative process, by virtue of the broader range of areas in which the role of the European Parliament is increased.  These include agriculture, fisheries, Structural Funds, transport and the entirety of what we now call justice and home affairs, which is the third pillar of the Union.  Ireland's opt-in arrangement for justice and home affairs adds an extra layer of parliamentary scrutiny to this, in that our participation in justice and home affairs measures is subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.The treaty also proposes to introduce new budgetary provisions to increase the role of the European Parliament in respect of the Union's budget.  The current distinction between "compulsory", that is, predominantly agricultural, and "non-compulsory" expenditure will be abolished.  Under the existing treaties, the European Parliament has only an advisory role in respect of compulsory expenditure.  Under the Lisbon treaty, the agreement of the European Parliament will be required in respect of the whole budget, including agricultural spending as contained in Article 314 TFEU.  These are important developments and emphasise the increasingly significant role which our recently elected MEPs will play on behalf of Ireland and the European Union.  I am sure the House will join me in wishing those MEPs all the best in delivering their mandate for the Irish and European citizen in the years ahead.

I heard the response to Deputy Costello's question on where it is decided that Irish taxation should apply.  Will the pension levy apply in this case?  My understanding is that in the long term, these pensions will not be derived from Irish sources, so what taxes will apply?  The Minister of State referred to tax under Schedule E.  Will he elaborate on precisely which taxes are intended to apply?

I know that all human decisions are not perfect, but that seems to be a strange contradiction.  From time to time, various budgetary elements are introduced such as levies.  Do these apply to MEPs?  Do they apply to new MEPs?  MEPs that are re-elected can chose to continue with the national salary rather than the European parity salary, so it would seem that there will be two distinct salary payments and two distinct taxation systems.  We need some clarification on this point.

I would differ from Deputy Costello in one respect.  Let us suppose that there was a common EU taxation system for MEPs such as that which applies to European Commission officials.  It is a relatively low level of taxation by our own national standards.  The perception would be that when one takes salary and all the various allowances and supports, MEPs would be generally regarded as well remunerated.  The public here, who send our MEPs to Europe, would probably be happier that they would be subject to national taxation provisions.  Like all public representatives, other than those who live and work in the centre of this city, MEPs are bilocated between the European Parliament and their home country residences.  In that respect they differ from European Commission officials, the majority of whom live away from home most of the year.Normal national taxes will apply in all respects with credit for tax paid to the EU to avoid double taxation.  The taxation reflects the fact that MEPs will continue to reside and be based here at least in part.

Will the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment negotiate with the company with a view to retaining as many of these jobs as possible in County Laois?Last Friday on 26 June, the workers in the plant in Rathdowney were called in by management for an announcement and they received the very severe news.  The Meadow Meats factory, as it is known locally, is part of the Dawn Meats factory group.  The workers were told the company proposed to close the boning hall and the packing area in the factory, which has been in Rathdowney for many years.  The boning hall is where the meat is cut up.  It is ultimately packed for order in the packing area.This is a very profitable company — it is not  being closed because it is a loss-making business.  This company has extensive plants in Cork, Waterford, although technically on the Kilkenny-Waterford border, and in Ballyhaunis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, will be aware of the Dawn Meats factory in Ballyhaunis because it is in his constituencyI am sure the Minister has had discussions with the company because it would have applied to the Department for grants for improvement works at its various plants.  To my knowledge, the company, unfortunately, did not include Rathdowney in that proposal.Will the Minister give some information on the plans for the abattoir, or the killing plant?  Will the workers employed in that section be able to continue in employment there in the years to come?  A number of the workers in the factory in Rathdowney have been good and loyal workers.  Some of them have worked there for 20 to 30 years.  Meat factories are not the highest paying factories in the country but during the years of the Celtic tiger, the workforce remained loyal to the company in the town.  They could have left for better paying jobs in the short term but they stuck it out for the long haul.People will be also aware that there was a fine zinc mine, Galmoy, in the immediate Rathdowney area.  It is only a few miles from Rathdowney on the Johnstown Road to County Kilkenny.  It also ceased operations recently.The loss of 120 jobs at Meadow Meats, Rathdowney, is devastating for the employees and their families, many of whom have large mortgages and financial commitments.  SIPTU is in negotiations with the company on the redundancies and I wish it success in this regard.  The main difficulty for Rathdowney is that it has no alternative sources of employment.  Effects on the town's community and local businesses will be severe.  Any threat to the abattoir's future will also cause problems for local farmers who supply cattle to the factory.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should call in IDA Ireland officials to acquaint them with County Laois.  I know no one at senior level in the IDA who is acquainted with the county.  IDA Ireland's track record in County Laois is the worst for any county.  No Member will recall an IDA announcement for serious job creation in the county in over 20 years.  Fewer than 100 IDA-supported jobs have been provided in the county, the lowest national figure.As we have given up having faith in IDA Ireland in County Laois, I hope it and Enterprise Ireland can find some replacement jobs.  I hope the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will, through her office, do what is possible to minimise these recent job losses in County Laois.  I accept Meadow Meats has offered alternative employment in its sister Waterford plant.  However, a proper transport allowance would have to be provided to travel the 200 km round trip every day between Rathdowney and Grannagh, County Waterford.  For many employees and their families, this will not be a practical alternative.  I ask that a good redundancy structure be put in place and for a commitment that those jobs remaining at the Rathdowney plant will be guaranteed into the long term.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I thank Deputy Fleming for raising this matter on the Adjournment.I am aware of the situation in Rathdowney and am concerned about the situation at the plant in question.  I understand jobs are being transferred to Grannagh, County Waterford, as part of the company's rationalisation strategy to bring scale to its boning activities.  I am aware of the effect the transferring of these jobs will have on the workers involved and their families, as well as on the local community.The company is rationalising its existing facilities to yield significant savings.  It submitted a business plan under the beef and sheep meat fund, administered by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  This business plan was approved by Enterprise Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Government.  It is being undertaken to increase capacity utilisation, cut costs, enhance scale and international competitiveness and it is in line with the sectorial strategy for the beef sector.As part of the company's rationalisation strategy, it is amalgamating boning activities in Rathdowney and at its site in Grannagh in County Waterford.  Up to 100 operative jobs will be transferred to Grannagh by the end of August 2009.  While 100 members of staff in the Rathdowney facility are being offered positions at the Grannagh facility, the remaining 100 employees will be retained in slaughtering on the current site in County Laois.  Employment in the Waterford plant is expected to exceed 300 by 2011.With the implementation of this business plan, the company forecasts it will increase employment from 1,400 to almost 1,500 between 2009 and 2012 across three plants.  Sales at the company are forecast to rise significantly with exports expected to increase significantly.  The gross investment planned by the company in Ireland over this time is also very significant.To ensure job creation and job retention, the Government, through the State development agencies and other interested parties, adopts a co-ordinated approach in dealing with the particular situation.  All the agencies work together in making people aware of the supports available to assist in finding new employment or to start their own businesses.While there has been a decline in the multinational sector in County Laois in recent years, IDA Ireland is marketing Portlaoise as a key location for investment in the globally traded services sector.  A significant investment has been made in a quality flagship business park in Portlaoise.  This is now an integral part of the agency's international marketing programme.In addition, the State development agency Enterprise Ireland, responsible for the promotion of indigenous industry, is continuing to address enterprise development in County Laois with several of its client companies developing their businesses there.  The agency works intensively with companies, both individually and in sectorial groups, to help them exploit market opportunities and to promote innovation and enhance their international capabilities.The Laois County Enterprise Board continues to provide support for the micro-enterprise sector in the county.  This year, it will continue to be actively involved in the county's economic development, ensuring that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development throughout the locality.The strategies and policies being pursued by the State development agencies in Rathdowney and County Laois will continue to support enterprise development and job creation in the area.  The State agencies will continue to work closely with each other and with local interests to assist in maintaining an integrated approach to investment and enterprise development.  This will be particularly important for workers who are not in a position to relocate to County Waterford and want to remain in County Laois.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	469	Waterford has traditionally been a modern manufacturing centre since the 1950s.  During the past ten years, there have been substantial job losses in this sector, however.  Unfortunately, no real strategy has been developed at national level in replacing these manufacturing jobs.If the trend continues, the amount of manufacturing industry left in Waterford in ten years time will be a matter of grave concern.  In regard to the Waterford constituency, as of last Friday the live register for Dungarvan was 2,209 while the live register for Waterford city was 12,250.  The comparative figures for the same weekend last year were 1,256 for Dungarvan as against 7,466 for Waterford.  These figures represent an increase of 4,794 for Waterford city and an increase of 953 for Dungarvan.A further blow for Waterford yesterday was the announcement that another 120 jobs are to go at the Bausch & Lomb plant.  For the 1,100 employees who will remain at Bausch & Lomb, major issues regarding competitiveness of the plant must be addressed.  Already some production of Bausch & Lomb's range of contact lenses is moving to the parent plant in Rochester, New York State.This followed the announcement last week that ABB Transformers Limited in Waterford will cease production at the end of March 2010 with the loss of 178 jobs.  Transformers have been manufactured at the same site in Waterford for 40 years.  The plant is currently building a transformer for Great Garbert wind farm on the Thames in south England and one for Hunter's Hill in County Fermanagh.The Government, particularly the Green Party members, makes great play of the green economy.  I have already taken up the moving forward of wind generation electricity projects with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, so that ABB would be in a position to tender for the transformers in such operations.  If the State is to move forward on alternative energy sources in a meaningful way, surely the national capacity for producing transformers, a vital part of such development, needs to be maintained and indeed developed.Many companies in Waterford are on short time.  I understand one is because it is awaiting payment from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Manufacturing of crystal in Waterford ended this year.  In 1988, Waterford Crystal employed 3,200 people at three plants in Kilbarry, Dungarvan and Butlerstown.  Waterford Crystal employees are still awaiting payment of minimum notice and holiday pay entitlements from the insolvency fund in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to rectify this position.For the past ten years, the Government had no effective strategy in place to retain manufacturing jobs, to expand on existing employment, to attract new investment and to encourage local entrepreneurs to develop projects and employment in the areas where we can best compete.  The key to such a strategy should be the upgrading of Waterford Institute of Technology to university status so that Waterford and the south east region can develop a research and development capacity and provide the fourth level education that is needed to allow the region to prosper.  The structures that need to be put in place should include each of the many effective players in the Waterford area.  Real Government intervention is urgently needed in the Waterford area to deal with the developing jobs crisis.  There is a great need to draw on the resources of the trade union movement as a full and equal partner in the context of the developments that will take place.  The role of the trade union movement in dealing with the crisis on the ground needs to be recognised as the positive contribution it is.  It is totally and utterly unacceptable that the situation is being allowed to drift at present.  I demand that urgent, appropriate and effective action be taken by the Government to ensure Waterford's long-term future.  The loss of so much manufacturing and construction employment is also having a detrimental effect on the retail sector, which is a large employer in Waterford.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I thank Deputy O'Shea for raising this important issue.  I will give the House the most up-to-date information on the unemployment situation in Waterford.  The most recent live register figures that are broken down by region were published in May.  They showed that 13,661 people — 9,047 male and 4,614 female — were signing on the register in County Waterford at that time.  The national live register figures for the end of June, which were published earlier this week, showed the continued strong upward trend in the number of people signing on the dole.  When seasonal factors are taken into account, some 413,500 people were signing on the live register last month.  That figure represents a month-on-month increase of 11,400.  On the basis of the figures I have given the House, our standardised unemployment rate is currently 11.9%.  It is worth pointing out that in the 12-month period to the end of May 2009, some 144,000 people left the live register as they had secured employment, which shows that jobs continue to be created.  We need to tailor our activation measures to ensure unemployed people have the best chance of securing employment as soon as possible.  We can agree that the current economic crisis probably represents the greatest challenge to this country's well-being since the 1980s.  Our public finances have deteriorated, our unemployment rates continue to rise and our banking system is need of continued remedial action.The aim of IDA Ireland's strategy for County Waterford is to make progress with the development of a knowledge-based economy so that the county and, particularly, the gateway of Waterford city can compete nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment.  The strategy includes the provision of world-class property and supporting infrastructure of scale in the Waterford city area.  Enterprise Ireland delivers a wide range of supports to Irish companies.  The supports are targeted at the specific requirements of clients in all regions, including Waterford, to ensure that they develop to their full potential in terms of employment, innovation and exports and, in turn, stimulate job creation.Enterprise Ireland, which recognises the significant changes presented by the current state of the economy, has prepared a new recovery strategy.  The strategy involves the management of the enterprise stabilisation fund, which provides €100 million to help viable but vulnerable companies to overcome the current economic difficulties.  The Waterford city and county enterprise boards serve the Waterford region by providing support for the micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases, promoting and developing indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulating economic activity and entrepreneurship throughout the county.  The stimulation of entrepreneurship can positively contribute to job creation by leading to the establishment of viable growth-orientated businesses.The Government is acutely aware of the negative impact unemployment can have on individuals, families and society as a whole.  It has invested substantial resources to address this problem.  In 2009, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is investing €1 billion in a range of labour force activation measures to assist the unemployed.  For example, the Department and FÁS have put in place measures to double their capacity to deal with the increase in live register referrals from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The implementation of these measures has increased the annual referral capacity to 147,000 people this year.Since the end of 2008, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, through FÁS, has almost doubled its provision of training and work experience activation places for the unemployed.  Over 128,000 such places are available to assist those who have lost their jobs.  The places are available on a broad range of programmes, including FÁS specific skills training courses, bridging foundation traineeships and newer programmes such as the work placement programme.  The latter programme offers a six-month work placement to unemployed people, while allowing them to retain their social welfare payments.  All the programmes are available and being delivered in County Waterford.To date in 2009, FÁS employment services in Waterford have placed over 1,000 people in employment, education and training courses.  FÁS has provided guidance and training to 420 redundant Waterford Crystal employees since January 2009.  There has been considerable engagement between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the management of Waterford Crystal on the payment of the outstanding amounts.  I pay tribute to the team in the insolvency unit, which has dealt with this matter as constructively as possible.  I assure Deputy O'Shea that a great deal of work is taking place to ensure that those payments are made.  I will continue to update him on the progress being made in that regard.  The Government remains committed to meeting the ongoing challenges in the labour market.  In addition to specific training activation measures, the Government will continue to focus on supporting and promoting enterprise development to create new jobs at national and county level.  Continuing to support employment creation will be the key determinant in addressing our current unemployment problem.  In the interim, we will continue to provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities to those who find themselves out of employment so they will be able to avail of future employment opportunities.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I thank the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, for coming to the House to respond to this Adjournment debate.  Fine Gael recognises the need to achieve value for money on behalf of taxpayers and consumers.  We want to support the Minister to this end.  However, we are concerned that a recent decision made by the Minister could have a negative impact on patients and jobs.  The reputed sharp 34% decrease in payments to pharmacists from the HSE could well result in the loss of jobs and the closure of many community pharmacies, thereby reducing choice and service to patients.  This might be avoided if other options were considered.  Perhaps the Minister could engage with the pharmacists to agree a phased approach, loaded upfront if necessary, that would achieve the same savings over a number of years.  The Dorgan report, which was commissioned by the Minister or the HSE, recommended that change should be phased in.  I agree with the Minister that it is not acceptable that it costs €600 million to deliver pharmaceuticals worth €1.2 billion to our people.As I said at the outset, I support the Minister for Health and Children's intention in this respect.  However, I am concerned that patients will suffer as a consequence of the sharp reduction in payments to pharmacists.  Perhaps the Minister will consider engaging with the Irish Pharmacy Union in a more phased manner.  Now that she has made the order, the Minister has the upper hand and may find the union much easier to deal with.  Now that many pharmacists have issued notice of their intention to withdraw services, I ask the Minister to set out her contingency plans to ensure continuity of supply to patients, which must be our primary concern.Given that older people use pharmacy services to a greater extent than any other age group, I suggest that the Minister should instruct the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Áine Brady, to take personal responsibility for supervising the contingency plans.  Such a course of action should be not construed as removing responsibility for continuity of supply from the Minister herself.  We cannot allow the circumstances that prevailed during the methadone dispensing crisis, for example, to be repeated.  The Minister has 30 days to take action.  I am sure it is within her remit to open negotiations on another front to see if a crisis can be avoided in this instance.  She needs to be well prepared if she is to ensure that patients do not suffer as a consequence of the actions of pharmacists.

The Minister's approach is based on section 9 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  When that legislation was being considered in this House, it was understood that health professionals would have to take a hit of approximately 8%.  I understand that is the percentage for GPs and other health professions.  Why are pharmacists being asked to take such a large hit in comparison to others?  They have told us it is 34%.  I remind the Minister that when the Progressive Democrat Party, which I believe is now no more——

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	474	——opened up the market — she was certainly a PD at that time — it allowed many young pharmacists to come into the pharmacy business.  They came in on the basis of the type of mark-ups and reimbursements that have been there, at least up to now, and were there at the time.  Many young pharmacists took out bank loans and now have very high overheads as a consequence of the opening up of the market.  They are now effectively being cut off at the knees by this measure.  I ask the Minister to understand where they are coming from.  I am not concerned about the large multiple pharmacies, but I am concerned about the community pharmacists who are trying to make ends meet and are genuinely worried about having to lay off staff.I am also very much concerned about the patients who will be impacted by this move.  I ask the Minister to meet them on a fair basis to try to find a solution to this issue.  Ms Liz Hoctor, president of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, said: "Our position is a responsible one.  We know we have to play our part in reducing costs and we are ready and willing to do so.  Indeed, we already offered to take an 8% cut in our fees."They appear to me to be as willing as any other health professional group to take their fair share of cuts.  They have also told me that they have suggested a further €30 million could be saved on generic prescribing, if they were allowed as pharmacists to substitute generic products responsibly for patented products.  Will the Minister explain why it is necessary to be so confrontational with pharmacists?  We had the battles last year and now we have this battle again.  When it came to the consultants, for example, the Minister was able to take years to reach an agreement with them whereas the pharmacists are being dealt with at arms length in this type of confrontational manner, which can and will lead, if something is not done, to severe difficulties for medical card patients in particular.I urge the Minister to adopt some type of an approach that will meet the pharmacists half way to try to find the savings necessary without everybody having to suffer the pain that appears to be facing us.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I am happy to be here to respond to the Adjournment motions tabled by the Deputies.  I hold pharmacists in very high regard.  I have played my part in opening up the market opportunities for young pharmacists here, particularly those who were educated abroad and did not have an opportunity to open their own businesses.The fact is that we will spend €16 billion on public health services this year.  We all know that this is an incredible amount of money, some 40% of the tax we will raise during 2009.  Since 2002, the cost to the State of pharmacy services has doubled.  No other professional group in Ireland has had its fees from the State double, or anything near it, and that is why pharmacists are different from others to whom the 8% applies.  As has been acknowledged, we spend €640 million to get €1 billion worth of product from the factory to the patients in the community.  By any standards, that is excessive.  In 2008, we gave €440 million by way of mark-up and fees and almost €200 million as the wholesale margin.  The article in The Irish Times today referred to by the Deputy, where Ms Hoctor said they were prepared to give up 8%, or €21 million, would mean that fees were only €260 million, equivalent to 2002 to 2003 levels.  Their fees are actually €550 million, so unless we are going to start dealing with the facts we will not be able to have an informed debate.The fact is that we have major pressures in our public health service.  Since 2001, the Brennan commission has recommended change in this area.  In the meantime, since 2002, pharmacy fees have doubled and that is not sustainable.  I recognise and accept that some pharmacists have excessive debt, but it is not the duty of the State to overpay by way of fees in order to deal with those in that situation and neither could the State ever be expected to do so.  It would be highly inappropriate of the State, because an individual or individuals may have excessive bank debts and perhaps borrowed money to pay to doctors and others to get into the pharmacy business, to continue to pay excessive fees to sustain that situation.Regarding income, pharmacists said in 2007 that they had a turnover of €3 billion.  This year, we will take €55 million and next year it will be €133 million.  They also said in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report that 49% of their income comes from the State.  That means we are taking 25% of the 49%, or effectively 12.5%.  We are taking €133 million away from what pharmacists said in 2007 was a turnover of €3 billion.  I have not seen where the 34% comes from but it does not make any sense to me.I left a meeting with Professor Drumm and others from the HSE and the Secretary General of my Department, who were discussing contingency arrangements, to come to the House for this debate.  I have a number of things to say to patients.  I certainly hope that commercial disputes between the State and the pharmacists will not interfere with patient care, and we are determined that no medical card patient will have to pay for his or her medication.  Plans will be put in place and they will be well advertised over the coming days in that regard.  We have to assess the tenor of the letter that has been received.  Some pharmacies have indicated an intention to withdraw, while a small number have indicated that they are withdrawing.  We have to seek clarification of that but, clearly, there are ethical responsibilities on pharmacists to supply sick people with their medication.  That is a matter for the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland as the regulator.  It is not a matter for me, nor is it one in which I intend to engage.I have been asked why we did not introduce the Dorgan report.  The Dorgan body was established in the context of pharmacists having the wholesale margin reduced from 17.6% to 8%.  As the House knows, the High Court found that although the principle was fine, the process was wrong and, therefore, we could not proceed with it.  The recommendations made arose out of that context.  If that had gone ahead — it was in place last year for a number of months — and we had applied the 8% on top of this, it actually would have been a greater sum.  Dorgan said we should not completely eliminate the 50% mark-up.  My intention originally was to have no mark-up, just a dispensing fee.  We have not eliminated the mark-up, but reduced it from 50% to 20%.  We have reduced the wholesale margin from 17.6% to 10%, instead of 8%, and we have abolished the €33 million which was paid for the over-70s because we have eliminated the automatic right to the over-70s medical card.This is not the end of the story.  We are going to move to reference pricing for off-patent products and the HSE is looking at the issues surrounding hi-tech drugs.  We need to do much more to continue to reduce the cost of delivering medication to patients, and I accept this is not the total picture reference.  Pricing is important and legislation must be provided in that regard.  I am in discussions with Professor Drumm and others on that matter and there are also issues to be addressed around the high-tech scheme.  It comes to this: when faced with very difficult choices the €55 million we will get this year is half the money we spend on home care packages and a quarter of what we spend on home helps.  It is factored into the HSE's budget for this year.Based on legal advice, we used the provisions in the emergency legislation to deal with this issue, and I believe it is appropriate in all the circumstances.  As I said, the High Court found the HSE was not entitled to reduce the wholesale margin, but the Minister had the authority to do so.  Based on legal advice, we have used the opportunity presented in the legislation to reduce the cost of delivering pharmaceutical products to patients.  We have taken the fees we have paid to pharmacists back this year to what they were in 2007.  Next year, the €133 million reduction will bring them back to what they were in 2006.  I do not believe anyone could argue that the fees paid in 2006 to 2007 did not provide for sustainable pharmacy businesses in Ireland.I am delighted to have had the opportunity to respond to this debate.  I am sorry that the time is very limited, but I assure the Deputies opposite that I am working with Professor Drumm, the Secretary General of my Department and others to ensure that appropriate contingency arrangements are in place so that patients can get their medication and to ensure that medical card holders in particular, the poorest in our society, do not become the victims of a commercial dispute between the Government and pharmacists.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I welcome the Minister to the House.  As he is very well aware, there has been ongoing lobbying about Portlean national school, although this may be the first time it has formally appeared on his desk.  We are living in difficult economic times and must examine certain areas where we can make savings.  However we must keep a very sharp focus on our education system.  We must work towards the future and if we make trimmings in the budget regarding covering the proper educational needs of children at a primary level we will face grave danger in years to come.In September, one teacher will have sole responsibility for five class bands ranging from junior infants to third class.  The second teacher will have 24 children in three class bands.  While this is not unique I would like to be specific on the five class bands with 24 children.  I recognise the role of the teacher in the educational curriculum, which states that it is "informed by a concern for the uniqueness of the child".  One teacher has to come in every day to satisfy the specific point in the curriculum and address the uniqueness of each child for junior and senior infants and first, second and third classes.The curriculum also states that there is a responsibility to "ensure that the complexity of children's learning needs is served by a learning process that is rich and varied."  It will be varied, but will it be rich?  I have to say, "No."  Added to that band of five classes, there are the specific educational needs of certain children.  Taking into consideration that all children have the right to access to the highest quality education appropriate to their needs, in September a teacher will go home every evening having to prepare eight different levels of work in 11 subject areas.  This is impossible.We must think of our experiences at school.  The Minister knows the needs of a third class student and a junior infant are completely different.  At junior infant level there is much role play and development work on social skills and oral work.  That is fundamental at junior and senior infants level.Into the bargain at Portlean national school, the extension was completed in 2007.  The then Minister, Deputy Hanafin, participated and we had great fanfare in the local community, which was welcomed.  I welcomed this and participated in the celebrations.  However in September, because the school is one student short of the number that would ensure it is a three-class school, there will be an empty classroom built and funded by the Government.  The Minister is conscientious about his brief.  Is it right that we have invested in a new classroom only to leave it idle because of a new quota system introduced?This backdated quota ruling was a sinister move.  A school with 48 students and three classrooms — because there are not 49 pupils on the roll book and because of the backdated ruling — will have only two teachers, and one teacher will have five different bands to work with while there is an empty classroom.Is this right?  I know the Minister will say it is not, and he will talk about the economic climate and cutbacks.  Irrespective of the civil servant's script he has before him and the sinister ruling, I ask the Minister to take personal responsibility on this issue.  It is not morally right that we have five different bands of students to one teacher.  It goes against the grain of the curriculum and who we are as a nation in terms of putting our children before everything to ensure we work towards our future.  I ask the Minister for his intervention, irrespective of the script.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment this evening.  The Minister is committed to providing information on the allocation of teachers to schools and this is a new feature on the Department's website.  The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the revised schedule for 2009-2010.In terms of the position at individual primary school level, the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by the Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.  The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in the Department, enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.The Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September 2009.  To ensure relevant information is openly available to the public, detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on the Department's website.  This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts, a net reduction of 254 posts.  It is the Minister's intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.The final position for any one school will depend on a number of factors such as the additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly, to which I have already referred, and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.  The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the primary staffing appeals board will have been considered.At its meeting on 14 May 2009, the appeal board considered an appeal submitted by the board of management of the school in question, Portlean national school.  The appeal was considered under section 10 of the primary staffing schedule, circular 02/2009, which is available on the Department's website.  The board decided that a departure from the staffing schedule was not warranted in this case.  The appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.I will set out for the Deputy the staffing arrangement in place if a school is losing a post due to falling enrolments.  In such instance the most junior teacher is offered redeployment panel rights.  The redeployment panel system, agreed between the patron bodies of primary schools and the INTO, serves as a means for redeployment of eligible permanent teachers in schools where posts are suppressed to schools with vacancies.  Panels are determined by the patronage of the school and the final decision to admit a teacher to the panel rests with the patron.Once the panel system is in operation schools are obliged to offer any permanent vacancy to teachers on the panel.  Teachers placed on the panel are obliged to accept the first offer of employment from schools within a 45 km radius of their existing school.  If a teacher has been on the panel for more than three years, the 45 km limit no longer applies.  A teacher on the redeployment panel awaiting an offer of a teaching post in another school remains employed in his or her existing school and must act as replacement teacher for absences of other teachers in the school.  The teacher placed on the redeployment panel from the school referred to by the Deputy has been successfully redeployed.I thank the Deputy for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to outline the position.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	478	Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my  Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil  enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school management authority is  required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved  teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range  of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in  the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.I have always accepted and acknowledged that the decision in the Budget last  October to increase the pupil teacher ratio across all second-level schools  will have an impact on class sizes and subject choices in our post-primary  schools from the commencement of the 2009/10 school year.Schools will make choices as a consequence of the changes made in the Budget.Some will decide to increase class size particularly in the subjects taken by  most students. Some may decide to eliminate some subjects from the choice of  subjects that they offer. Some will combine increasing the numbers in some  classes with eliminating subjects. In making such decisions individual schools  may also decide to prioritise some subjects or programmes over others. Some  schools may give a priority to Junior cycle or particular subjects at Junior  cycle and others may prioritise Senior Cycle and particular Leaving Certificate  subjects.At the level of individual schools the changes in relation to the allocation of  teaching posts will impact in different ways depending on whether enrolment is  rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers  than it is entitled to under the allocation processes. Across the school system  generally there will inevitably be an impact on class sizes and my Department  will through the normal process of examining applications for curricular  concessions endeavour to ensure continuity of provision for those already  preparing for the certificate examinations. The changes at second level are  more likely to impact on the range of subjects that schools will be able to  offer those starting the Junior or Leaving Certificate programmes next  September.I undertook to publish information in relation to the allocation of teachers to  schools and this was done earlier this year in relation to primary schools. The  Deputy may be interested to know that information on the current position  regarding teacher allocations to second level schools, whether enrolment  related or otherwise, will be published on my Department's website shortly. My  intention is that, just as is the case with the information provided in  relation to primary schools, this information will identify the changed  position for second level schools and VECs arising from the October budget  decisions. The information will represent the position at this stage and is not  the final position. At this point allocations for such as special needs,  language support and curricular needs are still in process. The information  will be further updated later in the year when final allocations are determined  and the final position regarding supernumerary posts remaining in school emerges.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	479	The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an application to my Department for large scale capital funding for a new school.Following an assessment, the proposed project was assigned a Band Rating of 1.1 in accordance with the Department's published prioritisation criteria and it  was determined that a 24 classroom school would be required to meet the short  to medium term needs of the area.A technical examination concluded that the development of a 24 classroom school building on the existing school site would not be feasible.My Department has inspected several sites suggested by the school authorities  to assess their suitability.  It is intended that the Department will commence  the acquisition of a site in the coming months.Once the site has been acquired, the progression of this large scale project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in  the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme. At this stage, it is not possible to give an exact timescale for  the commencement of construction.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	480	The majority of schools include among their pupils children with disadvantaged backgrounds. In general, most schools address the individual needs of these children without recourse to additional targeted resources.  Evidence has shown that disadvantage associated with poverty and social  exclusion assumes a multiplier effect where the levels are highly concentrated  in schools.DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for  educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying  levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP). As a result of the identification and review processes, 876 schools have been  included in the School Support Programme (SSP) under DEIS. These comprise 673 primary schools (urban and rural) and 203 second-level schools.The plan commenced in 2006 and is being rolled out on a phased basis over the period to 2010.DEIS provides various supports for both primary and post primary schools. These include:reduced pupil teacher ratio in primary schools in urban areas with most  disadvantage;allocation of administrative principal on lower figures than generally apply  in primary schools in urban areas;additional capitation funding based on level of disadvantage;additional funding for schools books;access to School Meals Programme;access to numeracy/literacy supports and measures at primary level;access to Home School Community Liaison services;access to School Completion Programme;enhanced guidance counselling provision at post primary level;access to planning supports;provision for school library and librarian support at second level;access to Junior Certificate School Programme and Leaving Certificate Applied;access to a range of professional development supports.In line with my focus on retaining resources in the most disadvantaged areas,  it is important to note that following Budget 2009, all existing DEIS supports  in DEIS schools are not being affected.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	481	A Code of Practice in relation to "The Provision of Schools and the Planning System", which was published in July 2008 sets out the best practice approaches that should be followed by planning authorities and by my Department in ensuring that the planning system plays its full part in facilitating the timely and cost-effective provision of school facilities.This Code of Practice, which was published as a statutory planning guideline,  sets out the fundamental principles or agreed actions that will foster greater  partnership between the planning authorities and my Department.These principles include:1. Forecasting Future Education Demand,2. Planning for New Schools through Local Authority Development Plans,3. Planning Considerations relating to the location of schools,4. Site Development Standards,5. School Development Proposals and the Development Management Process,6. School Site Identification and Acquisition.My Department has met with a representative sub-group of the City and County  Managers' Association on three separate occasions, in December 2008 and in  January and March of this year. At these meetings, draft versions of the  proposed Memorandum of Understanding in relation to the acquisition of sites  for school planning purposes were discussed.At the last meeting on 5 March 2009 with the City and County Managers'  Association sub-group, it was concluded that the draft was advanced enough to  allow for consideration and agreement by the City and County Managers'  Association.My Department is awaiting the agreement of the City and County Managers'  Association following which, my Department will report to me.I am satisfied that, taking into account the period of time since the  publication of the Code of Practice, significant progress on developing  greater levels of integration between my Department and the local government  sector has been achieved. Following final agreement on the proposed Memorandum of Understanding, I expect to see this partnership approach develop further in the coming year.

The Taoiseach  conveyed the view of the Government and indeed the wider public that further  substantial contributions are required from the Congregations by way of  reparation.  Furthermore, the contributions need to be capable of being  assessed by the public for their significance by reference to the full  resources available to the Congregations and in the context of the costs of  well over a billion euro being borne by the State.  The Taoiseach asked the  Congregations to revert with proposals in this regard.The same group again met with the representatives of the various religious  congregations on Wednesday 24th June at which the Religious Congregations   reported on the progress they had made in compiling reports on their financial  positions.  It is expected that reports signed off on by their financial  advisors will be submitted by the congregations to the Government by  mid-July when a further meeting will be held.The Taoiseach has stated that the Government would now move to appoint a panel of three independent persons to assess the material submitted by the congregations and report to Government as to the adequacy of these statements as a basis for assessing the resources of the Congregations.

The assessment as an independent mature student has to be carefully  considered to ensure it is targeted at very specific circumstances where mature  students can demonstrate that they have been genuinely living independently of  their parents for a period of time. I have no plans at present to alter the  residency requirements for independent mature status.In order to establish the candidate's status as an independent mature student,  documentary evidence is required as proof of a candidate's ordinary/permanent  address from 1st October of the year preceding entry to college.  Awarding  authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable  degree of proof has been submitted by the grant applicant.  An affidavit in  isolation cannot be accepted as sole proof of residency.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	484	There has been ongoing engagement and discussion with the relevant education  partners involving me and/or my senior officials concerning general education  matters and specific budgetary matters since the budget announcements last  October.To be clear there is no doubt that the budget measures concerning staffing will  have an impact. There is simply no easy way to control or reduce public  expenditure.At the level of individual schools the changes in relation to the allocation of  teaching posts will impact in different ways depending on whether enrolment is  rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers  than it is entitled to under the allocation processes. Across the school system  generally there will inevitably be an impact on class sizes and at post-primary  level the changes will impact on the capacity of individual schools to offer as  wide a range of subject choices as heretofore in future years. My Department  will through the normal processing of examining applications for curricular  concessions endeavour to ensure continuity of provision for those already  preparing for the certificate examinations. The changes at second level are  therefore more likely to impact on the range of subjects that schools will be  able to offer to those starting the Junior or Leaving Certificate programmes  next September.I undertook to publish information in relation to the allocation of teachers to  schools and this was done earlier this year in relation to primary schools. The  Deputy may be interested to know that information on the current position  regarding teacher allocations to second level schools, whether enrolment  related or otherwise, will be published on my Department's website in the  coming week. My intention is that, just as is the case with the information  provided in relation to primary schools, this information will identify the  changed position for second level schools and VECs arising from the October  budget decisions. The information will be further updated later in the year  when final allocations are determined.All the above allocations, primary and post-primary are provisional at this  stage and reflect the initial allocation position. The final position for any  one school will depend on a number of other factors such as the allocation of  support teachers, additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and  posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until  the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for  mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Boards  will have been considered. The appellate process is particularly relevant at  post-primary level where any specific curricular needs of the school concerned  are considered. Also at post-primary there is no effective system wide  redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools may end up retaining teachers, though over quota.

There are a number of reasons why  progress to Committee Stage with the Bill has taken longer than originally  anticipated. A number of amendments had to be considered arising from a review of the Bill following the Second Stage debate, further consultations since  publication and legal advice received.Given the range and complexity of the issues to be resolved, it is now more  likely that the Bill will progress to committee stage in the autumn session.My Department will continue to liaise with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on  Education and Science in this regard with a view to moving forward as  expeditiously as possible as soon as the proposed amendments have been  finalised.

The representatives were told that the needs of survivors of abuse are a particular priority of the Government at this time.The Taoiseach pointed out that the Government have accepted all of the  recommendations of the Commission and are committed to their full  implementation.  Mr Cowen also referred to the fact that the Government had  called on representatives of the religious Congregations concerned to make  further substantial contributions by way of reparation.The Taoiseach also stressed that those who perpetrated crimes against  survivors, no matter how long ago, must be made amenable to the law so that  they can be held to account for such crimes. He added that an Assistant Garda  Commissioner has been tasked with examining the totality of the Commission  Report and that criminal investigations are continuing in respect of a  significant number of people.The Taoiseach told those present that Minister Barry Andrews will bring to  Government before the end of July a comprehensive implementation plan to put in place the recommendations of the report.As well as listening to the issues raised by survivor groups at the meeting,  each group was asked to make a submission outlining the needs of survivors  going forward.  All of the issues raised, together with the recommendations of  the Report, will be considered in full by the Government.

There are many complex and competing considerations involved.  These include considerations relating to institutional funding, family affordability, equity, participation and value for money for the taxpayer.  However, it is an issue that merits consideration at this important juncture in the development of higher education and also given the current economic circumstances.My officials are finalising a technical report on the various options available. This will look at available models, drawing on experience with those that have operated internationally.  It will assess the potential policy, cost and revenue impacts of various available approaches in an Irish context.  I will be providing the completed technical report to my Cabinet colleagues for consideration very shortly.  As the Deputies will appreciate, I do not wish to pre-empt any decisions of Government in relation to these matters.I have already signalled that it is not my intention to recommend that any new form of student contribution should be introduced before 2010.  In the event that it is decided to introduce a form of student contribution from a future point, such arrangements would also apply, from that time, to those students who would have entered higher education this year i.e. 2009.

The Technical Working Group will also consider the general approach to maximising the use of existing spare capacity where this arises, including possible changes to patronage.As part of this process, if meetings with the Catholic Bishops are needed to discuss or clarify any general issues relating to the change of patronage, these will be arranged.  In this context, officials from my Department will shortly be in contact with the Archbishop of Dublin to arrange further discussion to determine how best to agree a framework by which the issues of school patronage, ownership of school property, the demand for denominational education and other associated matters can be addressed.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	493	The OECD PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) 2006 survey of  15 years olds across 57 countries showed that Ireland's mean score in mathematics was not significantly different from the OECD average.  We ranked 16th of 30 OECD countries and 22nd of 57 countries.  There were fewer lower achievers and higher achievers than the OECD average, with the majority of pupils scoring in the mid range of achievement.  When performance levels for mathematics in 2006 are compared with those in 2000 and 2003, there are no changes for Irish students.  Ireland showed a high level of equity in achievement outcomes.  This is evidenced by relatively small levels of "between school" variation and comparatively good standards among lower achievers.The Report of the Expert Group calls for the introduction of bonus points for Higher Level Mathematics in the Leaving Certificate.  Decisions on the award of points and admission criteria for entry to higher education programmes are, under legislation, a matter for the higher education institutions.  My Department asked the Higher Education Authority to initiate a discussion across higher education institutions regarding the desirability or otherwise of awarding bonus points.  The overall view emerging was that the introduction of bonus points was unlikely to dramatically increase uptake of Higher Level Maths.  The Report of the Points Commission in 1999 considered the issue of bonus points and recommended against such an approach.Providing bonus points could reinforce the perception that Maths is a difficult subject.  It should be noted that when bonus points were removed in 1994 on foot of curricular reform, participation in Higher Level Maths increased.  We can therefore conclude that curriculum reform has more impact than points in this area.  Introducing bonus points would inevitably lead to similar demands in other subjects such as science.

Responses issued to these schools on 11 June last.  A small number of schools have corresponded further with my Department and a reply will issue to these schools as quickly as possible.The responses included advice to schools as to how they can support children who are in the classes being suppressed through the school's General Allocation Model of resource teaching support.  There may be instances where children who are enrolled in a MGLD class fall within the low incidence disability category.  These children may qualify for individual resource teaching support through the  National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and schools were advised that it is open to them to liaise with the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) in this regard.  I am satisfied with the information provided to the schools on foot of their appeals.My Department promotes a continuum of assessment and intervention.  These interventions range from support from the classroom teacher and support from the resource / learning support teacher.  Where a school considers that these interventions are not meeting the child's needs they should seek the advice of their National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) psychologist.  Schools without an assigned NEPS psychologist can avail of the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments.

It provides a useful contribution to the debate on the post-second level education provided to adult refugees, persons with leave to remain and persons granted subsidiary protection.It does not, I believe, acknowledge the amount of initiatives that are already in place.Vocational Education Committees provide English language training for adult immigrants throughout the country.  Over 12,500 adult immigrants participated in English language tuition in 2008 at an estimated cost of some €10 million.  A further €2.8m is being provided to meet the English language and socialisation needs of adult refugees.The National Framework of Qualifications provides for a fully coordinated system of access, transfer and progression.  The FETAC "Higher Education Links Scheme and Pilot Scheme" has developed clear progression routes from further to higher education.  There is also the possibility of recognition of prior learning.There are a number of references in the report to difficulty in accessing information.  In the context of eligibility for reduced fees and access to grants there is a website, www.studentfinance.ie, that is a convenient and user friendly source of comprehensive information on financial support for further and higher education.  The data on this website are continually updated to reflect the current position for students and potential students.In addition, I have just launched my own website, www.integration.ie.  It contains detailed data on the key aspects of immigrants' lives.  It is an excellent first point of reference for information.  In relation to education matters, AIM — accessing intercultural materials — a portal with links to key databases — is also available on my website.Access personnel co-ordinate their work across higher education institutions.  They have, for example, piloted new strategies to reflect the needs of a more diverse student body.  They collaborate with schools and the community sector.  Research has shown that newcomer students are progressing in significant numbers to higher education, relative to their numbers in the population.Through the Strategic Innovation Fund, the HEA and the Department of Education and Science are supporting research on the needs of students from ethnic minority groups.  The report entitled "Migrants and Higher Education in  Ireland", is available on www.eine.ie.  This report has been recently completed by the CIT led 'Education in Employment' consortium of nine higher education institutions in close consultation with partners, including students from ethnic minority groups and FÁS.I am currently preparing an Intercultural Education Strategy that will incorporate all aspects of education from pre-school upwards and will include both further and higher education.  This Strategy will provide an overarching policy on the integration of newcomers into our education system.These are just some of the many initiatives in place that are addressing the needs of migrants, including the three categories addressed in the RIS report.

The WSE report described a highly unsatisfactory situation at the  school in relation to the quality of educational provision.I have already expressed my very great concern regarding the serious weaknesses  that were identified in the report including poor teaching and learning, inadequacies in relation to child protection policies and unacceptable standards in the general management of the school.As part of the WSE process, the inspectors who conducted the evaluation have made detailed recommendations and have directly advised the school authorities and staff regarding the improvements the school must undertake.  In addition, given the seriousness of the weaknesses evident in the school, senior officials of my Department have met recently on a number of occasions with the Patron of the school and the chairperson of the board of management to impress on them  the need for change and improvement in the operation of the school.The representatives of the school have accepted the findings and recommendations in the report.  The patron has confirmed that a child protection policy has been drawn up and is currently being ratified by the board of management, and that the teachers have received training in its implementation.An account of expenditure since the current board took office in January 2008 has been submitted to the Department and the school representatives have also confirmed to my Department that the matter of the school accounts is currently being pursued with the school's accountant and that it is anticipated that accounts will be available shortly.Officials in my Department will hold further meetings with the school authorities to ensure that all the issues raised in the report are addressed including any matters relating to the school's management of funds.I am satisfied that the measures being taken by my Department are appropriate for now.I can assure the Deputy that my officials will continue to engage closely with the patron and the board and that the quality of the school's work will be monitored through inspection visits during the coming school year.  I expect that significant improvements will result.

For planning purposes, the country was divided into about 300 geographic districts, each with several primary schools feeding into a post primary education centre with one or more post primary schools.  The intention was that these defined districts would facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs.  They also facilitated the provision of a nationwide school transport service, enabling children from remote areas to get to their nearest school.A Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme, including catchment boundaries, is currently being undertaken by my Department and is due to be completed by the end of the year.The Steering Committee of the Review is looking at the original objectives of the scheme, whether these objectives remain valid today, the extent to which the objectives are being achieved and whether there are possibilities for economies or efficiencies that would improve the value for money of the scheme.   In this context, the review is also looking at fundamental issues such as  catchment boundaries, which is in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.The review, when completed, will be published and submitted to the Oireachtas Select Committee on Education and Science.

The establishment of a  network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  I have arranged for the information requested by the Deputy to be forwarded to him directly.The pupil teacher ratio appropriate to classes for children with autism is one teacher for each class where up to six children can be enrolled.  A minimum of two Special Needs Assistants are also allocated per class of six pupils.An initiative in November 2006 expanded the level of administrative support available to large schools and schools with high numbers of special classes or a specialist autism unit.  The measures included the allocation of additional teachers to allow deputy principals in mainstream schools that, in addition to their ordinary mainstream class teachers, also have five or more special classes for children with the more complex, low incidence, special needs, to operate as administrative deputy principals.  Also where a school has a principal and four or five mainstream class teachers also has a specialist autism unit established under approval of NCSE, the principal will be appointed on an administrative basis.My Department interacts on a regular basis with organisations representative of schools and submissions from school authorities including the one referred to by the Deputy are taken into consideration in the context of future policy decisions.

Documents explaining the band rating system are published on my Department's website.  Progress on individual projects is consistent with the assigned band rating.  There are four band ratings overall with band 1 being the highest and band 4 the lowest.  A project's band rating can be reviewed if the circumstances of a  school change.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can sometimes be more severe involving other organs.  Ramblers, campers and those who work in such areas especially if they come into contact with large animals are at greatest risk of being bitten by ticks and of going on to develop the disease.Lyme disease is not a notifiable infectious disease in Ireland.  This means that there is no legal requirement on doctors to report cases to their local Director of Public Health, so this makes estimates of incidence difficult.  However, the schedule of infectious diseases is reviewed on a periodic basis and inclusion of Lyme disease will be considered in the future.  A number of cases are diagnosed each year, but the true figure is unknown.  However, research has determined that there are about 30 human cases per year in Ireland.A fact sheet on Lyme disease, developed by the Vectorborne Subcommittee of the Scientific Subcommittee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), is available on their website (www.hpsc.ie) to provide members of the general public and media with advice on minimising the risk of Lyme disease.  In the future, this committee intends to publish Clinical Guidance on the management of Lyme disease and raising awareness of this condition among clinicians.

The OMCYA is responsible for funding and overseeing Dáil na nÓg.  Since 2003, a consortium comprising the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI), Foróige and Youth Work Ireland has organised Dáil na nÓg in cooperation with the OMCYA.200 teenage delegates attended the eighth annual Dáil na nÓg which took place on 20 February 2009 in Croke Park, Dublin and discussed the issues of physical health and mental health.  The top three recommendations voted by delegates on physical health were:1. The cervical cancer vaccine should be made available free of charge for all 12-18 year old girls;2. All young people should have access to sex education, which is appropriate to individual needs, comprehensive and varied in delivery;3. P.E. should be prioritised and properly funded, both in and out of school.The top three recommendations voted by delegates on mental health were:1. A structured SPHE course should be implemented for senior cycle students, incorporating positive mental health awareness and development of an on-line support service;2. The establishment of mandatory mental health awareness workshops in all schools, to raise awareness about symptoms, supports and effects of mental health issues;3. A nationwide awareness campaign to promote positive mental health, decrease the stigma, aimed at reducing the numbers of suicides among young people.One representative from each Comhairle na nÓg is elected to the Dáil na nÓg Council, which follows up on the recommendations from the Dáil and tries to make changes for young people in those areas.  The council has a term of office of one year and meets once a month and is supported by the OMCYA and NYCI.To date three meetings of the council have taken place and they have had the opportunity to discuss the recommendations in more detail, meet with key policy makers relevant to their issues and begin to identify a course of action to deliver on these recommendations.  The council members have also undertaken research relevant to their issues between meetings and this has informed their deliberations to date.The next meeting of the council will take place on Thursday, 2 July 2009.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I am aware that a small number of community pharmacists have indicated their intention to withdraw from participation in the community drugs schemes in the light of my decision to reduce certain payments under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.These measures are absolutely necessary for two reasons.  Firstly, the cost of the community drugs schemes has doubled since 2002 to more than €1.6 billion in 2008 and fees and other income earned by pharmacists have doubled accordingly. Secondly, it cost an exorbitant €640 million to get €1 billion of drugs from the factory gate to the patient in the community in 2008.  This has to be reduced.  Given the current financial circumstances of the country — indeed, in any circumstances — this growing level of cost is unjustifiable and unsustainable.Savings from the combined effect of these measures have been estimated at €55 million for the remainder of this year and €133 million on a full year basis.  This is almost exactly what would have been saved if I had imposed an across the board 8% reduction in fees and retail mark-ups and reimposed the reduction in wholesale mark-up to 8%, as attempted by the HSE last year.  However, I have decided to achieve broadly the same level of reduction through a revised common fee structure for dispensing, a reduced retail mark-up, removal of the special payment for over-70s dispensing which is no longer appropriate given the changes in medical card eligibility arrangements, along with the lesser wholesale reduction.The approach I have taken addresses pharmacists' concerns that the current GMS dispensing fee is inadequate and provides for a standard dispensing fee structure across schemes.  This will benefit pharmacies serving remote areas and socially deprived communities.I believe that threats of withdrawal from the community pharmacy contract are unjustified and not in patients' interests.  There can be no grounds for causing upset or anxiety about the supply of prescriptions to patients.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	518	In order to implement savings measures on the number of public service staff, the Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade with effect from 27 March 2009 to end 2010.  A HSE circular has issued which gives effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.The Government decision is being implemented in such a way as to ensure that key services are maintained in so far as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.The employment control framework specifically exempts staff in the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians.  The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 wtes) for the health sector.  The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer and disability services.  In addition, special provisions apply in relation to Clinical Engineering Technicians, Dosimetrists, Physicists, and Radiation Therapists, which are specialist grades under the National Cancer Control Programme.The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided.  The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.The HSE will be focusing on the scope that exists within the health services for reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care.  It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.

Refurbishment work took place last year in the hospital to provide eight single en-suite rooms for the exclusive use of people with cystic fibrosis.The next stage in the development of St. Vincent's Hospital will involve the building of a new ward block to replace existing accommodation.  The new facility will include accommodation for cystic fibrosis patients with appropriate isolation facilities for the treatment of their condition.I am anxious to ensure that the project is delivered without delay.  Tenders for this development will be issued shortly, which should result in the signing of a contract before the end of the year.  It is intended that the construction, equipping and commissioning of this block will be completed as early as possible in 2011.

However, my Department has been informed by the HSE that concerns were raised by senior nurse management in relation to communication, morale and working relations, and the hospital management engaged a third party to undertake a review which would include recommendations as appropriate.  This approach was agreed with the Irish Nurse's Organisation (INO) who advised their members to participate in the process.This process involved an independent review of the HSE Disciplinary Procedure in this case, with recommendations for future situations and that an agreed mediator would be appointed to manage an orderly return to work for those Assistant Directors of Nursing (ADoNs) involved.Mediation hearings were held on 9th December 2008 and 12th January 2009. They were organised by the Health Service Executive  — Employers Agency (HSEEA), but did not prove successful. HSE Management contacted the INO and confirmed its intention to attend conciliation with a view to securing an acceptable accommodation which will allow for the orderly return to work of the five ADoNs.The dispute was referred to the Labour Court on 24th March 2009. The recommendation of the Labour Court, which was received on 26th June 2009, was that the mediation process should be resumed and concluded within one month. The Court has nominated a mediator to undertake this process.

As such, it is a matter for each individual nursing home to determine the price charged for services.  That said, the price may be expected to be influenced by the prevailing market conditions within the locality in which the nursing home is operating.The most recent survey by Nursing Homes Ireland found that in 2007 the overall average weekly bed price nationally was €778.  By contrast, the average weekly price in Dublin and the surrounding area was found to be between €922 and €966.Finally, under the new Nursing Homes Support Scheme, the National Treatment Purchase Fund will be agreeing prices with private nursing homes for the purposes of the scheme.  The prices will determine the maximum amount that may be charged for care services provided to people availing of financial support under the scheme.  As such, they will also determine the maximum amount of financial support payable by the State under the scheme.  It is intended to introduce the new Nursing Homes Support Scheme in the final quarter of this year.

Under section 6A of that Act, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987, an unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child.  Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian.Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a guardian may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child, including directions as to custody and access.  In addition, the section provides that the unmarried father of a child, even if he is not a guardian, may apply to the court for orders on custody and access.  Section 3 of the Act provides that, in deciding on an application relating to the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child, the court shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.These legislative provisions are comprehensive. They permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child's care and upbringing having regard to the child's best interests.There are no proposals to amend the law in this area although I can say that its operation continues to be kept under review.

The additional area in question amounts to approximately 1.6 hectares.  The planting to be undertaken will form part of the preliminary work which is expected to be put out to tender later this year or early next year and as a result no further costings are available at this stage.

I can advise the Deputy that as of 30 June 2009 there are no persons in custody solely for debt default.Imprisonment for non-payment of debt was abolished by the Debtors (Ireland) Act 1872.  However, refusal to pay a contractual debt may amount to civil contempt of court, for which imprisonment may be imposed.

Romanian nationals are entitled to free movement rights in common with all other EU citizens, apart from the labour market restriction which was placed on them under the Government decision of 24 October, 2006.Free movement rights mean that Romanians do not require an Irish visa as a precondition of entry to the State.  Also, it is not permitted to place an immigration stamp in the passport of an EU citizen.  Romanian nationals, like all other EU citizens, can move to and reside in Ireland.  They can enter Ireland, like any other EU citizen, on production of their passport or national identity card and they can remain in Ireland for up to 3 months without conditions.  However, in order to remain in Ireland for more than three months they must either:be in employment orbe self employed orbe studying here and have comprehensive sickness insurance orbe self-sufficient and have comprehensive sickness insurance to cover themselves and any other family members while they are in the State.Under the Government decision regarding work, Romanian nationals cannot take up employment in Ireland unless they get a Work Permit or unless they are otherwise exempt from that requirement.  Romanians nationals who do not need an Employment Permit include the following categories;A Romanian national who has been resident in the State as the holder of an employment permit which expired on or after the 31st December 2006, for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer.A Romanian national who was resident in the State prior to 1st January 2007 and is the spouse/dependent of an EU national who does not require an employment permit.A Romanian national resident in the State who is self employed.A Romanian national who entered the State on or after 1st January 2007 who is the spouse/dependent of an EU national other than a Romanian or Bulgarian national.The spouse or dependents of a Romanian worker who has lived in Ireland with the Romanian worker for more than 18 months after the accession of Romania to the EU.The issuing of work permits is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

The person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order following a comprehensive examination of his asylum claim and of his application to remain temporarily in the State. In addition he has been evading his deportation since 10 August 2004 and should therefore present himself to the Garda Authorities with any further delay.As a matter of policy, I do not intend to reward persons who have failed a very fair and comprehensive asylum process, and who have thereafter proceeded to evade their deportation for several years, by granting such persons residency in the State. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there has been a change in the circumstances of the person concerned, or new information has come to light which has a direct bearing on his case, there remains the option of applying to me for revocation of his Deportation Order pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended. However I wish to make clear that such an application would require substantial grounds to be successful.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

As stated by me in a previous Reply, Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, provides the Minister with a power to amend or revoke a Deportation Order. An application seeking to revoke a Deportation Order must set out any new facts or circumstances which have arisen since the original decision to deport was made. Any such application submitted would be considered on its merits, having due regard to all refoulement issues, and following such consideration, a decision would be taken to either affirm or revoke the Order. No representations have been received to date in this regard.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order in this case remains an operational matter for the GNIB.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 9 September 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 23 months. The Citizenship Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in early 2008. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.  However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee. In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible.

Liaison is maintained with their families, who are apprised of any significant developments.Operation Trace was established in October, 1998.  The original objectives of the investigation team under this Operation were to trace, review and collate all evidence pertaining to the separate Garda investigations into the tragic disappearance of six women in the Leinster area.  Subsequently the investigations into the disappearance of three other missing women were also reviewed.Operation Trace, in conjunction with the Garda District Officers in the areas where the women went missing, continues to take a proactive role in the investigations of the disappearance of these women. In particular, information and intelligence relevant to the Operation continue to be collated and integrated into a dedicated stand-alone database maintained for the purpose of the Operation. A Detective Superintendent retains operational responsibility to ensure that all information and queries received are identified, registered and acted upon. The Detective Superintendent also ensures that liaison is maintained with the families of these missing women, to ensure that they are kept apprised of any progress or developments arising from information received or lines of enquiry being pursued.  Regular public appeals are made for assistance from the public.An Garda Síochána has devoted significant resources, time and investigative skill to the investigation of these disappearances. Over time the cases have been subject to numerous reviews to ensure that the Gardaí maximise any new investigative opportunities and that they employ the most up-to-date techniques and methods in line with best international practice.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	578	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table sets out the number of murders recorded and detected in each year from 1989 — 2008 and in 2009 up to 29 June. Figures provided are provisional, operational and liable to change.  I am further informed that a breakdown of the current position in outstanding cases as requested by the Deputy is not readily available and could only be provided by the disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources.The detection rate for murders by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress.  It is expected that over time the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and the number of proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts, as there are inevitably time lapses between the commencement of a criminal investigation, proceedings being commenced and convictions secured.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder.  Furthermore such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.While An Garda Síochána have made significant progress in the investigation of a number of killings, there can be considerable difficulties for them in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities.  It has to be accepted that the reality is that associates of a victim of a gangland killing who would have information of value to An Garda Síochána often do not cooperate with Garda investigations.  Indeed, they frequently fail to cooperate even when they themselves are the victims of violence.  A number of changes to the law on evidence have been made to address this.  It has also to be accepted that there is often no connection or personal association between the victim and the perpetrator, which makes it very difficult for An Garda Síochána in their investigation of such a murder.  Witnesses may also be subject to high levels of intimidation not to come forward, and it is to assist such witnesses that the Witness Security Programme is in place.YearRecordedDetected200929102008503620077760200662452005523220043026200337252002504320014439200032271999282019983834199738341996423319954332199425201993232019922520199123201990171519891715Figures provided are provisional, operational and liable to change.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	579	I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 to 121, inclusive, together.The Department of Foreign Affairs has funded scholarships for civil servants from candidate countries and new Member States in UCD since 2002. The programme is funded from a budget line of the Department of Foreign Affairs relating to a programme of support for public administrations in candidate countries and new Member States to improve their capacity to deal with the demands of membership and has no implications for the Education budget. This programme is designed to facilitate the building of productive links between Ireland and those countries that have recently joined the EU or are candidates for membership.The Government of Ireland Scholarship currently funds six students at a cost of €300,000 for a year's study in the UCD School of Politics and International Relations towards an MEconSc in European Economic and Public Affairs. The scholarships include fees, accommodation (usually on-campus), expenses for obligatory field trips to Brussels and Florence, but not a living stipend. A breakdown for the various categories covered is not available but the bulk of the scholarship goes towards fees, which may vary depending on whether the scholarships are awarded to EU students or those from candidate countries. The total expenditure on the Scholarships since 2002 has been €2.267 million.The students are selected, by UCD, on merit from the public administrations of the new and candidate states with the double aim to improve the training and education of individual public servants and to increase the reputation and influence of Ireland among a growing cadre of actual and potential senior public servants. To date, 80 students have availed of the programme from 14 of the 15 eligible countries (the twelve accession Member States and the candidate states Croatia, Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), including the six students who have recently completed the course in the 2008-2009 academic year.  As the application process for the academic year 2009-2010 is still underway, the number of beneficiaries in 2009/2010 has not yet been determined but is likely to be in or around the same number as the 2008-2009 academic year.Apart from the obvious value of the programme to the participants and the countries they represent, the development of a body of officials with a generally positive experience of Ireland and an understanding of Irish society and administration is of great assistance in building networks of contacts. This is of great value in the work of our Embassies and is of particular importance in countries with which Ireland has limited traditional links.

The Committee has met since at senior official level, and a further Ministerial meeting is envisaged in the near future. Extraordinary rendition is one of the areas under its remit.  The formal meetings of the Committee supplement the ongoing consideration of extraordinary rendition and other issues under its remit as part of the Cabinet's normal work programme.  The Committee membership comprises the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Transport, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Defence, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	581	The Government attaches the highest importance to resolving the plight of our undocumented citizens in the United States.  We have emphasised our strong support for the undocumented in all our engagements with the US Administration and Congress, including during meetings with President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton in Washington this March. Earlier this week, the Taoiseach and I discussed the issue in meetings with leading Congressional figures, including several key proponents of comprehensive immigration reform.As the Deputy is aware, in the absence of comprehensive immigration reform, the Government has been actively pursuing a bilateral approach, aimed at facilitating greater legal migration between the two countries. The approach has had three core objectives: a reciprocal Working Holiday Agreement (now operational); new bilateral arrangements to provide reciprocal long term E3 working visas; and a solution for our undocumented.While the inclusion of Ireland in an expanded version of the E3 programme would provide extensive new opportunities for Irish people to work in the United States and help ensure that a new generation of undocumented Irish does not develop, our friends on Capitol Hill have been clear that the status of the undocumented Irish cannot be addressed in isolation from other ethnic groups, including by way of an E3. Their advice is that the best prospect for a solution for the undocumented continues to lie with comprehensive immigration reform.On 25 June, President Obama met with a range of key Congressional figures, including supporters and opponents of reform, to discuss this issue and identify how to begin fixing what he has described as a broken immigration system. His statement following the meeting that his ‘Administration is fully behind an effort to achieve comprehensive immigration reform' is very welcome. I also note the announcement that the Administration, under the direction of Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, will work with a leadership group from Congress to take forward the issue.  As President Obama noted, however, immigration remains ‘a sensitive and politically volatile issue' in the United States. Bi-partisan support is considered vital to the success of comprehensive reform and our friends on Capitol Hill have made it clear that progressing legislation will continue to present significant challenges.While encouraged by these recent developments, the immediate prospects for immigration reform remain uncertain. The Government is determined to continue to highlight the difficulties facing our undocumented citizens and to support the Administration in its efforts to implement reform.

To date, almost 4,000 calls have been made to the phone line, and over 1,000 information reports have been made to the Gardaí as a result.  The Gardaí have confirmed that there have been 9 reports received to date in relation to Westmeath and 7 of these calls relate to Athlone. All of those reports contained sufficient information to launch a preliminary investigation, and all of those investigations are ongoing.The Deputy should note that calls are spread right across the country including areas that have not directly run a campaign.  This highlights the fact that the confidential number used in the campaign is open to all to use regardless of the area one comes from.  It should also be noted that from the outset the Dial-to-Stop Drug Dealing Campaign was to run over a discrete period of time. This was based on the findings from the initial pilot project in Blanchardstown in Dublin which found that the vast majority of calls were received early in the campaign following its launch.

This review is based on data generated by the 2006 census. Part of this review will involve consultation with local Area Implementation Teams, and this will allow local input into the review process.  During this stage of the review consideration can be given to the inclusion of specific estates including the estate mentioned by the Deputy, based on local knowledge and specific local data.  I hope to be able to make an announcement in relation to the existing RAPID areas in the coming months.

The last Údarás na Gaeltachta election was held on 2 April 2005.  The date of the next election has not yet been decided but I can assure the Deputy that it will be held in due course in accordance with the relevant legislation in place at the time.

Applications to the value of €3.6m were approved under the Scheme in 2007 and this figure increased to €4.2m in 2008.  On suspension of the Scheme on 7th April 2009 almost €1.5m worth of applications had been processed or were on hand for processing.  In this context, demand for the full year 2009 could have been of the order of €6m if the scheme had not been suspended.  This level of demand was clearly unsustainable in the current economic climate.The suspension of the Scheme has afforded my Department the opportunity to initiate a comprehensive review and address a broad range of concerns that have been raised in respect of its operation in recent times.  I can confirm that the review is currently underway and I hope to be in position to have it completed by the Autumn and provide a revised Scheme.  I would like to assure the Deputy that all applications received prior to the suspension of the Scheme are being processed in line with the current eligibility criteria. To date some €1.2m has been paid to applicants and currently 38 applications are being processed and I anticipate that decisions in respect of these will be published over the coming weeks and related payments made.

Details of all grants paid are available on my Department's website on www.pobail.ie.  Two groups in Longford and one group in Westmeath received funds since the beginning of the year. There remains one application pending which was received before suspension of the Scheme, which is now being processed and an announcement will be published in the coming weeks.

The requirement to be in receipt of a social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme.  A waiting period is considered essential to confer entitlement to income support for an indefinite period and is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.From September 2007, a person who is awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.In all other circumstances, to qualify for the back to education allowance an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant Social Welfare payment for 3 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  The 12 month waiting time is reduced to 9 months for persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process or engaging with a Department facilitator.  The scheme will continue to be monitored in the light of the changed economic circumstances to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.

Their primary function is to operate the National Litter Pollution Monitoring System (NLPMS) through collating litter quantification and litter pollution data from the local authorities throughout the year and providing an analysis on the national position to me annually.Information regarding the performance of local authorities in relation to their responsibilities under the Litter Pollution Acts is provided through the National Litter Pollution Monitoring System Results and enforcement statistics. NLPMS reports for each year are available on www.litter.ie; the 2008 report has just recently been published. Local authorities report statistics in relation to their enforcement of the litter laws to my Department twice yearly and these are available in the Oireachtas Library. The Litter Monitoring Body also provides individual reports to local authorities to enable them to evaluate the success of their anti-litter initiatives and take appropriate  action where necessary.Under the Litter Pollution Acts, each local authority is required to adopt a litter management plan (LMP). The legislation prescribes the specific minimum components of a LMP, requiring information on litter prevention and control activities and the setting of appropriate objectives and targets for the period covered by the plan. An additional function of the Litter Monitoring Body is the periodic assessment of new or amended litter management plans adopted by local authorities. The primary purpose of this assessment is to assess LMPs with respect to the core functions prescribed under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, and to determine how local authorities have discharged those functions. The 2000 and 2004 reports are available on www.litter.ie. The most recent report, for 2008, is currently being finalised.

To ensure effective targeting of resources to support households most in need, income limits are applied, distinguishing between single and dual income households.  A maximum loan limit is also applied and local authorities, in assessing loan applications, take account of the household's ability to finance the loan based on their net household income.I recently introduced new regulations to underpin local authority lending into the future. The Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009 replace the previous regulations, providing for a new loan limit of €220,000 and maximum earnings of €75,000 in the case of joint applicants and €50,000 for single applicants. The previous maximum loan to value ratio of 97% still applies.The regulations also provide for the introduction of a formal credit policy to ensure prudence and consistency of approach for all local authority mortgage lending. To reduce the administrative burden on local authorities in the loan application process, particularly in carrying out credit checks through the Irish Credit Bureau, a centralised underwriting service is being provided by the Affordable Homes Partnership. The central underwriting unit, staffed by a small number of individuals with relevant expertise to minimise risk for the State, will issue a recommendation on each application to the relevant local authority. It is important to note, however, that the final decision on all loan applications continues to rest with the local authority concerned.No specific staffing implications arise from the new arrangements, which were introduced following discussion with the County and City Managers' Association and the Affordable Homes Partnership.

Under the Directive, each Member State is required, inter alia, to ensure that all end-of-life vehicles are dismantled, treated and recovered at no cost to the final holder / owner of that vehicle and in a manner that does not cause environmental pollution.The Waste Management (End-of-Life Vehicles) Regulations 2006 provide the regulatory framework for the implementation in Ireland of this Directive.  Under the regulations, a wide range of obligations are imposed on vehicle producers (i.e. manufacturers and professional importers), authorised treatment facilities, vehicle owners and local authorities.Producers are required to establish national collection systems for the appropriate treatment and recovery of end-of-life vehicles of their particular brands.  As a minimum and in accordance with the proximity principle, each producer's national collection system is required to have at least one authorised treatment facility in each city and county council area that will provide free take-back for vehicles of that producer's brand.  In counties and cities with a larger population base, producers are required to have one additional facility for each additional 150,000 persons in the relevant county or city area.  Producers must also register with each local authority, pay a registration fee and provide specified information to each local authority under the registration process.Local authorities are responsible for the enforcement of the regulations in their functional areas as well as the issue of waste facility permits for authorised treatment facilities.  They have no direct role in the provision of such treatment facilities — that is a matter for the market in the first instance or, in the absence of a market solution, for producers in accordance with their producer responsibility obligations under the regulations.

For these sites, the derogation given by the Government, which allowed the continuation of turf cutting for personal domestic use, expires in 2009.With regard to land offered within Corracramph Bog, a Natural Heritage Area designated in 2004 in respect of which the 10 year derogation period will not expire until 2014, the completion of land transactions will not qualify for priority attention this year.

The terms of reference which I gave the committees included a requirement that they recommend local electoral areas comprising of not less than 4 seats and not more than 7 seats, except in very exceptional circumstances where 3 seat local electoral areas could be recommended if, otherwise, the geographic size of the area would be disproportionately large.In their reports, the committees recommended that a total of 3 local electoral areas should have 3 seats. When publishing the reports on 17 June 2008, I announced that I was accepting the recommendations of the committees and the local electoral areas proposed in the reports were in use at the recent local elections. The terms of reference of any future local electoral area boundary committees will be determined at the time of their establishment.

However, in line with the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, a specific fund is in place to support initiatives that build and foster the principles of sustainable communities.  This fund currently provides support to housing authorities for a range of community initiatives, including tenancy liaison officers and advocacy services.  In 2009, some €3 million has been set aside to continue this valuable work.In addition, my Department provides assistance towards the administrative and general expenses of certain not-for-profit organisations and bodies which provide advice, research, training or other supports including representative services in the area of housing.   Allocations from the €1.5m available for this purpose in 2009 will be made shortly.

The proposal for the project in Boyle was approved for inclusion in the new three year remedial works programme and my Department is liaising closely with the Council to ensure that it progresses in a timely fashion.My Department also received a number of proposals for works to rural houses, including from Roscommon County Council.  Given that, when assessing such projects, a clear link must be demonstrated between the investment which would be involved and identified housing need, my Department will be in touch with the relevant housing authorities shortly, seeking further information in this regard.

All relevant Government Departments are working on the development of further measures to reduce Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  This work is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, which is chaired by the Taoiseach.  I have been reporting progress to the Oireachtas on an annual basis in presenting the Carbon Budget.  While the measures involved are relevant to our Kyoto compliance over the 2008-2012 period, their longer-term impact is of even more importance.  Significant structural change is required across all sectors of our economy if we are to meet the much more demanding targets to which we are now committing ourselves.  Under the recent EU climate and energy package, Ireland has taken on a target of a 20% reduction in emissions between 2005 and 2020, and this target will increase further when a new global agreement on climate change is reached, hopefully in Copenhagen in December 2009.  I will be addressing the question of further legislation on climate change in the context of the review of the Programme for Government.

I further stated in my reply, complex legal issues arise in relation to geothermal energy and that my officials are actively engaging with the Office of the Attorney General in this regard.  I am also expecting the recommendations of the Geothermal Working Group, shortly.  In addition, my officials are engaged in ongoing discussions with the industry and other stakeholders.  In view of the ongoing work of my officials and others, the range of issues involved and the need to ensure that the most comprehensive approach to legislation is taken, I hope to be in a position to set out a specific timeframe in the near future.

I understand, however, from Coillte that it has approximately 7,000 acres of land, which are the subject of long-term leases (150 years).   In the absence of specific details, and following a review by Coillte of some of those leases, the company advise me that it's use of such land is limited to forestry purposes only. I am also advised that access for recreational activities can only be afforded in consultation with and at the discretion of the relevant landlord.

The Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 clearly provides that the SFPA is independent in the exercise of its functions and as such I have no remit as to its work programme, its deployment of resources, or its operational activities. Consequently, particular queries regarding specific aspects of the SFPA's work programme should be directed to that body directly by the Deputy.

As previously outlined, the Board of the NEWB has been mandated to make arrangements for its new extended remit and have commenced this work with an inclusive, structured and planned approach engaging with all relevant parties. Consultation is currently under way, involving all the individual services, to develop an appropriate management structure and reporting arrangements for the new service to commence from 1st September 2009. My Department will assist with  this process to ensure successful transition to full integration. Operational  issues will be addressed during this consultation and development phase and  will involve engagement with the services and other relevant stakeholders as  required. The ongoing consultation will address issues including reporting  arrangements and any concerns relating to employment terms and conditions.Future changes, if any, to the employment arrangements of Visiting Teachers for  Travellers will be the subject of discussions with unions representing the  affected teachers.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	618	I can confirm that I met a delegation from the school to which the Deputy refers in January of this year.  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department operates a prioritisation system for school building projects, details of which are published on my Department's website. My Department has received an application for major capital funding for the provision of a new building by the school referred to by the Deputy.  The application has been assessed and has been assigned a band 2.2 rating under the prioritisation criteria for large scale projects.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in  the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.At the meeting on 7th January, 2009, I outlined the position to the Board of  Management and indicated that I would take the views of the Board into  consideration at the appropriate time. I also indicated that it was not  possible for me to give any commitments in relation to the time-frame for the  progression of a building project at the school.  I did not say that their  application would not be progressed.  I did not make a statement to the effect  suggested by the Deputy.I should also point out that my Department provides devolved funding under the  Summer Works Scheme (SWS) and under the Emergency Works Scheme (EWS) to enable individual school authorities to carry out small scale capital works.  The school in question received funding under the 2007 SWS to allow it to upgrade its toilet facilities.  No further applications for funding for minor capital  works have been received to date. Any such applications made by the school will  be given full consideration.

Schools may claim the  first portion of the grant when the building works commence, 70% of the cost of  the project, subject to receipt of the necessary certification and the balance  when the project is completed.A total of 84 schools have now indicated to my Department that they are pursuing the permanent option. However, there are a number of other schools who have not yet indicated which option they intend to pursue.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	620	As part of the modernisation agenda for teachers under the Social Partnership  Agreement Towards 2016 it was agreed to address the issue of difficulties in  relation to teacher performance. It was recognised that while the vast majority  of teachers fulfil their teaching function and professional duties adequately  and well, there are, as in all professions, a small number of under performing  personnel in schools.In that context discussions commenced under the auspices of the Teachers  Conciliation Council to review and revise existing procedures for the  suspension and dismissal of teachers. The Teachers Conciliation Council is the  recognised forum for dealing with matters relating to pay and conditions of  service of teachers. The parties to the forum include representatives of the  managerial authorities of schools, the teacher unions and the Departments of  Education and Science and Finance.The discussions comprehend the arrangements that will apply in the case of both teachers and school principals. Revised procedures for the suspension and  dismissal of teachers have been agreed. One of the issues considered was the  provision of assistance, where appropriate, to teachers who are experiencing  professional difficulties as provided for in the Towards 2016 agreement.  Revised procedures are being brought to finality for principals having regard  to the particular issues relevant to that grade.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	621	As the Deputy may be aware the appeal in question has already been heard by the  Supreme Court and judgement is awaited.  Aside from the issues pertaining to the operation of the Redress Board, the High Court decision had much wider implications for the State.  The Judgement in this case undermines the right of the Oireachtas to adopt age based criteria in its legislative classifications.Consequently, the decision to appeal this matter to the Supreme Court was taken not only for its implications in terms of the Redress Scheme but also for its  potential effect on the ability of the Oireachtas to conduct its business.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	622	On 24 June 2009 there were 35 primary school principals, 2 secondary school principals, 40 primary school teachers and 15 secondary school teachers who had previously been awarded pensions by my Department employed under a fixed term or temporary teaching contract in primary, secondary and community schools.  In  the main these teachers were employed in a regular part-time capacity (ie  fixed-term), many as resource teachers, teaching a small number of hours each  week.  These figures do not include casual substitute teachers who may be  employed on a daily or hourly basis.  Where a person's pension and pay on  returning to teach exceed their final retiring salary a reduction in pension is  applied in accordance with normal public service abatement arrangements.Figures for retired teachers, re-employed in other agencies under my  Department's remit, are not readily available.  I spoke at the annual  conference of AMCSS about the desirability of engaging unemployed  teachers where at all possible in relation to the filling of casual or fixed-term vacancies.  This is something I would encourage school management generally to consider.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	623	My Department provides funding to primary and post primary schools towards the  purchase of assistive technology for the use of pupils with special educational  needs. The scheme is targeted at individual circumstances where pupils have  very specific educational needs and the purpose of the grant-aid is to provide  the pupils in question with equipment that will be of direct educational  benefit to them.My Department does not provide funding to companies or individuals providing an information and communications technology teaching service for students with  special needs or learning difficulties.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	624	A deficit of mainstream accommodation is a shortfall in amount of permanent  classrooms to accommodate the teachers allocated to the school.In the school to which the Deputy refers the original school consists of 3  permanent classrooms and a small ancillary area. This has been further  supplemented with temporary accommodation for the current staffing of  principal, 8 mainstream teachers and resource teachers.The long term projected staffing for this school is for principal + 12 and  therefore the additional accommodation required to accommodate the full  complement of staff which will be assigned to the school is significant  relative to the permanent accommodation currently available.  A new 12  classroom school on a greenfield site is proposed for the school.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	625	I understand that the Deputy is referring to special needs assistant hours. The  Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is  responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers  (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs)  to primary and post primary schools to support children with special needs. The  NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The  qualifying criteria for the allocation of SNA support is outlined in Department  Circular 07/02 which is available on my Department's website at  www.education.ie. There has been no change in the criteria governing the  allocation of SNA support.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	626	The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) has been in existence since  1994 and was designed to enhance the vocational dimension of the Leaving  Certificate (Established). This two-year programme combines the academic  strengths of the Leaving Certificate (Established) with a focus on  self-directed learning, enterprise, work and the community which are included  in the Link Modules.My Department received applications from 10 second level schools for approval  to introduce the programme in their schools from the commencement of the  2009/10 school year.In framing the budget in October and again in April, a range of very difficult policy choices had to be faced by the Government across all areas of public expenditure, including in the field of education where in future a ceiling will apply to the overall number of teachers. Clearly any expansion in programmes has to be considered in the context of existing policies and available resources. In the context of the budgetary constraints the first priority is to  maintain existing service levels to the greatest extent possible. In the context of the limits on overall numbers employed in the public service and how that is to apply to the school sector it simply would not make sense to expand this service and to further increase the upward pressure on teacher numbers at  this time.My Department has, however, outlined to the schools concerned that those who  wish to provide the LCVP programme from within their existing staffing  resources will be facilitated.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	627	During the passage of the legislation governing the establishment of the Redress Scheme (Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002) through both Houses, the issue of including children who were in foster care was discussed and it was decided not to extend the legislation, as children in foster care were not in a residential institution.  However, this statutory redress scheme was an additional benefit introduced by the Oireachtas for a particular category of persons and left unaffected the right of anybody to bring legal proceedings.  Consequently, a person's ineligibility to be considered for an award under the terms of the Redress Scheme does not effect their statutory right to pursue any other legal avenue which may be open to them.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	628	The Government has had to make difficult choices and take difficult decisions  in relation to the public finances. These include decisions aimed at reducing  the size of the public service and clearly those decisions impact on the  employment opportunities across the public service, including in the education  sector.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	629	I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be  made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to  control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In  this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most  other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various  impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements and in  view of the ominous financial circumstances that we are facing I am not in a  position to reverse any of the decisions taken.I am committed to providing information in relation to the allocation of  teachers to schools and as a new feature on my Department's website. The  process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information  on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the  revised schedule for 2009/10.In terms of the position at individual primary school level the key factor for  determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil  enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment  data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received  and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that  begins next September.My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a  net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my  efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public  detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is published  on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on  individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts  and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to  have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when  the allocation processes are completed.The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors  such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts  allocated as a result of the appeals processes. The operation of redeployment  arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his  or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.  The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until  the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for  mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will  have been considered.I understand that the school referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal to  the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. Following consideration of this case at its  meeting on 14 May 2009, the Board refused the appeal. The Board of Management of the school has been notified in this regard. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	630	The project to which the Deputy refers is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I approved the project to proceed to seek planning permission in May 2009.I am aware of the trend in building costs in the current market conditions.   However, the final budget for this project will not be approved until the stage  2(b) tender documentation is completed and assessed.The progression of all large scale projects, including this project, from  initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the  context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  programme.However, in light of the current competing demands on the capital budget of my  Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the further  progression of the project at this time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	631	The school to which the Deputy refers is operating with provisional recognition from my Department. It is entitled to grant aid for rental for its accommodation, for school transport and for the payment of teacher salaries.Teacher allocations to all second-level schools are approved annually by my  Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules, each school is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are, in the first instance, a matter for each school.In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e. curricular concessions. This concession is available as a short term support to enable essential curricular provision to continue. An application for  curricular concessions was received in my Department from the school referred  to by the Deputy. The school has been notified of the outcome.The allocation processes also include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The Principal of a school can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established specifically to adjudicate on appeals on staffing allocations in post-primary schools. This Board operates  independently of my Department. The school in question did not submit an appeal.Discrete allocations are also made to second-level schools to cater for example  for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with language difficulties.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 183 together.The Deputy will be aware that a significant number of sections of the Education  for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004 have been commenced,  principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education  (NCSE) and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children  with special educational needs. Specifically, the following sections have been  commenced — 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 53.As I have outlined previously, it is not possible to commence the EPSEN Act  incrementally by age cohort, therefore the provisions of the Act especially  those regarding assessments and individual education plans will have to be  commenced for all children at the same time. This means that the necessary  training arrangements, personnel and systems have to be in place at the time of  commencement.As required under the Act, the NCSE provided a report making recommendations regarding the implementation of EPSEN which suggested additional investment over a period of years of up to €235m per annum across the education and health sectors. Having considered the NCSE report, and consulted with the education partners, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE, my Department identified a range of options for the implementation of EPSEN. My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. In the light of the current financial circumstances, it is therefore not possible to proceed with full implementation in 2010 as originally envisaged. However, the Government will keep the matter under review and is committed to the full implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date.I want to reiterate that children with special educational needs will continue  to receive an education appropriate to their needs. I intend to build on the  progress that has been achieved in recent years which has seen a huge increase  in resources for special educational needs. The NCSE will continue to support  schools, parents and children, and teachers and special needs assistants will  continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs.  Additional  funding was provided as part of last October's budget and is being used to  strengthen and enhance health and education services and continue the  preparation for the full implementation of the Act at a later date.

Approximately 135,000 children avail of school transport services on a daily basis using some 3,300 private contractors' vehicles and over 600 Bus Éireann vehicles.Negotiations with school bus operators regarding bus contracts are a matter  between Bus Éireann and the individual contractors and these negotiations take  place prior to the commencement of the new school year. The Deputy will  understand that pending the outcome of these negotiations it is too early to  say what the impact might be on the overall cost of school transport this year.My Department is continuing to work closely with Bus Éireann to ensure that  school transport services are delivered in a safe and cost effective manner.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	634	I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be  made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to  control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In  this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most  other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various  impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements and in  view of the ominous financial circumstances that we are facing I am not in a  position to reverse any of the decisions taken.I am committed to providing information in relation to the allocation of  teachers to schools and as a new feature on my Department's website. The  process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information  on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the  revised schedule for 2009/10.In terms of the position at individual primary school level the key factor for  determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil  enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment  data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received  and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that  begins next September.My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a  net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my  efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public  detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is published  on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on  individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts  and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to  have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when  the allocation processes are completed.The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors  such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts  allocated as a result of the appeals processes. The operation of redeployment  arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his  or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.  The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until  the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for  mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will  have been considered.

In the last school year the service referred to by the Deputy, in the details supplied, was operating to capacity.If, for operational reasons, a larger bus is introduced for this route, in the  2009/10 school year, additional spare seats may become available. However, I  should point out that pick up points are planned to facilitate eligible pupils  and those availing of concessionary transport will have to make their way to  that point.  Parents should continue to liaise with their local Bus Éireann office regarding the availability of seats.

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.The Deputy will appreciate that, as home tuition takes place outside of the  normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are  qualified to give education to the children concerned. It is reasonable to  expect that a person, providing an education to a child in the child's home  outside of the normal school structure, is fully qualified.Some parents had advised of difficulties in sourcing fully qualified teachers.  My Department therefore has allowed for other qualifications. However, the  guidelines to the home tuition scheme have in recent years been advised of my  Department's preference for a fully qualified teacher.I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department has continued to sanction  alternative tuition providers where parents have shown that they were unable to  source a fully qualified teacher.

These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education committees' Scholarship Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending  Post Leaving Certificate Courses.The Higher Education Grants Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities.   The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees.   Under the terms of the maintenance grants schemes grant assistance is awarded  to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which  relate to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.As the decision on eligibility for a higher education grant is a matter for the  relevant local authority or VEC to determine it will be necessary for the  candidate referred to by the Deputy to contact his local authority/VEC directly  to have his eligibility assessed.

It is now the practice to purchase rather than rent temporary accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than 3 years. This will reduce the incidence of long term rental of prefabs.In July of 2008, I introduced a further innovation which allows those schools with an urgent and pressing need for additional accommodation which is likely to last for more than 3 years and who are being given approval for grant aid, as in the case of this school, to avail of the option of using their grants either to purchase prefabs or to construct permanent classrooms for the same amount. Funding is approved on a devolved basis for both options and it is then a matter for the schools to decide which option to pursue.

This application must be supported by an Occupational Therapist's Report confirming the need for the item(s) in question.It is open to all schools to submit such applications on an ongoing basis as required.  These applications are assessed and approved, where appropriate, as expeditiously as possible.  The school referred to by the Deputy has submitted several applications for specialist furniture and equipment recently, the majority of which have been approved funding.  Any remaining applications will be assessed and the school notified of the outcome in due course.

The decision on eligibility for a higher education grant is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC as appropriate.The Nationality requirement as set out in the 2008 Grant schemes states candidates must:hold E.U. Nationality; orhave Official Refugee Status; orhave been granted Humanitarian Leave to Remain in the State (prior to the Immigration Act 1999); orbe a person in respect of whom the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has granted permission to remain following a determination not to make a deportation order under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999; orhave permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State, or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; orhave permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU Member State who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed, or self-employed, in the State, or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality; orbe nationals of a member country of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform adjudicates on a person's entitlement to remain in the State and on the stamp that is awarded where permission to remain is sanctioned.  A ‘stamp 4' does not of itself convey any entitlement to public services.  It is the candidate's nationality or his/her immigration status in the State that determines whether or not he/she meets the nationality requirement outlined in the Scheme.  Possession of a ‘stamp 4' does not automatically satisfy the nationality requirement of the grant schemes.  My Department understands a ‘stamp 4' can be awarded to categories of applicants other than those specified in my Department's grant schemes.

The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the revised schedule for 2009/10.To be clear there is no doubt that the budget measures concerning staffing will have an impact.  There is simply no easy way to control or reduce public expenditure.At the level of individual schools the changes in relation to the allocation of teaching posts will impact in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.  Across the school system generally there will inevitably be an impact on class sizes and at post-primary level the changes will impact on the capacity of individual schools to offer as wide a range of subject choices as heretofore in future years.My Department will through the normal processing of examining applications for curricular concessions endeavour to ensure continuity of provision for those already preparing for the certificate examinations.  The changes at second level are therefore more likely to impact on the range of subjects that schools will be able to offer to those starting the Junior or Leaving Certificate programmes next September.The Deputy may be interested to know that information on the current position regarding teacher allocations to second level schools, whether enrolment related or otherwise, will be published on my Department's website in the coming week. My intention is that, just as is the case with the information provided in relation to primary schools, this information will identify the changed position for second level schools and VECs arising from the October budget decisions.  The information will be further updated later in the year when final allocations are determined.All the above allocations, primary and post-primary are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position.  The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as the allocation of support teachers, additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Boards will have been considered.  The appellate process is particularly relevant at post-primary level where any specific curricular needs of the school concerned are considered.  Also at post-primary there is no effective system wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools may end up retain teachers, though over quota.

Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.  Accommodation requirements at schools throughout the country and in County Kildare will be considered in this context and within the framework of the Schools Building and Modernisation Programme.

I am satisfied that the drafting of legislation on behalf of my Department is dealt with as expeditiously as possible in order that it may be put before the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate at the earliest opportunity.The preparation of a scheme of Bill in relation to proposed legislation is a matter for my Department and I am satisfied also that this work is progressed as quickly as possible, taking account of the often complex policy and legal issues that arise, and the current constraints in relation to staffing and other resources.It is inevitable that, both during the preparation of a scheme of Bill and during the drafting process, policy and legal issues arise that must be dealt with comprehensively before the relevant legislation can be progressed.  Such issues can also arise during the passage of legislation through the Houses.  As Minister for Education and Science I believe that it is essential to ensure that the legislation presented in my name is legally sound, even if some delay is necessary to ensure this.The Student Support Bill has not yet moved to Committee stage, as a number of legal and policy issues which have arisen require resolution before the necessary amendments can be tabled at committee.  Given the range and complexity of the issues to be addressed and the budgetary context in which the related administrative reform will have to be developed, it is now more likely that the Bill will progress to Committee stage in the autumn session.  However, my Department continues to be fully committed to bringing forward this important piece of legislation in the shortest possible timeframe.  The scheme of an Education (Patronage) Bill has been approved by Government for drafting and I hope to have the Bill published and passed during the Autumn session 2009.In the case of the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund (Amendment) Bill 2009, preparatory work on the General Scheme of this Bill has been completed by my Department.  I hope to have the Bill published and passed during the Autumn session 2009.  With regard to the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, the Deputy will be aware that this amalgamation involves consolidating and amending functions currently performed by at least five separate agencies and presents a considerable legislative challenge.  A period of consultation on the implementation of the amalgamation has recently concluded.  The breadth and complexity of the issues involved is clear from the contents of the consultation paper.  My Department is currently preparing the General Scheme of the required legislation, which I expect to bring to Government for approval in the Autumn.  This is in line with the original timetable for the amalgamation and we remain on target for the establishment of the new organisation in late 2010.
