The record should show that the Government Chief Whip in the other House is determining the business of this House. That is why we did not sit last week. The Government wants to make sure we are the Taoiseach's subservient little lap-dog. It is unfortunate that the opportunity to discuss an amount of business, including Private Members' Bills, was lost. We could have considered a number of items on the Order Paper but for some inexplicable reason we were unable to do so. I am sure it is no fault of the Leader or the other Members of the Seanad on the Government side. It is the fault of their masters in the Dáil. Will the Leader agree with me that, after two years of calls from this side of the House and the Opposition in the other House, the Taoiseach has conceded there is an issue with discretionary medical cards? He is finally beginning to listen to his own backbenchers. He certainly did not listen to us in the past two years when we highlighted day after day, week after week, month after month, the individual cases we all have come across. These are cases of blind people, people with cancer, long-term illnesses, multiple sclerosis and a wide variety of other illnesses who have been coldly and callously stripped of their discretionary medical cards in a very inhumane way. In the other House yesterday, many examples of this were given. All Members here have examples, too. It is time something was done on this issue. Accordingly, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, come to the House and highlight in detail what will be done to help the families in question. There is plenty of pre-election rhetoric to garner votes such as the Minister for Finance’s indication of tax cuts on the never-never, the Minister for Health’s indication of a third tier of medical cards for discretionary card applications and the airy-fairy, woolly proposals we have heard on Irish Water. We do not want these empty promises. We need the absolute detail that will answer the question for the blind person whose home I was in last night when they expressed their fear their medical card review will take away their discretionary medical card. This issue has not just arisen in Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Cavan but in every county and city. Answers are required. I will not call for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, to come to the House on Irish Water today because he is engaged on a Private Members’ motion on the issue in the other House. It is vitally important, however, we have him here soon. Let us have a quick recap on events. In November the Minister lied to the Deputy Barry Cowen by saying the cost of the establishment of Irish Water-----

I welcome the Government’s decision yesterday on water charges. We have seen a fair deal on them and the recognition that this is a conservation measure. The principles agreed at the Cabinet will encourage sensible use of this important natural resource. It is welcome that the Labour Party position that there should be no standing charge was adhered to and achieved because that would have militated against the conservation aspects of the charge. It is welcome that water for children will be free, that there will be a cap on charges for people with particular medical needs and that vulnerable groups such as pensioners, people with disabilities and carers will get an allowance through the household benefits package. It is also welcome that there will be a hardship fund, a free allowance and an accelerated metering programme. As the programme develops, we will see a much more efficient and effective use of our water resources, a much better delivery of water services and much less waste. We must be conscious that through the boom time, we allowed a fragmented system to evolve where water services were delivered through 34 local authorities, thousands of people are still on boil-water notices or restrictions and there were significant supply shortages in the Dublin area during the Christmas holidays. I welcome the debate on the Labour Party’s Private Members’ motion on personal assistance services for people with disabilities this evening. We drafted the motion with the assistance of the Centre for Independent Living, members of which will be present in the Visitors Gallery for the duration of the debate which will be taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. Many Members will have received communications from people with disabilities or their families who want to see this motion pass. I believe it has cross-party support, which I welcome. At the weekend the European Ombudsman, Emily O’Reilly, spoke coherently and persuasively at the Burren Law School, a school in which I am involved as one of the directors this year, about the need to establish an office of guardian of the public interest to ensure practices such as extraordinary rendition are not allowed. While it may seem a technical point, will the Leader organise a debate on this matter as it could develop into a very important safeguard of the public interest? An office such as this would be a different function to that of the Attorney General. We would see ombudsman offices taking on part of this function - hence Emily O’Reilly’s interest. It would be worth exploring this specific point of having an office of the guardian of the public interest.
#JillianVanTurnhout	unknown-#JillianVanTurnhout-party	unknown-#JillianVanTurnhout-dob	unknown-#JillianVanTurnhout-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	40	While I am greatly saddened that such services are necessary at all, I welcome the opening this evening of Ireland’s first FGM, female genital mutilation, clinic at the Irish Family Planning Association’s clinic on Cathal Brugha Street. The clinic will provide treatment to an estimated 4,000 women who have suffered FGM in or outside Ireland. FGM, as we know, is an abhorrent practice and a grave violation of women’s and girls’ human rights. It is classic example of gender-based violence, perpetrated against women and girls all over the world. Another glaring and incomprehensible incident of gender-based violence is the recent mass abduction of 234 Nigerian schoolgirls by the Islamic extremist group, Boko Haram. According to Time, the girls are being sold into forced child marriages, a modern form of slavery and an egregious breach of international law. I note the call to action of Walk Free, an online movement fighting to end modern slavery which is urging the Nigerian Government to act immediately on intelligence received by credible local services sources and to work with neighbouring countries, Cameroon and Chad, as well as other nations offering assistance to mount an effective search for these girls and improve the protection of schools in north-east Nigeria in order that children can receive an education without risk of kidnapping, forced marriages or other abuses. I call on the Government to exert all of its influence at international level to ensure swift action is taken by the Nigerian Government. We have not heard much about this on the news, but if this many Irish schoolchildren were taken, there would be uproar. Last week it was announced by a US company that it planned to return to Ireland on 20 September to hold a child beauty pageant. We had an excellent debate on 5 March condemning child beauty pageants and the wider question of the importance of protecting childhood. The Government supported my motion during that debate. We also asked the Dáil to pass a similar motion. Given the recent announcement by this US company that it wishes to return to Ireland, will the Leader call on the Dáil to have a similar debate in order that we send a clear message to the company that it is not welcome here? We have many brilliant activities for children and young people in Ireland and child beauty pageants are not among them. I express my thanks to the Irish Hotels Federation which has continued to support the motion passed in the House and our work and it also condemns child beauty pageants.

We raised this issue with the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, when he came before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last week. His reply was interesting. He stated:On the Setanta case, let me offer some points of information that might be of use. The company had a licence in another part of the European Union and started operating here in 2007. Although the Central Bank had no information about the company's balance sheet and finances, and the fact that it had grown to a sizeable scale, by November 2013 we had become concerned and had some concrete suggestions that there could be problems with this. We drew this to the attention of the Maltese regulatory authorities, and they took a series of actions over the following weeksIf the Central Bank knew in November and spoke to the Maltese, there should be no question that the Irish insurance compensation fund, which has already paid out €1 billion to incompetent insurance companies, should be invoked in this case. Will the Leader ask the Tánaiste what representations have been made by Ireland to Malta on the issue? I refer to the gauntlet thrown down by Jean-Claude Trichet to the Parliament of this country. He has stated he will not appear before the banking inquiry. This is a parliamentary democracy and he is a public servant. Others sought to defy Parliament and the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy John McGuinness, gave them their answer. Mr. Trichet is criticised roundly in a book published yesterday by Philippe Legrain, who was President Barroso's economic adviser from February 2011 to February 2014. Mr. Legrain writes that when Ireland sought relief in November 2010 it was turned down. He continued:Instead, eurozone policymakers, notably ECB President Trichet, outrageously blackmailed the Irish Government into making good on its guarantee, by threatening to cut off liquidity to the Irish banking system - in effect, threatening to force it out of the euro. Thus, having exhausted the borrowing capacity of the Irish government, the creditors of Irish banks could now call on loans from other eurozone governments along with Britain's, Sweden's and the IMF. This was a flagrant abuse of power by an unelected central banker whose primary duty ought to have been to the citizens of the countries that use the euro - not least Irish ones. Bleeding dry Irish taxpayers to repay foreign debts incurred by Irish banks to finance the country's property bubble was not only shockingly unjust. It was a devilish mechanism not for safeguarding financial stability in the eurozone - which would be the ECB's defence for its actions - but rather for amplifying instability.Mr. Legrain's authoritative account of this affair indicates that Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet cannot be allowed to defy the Parliament and if the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, wishes him to appear he certainly has an awful lot to answer for.

I would like this to be done as soon as possible. We are all on the doorsteps and hear the stories. It is quite disturbing and very difficult to have any answers for people who find themselves in such a situation. There is also an issue with medical cards which have been taken back before their due date. I met somebody with a long-term illness who had a medical card which was due for renewal in July but it was withdrawn in March. This is very distressing for somebody with a long-term illness who all of a sudden finds this a huge financial difficulty and burden.

The peace process is a prize we had all hoped for so earnestly, but as I have stated many times, the process is very fragile. The recent debacle of the clumsy arrest of Deputy Gerry Adams and the loaded manner in which it was tweeted by a political source to the general public is not helping the process. It is particularly important for us to ensure we contribute to promote moderation with regard to peace and justice on the island. Deputy Gerry Adams is an elected Member of Dáil Éireann. He is a significant leader of a constitutional political party. He is pivotal to the peace process and he enjoys a special international reputation. I do not believe for one moment that the histrionics of this episode have in any way helped to alleviate the suffering of all those people who lost loved ones during the recent Troubles. In fact, I believe it has added to their suffering. It is interesting to note a television poll conducted showed that almost 50% of all respondents did not believe this arrest was in any way intended to help those people, the forgotten, with regard to the Troubles in Northern Ireland. All of this started with the Boston tapes and in recent days Senators have possibly noted that Boston university, in no uncertain terms, has distanced itself from the issue to the point that it intends returning the tapes to the people who were interviewed. If we do not continue to deal with the process, much that has been achieved will be lost. The small group of loyalists who came to the gates of the jail do not represent all the loyalists in the North. In any contact I have had with loyalists there has been plenty of dialogue and we respect each other, and many of us have a common cause. It would concern me very much if this entire episode was in any way exploited for political gain north or south of the Border because if we did this we would be exploiting the suffering of all those people who must live out this whole matter to the end of their lives. This is why I request the Leader to arrange a debate, because the debates we have had in the past have been balanced, reasoned and very moderate. I hope this will continue.
#JohnKelly	unknown-#JohnKelly-party	unknown-#JohnKelly-dob	unknown-#JohnKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	44	Earlier today I heard calls from the INMO for the lifting of the moratorium on recruitment. It is time this was done. I have raised this issue ad nauseam in the House. Why do we have all of these problems with people losing their medical cards as Senators Imelda Henry and Marc MacSharry have mentioned? Apparently there has been absolute bedlam at the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in Finglas for the past two years. People who work there are absolutely stressed out and cannot cope. What did the HSE do to address this? It brought in the Germans. Angela Merkel is now reviewing medical cards in the PCRS. It is as simple as that. This has not been mentioned in any debate on medical cards we have had so far in either House. Because of the moratorium on recruitment, the HSE has employed a German company called Arvato to review medical cards on behalf of the people. This overrides the recruitment process. It is obvious the company has absolutely no expertise in assessing or reviewing medical cards.It has no compassion, which is obvious from the process of reviewing medical cards. Germans do not do compassion. The company has no knowledge of people's circumstances, particularly in rural Ireland; it thinks that a farmer with ten acres of land is a millionaire. In the past, medical cards were administered locally and people knew one another. People were granted a medical card by right if they were entitled to it and there were no problems. I ask the Leader to relay to the Minister, but I will mention it to him when he takes the matter I raised on the Adjournment, that there would be no need to create a third tier medical card if eligibility for the medical card was assessed locally by people who know the circumstances of the clients and none of these problems would have arisen in the first place.

It is anything but fair. The vast majority who will have to pay the water tax will see it as unfair. In spite of all the so-called concessions to Deputy Eamon Gilmore and other Labour Party members, the average cost per household for water tax will be €240. That same Government recently introduced the property tax, where the average cost is €316, bringing the combined new charges on ordinary householders to an average of €560 per annum, yet the charges are not based on an assessment of income.

We have called for such a debate on several occasions but the Leader has not arranged it. We would be very comfortable with having that debate with anybody. We are discussing what the Government is doing in this state. The new charges will come to some €560 and let me remind the Labour Party that those charges are not based on income or ability to pay. It seems clear that the Labour Party has abandoned the principle of progressive taxation. These two measures are about raising revenue for national finances. None of the money that is being raised is going towards local services. We all know in our individual constituencies that the local authority's budgets have been slashed year after year. This is about raising revenue to plug the hole in the national finances. If that is what this is about there are fairer ways to achieve it, such as by having fair and progressive taxation. I will table an amendment to the Order of Business, calling on the Minister or Minister of State from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House. We spent nearly 16 hours debating the Water Services Bill. It has taken up to now for the Government to tell the people what they will pay for water. Let me remind people outside this House that after 2015, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Party councillors will have the power to increase the property tax, which they will do and after 2016 they will have the power to increase water charges.

This is not news. One year ago, the leader of Boko Haram announced to the world a new policy in an attempt to enforce militant Islamism in Nigeria. He told the Nigerian Government and the international community that this group would begin kidnapping children and selling them. Human Rights Watch estimates that they have already kidnapped 25 children this year in addition to the recent kidnap of 276 children. Added to this slavery is the message from Boko Haram that girls should not be receiving an education but should, while minors, be married off. Indeed one translation of this group's name is "western education is sinful". Nobody paid any attention to the group until now and if this had happened in the developed world, there would have been absolute outrage. Borders would have been shut and defence forces mustered and a vigorous campaign launched to bring the members of Boko Haram to justice. Instead, the Nigerian Government has until recent days turned a blind eye. Boko Haram developed from an original Nigerian Taliban and is equally as cruel and barbaric as its Afghan counterparts. We need to wake up to the threat it poses to the international community and to women in particular. Perhaps the Leader could organise a debate on the matter in the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

If Senator John Kelly is so concerned about the medical card issue, he should support the amendment to have the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, come to the House. It is outrageous that a German consultancy firm has been brought in to weed out applicants and refuse medical cards. The system is being run badly. I am dealing with a case, where the documents provided by the applicant have gone missing and the constituent was informed that the documents were never received, even though the applicant had sent the documents in a registered letter. I am advising all medical card applicants to register and have recorded correspondence with the HSE. I think the documentation is being lost on purpose to delay any approvals in the future. It is a serious situation and is causing great distress. I support the call made by Senators Jillian van Turnhout and Hildegarde Naughton in regard to the outrageous situation in Nigeria. The Boko Haram organisation has kidnapped 276 bright intelligent young women. That is a crime against humanity. I know the Americans are sending support to try to locate these young women, but the world should be mobilised to find them and return them to their families. The issue has dropped from the main headlines. There is more concern in the media about internal party political issues than about this issue. The kidnapping of these girls should be highlighted every day. Furthermore, I condemn the Egyptian Government and the judicial system for condemning 500 members of the Muslim Brotherhood to death by hanging. That is an outrageous proposal. This will set Egypt on a course of conflict worse than has been seen before. The Egyptian Government must have no regard for a proper judicial system to allow a judge to convict more than 500 young men to death by hanging. I hope the Government will take action in this regard.

I do not know how we can keep this issue on the agenda other than by raising it in this House. There was a rally this morning at the Nigerian Embassy from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. It is important to try to make an input. I am aware that President Barack Obama announced this morning that he will deploy satellite technology to find the location of the girls. We should call on NASA and anybody else with the technology to use it. If girls were kidnapped in a European country, the matter would be high on the agenda. It is time to use all the available technology for tracking people. I do not think it is beyond the realms of possibility that this technology should be used. Another nine girls were kidnapped last night. Boko Haram is bold and brazen enough to state it has sold some of the girls it kidnapped into early marriages. We need to keep the kidnapped young girls on the agenda. Water is important to everybody and Senator Ivana Bacik has outlined what has been done - I am not going to repeat it - for the groups that cannot afford water charges.

The development is essential for the restoration and maintenance of public trust and confidence in our charities whose work now, more than ever and across many sectors, makes such a crucial and highly valued contribution to society, the economy and the less well-off. Following the putting in place of a CEO last March, the Minister for Justice and Equality has announced a new board for the charity commission whose chairman will be Conor Woods, a young man who helped me put a report together in 2012. He is an accountant, chairperson of the Chartered Accountants Ireland's charity committee and a senior statutory auditor. Also, he is a dynamic, dedicated and driven individual who is passionate about the charity sector and wants to get things done. He will lead a magnificent board whose first board meeting will be in two weeks' time. He wants to get things up and running in a timely manner. Speaking of welcoming appointments, while we were on our break the banking inquiry committee began to come together. I wonder which Senator will represent us on the banking inquiry. As we all know, one of our Independent Senators happens to be one of the most expert economists in Ireland and sits on the other side of the Chamber. I refer to Senator Barrett. I am not on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and hope it is not too late to ask that Senator Sean D. Barrett represent Seanad Éireann on the committee as he is an independent expert. God knows, we need experts on the committee.

#LorraineHiggins	unknown-#LorraineHiggins-party	unknown-#LorraineHiggins-dob	unknown-#LorraineHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	60	I wish to raise the serious issue of the lack of change in the culture of banking in this country. I am sure many of us in this room watched last night's "Prime Time" debate. It featured a young couple who were forced to sell their family home for €60,000 having been left with an unsustainable debt of €190,000 and they were made bankrupt which is most regrettable. I acknowledge that people have a duty to pay their debts and that banks have a right to recourse for any of their loans. However, the extremities of the couple's situation raised more questions than answers. It is not the only example of shoddy practice by Ulster Bank against its Irish customers. In the past the bank had IT glitches that were caused by its outsourcing of IT positions to India. In recent weeks I have become aware of another issue that conveys fully the depravity of the banks when it came to lending during the Celtic tiger era. It acts as an example of the way they induced people to take out investments. One such issue that was brought to my attention related to a man who was forced into taking out a financial product. He was a long time customer of the bank but he was put under excruciating duress to invest in a property that was owned by Ulster Bank's parent group in England - RBS - a fact that was not disclosed to him. He resisted the investment in the strongest possible terms and did not give his consent. However, the bank told him that he was lucky to be included in the offer and that he would regret not proceeding with the investment. There was also further misrepresentation on the loan to value ratio. That shows Ulster Bank was funding its asset sale and explains why it engaged in such predatory practices. Essentially, it helped the English arm of its bank at a cost to Irish customers. It is not only me who had a problem with the practice. The Financial Regulator found that there were serious flaws and failures in the bank's sales practices. Not only did Ulster Bank fail to satisfy its regulatory requirements, pursuant to the consumer protection code of 2006, it failed in its overall duties to its clients.  I have given an example of how people suffered due to the practices of banks in this country. It is time for banks to put their hands up and stop prolonging the pain for people. I ask the Minister for Finance to come in here to discuss what sanctions can be imposed against the banks who have behaved appallingly. Concealing the information that I outlined while putting people under duress to buy property is a serious matter which needs to be addressed.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	61	Last summer the Fianna Fáil Party was privileged to have many young people from Boston College take up an internship. I was honoured to have a young lady called Ms Kate Moran as an intern who played a very important part in the production of my policy paper on women entrepreneurs. She is an example of the calibre of the young people who came here as interns so it is no surprise that Boston College is one of the most revered universities in the United States. Sadly, a dark shadow has been cast over the college as can be learned from an article in this morning's Irish Independent  entitled "University historians distance themselves from 'Boston Tapes'". The article refers to historians in Boston College who have distanced themselves from the controversial Boston tapes project where interviews held by Boston College were used by PSNI officers last week when interviewing the Sinn Féin leader, Deputy Gerry Adams. Speaking on RTE radio this morning Mr. Jack Dunne, spokesperson for Boston College, said that the two interviewers on the tapes showed incredible bias. He also said they failed to observe normal academic procedures into projects of oral history and used leading questions with no visible attempt at balance. The fact is that the Boston tapes were never meant to be part of current affairs but were intended to remain as an oral history project. Professor Weiler, professor of history at Boston College, said the project had "tarnished the reputation" of the college's history department. Professor Robin Fleming, the current chair of the college's history department, said press reports referring to the tapes as their project were "fundamentally inaccurate". Both Professor Weiler and Professor Fleming have vehemently stated that neither of the two interviewers heard on the tapes were employed by the college's history department. I believe it is extremely unfair that the actions of two people, neither of whom was employed by the college, can tarnish the reputation of Boston College.  The Governments of Ireland, the United States and Britain and hundreds of people have invested time and energy into keeping the peace process stable. Last week many boundaries were crossed that could lead to a breakdown of peace. Most people on this part of the island do not realise that the peace process is at risk and that many elements of society - both loyalists and extreme republicans - are dying to get back into war again. Therefore, I support Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú's call for an immediate debate on the Northern Ireland peace process.  I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by my colleague, Senator David Cullinane.

It is true to say that Boko Haram is one of the worst terrorist organisations to emerge in recent times and that this is a major issue that needs an international response. We can only imagine the distress being experienced by the parents of all of the missing children in Nigeria. It is incumbent on all democratically elected governments throughout the world to intervene and help in this situation. I support the call for the Tánaiste to get involved and to involve the European Union at the highest possible level in order to bring the girls safely back to their families and distraught parents. I support the call for the Minister for Health to come to the House, in due course, to discuss the emerging problems with medical cards.

However, a change in legislation is required to bring this about. This is why the Minister should come into the House and have a wider debate on the entire medical card issue, on how it could be made fairer and to ensure that situations such as those outlined on "The Late Late Show" broadcast the other night simply do not happen again.

I am sure he would know all about that and ours certainly are not. However, it appears that the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, has taken on some of the Teflon left behind by Bertie and the boys because he appears to be totally impregnable when it comes to the calamities and debacles that have ensued in his ministerial role. There has been the GSOC affair, the whistleblowers, the way in which he dealt with former Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan and now the statements by the Data Protection Commissioner with regard to the Deputy Mick Wallace affair, which was totally inappropriate. However, the Government stands behind and defends him all the way, which is completely inappropriate. The Labour Party, in particular, must consider its defence of the Minister once more. The reason I make this point again is because the Seanad Public Consultation Committee had a very good set of hearings yesterday. I note that a recurring theme that arose throughout that debate was the issue of direct provision, which Members have brought up many times in this House. I note that Professor Michael O'Flaherty, Dr. Liam Thornton, the Immigrant Council of Ireland and a number of others addressed the issue of direct provision in the context of international human rights. Professor O'Flaherty offered his opinion that the State and the Government are more than likely to get their hands rapped on this issue because it is very much in contravention of international human rights. Moreover, with all the debacles going on in the Department of Justice and Equality, it is clear that putting Bills such as the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill on the long finger and telling Members they cannot be dealt with is all because the Minister is putting out fire after fire within his own Department and is not focusing on the job of work that must be done. While it is well and good and proper for Senators to raise issues abroad of international human rights violations, human rights violations are happening on their watch on Irish soil that must be dealt with. Moreover, Members need a Minister who is competent and able to do that and who will bring forward the proper legislation that will deal with these issues in a forthright manner.

I find myself in agreement with the comments of my colleagues, Senators Michael Mullins and Imelda Henry, on the medical cards issue. Senator Marc MacSharry probably was prompted by the Taoiseach's humane approach as regards discretionary cards but more about that anon. I wish to raise the comments made yesterday by the credit controller, Mr. John Trethowan, before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation when he voiced his concerns regarding the exiting foreign banks leaving the Irish market, namely, Danske Bank, Bank of Scotland and ACC-Rabobank. This is an issue I addressed at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last week. It seems as though these people are not concerned about the strategies they are employing against their customers, which in many instances are very unfair. I raised these last week with the Governor of the Central Bank at the aforementioned committee and since then a number of cases have been brought to my attention directly that I intend to pursue further with the Governor. In fact, I have written to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform asking that the chief executive officers of the aforementioned three banks be brought before it to be questioned because their winding-down strategies are showing scant regard for customers and particularly for small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs. While they may not be concerned about any wreckage they are leaving behind them in their wake, Members must be concerned. We cannot afford to have inflicted any further structural damage on SMEs or to impede their recovery. I have been given instances of breaches of contract and of agreements, over-willingness to appoint receivers to viable trading companies and unnecessary demands as regards refinancing with other institutions. While I do not seek an immediate debate, this is an issue that Members might review following the further hearings by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	79	First, I join Senator Jillian van Turnhout in welcoming the opening of the female genital mutilation, FGM, clinic in Ireland. Interestingly, an Irish person opened the first such clinic in the United Kingdom approximately 21 years ago. The reason it was opened was because a huge number of Somali woman came into United Kingdom and London, in particular, and suddenly hospitals there had a new problem with which to deal. It was interesting to raise that issue with a senior politician at the time, 20-odd years ago, to be told this would never be a problem in Ireland. Senator van Turnhout has mentioned a figure of approximately 4,500 women who now require the facilities of this clinic, which just shows how one should never think that change will not come. New issues arise on a day-to-day basis and one should be prepared to deal with them. I wish to touch on the medical card issue because I wish to repeat what I have said previously. Medical cards are issued to people who could earn up to €5,000 per week and the Government now is obliged to trawl back from that scenario. Since coming into government, an additional 217,000 medical cards have been issued and 43% of the population now have medical cards. At present, 1,950,000 people either have a medical card or a GP-only card and the taxpayers are paying for this. I do not agree with the manner in which it currently is being reviewed, whereby people are being written to unnecessarily, which is causing unnecessary alarm. I already have asked the Minister that the current procedure in place regarding how the review is carried out be stopped and a new system considered. This must be done urgently because unnecessary alarm is being caused to people and this issue certainly must be considered. I ask that the Leader would convey these views and if the Minister comes into this House, I certainly will convey these views to him. I will touch on an issue raised by Senator Paul Coghlan regarding the banks and a situation I recently encountered. ACC Bank is closing down current accounts, but one is entitled to hold onto one's loan account. However, the problems for farmers is that when they seek to arrange an overdraft account with an alternative bank, the security is held by ACC Bank. If, for example, someone has an 80-acre farm, the easiest way to deal with that is for 20 acres to be released to be used as security for the overdraft facility in the alternative bank. However, ACC Bank is not accommodating farmers in that regard. I ask that the Minister intervene, as unnecessary hardship is being imposed on people. They are being obliged to transfer everything, even when they have very good conditions and loans. They now are being forced to walk away from these conditions and are being put into further financial difficulty. The Minister should intervene on this issue.I ask the Leader to raise the matter with the Minister for Finance at the earliest possible date.

This breaks the impasse where support from the Northern Executive was not forthcoming. I have spoken to a number of people in that regard since and they fully expect that the North-South Ministerial Council will indeed do that and that the funding application can be made in 2015 through the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB. I agree with Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú that it would be timely to have a debate on the North in this House, but we could talk until the cows come home in that there is that much to talk about, and, by the way, it does not make us Sinn Féin to be talking about the North.

I would like to start the ball rolling on that issue.  I ask for a debate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in attendance to discuss not only Narrow Water Bridge project but the A5 and that he outline North-South transport issues which we could then debate.
#JohnCrown	unknown-#JohnCrown-party	unknown-#JohnCrown-dob	unknown-#JohnCrown-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	91	I welcome all my colleagues back; it is good to see them all again. I am fairly upset about two health administration related issues which have come to light during the break. One was the announcement that the HSE was sponsoring a symposium by Professor Kaplan of Harvard for 300 assorted HSE employees on the question of value for money, and paying the professor, it is rumoured, €50,000 for his seminars with untold other expenses involved in the setting up of the meeting. There was a vague promise that sponsorship is being obtained from extra statutory sources, perhaps from people who have contacts to provide services and goods to the HSE. I did an MBA in health care many years ago pretty much with the express interest of finding out why professional bureaucrats kept telling people like me that we knew nothing abut running the health service and I found out that perhaps we knew a little more than they thought we did. I am appalled by this. I am also appalled at the sheer scale of the lack of proportion in hosting an event like this, which may cost several hundred thousand euro, at a time when we have lengthening waiting lists, when medical cards are being plucked out of the hands of people who have had them for many years, when deaf children are waiting for one year for hearing tests, when patients in hospitals are waiting for weeks to get scans done which are delaying their treatments, delaying the release of beds and clogging up the system. This is appalling. I would like Professor Kaplan if he watches "Oireachtas Report" tonight in the Merrion Hotel, or wherever he is staying, to be aware of a few things if he is trying to preach to us about value for money. We have managed to provide a health service with the smallest number of specialists per head of population in every single specialty known. We have the smallest number of physiotherapists and speech therapists who provide an extraordinary service often in Dickensian circumstances. We have a real priority problem if they think that we are not delivering value for money. Second, I alerted the House before to the fact that the press PR spokesperson from the HSE was issuing threats to a medical journalist who took part, in a very reasoned fashion, on the contentious debate about discretionary medical cards and whether people were having their prior discretionary medical cards removed. It is completely inappropriate that the HSE can have money lying around to hire Mr. Connors to act as its press spokesperson so that he can then try to throttle debate in our democracy on issues that are of critical public importance. Again, it goes to the heart of a bureaucracy which is gone mad.

The issue I raise now is one I raised when I served on a county council, namely, that something must be done about our electoral register. The issue of the register may not apply as much in a general election because it is more likely that people will be registered in a constituency and they may vote in a centre five or six miles from where they live but the issue applies in local elections where areas are divided and people may not vote in the area in which they are living. It is time that we had a review of the way our register is compiled and I ask the Leader write to the Minister on the Environment, Community and Local Government and to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government about this. It is time the PPS number was tied into the electoral register in order that when a person reaches the age of 18 years, his or her name will automatically be put on the register. The PPS number will tie in with one's residence and address and one's name will appear on the register where one is living. There is considerable duplication on the register and many people have moved out of areas and their name should no longer appear on the register in those areas. It is every citizen's right to vote in this county. Some people do not take on the onus of putting their name on the register. County councils have done their best over the years and have sent people around knocking on doors and written letters but suddenly at election time people will say that their name is not on the register. It is time we changed the way our register is compiled. The PPS number is the way to do it. I ask that the Leader to write to the Minister and to the Oireachtas joint committee about this. If we do not deal with the issue now, it will be 2016 when we will think about it again when the general election will be held. It is time to do it now while the iron is hot.

I am not agreeing to the amendment proposed to the Order of Business. The Minister has spoken on the matter and is examining the situation. Senator Marc MacSharry gave a wrong indication when he spoke about blind people, especially when we recall that Fianna Fáil completely cut blind people's allowances, but we will not go into that. Several Members pointed to the problems with medical cards, while Senator Terry Leyden referred to documents which had gone missing. I have come across that problem on several occasions. It is very frustrating for people who know that they have given the required information to be told their documents have gone missing. That is totally unacceptable, irrespective of what Department or organisation is involved. It is extremely frustrating for the people concerned. Senator John Kelly made the point that a German company was involved in reviewing medical cards. Senator Terry Leyden also referred to that point. These comments deserve a response and I will bring the matter to the attention of the relevant Minister. Senator Marc MacSharry also raised the issue of water charges. The Government has taken a brave stance, which Members on the other side of the House said would not happen. The Government stated it would give an indication before an election of what the charges would be. There is no cuteness. We are putting the figures to the people in a transparent manner before an election, which is to be welcomed. I think this will be welcomed. They certainly will not welcome having to pay more money, but they will welcome the transparency of the Government in being up front and putting the figures before them.  In regard to Fianna Fáil, its original deal with the troika envisaged a €400 annual charge from last year, with no allowances. That is what it signed up to. In regard to Sinn Féin, in Northern Ireland it already charges for water indirectly as part of the domestic rates regime which includes a property tax.It recently deferred the introduction of direct charging for water until 2016. At an average figure of €950 per household, domestic rates in the North are already far in excess of their equivalent in the South.

Senators Jillian van Turnhout, Colm Burke and others spoke about the issue of female genital mutilation and the reopening of the clinic, which will be welcomed by everybody. Senators Jillian van Turnhout, Hildegarde Naughton, Terry Leyden, Cáit Keane and Michael Mullins spoke about the abduction of children in Nigeria. This appalling event is not getting the international coverage it deserves. I agree that swift action is required on the part of the Nigerian Government and pressure should be applied by all countries in that regard. I would welcome an all-party motion on the matter that might be discussed next week. I hope such a motion will be forthcoming. This side of the House would certainly be agreeable to raising the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade at the appropriate time next week. I hope something will also be done in the meantime. Senator Jillian van Turnhout also spoke about child beauty pageants. The view of this House on the matter is clear and unequivocal, but it is a matter for the Dáil to decide its view. Senator Sean D. Barrett referred to Setanta Insurance. I agree completely with his remarks in that regard. The lack of regulation is, once again, an issue in the context of insurance companies. I have been approached by a number of people in recent weeks regarding claims they had made and the payments they were expecting to receive. They do not know where they stand. If the Central Bank knew about the issue since last November, why did it not take action then? Policies were being sold as recently as the week before the company went into liquidation. Some recourse must be offered to those who are in this situation. The Government of Malta, where the company was regulated, should not get away scot free in that regard. I will raise the issue with the Minister for Finance who has also commented on it. I also share Senator Sean D. Barrett's concerns about Mr. Trichet which, no doubt, will be discussed in the banking inquiry. Senator Mary Ann O'Brien asked about the make up of the inquiry. On behalf of the House, I made representations, as requested, to involve Senators in the inquiry and it has been decided that the Government will nominate one Senator and that the Opposition will also nominate one Senator. It is to be welcomed that the House is recognised when it comes to forming a committee of such importance. Senators John Kelly, Imelda Henry, Michael Mullins and Paul Coghlan raised the issue of discretionary medical cards, to which I referred.  Senators Labhrás Ó Murchú and Mary White called for a debate on Northern Ireland. I have asked the Taoiseach to deal with this matter. As Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú noted, this House has had balanced and reasonable debates on Northern Ireland and I have no reason to believe any other debate we might have would not be conducted in a similar manner. This House has always been to the fore in promoting peace and reconciliation and we should continue in that role. One of the amendments to Standing Orders that the Government has proposed to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is that Ministers who attend North-South ministerial meetings should report to this House in order that we can debate the issues arising. Senator Jim D'Arcy referred to this issue in the context of transport matters. I expect this proposal to be accepted by the committee and the House and it should be welcomed by all Members. I have addressed the question raised by Senator David Cullinane regarding water charges.  Senator Terry Leyden referred to the decision of the Egyptian judiciary to hand down death sentences to more than 500 people. This is a most regrettable decision which perhaps the Senator might raise on the Adjournment.  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien welcomed the decisions by the Minister for Justice and Equality on the regulation of charities and the appointment of a new board. This is something Senators have sought for some time. I compliment the Minister on making these appointments. Senator Lorraine Higgins spoke about the culture of banking, including Ulster Bank in particular, and called for a debate on sanctions against banks. I wish the Senator, with Senators Deirdre Clune, Thomas Byrne and Rónán Mullen, well in their quest for election to the European Parliament. It is a hard campaign. Senator Mary White referred to the views of Boston College on the tapes. I am sure the issue will be raised during our debate on Northern Ireland.  Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh referred to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the comments he had made on several occasions. The Minister will be introducing the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill 2013, about which people have spoken for the last ten years, and other reforming legislation in the coming months. In regard to direct provision, yesterday we had an excellent exchange of views between the Seanad Public Consultation Committee and representatives of human rights organisations. I thank the Members who attended that meeting and contributed to the debate. The report of the committee will be published shortly. I thank Senator Katherine Zappone, in particular, for her excellent work in preparing for the meeting and compiling the report. Direct provision was one of the issues raised, rightly so, but it was also noted that fewer than 4,000 people were in direct provision accommodation, compared to 8,000 when the Government entered office. It is to be welcomed that the delays in processing applications for asylum have been significantly reduced.

I am trying to be balanced in my reply rather than take one side of the fence or the other. Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the comments made by Mr. John Trethowan on foreign banks leaving the Irish market with scant regard for their customers, SMEs in particular. I am sure that matter will be examined by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in the coming weeks or months. Senator Colm Burke said the procedure for the review of medical cards should be re-examined, which is exactly what the Minister is going to do. The Senator also pointed out that 217,000 extra medical cards had been issued in the past two to three years. I noted his comments on problems between ACC Bank and farmers. I am sure he has raised this matter with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but if he wishes to give me the details, I will certainly bring it to the attention of the Minister also. Senator Jim D'Arcy referred to the Narrow Water Bridge project and the fact that the June meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council would address the matter. I hope, as a result of the proposals made by the Government in regard to reforming the procedures of this House, we will be able to discuss the matter with the relevant Ministers when they come back from the meeting. I note Senator John Crown's points on the HSE, value for money and the question of a public relations person for the HSE allegedly issuing threats to people. It is certainly unacceptable if threats were issued.  Senator Pat O'Neill referred to the local and European Parliament elections and the compilation of the register of electors. That matter is discussed year after year and before and after local elections. The point the Senator made that it could be linked with PPS numbers should be discussed by the relevant committee. I will certainly drop a line to the Chairman of that committee asking that it be done in early course.

My hope is that by discussing this issue, we will have some further thoughts on it before Report Stage. Friendly societies have been a major part of the financial life of citizens, particularly the less well-off, a contention for which I will adduce evidence later. It is proposed not to allow the creation of new friendly societies in a financial landscape that has to be described as a wilderness. Why were the friendly societies picked out in this legislation? Whatever else happens in Irish financial affairs, there will be no more friendly societies. I could nominate dozens of candidates to which the extinction clause included in the section should be applied much sooner than the friendly societies. Perhaps the Minister of State might reflect on the issue before Report Stage because, without being aggressive about it, I am at a loss to understand the reason friendly societies merit the fate that is envisaged for them in the Bill. They have done a great deal of good, certainly when compared to other sections of the financial services sector which caused a great deal of harm. I will refer to these later. According to the explanatory memorandum, the "main amendment in the area of friendly societies provides for the closure of registration of new societies." The House should only accept this measure following the deepest consideration and debate. What are friendly societies and why does the Government not want new societies to be founded? The Registrar of Friendly Societies, Ms Helen Dixon, states friendly societies are registered under the Friendly Society Acts 1896 to 1977 and established for various purposes, primarily to provide small life assurance benefits, sick benefits and death benefits to members, provide benefits to non-members and promote particular activities or interests. Let us dwell briefly on the primary activities to which Ms Dixon alludes. The provision of small life assurance benefits, sick benefits and death benefits appears to be a good thing. Reading Ms Dixon's reports, one does not encounter the types of conflicts and disastrous economic performance one finds in other sectors. The reason for putting an end to the foundation of any new friendly societies is not obvious from her statements.  The number of registered friendly societies is in decline and currently stands at 48. As I indicated, we should compare this sector with what has taken place in the banking and insurance sectors. The case of Setanta Insurance was raised on the Order of Business before the Minister of State joined us. In addition, a major High Court decision was made against a stockbroker recently.We have had to pay €1 billion to insurance companies that failed. We had to intervene in the case of a credit union in Newbridge. We have no building societies left and we have a collection of zombie banks which have cost us €85 billion. In that particular landscape I do not share any sense of urgency that we should today seek that no new friendly societies should be formed. The Public Service Friendly Society is an example of one. It had its annual general meeting in Buswells Hotel in the week before I started my research on the Bill. That society provides access to low-cost illness protection, specified illness cover, assistance in financial difficulty, travel insurance and help for members struggling with school costs. It provides advice and direct educational grants - repayable as well as non-repayable. For those who find themselves in a tight financial spot for whatever reason, the society can help. It provides a first-contact confidential service, and offers support and direction. That is obviously a very good society. Why would we not anticipate that the next generation of people would be equally adept at forming such a good society as the Public Service Friendly Society? Across the water these societies are stronger. The newly formed Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom is responsible for the governance of 10,000 such societies. In the United Kingdom friendly societies manage the savings and investments of 4.5 million people with total funds of £15 billion under management. Based on the accounts of the registrar, Ms Helen Dixon, friendly societies were established to encourage self-help, personal responsibility and enable people with limited financial resources to improve their economic status. They do not have shareholders which means the full benefits of the products are passed on to their customers. They typically offer better returns, lower charges and better service than insurers with shareholders. These are mutual benevolent societies or fraternal organisations gathering together for the purposes of insurance, pensions, savings or co-operative banking. They have a very distinguished role. A great and former Member of this House, Sir Horace Plunkett, founded such societies throughout the country, out of which grew the very strong agriculture and dairying sector, not least in the Minister of State's neighbourhood and constituency. Before modern insurance and the welfare state, friendly societies provided financial and social services for individuals. Before the development of large-scale government and employer health insurance, these societies were there. If members became sick, they would receive an allowance from their mutual society. The society might have a doctor whom the member could consult for free. We already mentioned the funeral expenses. They have also been very active in Scotland. I place before the Minister of State that evidence of their record and what they are doing now. They do not appear to be in trouble unless the Minister of State has information as to why this section is included in the Bill. I point to what they do, the parts of society in which they work, their idealism, their solvency and their providing help for people particularly in a State that has such financial difficulties that we frequently find in this House that many of the things we would like to do are not possible. Would the development of a mutual self-help society, such as the Public Service Friendly Society, not be positive? Should we not encourage and promote the establishment of new ones, which would therefore mean not going ahead with that section of the Bill? Can we now say that no friendly society will ever be established again in Ireland? That is what this section provides for. Do we really intend to tie the hands of future generations? Would they not be just as idealistic as Sir Horace Plunkett, George William Russell and others who went before us? Before voting for the section preventing the establishment of any friendly society in Ireland again, we should consider their record in the United Kingdom and here. We should consider their establishment by the kinds of practical patriots we so badly need. We should consider the new generation. We continually look for people with initiative and entrepreneurship, and we desperately need new financial institutions. Friendly societies have played a noble role. Who am I to say they could never do so again? I was disturbed, as was the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, when he told the House that the banking institutions had intervened to push down the rate of interest paid in the Post Office Savings Bank. I hope it could not possibly be true that banks have put pressure on the Government to get rid of friendly societies in the same way as they put pressure on the Government to reduce the rate of interest paid in the Post Office Savings Bank. The Minister was very concerned about this. The bank bailout bill is approximately €85 billion and we are setting up an inquiry into that today. We have paid about €1 billion in insurance - in one year Quinn Insurance lost €900 million, and PMPA and ICI lost a couple of hundred million pounds each back in the 1980s. The administrators of Quinn Insurance are suing the firm's accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, for €1 billion. We could go through the list of what is wrong in financial services. I would make a very strong case that the friendly societies should not be scheduled for abolition by this House of Parliament. That is why I do not support section 5. I hope that, on reflection, all Members of the House could come back and ask cui bono; for what benefit are we proposing that a group of self-help people should never again come together for their mutual benefit? Why are we saying that we never again want a new friendly society established? Cessation of registration of new societies seems to be so draconian that there should have been a Green Paper or White Paper before proposing that it be done in section 5 of this Bill. Given the wilderness that is the Irish financial sector, what singles out friendly societies for this kind of treatment, as proposed in section 5(1)? I am not sure there will be any support for such a measure when this comes to be discussed widely in the country. We might wish to register them differently, although that is not apparent in Ms Dixon's report. There were some scandals.I heard a man in Spain who had taken money being interviewed by RTE. One deplores that and better regulation is needed. I praise RTE for that piece of investigative journalism. It was a long time ago. I think a youthful George Lee might have been on its perimeter. The money, however, was peanuts compared with what has happened since. If there is a problem with friendly societies, I would be delighted to consider it but the overwhelming weight of evidence is that they were very good in the past. While they have reduced in number to 48, I would never rule out the possibility that the next generation, on whom we rely to clear up so many of the other problems that have arisen here in the past seven or eight years, would not have the idealism to reinvent friendly societies. If they did, they would run contrary to this Bill. I would be most interested to discuss how the Minister of State proposes to proceed in this matter. I make an earnest case that these were good for the country and for their own members. They did not impose the kind of burden on society that some of the other financial institutions, which behaved disgracefully, did.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15127	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	112	I thank the Senator for proposing this amendment. To be fair to the Government side, we addressed many of those questions on Second Stage and given that this is Committee Stage, I will begin by giving the rationale for section 5 and then give a brief overview of some of the issues raised by the Senator. Section 5 provides for a very significant change to the Friendly Societies Act 1896, that is, the cessation of registration of any new societies under this legislation. Only a few societies, 47, remain in existence. There have been only three new entrants in the past nine years giving a clear indication that the friendly society model is no longer favoured by newly establishing organisations. The current legislation does not provide for prudential supervision of friendly societies by any public authority. This is a source of some concern in that there is some potential risk to the interests of certain members of the public and I consider that it is in the public interest to restrict the operation of new entities in this area. That is the justification for section 5. Furthermore, certain limitations are already being placed on the activities and functioning of friendly societies by other bodies of legislation. For example, the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 introduced restrictions on new bodies registering for the purpose of the provision of health insurance, that is, no new bodies may register as restricted membership undertakings; the Charities Act 2009 introduces a new charities regulatory authority and registration requirements to which several of the benevolent type societies may be subject; and the Consumer Credit Act 1995 brings a small number of societies under the supervision of the Central Bank for loans purposes. I assure the Senator that there is no disadvantage foreseen to any would-be societies in that they can register, either under the Industrial and Provident Societies or the Companies Acts, in both instances with the added protection of body corporate status. The Friendly Societies Acts do not confer full corporate status on societies or limited liability on members. The evidence in recent years is that this has become common practice for many charities and clubs which register as limited companies. This change will mean in effect that the friendly society model will continue only as a closed group of societies, that is, the existing societies will continue in operation but no new societies will be permitted to establish. The Central Bank regulates savings, loan and insurance activities carried out by entities involved in the provision of financial services with a view to protecting the financial interests of members of the public doing business with the provider of the financial services but not where these activities are carried out by friendly societies. This is a source of some concern to the Government in that there is some potential risk to the interests of certain members of the public and we consider that it is in the public interest to restrict the operation of new entities in this area. There is no expertise in this area in the registry of friendly societies and no existing legal basis for such supervision and it would not be practical given the number of societies involved to develop a supervisory regime within the registration of a friendly society, RFS. The most realistic institutional option for introducing an appropriate system of supervision is the Central Bank, which is at the centre of financial supervision and financial stability oversight and has a responsibility to provide, in a fully integrated and co-ordinated manner, for the prudential supervision and stability of all types of financial service within the financial system as a whole. To avoid the possibility of other bodies moving into this unregulated space, it was decided to close registrations to new friendly societies. I hope that addresses the concerns raised by the Senator in his amendment. Only a few societies, some 47, remain in existence. There have been only three new entrants in the past nine years and that must indicate that newly-establishing organisations no longer favour the friendly society model. We strongly believe no new societies may register in the future as friendly societies.

The Public Service Friendly Society promises guaranteed acceptance for its health benefits. That arose because Government was concerned about selectivity in the area and it brought in a lot of legislation. That is a minor point. There seems to be a complete difference of opinion between what is done in the United Kingdom and here. I hope the Government’s concern with new entities does not reflect any pressure from banks because we are sowing the seeds of far more financial troubles in this country with the pillar bank strategy. This will be an appalling duopoly. Senators referred on the Order of Business to foreign banks withdrawing from their regions. I am sure the expertise lives in the Central Bank now but we recall the 84 times when the official in a recent High Court action could not remember anything. That was not much in the way of regulatory expertise. We are assuming a completely different kind of Central Bank from the one that featured recently in the courts. That was abysmal regulation. As I will speak with the Minister of State between now and Report Stage, I will not press this amendment. The Minister of State knows my concerns. Why are the friendly societies regarded as an avenue for malpractice and so on? Might they be better regulated? Might we learn something from the UK experience, which I quoted and which will be available in the Official Report? Compared with what has happened in the rest of the financial services, these were much more idealistic and still are. They are formed by people acting in a co-operative manner for their mutual benefit.That is something we might consider. As of today, we have raised thoughts about how friendly societies might be preserved, protected and grow. I may speak with the Minister, as we do when we meet in the corridors around here, to see if we can deal with the fears he has mentioned. Is the House correct in assuming new friendly societies would represent a threat to people's well-being and livelihood? That would be said but compared to some of the people on the list, any damage - which is minuscule compared to the major benefits - would pale into insignificance. For example, one institution was led by a man who has stated he does not want to give any evidence about his activities to these Houses of Parliament, and people have said such things before. In all of this I remain an advocate of the friendly societies. I will think about what the Minister of State has indicated before now and the next Stage. I certainly would not have chosen them as a target, stipulating that from this day we will never again allow friendly societies to be established in this jurisdiction.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	114	I will continue on the same theme. This concerns cessation of formation of new separate loan funds, and after the coming into operation of this Bill, one may not form a separate loan fund. If a party has one already, it will be permitted to keep that in existence. This means we do not want existing societies to develop into more lending, although we may need that in future. The Minister for Finance is considering what kind of financial influence Ireland will have but as we want to cease having new societies, the existing societies will not be allowed to form new separate loan funds. That may be an important function which could be badly needed in the economy in the years ahead, particularly if we end up with two pillar banks and no building societies, with the other difficulties we have mentioned. Why would one stop new funds being set up when the activity of running such funds now is perfectly lawful? I have not heard any evidence that there is any misappropriation of those funds. What problems are we addressing in the section? It seems that an existing friendly society - there are 48 detailed in the annual report but only 47 remain - want to set up loan funds while satisfying the needs of members, with a better track record than most financial services in the country, why would one seek to shut off the possibility? This is to repeat the arguments made in opposition to section 5.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15127	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	115	I thank the Senator for his comments. The Senator is effectively opposing the proposal to prohibit the establishment of new loan funds where a society does not currently operate a loan fund, and the Government does not agree that this section should be omitted. Section 6 places a restriction on existing societies establishing a loan fund as provided for in section 46 of the principal Friendly Societies Act 1896 where they do not already have such a fund in place. This change will not impact existing societies which currently have a fund in place. As I mentioned previously, such activity is not subject to prudential supervision by any public authority, and whereas the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010, in amending the Consumer Credit Act 1995, bring a small number of societies under the supervision of the Central Bank for loan purposes, I am of the opinion that societies not already active in this field should not be permitted to extend their remit. It is very important from a consumer protection view that the provision of loans to individuals should be a regulated activity. It is not desirable that societies should be in the business of making loans without reasonable protections being afforded to the individuals accepting the loans, and this is generally accepted by societies themselves, as only three of the 47 currently operate loan funds. The section effectively provides that where a friendly society does not at the time of the passing of this Bill operate a loan fund as provided under section 46 of the Friendly Societies Act 1896, such a society may not establish a loan fund after the coming into operation of the Bill. It does not affect the operation of an existing society currently operating a loan fund.

A representative of one bank indicated it was giving 90% loans on properties and lending up to 4.7 times income. The correct ratios should be 2.5 times income for 80% loans. In introducing a Bill in this House I indicated that such a system operates in Denmark. I can see a housing bubble developing again if banks continue to offer 90% loans while offering to pay stamp duty. As the Governor of the Central Bank mentioned, we do not have laws against reckless lending, unfortunately, and he would probably like macro-prudential rules. We sent our thoughts on the Bill to Brussels and the officials from the Department of Finance probably intervened in meetings rather than going a more direct route. If there were rules, the three friendly societies interested in this and the 44 which might become interested could devise sensible rules for lending. In the configuration of Irish banking and the need for all forms of credit - other than bailing out banks - we will need new financial architecture. I would not like to rule out the friendly societies from being part of this. As with the previous section, I will not formally oppose it. I will consider what can be done on Report Stage. It is probably not as major a point as the previous issue, which restricted any new friendly society. Somebody will be required to lend responsibly in the society after the incredible damage done by reckless lending, which has yet to be punished and see proper regulation. There may be possible benefits from the work of friendly societies, and I am impressed by what the Public Service Friendly Society sent me. We need a wider view of the new financial architecture. Friendly societies extending loans under some kind of supervision as mentioned by the Minister of State, could be a beneficial act; therefore, we should not shut it off. I may discuss this with the Minister of State before the next Stage.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15127	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	117	The Senator mentioned the supervisory regime or lack thereof. Nobody in these Houses of the Oireachtas would disagree with the Senator's critique of the lack of supervision.There is no question or ambiguity about that but for the purposes of the Bill it is important to note that we are seeking to move to a situation whereby one recognises the 47 that are in existence and those that have loan funds, but one ensures that the changes to the legislation are being made as a preliminary step in the process of establishing a system of the most appropriate supervision of certain existing societies, especially operating in the area of financial service provision. That is the ethos under which we are trying to introduce the legislation. It is intended that the group of societies would be subject to Central Bank supervision and that this would be the closed group. I accept the points made by the Senator. I do not think anybody in the House would disagree with him on his critique of the system up to now but what we are seeking to do is to ensure the system is fit for purpose, notwithstanding the fact that these friendly societies go back to the 19th century and there is a particular ethos around them. The Senator speaks to my own geographical area of north Cork. I remember names such as Nora Herlihy and Horace Plunkett among others that are synonymous with movements such as this. We do not seek to lose sight of that either but what we want to do is ensure we have an appropriate model for the 21st century and that is what we are trying to achieve in the Bill.

That seems to go against what the Minister of State said in that it is relaxing the conditions. If we have fears, let us see who the members are every three years and what their holdings are. I support what the Minister of State just said in suggesting the amendment weakens regulation when it is the case that we should not weaken the regulation.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15127	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	119	Section 11 provides for the removal of the requirement for societies to submit at least once in every three years a return to the members and their holdings to the registrar. It is known as the triennial return. The co-operative sector has sought the abolition of the requirement and argue that the information is out of date too quickly to be useful, and imposes an unnecessary administrative burden on societies. There is general agreement that the return serves no useful purpose and, accordingly, it is proposed to remove the requirement. The removal of the requirement is balanced by the provision in section 10(g) for a right for non-members to inspect the books containing the names of members and their holdings in shares at the registered office of the society. Members already have a similar right. This section is modelled on the like section in the Companies Acts. Information is therefore available to both members and non-members on a current information basis, which would render the triennial return unnecessary. Section 11 relates to the industrial and provident societies, that is, co-operatives and societies that are not friendly societies.

I welcome the Minister of State from the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and thank her for agreeing to take this motion. I propose it on behalf of the Labour Party Senators and my colleague, Senator Mary Moran, will second it. We acknowledge the assistance and support of the Centres for Independent Living. Some representatives from the centres are present and others will come in. It is on their initiative that we have put forward the motion. The motion refers to, "Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, UN CRPD, provides that states should recognise 'the equal right of all persons with disabilities to live in the community, with choices equal to others’ and commits states to ‘take effective and appropriate measures to facilitate full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of this right and their full inclusion and participation in the community’". That principle lies at the heart of the motion. In the spirit of the article, the motion "notes the commitment in the programme for Government 2011 to ensuring ‘that the quality of life of people with disabilities is enhanced’ and further that the Government will ‘facilitate people with disabilities in achieving a greater level of participation in employment, training and education’". We note the aim of the national disability strategy and the provision of personal assistance services. The provision of the services is the practical focus of this motion while by the broader context is set out in Article 19 of the UN convention. The motion "acknowledges the progress made by the Government in respect of the programme for Government commitments on facilitating the full participation of people with disabilities in society, particularly in: the publication of the value for money and policy review of the disability services ... the publication of an implementation plan for the national disability strategy; the development of a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities...". We want to focus on the idea of the provision of a personal assistance service, PAS, within the overall framework of migrating to a person-centred supports model and to address the question of whether it would be possible to achieve this within a statutory framework in the lifetime of the Government. The Government has stated its intention to proceed to ratify the UN convention but certain further legislative and administrative steps must be taken in order to do so, one of the key requirements being the enactment of capacity legislation. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has considered the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, published last year, which is due to be taken on Committee Stage shortly. The motion mentions the national disability strategy. I compliment the Minister of State on setting up and chairing the implementation group referred to in the motion which considers how the strategy can be put into effect in order that it is not just a paper strategy but is properly implemented. The Government has seen the implementation plan which was developed and published in July last year. The Centres for Independent Living, some of their members are present, which have been very instrumental in the framing of the motion, are represented on the implementation group with other disability organisations and individuals. The Minister of State has also set up a disability forum which will operate in a manner similar to the social inclusion forum. The motion also mentions the development of a comprehensive employment strategy which is ongoing. The Department has committed to publishing the strategy at the end of this year. The Centres for Independent Living - there are many centres around the country - have pioneered the concept of the PAS. Every day thousands of people with disabilities benefit directly from services provided by centres for independent living. The key feature of the PAS, introduced here in the early 1990s by the Centres for Independent Living, is that the person with disabilities is the leader in the service. The Centres for Independent Living is committed to ensuring independent living, that persons with disabilities have the choice to live life with the help of PAS. The PAS is the necessary assistance required by a person with a disability to ensure he or she can participate of full and equal member of society. Leadership is critical. The PAS should be fully directed by the individual leader. This is self-empowering. The Centres for Independent Living point out that it is distinct from home help services which are not empowering in the same way. In home help services other professionals decide what the person needs and assign responsibilities. In the PAS the person with a disability leads the service. That is critically important. The HSE provides a range of assisted living services, including the PAS. It states the role of the personal assistant in a scheme is to assist a person with a disability to maximise independence through supporting them to live in integrated settings and to access community facilities. The personal assistant works on a one-to-one basis in the home or the community and services are accessed through an application process or through referrals from public health nurse or other community-based staff. The difficulty posed by the absence of statutory framework for the PAS is that we do not have a rights-based service.There is certainly a strong view, with which I agree, taken by the Centres for Independent Living that statutory protection for the personal assistance scheme would give it greater protection against cuts to resources, for example. It would also give individual applicants a greater feeling of support and strength in applying for personal assistance services. Personal assistance service is provided through the Health Service Executive. In its 2014 national service plan, the HSE committed to providing 1.3 million hours of personal assistance in disability services. The Centres for Independent Living point out that according to 2012 figures, there were 650 people in receipt of personal assistance services, 546 in receipt of home-help hours and 346 utilising a home-care assistant. Services are being offered but the question is about the framework in which they are offered and the access people have to these services. This is where the idea of a statutory framework would be very positive. A statutory framework would also give greater clarity to several issues such as the definition of “personal assistance service”. The definition I cited earlier is from the Centres for Independent Living. The Government has a shorter definition, which states: "The role of the personal assistant is to assist a person with a disability to maximise their independence through supporting them to live in integrated settings and access community facilities". The difficulty with the absence of a clear statutory definition is that in a practical setting, like when a person with a disability enters hospital, the question arises as to whether they might have a personal assistant with them. That has given rise to difficulty in the past. Senator Mary Moran and I have heard from members of the Centres for Independent Living of the fear that personal assistance services might be withdrawn in a particular context, such as a hospital setting, or would not be allowed in particular settings. Greater clarity would be provided were we to see a definition of personal assistance scheme in statute. A statute could also provide more clearly about the means of assessment for the provision of the service. That is another area in which, again, there is a good deal of fear. The Government could ensure the person with a disability is the leader and the person whom the budget follows. They would be the person who has the autonomy of choice. The lived experiences of people with disabilities about which we have heard indicates the need to ensure that autonomy is in place. There is a great deal of fear among persons with disabilities who are approaching retirement age that they may lose their personal assistance service or be placed in a different care context such as a nursing home. I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is receptive to our arguments. We heard earlier how the Centres for Independent Living had already met the Minister of State and found her to be supportive and understanding of the issues involved. The centre also found she is aware of the fears people with disabilities may feel, particularly when they already have access to a personal assistance service and know the difference it can make in their lives in holding down a job, pay a mortgage and participate fully and equally in society. It is again returning to that key principle that is set out in Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities that personal assistance services are fundamental in ensuring individuals have the right and ability to participate fully and equally in society. This evening, I received an e-mail from a woman who is a wheelchair user but who lives a full and independent life solely due to the daily support she gets from her personal assistant. This support allows her to work part-time and to contribute to society, partake in activities outside of her home, social or otherwise, as well as providing her with self-determination and choice over how to live her life. She stated:The availability of personal assistance service is a resource-based and it is no exaggeration to say that every day I live in fear that it will be taken away. If I lost my PA, personal assistance, hours tomorrow, I would lose my home as I could no longer live here. I would also lose my job as I would not have the ability to attend. The likelihood is that I would be forced to enter institutional care, the ultimate cost of which is loss of independence and self-determination.She concluded by asking Senators to support the motion as a first step in enshrining personal assistance services in law. Her e-mail puts it eloquently. We drafted the motion with Government support. There is no amendment to it and I very much hope we will have cross-party support from all our colleagues in the House. It is an important motion in recognising the importance of personal assistance services to ensure vindication of the rights of persons with disabilities under Article 19 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The motion also calls proactively on the Government to support the provision of personal assistance services within the overall framework. I hope it will be the first step towards a statutory-based model of personal assistance service. The Centres for Independent Living have drafted legislation to provide for this which I have supplied to the Minister’s office. While it would require some redrafting, we should examine it. The motion is important in highlighting the significance of personal assistance services to enable many individuals with disabilities, many of whom are watching this debate, to live fully independent lives and participate as equal members of society.
#MaryMoran	unknown-#MaryMoran-party	unknown-#MaryMoran-dob	unknown-#MaryMoran-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	130	I am pleased and honoured to second the motion. I welcome Mr. John Dolan and other members of the Centres for Independent Living who are here for this debate. I agree with Senator Ivana Bacik on the need to put the personal assistance service on a statutory framework. Speaking to those involved, it was reiterated to me that we need certainty and greater clarity in this area. A personal assistance service in its simplest form ensures that those with disabilities are able to actively and fully engage in society. The full definition of such a service needs statutory protection and would make clear the difference between a personal assistant and home-help hours. Many of us do not fully grasp the exclusion and everyday difficulties that arise for people with physical or sensory disabilities. Going to the cinema, the shop, or as many Members know from organising trips to Leinster House, can be a nightmare for a person with a disability. I commend the ushers in the Houses of the Oireachtas for the support they give people with limited mobility or a disability when they visit the Houses. It is an attention above and beyond the call of duty that they provide every day. Last week I met someone in a wheelchair coming into the Houses, but there was a problem with the lifts. What should have been a simple journey to speak to a Member turned into the greatest nightmare for this person. The everyday tasks we find so simple can be a barrier for a person with limited mobility to leading a full and inclusive life in society. While Ireland has not yet ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, I believe there is cross-party agreement on Article 19 that provides that states should recognise the equal rights of all persons with disabilities to live in the community with choices equal to others and shall take effective and appropriate measures to facilitate full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of this right and their full inclusion and participation in the community.We have all spoken about this idea and paid lip service to it. We have laid documents and reports before the nation but we need to do more and provide more tangible and concrete paths to inclusion. We need to strengthen the person assistance service in order that those with a physical or sensory disability are no longer at a disadvantage. The rest of society is missing out because of the conscious or unconscious barriers placed before people with a disability. This Private Members' motion calls on the Government to support a person centred support model for a personal assistance service that would allow for independent living and full engagement in society. That seems simple. The overall funding for the disability services programme in 2014 is €1.4 billion with the HSE providing a range of assisted living services, including personal assistance services. The Disability Federation of Ireland published a report on the personal assistance services provided in Ireland in February 2014. The report identified a lack of understanding of the special role and the purpose of the service, with new entrants having less control over its delivery. The authors of the report stated that by refocusing on independent living for the user, the service would better progress our own policies in government. This service should not just be about meeting the personal care needs of the individual. Independent living was the original focus and should remain the focus today. It is well established at this stage that by proving empowerment by the personal assistance service, the mental and physical health of the user, the leader, would be enhanced. This could lead to less care being needed in the future while also removing many people from residential or assisted living situations, where possible. In the document the Disability Federation of Ireland has provided a very apt quotations from a man, which states: "I would rather fight to the death, if I had to for my freedom, the personal assistance service has ensured my freedom. If I did not have the personal assistance service I would be in bed with bedsores in one room with very few possessions." One can imagine the mental and physical toll that would have. He finished by saying, "Life would not be worth living." Senator Ivana Bacik referred to the number of e-mails we have received on this subject. It is great to see the number of people who take an interest in the debates in the Seanad and want to play their part. I am delighted that we in this Chamber have the opportunity to be the voice for people who have put forward their views on this subject. The very caring Minister of State listens to the people whom she meets.  The allocation of €1.4 billions to this section of the health service seems a great deal of money. It is a great deal of money but my argument, which I have made previously, is that disability is not just an issue for the Department of Health. I have made the case that those with disabilities who participate in sport come under the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. Services for the disabled also come under the Departments of Education and Skills, the Environment, Community and Local Government, as well as other Departments. Intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities should be addressed by every Department.

It is not always about how much we allocate but how to use the money most effectively and efficiently. Through my role in this sector, I hear that the quality of the personal assistance service could be improved. In the mental health sector, we now have a person to lead service user engagement to improve our mental health services. I am aware the Minister has set up and I commend her on chairing the national disability strategy Implementation group which is progressing the national disability strategy. Further consultation could be conducted on the specific area of personal assistance service with service users. This would certainly lead to a much-needed improvement in the service as well as possible cost savings. Both sides of the House would agree and acknowledge that elements of the HSE require reform and overhaul, which is being undertaken. I have advocated during my time for further and meaningful engagement with service users across the whole health sector. We are now specifically looking at this with the mental health and disability service users. It is important to actively engage with personal assistance service users in order to make the service a person-lead service.

As much as I would like to think the public takes a great interest in the debates in the Seanad, we have the databases of the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Centres for Independent Living to thank for the e-mails we have received and the interest in the debate, for which we are all grateful. The Fianna Fáil group will be supporting the motion so as not to detract in any way from the shared commitment of everybody in the House to make the current situation better. Some of the choices made during the period of austerity in the past number of years were unnecessary and continue to make it very difficult for people with disabilities. We on this side of the House had to consider whether we would support the motion. I found it unusual that the Government that had introduced such cuts was now tabling it. The analogy I use is that it is like Phillip Morris championing a campaign to give up cigarettes. Taken in isolation, we all have had to endure the cuts in the health service, such as the increase in the prescription charges, and the reduction in services. This has bitten into society in a very severe way for all able and disabled people but the impact has been greater on the 19% of the population with disabilities. Neither this nor previous Governments have covered themselves in glory when it has come to the prioritisation of funding and the tendency is to reach for the low hanging fruit, which all too often falls within the responsibility of the Minister of State, such as mental health funding, the provisions for the disabled and so on.  We are in agreement on the need for a statutory based personal assistance service, more employment and the various other well made points in the wording of the motion but the reality is that talk is cheap and actions speak louder than words. Choices had to be made and the Labour Party lost out to the Fine Gael Party on the argument to add a percentage or two to the taxes on people who were better heeled and earning an income of over €150,000 per annum who could have given more. This would not be a panacea for all the cuts that were necessary but it could have prevented some of the cuts that had to be made in services to the most challenged sector of society. We failed to do that and I feel we must look back in shame at not having made the choices that would have been less popular with other sections of society, but in terms of our responsibility to people with disability would have been the correct thing to do. Perhaps the Minister of State would have liked to have done this but the reality of the choices made were not conducive to what was necessary to help people with disabilities.  It is unusual to see a Government come forward with a motion such as this when it holds the reins. There is a draft HSE policy on disability, accessibility and the use of supports which includes support persons, personal assistants, assistive animals and assistive technology. The document reference number is 20.3.2013 which refers to the date of 20 March 2013 and is listed as "revision 6, pending approval." The document was not released to me because it is a confidential document but it does exist. Shockingly, anecdotal evidence suggests that in February this year the newly appointed head of disability services, Ms Marion Meaney, was unaware of the document. One wonders whether Mr. Pat Healy, the director in this area, is aware of the document. Then again why should I wonder when nothing was done with the document since March 2013? That is hardly the kind of commitment from a party which proposes to put the issue of personal assistance on a statutory basis. It is a sad indictment of the abject failure of the Government's approach to this area when a document, pending approval, has not been visited since March 2013. I have no doubt that the Minister of State can investigate the issue. I have a photograph of the front of the policy document that I am glad to share with her after the debate because it is too small to show her now and cannot be seen from across the room. I can assure her that it does exist. It is shocking in the extreme that, on the one hand, that inaction is sought to be promoted yet, on the other, the same party tabled the motion. Cuts have further exacerbated the difficulties experienced by people with disabilities. All Governments share the responsibility for the failures in this regard. Far be it from me to exclusively punish the existing Government but absolve previous Governments. I would never seek to do so and will not. I shall, however, highlight the fact that it is odd to table a motion in the name of the Government parties at this time while at the same time ignore a policy that has been in existence since March 2013, that groups like the Centres for Independent Living, the Disability Federation of Ireland and other stakeholders, having participated in its preparation or signed up to, would like to see implemented. The Government has continued to procrastinate. Today we have a motion that seeks to put the initiative on a statutory footing but it will not even put in practice the same policy that the Minister for State, and the officials operating under her control and auspices, have sat on for the past year.  I thank the people who made the effort to come here today and I had an opportunity to meet one or two of them beforehand. We know the chief executive officer of the Disability Federation of Ireland, Mr. Dolan, from old and ongoing debates. We are grateful for their ongoing assistance.  I urge the Minister of State to dig out the policy document and make sure that Ms Marion Meaney is made aware of it, and the director is now aware of it. Instead of leaving it on a shelf I urge the Minister of State to dust it down, approve it and let us move it forward as quickly as possible. The people who took the time to pass through all of these areas and stairs, and got into the lift on the other side of the building, in order to come all of the way in here, deserve to hear a little more than rhetoric on the motion tabled today. Instead, they want action taken on the policy that they helped and advised the HSE in drawing up. I have a picture of the draft policy document that I am glad to show to anybody after the debate.

I note that the Irish Human Rights Commission, then chaired by a former Leader of the House, Dr. Maurice Manning, with the active participation of Professor Gerard Quinn of NUIG, played a significant role in conjunction with many NGOs in the area in the drafting of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It was the first time a United Nations convention was drafted with the direct involvement of those actually concerned. This happened by conforming to the principle of "nothing about us without us." Ratification of the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities is of major importance for the Government. I hope the last major roadblock - the passing of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 - will not take much longer. It is very complex legislation and such capacity infrastructure is very recent in other jurisdictions. The Minister for Justice and Equality is to be commended for publishing the legislation. It is six years since it was first mooted by the previous Government and eight years since the convention became open to signature. I am hopeful the Government will be in a position to ratify it during its lifetime. A personal assistants service, as outlined in the motion, would be in line with Article 19(b) of the convention and would support living and inclusion in the community. The autonomy and participation of those with disabilities in our communities is vital. We have, for far too long, seen those who were somehow classed as different being shut away. For decades mental hospitals were filled with those who, for one reason or another, were not considered worthy of participation in society. A service, as outlined, would ensure that an individual could exercise choice and control over his or her life and contribute to the community. It is reflective of the relevant human rights principles. The individual is encouraged and facilitated to pursue educational opportunities and meaningful activity or employment that suits his or her age, needs and preferences. They are supported in becoming an active citizen and participating in community based recreational activities. They can also avail of travel opportunities. I note that the Disability Federation of Ireland has said that the personal assistance service has formed, and continues to form, the backbone of community services and supports that enable people to live independently in the community and supports people's choice and control. It allows people to engage more equally with family members, their community and their employers. The disability federation's report on personal assistance is a comprehensive and balanced document that outlined the challenges and changes required for such a service. The personal assistance service and Centres for Independent Living are vitally important. However, I note from various research, that there is no defined understanding as to what constitutes a personally assisted decision or service but there is a need to define it in statute. That is something that should be pursued in order to provide a consistent service to people with a disability. I commend my Labour Party colleagues for tabling the motion which I am delighted to fully support.

I also thank my Labour Party Senators for tabling the motion and giving us an opportunity to debate disability services, particularly Senators Ivana Bacik and Mary Moran. I join in the welcome extended to the delegation from the Centres for Independent Living. I also welcome Mr. John Dolan and Ms Jacqueline Grogan from the Disability Federation of Ireland who are seated in the Visitors Gallery. The Disability Federation of Ireland is a good place for me to start. I advise everybody to read its recent report that was produced in February entitled Access to Life: Personal Assistant Services in Ireland and Independent Living by People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities. The report details the current difficulties faced by those using personal assistant services, their vulnerability to funding cuts, the inappropriate forms of regulation and the failure of policy-makers to implement the Government's stated objective of full inclusion and self-determination. I note that the motion began with the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities which, as Senator Ivana Bacik mentioned, has not been passed yet. In fact, Ireland is one of three countries in the EU that has not ratified the convention and are joined by Finland and the Netherlands. We should hang our heads in shame for not ratifying the convention. Obviously we need to pass the decision-making Bill before ratification takes place. Even if it is passed there are concerns that the Government will be in difficulty when it comes to ensuring the convention is applied.  For me the model of disability used in Ireland is a charitable-based model of disability services. I would advocate that we move to a rights-based approach. The recession has led to delays in the implementation of our current disability strategy. In the case of school leavers with intellectual and multiple disabilities we have found places and bits of places and services. Unfortunately, when the time runs out for such services, which is three years maximum, another race to find bits of provision starts. There is no joined up thinking and co-ordination of supports.Families and those with disabilities do not know who funds what. Many think it is voluntary agencies which raise the funds and, therefore, feel beholden to this charity model that we have developed. Most of these services are 80% to 90% funded by the State and they have seen cuts year after year. Transport to services have been cut, as has respite and funding for social activities. Those who complete third level education report that losing the personal assistants they had to attend college then leaves them stuck at home. They have completed this great achievement, they have gone to college, they have had these supports and they are told, "Well done, you have got your degree. Now you can stay at home." There has been no recruitment into the public service in eight years. Recruitment into the private sector is extremely difficult, with such high unemployment rates generally. The quality of the services which have been developed from the 1990s have really eroded in the past decade. Those using the services are terrified of complaining because they feel they may lose what bits they have, not to mention the situation for many who are on waiting lists. Then, of course, there are the numbers who do not know. We do not have lists of those because they do not know that they are entitled to ask for these services. Provision of personal assistant hours to new service users have slowed considerably. Instead, persons with disabilities are given minimal home help hours or nursing home beds. Home helps cannot leave the home and are present for the minimum amount of time. Often assessments for services are led by nurses and doctors, which means that it has a medical focus. The medical model of disability is one which has us in the state we are in with an institutional focus on the services that are needed. The assessment needs to ensure those with disabilities can have supports to take part in employment, community and family life. The recent documentary on RTE, "Somebody to Love", is an example of the importance of persons with disabilities having opportunities to have relationships and families. Surely, all of that should be within their expectation and reach. Personal assistance hours that persons with disabilities are awarded are for the bare minimum, in terms of personal care and food preparation. That is how the hours are awarded when, in fact, often what persons with disabilities tell me they need the hours for is communication and advocacy. Those with communication disabilities are often forgotten about. They need assistance in managing money, setting up homes, accessing transport, making complaints, being heard and being listened to. It is not all medical. It is not all basic needs. Lack of personal assistance hours has led many to stay in acute hospital settings. We discussed this previously when we discussed the issue of nursing homes in this House. These, for me, are the institutions of the 21st century for persons with disabilities. Looking at the motion, the focus on value for money has been on the costs of services and the salaries of those working rather than on those with a disability who use the services which is where the focus on value for money should be. It should not be looking at waiting lists for services. It should be looking at quality of life. Little has been done on individualised budgeting. The scramble in the past few years has been to find places in day services and training for school leavers. I raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, last month at the Joint Committee on Health and Children. In terms of those in residential settings, there are minimal moves to support some of them into the community. However, persons with a disability living at home with their families who wish to leave home or do not have support of families, or where their parents are getting older and can no longer care for them, face long waiting lists for services and housing. In short, we do not support adults with disabilities to plan their lives. The State funds voluntary bodies to provide services for a few. It presupposes that families will support them and there is little individualised planning. There are no rights to services under the Disability Act 2005. We need a co-ordination of supports and assessment of need for all of those with disabilities. We need to promote the personal assistance as a key to support for persons with disabilities in self-determining their lives. Personal assistants are referred to as arms and legs by those with significant disabilities. A personal assistant is one who works on the instruction of the person with the disability and leads to a full life of one's choosing. Independent brokerage is required to help persons choose what is right for them rather than fitting them into services. "Lives" should mean providing persons with disabilities with the supports they need to live those lives. Currently, persons with disabilities feel owned by the services rather than owning the supports that they receive or feel they need. In effect, we must move away from this model of charity to a rights-based approach. That, for me, is not about the cost basis. It is about how we use that cost and how we empower those with disabilities. What has happened with the politics of cuts means we do not sit down and plan the services. We do not ensure that there is individual planning and support for those with disabilities to determine their own lives. The past seven years - I have been going through reports - have seen persons with disabilities who have been silenced because they have to be grateful for the little support they get. They have to fight to keep the little things, and only for what is available. There are few data, which is also a significant problem. We do not have data on the waiting lists for personal assistance services. We certainly do not know the numbers who could use the service. Sometimes those with a disability are not aware of it or they are prevented by those who oppose independent living. I welcome this debate, but we really need to look at how we move forward. It is not only about the health services. As much as I want to live my life in many different ways, we need to ensure we develop a personal assistance service that allows each person individualised planning. That would probably make economic sense too. For me, it is the rights-based approach that is the important way.
#CaitKeane	unknown-#CaitKeane-party	unknown-#CaitKeane-dob	unknown-#CaitKeane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	138	I thank the Labour Party group for tabling the motion. It is an important debate and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for coming and welcome her to the House. I have heard her speak on this issue so often that it is one of her major priorities, although she has many in these trying circumstances. A quote, "Help me to do it by myself," would be most apt today because that is what constitutes independent living. People do not want everything done for them but they want help to do it by themselves. We may take that message from all of the Members who have spoken. We always hear as well that one should give a leg up rather than a hand out. This is demonstrated here today by this magnificent document produced by the Centres for Independent Living, whose representatives, along with those of the Disability Federation of Ireland, I welcome here today. We can see that shining through, not alone in the document itself but in the life stories of persons with disabilities who have benefitted from personal assistance. They say a picture tells 1,000 words, and there are many pictures in this that do so. One, in particular, came to mind, namely, that of the person from County Clare who was assisted by his personal assistant to go back into education and then take up gainful employment. As we will have seen in our own personal lives and in dealing with others, those who are helped, through education or whatever, help themselves and do not become dependent on the State. Sometimes a little makes a considerable difference. The message, if we looked at it that way, is "a little means a lot". One of the previous speakers stated it was not an issue only for one Department. As illustrated, it transcends right across every Department. Most of the Members who spoke mentioned the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the optional protocol, which was adopted in 2006. The Republic of Ireland signed the convention. I will not go into it as Senator Hildegarde Naughton has given the history of it in detail. It is a long time in coming. I note the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, took it to heart with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 that was spoken of by Senator Hildegarde Naughton. He, with the Minister of State, has done significant work on that issue, which I welcome. That statutory framework is definitely an issue. Words are cheap, but when it is written in statute, that gives power and power means enablement. Knowing one's rights is one matter but having rights is another. It is important to ensure that the statutory framework that has been spoken of comes to fore. The philosophy of independent living speaks for itself.Money is one thing. It is a lot and Senator Marc MacSharry spoke a great deal about what the Government is not doing. However, a great deal more also could have been done in the boom times when there was a lot of money around. I would have liked many things to have been done that were not done. However, money is not everything and there is much that can be done. While everybody must cut the cloth according to the size of the budget one has at the moment, if every Department worked together to ensure it had a philosophy, such a philosophy, as well as the money, would do a lot. In the area of education in particular, when one speaks about education and making available facilities, I refer to the philosophy the Minister of State herself is driving, namely, value for money and the policy review to let the person decide the services for himself or herself, rather than dictating to the people what services they need. Such people know best what they need, like the policy of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, of the money following the patient. In this case, they are not patients but are able-bodied and willing for work, albeit with just a little help. Were money to follow the patient and were the person himself or herself to make the decision, that also really would make major inroads into the position under consideration today regarding the assisted decision-making process. I have long pages of notes on this issue but will skip them because much already has been said about its educational aspects. However, one point is that when Members discussed the issue of disability in the Chamber previously, it was noted the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, had requested the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, to establish a working group. I understand it was established to consider a tailored allocation model for education in respect of these sectors of society. I will take the opportunity to welcome the progress being made by the Government to empower people with disabilities, through the Minister of State's own area of responsibility, to make decisions about their own services through the planned introduction of the money-follows-the-client system. It is utterly unacceptable in the 21st century that people have no say in how their budget is managed themselves. They are as well able to decide as is the Minister or am I where and how that money should be spent. I believe it would be spent a lot better, were decisions made by the people themselves rather than decisions being made for them. They should choose the services of which they wish to avail rather than having the State or any such body make that choice for them. The old broken model of providing funding directly for service providers is incredibly restrictive and is a model that does not lead or give choice to the person availing of whatever service, be it a care service or whatever else. I note that funding in respect of the housing model was announced recently by the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan. I understand that €10 million was made available a couple of months ago for housing for people with disabilities, which is welcome, particularly in these stringent economic times. Everybody needs a good house and a good home because unless one has those, one has nothing. In addition, however, a home often can become a prison if people cannot leave it. They need just a little help to avail of services outside, even if it is only for communication with the outside. This leads on to better health, better involvement with the community and everything else that goes with it. Someone mentioned sport earlier and Members have seen what people can do for themselves in this regard, as well as what Eunice Shriver Kennedy did for the Special Olympics. Members will have seen how it means a lot when people are helped a little. I note the Acting Chairman is signalling to me. This is an important debate and I am delighted the Labour Party tabled the motion. I hope further improvements will be seen in the future.

It is important to appreciate that Members are talking about full rights as a citizen, not second-class citizenship in any sense. The real mark of a properly-functioning republic is it should cherish all sections of society equally and none more so than those who are most challenged in life. It probably is one reason I feel somewhat disheartened when people who experience disability must come to the gates of Leinster House - at great discomfort for and inconvenience to themselves - to demand what are their rights as a citizen. They really are coming for these rights, in addition to, as Senator Marc MacSharry pointed out, the promises which have been made not by one single Government but by all Governments during the years. There is no misunderstanding as to what are the issues in this regard because they have been debated repeatedly. There have been many committees and commissions down through the years and exactly what are the rights, requirements and necessities of this particular section of society have all been well documented. When one considers that between 18.5% and 19% of the population experience some level of disability, it is clear this pertains to a sizeable number of people. Much of what Members know would not have come to their notice without the representative organisations that bring to Members' notice the inadequacies, where such exist, the requirements and so on. All Members are aware that if one has experience of disability, one's cost of living is more expensive. This is a fundamental and well-documented issue because one must deal with adaptation, extra assistance and so on. However, the more I studied the Special Olympics down through the years and saw the sheer tenacity of character, dedication and commitment of people in the Special Olympics, the more I realised what they are capable of achieving against all the odds. Therefore, that properly functioning republic I mentioned should take cognisance precisely of the great potential that exists within that section of the population comprising 18.5% to 19% of the total. During the years I have watched representatives, particularly those who are experiencing disability themselves, put forward their cases in radio and television programmes and newspaper interviews. Moreover, a number of Members have direct experience in this regard. One cannot but say Members are aware of their responsibility. Today's debate really is only a blip on the radar because nothing particularly huge will come out of this, except what Members might do. It is important that they might coalesce all the efforts of legislators, because this is the only way in which some things that must be achieved will be achieved. As for budgets, the bottom line should be that we absolutely sustain and maintain the core assistance to which this section of society is entitled. Any erosion of this would be completely against this debate and would be completely against the spirit of international legislation, from which Ireland appears to be backing off a little. This must be the starting point of any budgetary consideration and does not take into account the expansion of the assistance and the subventions that are required. During the years the State has committed itself to having an employment target of 3% within the public sector for people who experience disabilities. In so far as progress has been made in this regard, it is known that those who took up those jobs were completely qualified for them. In my experience, one does not get into the area of differentiating in any way with the service provided.The only reason we set a target of 3%, or any target for that matter, is that we did not deal with equality in respect of the people concerned in the past. That is what we mean by equality and what I meant when I spoke about treating all sections of society equally. I was not asking that we give greater recognition to these people because if they get equal recognition, they will get their rights and that is what we are working towards.  There is a great opportunity in the Seanad when we have debates such as this and can leave the politics, partisanship and personalities to one side to discuss important issues such as this one. I know the Minister of State would be exceptionally well positioned and well focused on looking after those who are most vulnerable in society. One expects she and her officials will convey to the Minister the views they hear during this debate. They will hear that this issue is not a political football by any means. If we set targets we must implement them.  When I look back on where we have come from, we have made huge progress. Most of what is involved is of a tangible nature in being able to deal with the physical difficulties which come our way. Addressing the physical difficulties, certainly in the context of new planning legislation and in remedial works to existing buildings, is being advanced, although not necessarily fast enough. If we do not deal with the physical challenges people face, people who experience disabilities will not be able to take up certain types of employment. Likewise, they will not be able to live a full social life. The bottom line on all of this is social justice. Everything we talk about in terms of responsibility is underpinned by social justice, human rights, the rights of the individual. If we can move forward with that type of linguistic expression, we will get rid of compartmentalising a section of citizens who should not find themselves in that position. They should find that they are centre stage and mainstream, that they are not considered an afterthought or peripheral, and that they are central to every item of legislation, policy and budgetary consideration.  I am glad we are having this debate. I welcome the representatives who are present in the Visitors Gallery because any strategy we implement must be done in partnership with the representatives of that section of society in the same way as we did with the trade union movement during the good years of the Celtic tiger. That is exactly what we did. It is more important that such implementation does not take place in isolation from those who have the most knowledge, the most experience and the broadest understanding of how they can lead a full productive life. When a strategy is well founded and well meaning I do not believe any politician or public representative deliberately sets out on an issue such as this one to cloud over what must be done, but sometimes the implementation document is a bit lean on being inclusive of those who must be included. The strategy exists and if there is a weakness it is in its implementation. I suggest that even if it means pushing out the parameters a little on what normal procedures and protocol might be, there are times when one must be a little more ambitious and radical on issues such as this one. We are all aware of the recessionary constraints and we would only be exploiting a situation if we did not keep that in the back of our minds but there are times, even with the moneys available-----

I personally raised more than £50,000 at the time and was delighted to have done so. Given all that, I have a personal affinity with all these people who unfortunately are confined to a wheelchair. I know Tom Chambers in Mayo and he does a great deal of good work related to disability access to public buildings. Unfortunately, there are still many public buildings that have decided not to do anything to cater for people with disabilities. There are many banks to which access can only be gained by climbing up steps - I know of a few of them. I know Tom Cunningham in Gurteen in County Sligo. Tom is wheelchair bound and he goes to my town to play cards every Tuesday night. He is living independently and does everything a normal person does. I also know the one and only Mary Ganley who works in Roscommon with the disability service and she does an amazing job and deserves a great deal of credit. I have known Mary since I was growing up when we used to go dancing in the Casino in Castlerea and Mary was out on the middle of the floor in her wheelchair jiving. If the Casino was still going, Mary would be still going. It is essential that all of these people's personal assistants, PAs, are protected and that we ensure there is more investment in this area and that there will be no further cutbacks. I know that Mary Ganley goes to work every day. She does an amazing job. Like her and everybody else I know who are living independently, they are intelligent people. They are very clever and witty. They have immense ability. They do not view themselves as having a major disability. They consider themselves to be the same as ourselves, they only difference is that they are in wheelchairs and, fortunately for us, we are not.  I listened to the Senator Jillian van Turnhout's contribution and she covered everything, including all the obstacles that, heretofore, had confronted people with disabilities. I hope we are moving towards dealing with all of those issues in the immediate future and I am optimistic that we will. The notion that we should not look after people in their own homes and should consider putting them into residential institutions is a nonsense, apart from the fact that it definitely will cost much more to do that.  I have concerns that have come to light in recent times regarding all the people who have disabilities, including people in wheelchairs, who we hear have had their medical cards removed by the nonsense that is going on in the PCRS. I have an Adjournment matter on that issue tabled to the Minister after this debate and I will go into it in more detail. Those kinds of situations do not help anybody and it certainly does not help people with disabilities to have the stress of dealing with medical cards, knowing that their card is being removed when they know they should be entitled to it.  All people should be equal and, unfortunately, for too many years some people have been more equal than others in this society. Let us look after the people with disabilities and the people who want to live independently in this society.

I also welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate and welcome the individuals from the Centres for Independent Living who are present in the Visitors Gallery. It is a sign of how far we still need to go that this Chamber can only facilitate a very small number of people who have motorised vehicles or a wheelchair. We still have a long way to go even as a state in supporting people with a disability to live normal and independent lives. I recognise that some positive changes have been brought about by the Government and that measures were brought forward by the previous Government.I support the motion with reservations because on previous occasions when we have discussed supports for people with disabilities, I have been critical of cutbacks in this area. I will restate my criticisms today because it is regrettable that resources have been taken away from people who desperately need them to live independently and enjoy a decent quality of life. My party supports the personal assistance service, PAS, the aim of which is to enable people with disabilities to live full and independent lives. However, if the goal is full participation in society, which Sinn Féin believes is legitimate and achievable, it is incumbent on the Government to ensure the service is adequately resourced. We will vote in favour of the motion but we have concerns about the funding of services for people with disabilities. The PAS aims to provide the assistance required by an individual with a disability to allow him or her to participate as a full and equal member of society. I doubt any Senator or the Minister of State would disagree with that aim but, unfortunately, it is not a reality for the many people who are not in a position to become full and equal members of society simply because we have not put the necessary resources in place. We do not yet have rights-based legislation that would support people with disabilities in this State. We have a long road to travel in this regard. The remit of a personal assistant extends to all areas of life assistance for a person with a disability, including personal, social and employment needs both inside and outside of the home. The philosophy underpinning the service is empowerment and independence. This goes to the heart of why it is important to make the personal assistant system available to all who need it. Independence is a fundamental principle. A fully resourced and functioning PAS should lead to self-empowerment for a person with a disability, enabling him or her to overcome the disadvantages imposed by physical and sensory impairments. People with disabilities who are in receipt of personal assistance do not receive a set number of hours because they act as leaders in directing the personal assistance in ways that can maximise their life opportunities. It is important, therefore, to recognise that the principle of personal empowerment distinguishes the PAS from home help services. Sometimes we fail to make that distinction, however. While home help is an important service, it lacks the empowerment aspect that is at the centre of the PAS. Under the home help service model, professionals decide the individual's needs and the emphasis is on providing basic personal care such as dressing and bathing. No consideration is given to an individual's ability to exercise control or choice over the provision and function of his or her supports. At a fundamental level, the PAS recognises and validates the right of people with disabilities to have autonomy and control over crucial aspects of their lives. The PAS offers an independent lifestyle not only to the person with the disability but also his or her family. Without the PAS, there is a real danger that a person with a disability would be consigned to residential or institutional care. My party fully supports the de-institutionalisation of care and support for people with disabilities. This in area in which we can save money. Advocacy groups representing people with disabilities can point to numerous cases in which individuals were put into institutionalised care even though they would have chosen to live independently at home if the resources had been made available. The key issue arising is the failure of the State to provide a legislative grounding for a properly resourced and user-centred disability policy. We can put in place legislation, pass motions and say all the right things, but unless the resources are in place to back up our commitments, they do not mean anything.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	149	I thank Senators for their contributions. It is always worthwhile to come to the Seanad during Private Members' business because, as Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú rightly noted, it is possible to have a debate that is not party political or about kicking the Minister. There are, of course, times when kicking the Minister is important, but when we are discussing an area in transition, such as disability services, it is important to have an intelligent and worthwhile discussion. Senator Jillian van Turnhout, who has temporarily stepped out of the Chamber, is always a good contributor to debates but, in regard to her comment on people with disabilities being afraid to complain, she must be meeting different people with disabilities from those I am meeting because they have no difficulty complaining to me. I suppose that is because they recognise that I will listen and, if at all possible, respond to their complaints. It is important that people be able to express their views and equally important they are listened to. I take that part of my job very seriously. I thank Labour Party Senators for giving me an opportunity to respond to their motion, to outline the Government's commitment to the provision of effective and responsive public services for people with disabilities and to re­affirm strongly the Government's commitment to the national disability strategy. The Government intends to proceed to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, at the earliest opportunity. Ireland does not become party to any treaty until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by it, including the amendment of domestic law where necessary. An interdepartmental committee on the convention is reviewing the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification. One of the key requirements is the enactment of legislation on capacity. The programme for Government commits us to introducing a Bill in line with the UNCRPD. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and exercise their basic rights in line with the principles of the convention. I think everyone knows at this stage that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, has resigned. I compliment him on the huge support he has offered me in preparing the Bill. This legislation would never have seen the light of day if not for his drive and commitment to human rights and his liberal agenda for people with disabilities.The Bill will go to Committee Stage shortly. While I am conscious that I may run out of time, it is important to note that, as a result of our extensive consultation on this legislation and with the support of the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, the Israeli Government has put on hold its capacity legislation on the basis that it will probably adopt our legislation once completed. This is a compliment to the individuals who are working on this legislation. We could not have a better person than Professor Gerard Quinn, who has already been mentioned, advising us.  People with disabilities can face challenges when participating in many everyday activities. Every sector of society must break down barriers to ensure equal participation. In this regard, the national disability strategy plays a key role. The programme for Government committed us to the publication of a national disability strategy implementation plan. I concur with Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú's point that implementation will be the most important issue. When we entered government, there was no implementation plan in place. An extensive plan is now in place. I compliment the members of the group, not only representatives of service providers but also persons with disabilities and the Centres for Independent Living. While the plan does not include everything we want, it will mark a significant step forward and will be augmented as the country's circumstances improve.  I chair the national disability strategy implementation group, which developed the plan and is also tasked with monitoring its implementation. The plan seeks to ensure available resources are used to best effect to ensure people with disabilities have more choice and control in their lives to help them to achieve their aspirations. Progress is reviewed by the implementation group and thematic meetings deal with specific issues. Such meetings are attended by all relevant bodies to ensure cross-sectoral input and review. Two such thematic meetings have taken place, one focused on Irish Sign Language and a second focused on housing. I am still fascinated and amazed by the fact that I am the Minister in attendance for debates on the Special Olympics. Surely the Minister of State with responsibility for sport should be in attendance for such debates. Surely debates in the House on housing for people with disabilities should be attended by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. 
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	150	I agree.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	151	I accept the point made by Senator Jillian van Turnhout on this matter. Why do we insist on having disability rooted in the area of health? If I manage to change that, it will be a significant achievement. In addition to ongoing implementation of the actions being undertaken under the national disability strategy implementation plan, a key initiative is being progressed with regard to employment. Work has a central role in most people's lives and its benefits are as important for people with disabilities as they are for others in society. We are committed to publishing a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, the aim of which will be to ensure more people with disabilities can access work, services at local level are co-ordinated and there is joined-up access across agency boundaries to deliver more seamless supports. I will probably find the Minister for Social Protection waiting for me outside the door if she hears me state that I fully concur with Mr. Martin Naughten when he asks how we can possibly have a comprehensive employment strategy if we do not allow people with disabilities to be considered unemployed. I know this is a sensitive issue and many people with disabilities do not wish to be included in the unemployment figures but that decision must be a matter of choice. We must give people with disabilities the option of being included in the unemployment statistics.  The development of the comprehensive employment strategy is bringing together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address barriers that impact on the employment of people with disabilities. Significant work has been undertaken and a draft strategy is being reviewed and will be discussed further at the upcoming meeting of the national disability strategy implementation group. Its publication is included in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's An Action Plan for Jobs 2014 and its subsequent implementation will be overseen by the Cabinet committee on Pathways to Work. The Government has protected the provision for special educational spending since coming into office. Some €1.3 billion will be spent in support of children with special educational needs this year. We must stop talking about the €1.4 billion that is spent on disability in the health area because €6.4 billion is being spent on disability across all areas.  There are now a greater number of special needs assistants, SNAs, and resource teachers in schools than at any time previously. The provision has been increased by 390 SNA posts, resulting in 10,965 SNA posts being made available for allocation by the end of 2014. An additional 480 resource teaching posts have been made available for the current school year to meet growing demand from schools for low incidence special educational needs support. This brings to more than 10,700 the number of resource teaching and learning support teachers in mainstream schools, which is more than at any time previously. This year, provision is also made for enhanced capitation payments for special schools or specialist schools, as I describe them, and special classes, specialist transport arrangements and assistive technology support. The Government also encourages and facilitates the participation of young adults, including people with disabilities, in further education and training programmes and provides funding for a range of educational and training programmes that offer guidance, access, transfer and progression opportunities for learners along the national framework for qualifications. These include: the back to education initiative; support for learners attending courses through the provision of payments, allowances, and maintenance grants; the fund for students with disabilities, which supports full-time students with disabilities in further and higher education institutions; SOLAS specialist training providers to people with disabilities, with 2,110 places available annually in specialist training provision; and the disability access route to education scheme, which provides a third level admissions scheme for school leavers. The Government provides funding of more than €1.4 billion to the Health Service Executive's disability services programme and is committed to protecting front-line services for people with disabilities to the greatest possible extent. We all recognise the circumstances in which the country finds itself. In 2014, the Health Service Executive is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources by providing the following specialist disability services: residential services to more than 9,000 people; day services to more than 22,000 people; respite residential support for nearly 6,000 people; and 3.7 million personal assistant-home support hours. Senator Jillian van Turnhout has a particular interest in this area and is always well informed. However, it is wrong to continue to argue that there is no difference between the level of resources provided for school leavers this year and in previous years or to refer to bits and pieces of places. This year, for the first time, we have a plan that is based on evidence. Additional funding of €14 million has been provided to address priority needs within disability services identified by the Minister and advised to the HSE. Some €7 million of this sum has been allocated for additional places for school leavers and rehabilitative training graduates, with a further €3 million allocated for emergency residential placements and €4 million to deliver an increase in services for children with disabilities, including autism, and reduce waiting lists. These services are being provided in the community for children aged from birth to 18 years to ensure children do not have to be accessing any particular service to secure an intervention.  To maintain current service levels while supporting people to achieve their full potential, including living as independently as possible, significant reconfiguration of existing resources will be required. This will be in line with the recommendations in the value for money and policy review of disability services, with new and sustainable models of service being implemented to meet changing needs and increasing demographic pressures. Our focus is to bring about reform that will positively impact on the way in which people with disabilities are supported to live the lives of their choice. In addition, throughout 2014 the Health Information and Quality Authority will continue to register and monitor standards in designated residential centres for people with disabilities. This practice, which has been called for by the disability sector for a number of years, commenced in November 2013. I note the presence in the Visitors Gallery of Mr. John Dolan who has been making this call for some time.  For some people with a disability, a direct funding model may be the best approach in order that individuals with a disability can receive direct payments to manage their own personal assistance service. The Government will support the provision of a personal assistance service within the overall framework of the migration to a person-centred supports model and individualised funding, in the context of the implementation of the value for money review by the HSE and the Department of Health. In response to what Senator Jillian van Turnhout said, the value for money review was never about saving money but about finding out what value we were getting for the money we were spending and ensuring that value was delivered to the person in need of the service. In essence, individualised budgeting gives more choice and control over how moneys allocated to meet an individual's needs are utilised. This might or might not involve the transfer of funds to the individual. The move towards an individualised budgeting framework raises legal and practical issues and will require careful consideration and possibly legislation in due course. Demonstration projects are already under way to examine the practical aspects of introducing this major change and to establish the costs and benefits. An analysis of the projects will commence towards the end of 2014. The balance and emphasis will shift towards these new models once sufficient analysis is carried out. The role of a personal assistant is to assist a person with a disability to maximise their independence through supporting them to live and to access community facilities. The PA works on a one-to-one basis, in the home or in the community. A vital element is the full involvement of the individual. We acknowledge the role of PA services in supporting the person with a disability to realise the entitlements set out in Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The HSE provides a range of assisted living services, including PA services to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives. While the resources for the provision of assisted living services available are substantial, they are finite. Services are determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with prioritisation criteria and the level of resources available. In the normal course of service delivery, reviews are undertaken throughout the year to ensure that if needs change, which may mean increased needs or reduced needs, the service provided will address this change within the overall available resources. I welcome the opportunity provided by this debate to put on the record the Government's position on services for people with disabilities. There is an onus on us all to use the substantial resources committed to disability services across the public sector more efficiently, but also to achieve better outcomes for that funding and to bring about a real and substantial improvement in the lives of people with disabilities. This is a central tenet of the national disability strategy and a high priority for me. As the country's economy and circumstances improve, I am sure we can build on the substantial work already done.

I welcome the motion tabled by the Labour Party Senators. I welcome Mr. Gary Lee from the Centres for Independent Living, Mr. John Dolan from the Disability Federation of Ireland and all of our guests. I strongly support the statements of my fellow Senators, as well as the necessary legislative and administrative requirements to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I wish to focus on the right to a medical card of disabled people with a long-term illness. Our responsibility, apart from Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is, as recommended by the United Nations report on children, that the State's demand to involve the finances of parents or guardians should cease forthwith. I fully agree with having universal health care in the future for all our citizens. We should surely get our house in order and take care of our most vulnerable before we declare that every child aged under six can have free GP care when people I know, who are disabled and very ill, do not have access to free GP care. I refer to a lady in south Dublin, whom I believe the Minister of State knows. She has a lovely little boy who is disabled. This afternoon I spoke to his mother who feels we have completely abandoned him and that he is being treated as a non-person and not a citizen in our country. I feel he is an ambassador for other gravely disabled people who have had that dreaded phone call - I am sure the Minister of State has friends who have had such telephone calls - to say that the medical card will be withdrawn. The person then has to fill many forms and get them completed by the GP. This leads to much more stress and agony. That is what has happened with this child. Two weeks ago the medical card was taken away. Before his medical card was taken and after his family had begged, reapplied and phoned, the HSE advised the entire family, comprising two healthy children, two healthy parents and a gravely disabled sick child, to apply for medical cards. They all had to go to the GP to go back over two years' records and fill in several forms. Two weeks ago they were rejected. This little boy is tube fed and incontinent. He will never walk, talk or kick a football. This little boy will never be employed or educated. However, he has a wonderful smile and is the light of his family's life. He appeared on "The Saturday Night Show" the other night. Every month he needs approximately €1,200 worth of syringes, tube feeding bags and other horrible bits and pieces such as nappies just to keep him going. His parents do not want complete help from the State. They are well able to work, even though they never get any sleep. They are determined to make good lives for themselves and their other children. They are not looking for charity, but they are not millionaires. As the Minister of State knows, nobody can keep up with the needs of a disabled person. When this mother, a very articulate lady, received the telephone call the other day, she burst out crying. She is distraught and is a broken person. She feels like giving up. Her family is saving us a fortune given that they look after this child full-time. A friend of theirs has a child with Prader-Willi syndrome. Last year she received a similar letter. That mother is broken. The child had two spinal injury surgeries in Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin last year and is now at home with no medical card. There are people who are disabled who cannot complain because they do not have the strength. I feel bad standing up here because I do not know how hard it is. The people in the Visitors Gallery are the ones who should be standing here. I apologise to the Senators because I know I have digressed from the motion. This is a really topical issue. I encourage the Minister of State to tell her friend, the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, that we had a great debate here this evening and we need to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but we also need to ratify the medical needs of people with disabilities. While I know I should not speak about individual cases, let this child be an ambassador for other people with disabilities because these are desperate people. The people concerned are much more vulnerable. While I do not want to single out people who need medical cards, these are people who cannot swallow or stand or go to the toilet on their own.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	153	I apologise to the Minister of State. Unfortunately, I could not get out of a prior commitment this afternoon that was ahead of the motion being tabled. I welcome to Seanad Éireann the people from the Centres for Independent Living, whom I met today, and some of the other people who have been key campaigners in the disability area, in particular Mr. John Dolan. When I arrived in my office in Leinster House this morning I received two manifestos, one for the European Parliament elections and one for the local government elections. While I have not yet read them yet, I have no doubt that the content is super. I encourage all Oireachtas Members to take due note of the manifesto from the Disability Federation of Ireland. I commend the Labour Party Senators for tabling this extremely important motion.We are more than three years in government and there is an expectation that things should be moving a little bit quicker than they are. This is not down to our good friend, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who, unfortunately, is dealing with a system that is extremely cumbersome and it takes time to change it. As a matter of fact, if the Minister of State was not at the helm in the Department of Justice and Equality and in the Department of Health, progress would be a lot slower. We need to look at the glass as being half full but it is very easy to look at it as being half empty; it should be full, not empty. In my view, at this stage in government we should have ratified the convention on the rights of people with disabilities, but we have not. All we can do is make sure it happens and I have no doubt that it will happen. At this point it is appropriate to acknowledge the contribution and commitment of former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, in this regard. What seems to have gone missing from the public discourse about the former Minister is the fact that he was an extremely liberal Minister, a Minister who was committed to equal rights for everyone and equal rights for people with disabilities. I have had numerous conversations with him in which he spoke passionately about his belief that we should want to live in a society of zero barriers, where everybody could play to his or her full strengths. That is what we are discussing in this motion. The concept of a personal assistant is to ensure that people can participate in what is a democratic society to their fullest potential. It is to ensure that people can do day-to-day activities such as going on a bus with their peers and attend school and college with their peers and where they can play to their strengths; where having a disability does not affect their ability; and where they can be in a situation where they are not compromised or not at a disadvantage to their peers. Nobody wants any advantages over any other citizen in society. All people with disabilities want is a level playing pitch. When there is a level playing pitch, people can play to their strengths and can reach their potential. When I was in college in UCD back in the 1990s, the whole concept of independent living and the Centres for Independent Living was formulating. It was a fantastic concept. The breaking down of barriers was endless. The opportunity arising from this concept becoming a reality was phenomenal. More than 20 years later it has achieved a lot but it could achieve a lot more if it received the type of engagement, support and recognition that the document sitting on the shelves of the Department of Health and which has been signed up to by all stakeholders, were published and was to become the policy and the standard-bearer. It has the imprimatur of all the various organisations and stakeholders such as the Centres for Independent Living and, crucially, the HSE.  I call for that document to be published and to become the bible of moving forward with the Centres for Independent Living and the personal assistants throughout the country who do a phenomenal job. As Senator Mary Ann O'Brien said, it would cost the country a lot more if the PA structure was not in place. It has so much more potential to create the type of equal society that we all talk about. I refer to what Senator Mary Ann O'Brien said about medical cards. To be honest, the discretionary medical card issue has turned out to be an unmitigated disaster. I do not think any fair-minded person would defend it. It is up to the Government to resolve the issue as a matter of urgency. I echo her suggestion about the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, having a word with the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly. I have already had a word with him on this important issue. Those types of scenarios should not happen and they are indefensible. This motion is to be commended. Seanad Éireann should be holding the Government to account on issues such as this. The Minister of State has given us some comfort by outlining what has happened and what is happening and her own commitment. As she said, it should be the Minister responsible for sports who should talk about sport and the Special Olympics, but it is up to the Government to make it happen and I have every faith that the Minister of State will drive this.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	154	I welcome the Minister of State. I record my appreciation of her firm commitment and sincerity which she continues to bring to an area that is dealing with the most vulnerable of people. My contribution will not be in my own words but in the words of the Disability Federation of Ireland and of those involved at the coalface. Our role should be to act as a voice, as Senator Mary Ann O'Brien very eloquently and very emotionally put it. I immediately thought of Senator Mary Moran when I read the motion. We share a common bond in that both of us are parents of a person with Prader Willi condition. Listening to Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, I thank God that we have the financial capacity to be able to look after our Siobhán who is now 23, who can live at home and who lives, within the confines of her condition, an independent life and she is the apple of our eye. I understand perfectly the point the Senator is making. I have dealings in County Leitrim with the Leitrim Association for People with Disabilities and I commend the work they do and their director, Rosaleen Keilthy, who keeps me fully informed whenever there is a need to lobby the Government and to ensure I give my full support to the motion and to give the Minister of State whatever support is necessary.  I refer to the report of Disability Federation of Ireland. I acknowledge the presence of representatives in the Visitors Gallery who will recognise their own words:The small group who established the personal assistance service for themselves and others in the early 1990s had a clear appreciation of what the service was about, namely, self-empowerment to overcome the disadvantage imposed by physical and sensory impairments. Since then, the empowering concept behind the service has been weakened.Thirty interviews were carried out which came to conclusions in this report. I am reading from some elements of the executive summary of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware. The interviews reveal that many new entrants to the service have less control over their service. It came under stress when the Government took over funding responsibility in the mid-1990s and the administration and training aspects became the responsibility primarily of a voluntary service-provider organisation. Subsequently, the emphasis has shifted to providing for basic personal care needs such as dressing and toileting, with less attention to supports for independent living. With the arrival of austerity, funding for the service has decreased. Not only were more recent entrants likely to have less personal assistance hours to manage, but they also seemed more apprehensive about the future. They worried about the level of their service being sustained, about getting increased hours when their condition worsened or if they wished to leave the parental home. In summary, the research found that the original model of the PA service established by the pioneers has been undermined. Restoring the focus on enabling independent living as well as covering basic care needs would strengthen the service effectiveness for progressing the Government's policy objectives. It would enable service recipients to pursue meaningful lives as they so determine and to continue expanding extending mainstreaming in the footsteps of the pioneers from two decades ago. The report lists extensive recommendations but because of time constraints I have chosen just a number of them. Under the heading of recognition for the PA service, one of the recommendations is that in keeping with Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Department of Justice and Equality should examine the case for establishing the PA service on a statutory basis as one of the supports enabling disabled people to participate as full participants. The wording of the final part of this motion is mirroring the recommendation of Disability Federation of Ireland and it has been addressed by the Minister of State. The report recommends that since the PA service is exceptional in how it facilitates social inclusion, the Government, especially the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, should explore new ways of funding the service. A national disability insurance scheme similar to that introduced in Australia could ensure secure funding. Another possibility is the establishment of a fund for independent living. It also recommends that the HSE urgently needs to engage with leaders and others in the disability sector to clarify what constitutes a PA service and to put the agreed definition into practice because this seems to be a grey area. Pathways to direct payments where a leader can become the employer also needs to be developed, based on learning from international, as well as Irish experience.A rigorous evaluation of the likely impact of any proposed policy changes on Article 19 commitments is essential and must be evidenced in the Government's national disability strategy implementation plan. According to the report, the co-ordination achieved to date under the national disability strategy has been disappointing. Performance by Departments and State agencies needs to markedly improve. Given the rapid pace of change in policy on personal supports and independent living, it would make sense for the Disability Federation of Ireland or another voluntary disability organisation to repeat this review of leader experience in a few years.

She never shirks her responsibilities and always comes to the Seanad to answer questions. Senator Marc MacSharry expressed surprise that a group of Government Senators have tabled this motion. Being a member of a Government party does not mean one will not highlight the difficulties faced by people with disabilities and inadequacies in disability services. We will do our best to ensure the issue of disability is on the front rather than back burner so as to ensure progress is made on the matter. There is nothing wrong with a group of Government Senators highlighting this issue and I am pleased and grateful that all parties have agreed to support the motion. The Minister of State is passionate that people should live independently in the community, especially those with mental health issues. I have worked closely with her on this issue on a number of occasions. She has stood firm in her beliefs, despite fierce opposition to her proposals, because she believes the community is the appropriate place for people with mental health issues to live, albeit with assistance. Psychiatric nurses visit people living independently in their homes and care assistants and psychiatry services are also provided in the home setting. Thank God everything is working out well for them. The Minister of State's position has been vindicated, as I hope and trust those who are living independently in the community will agree.  Some people embrace change, while others reject it or find it difficult to accept. As the Minister of State noted, everything is rooted in health. The Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection spent two hours discussing this issue this morning with the Carers Association of Ireland and representatives of the peer support group, WALK. Given that people with disabilities are not sick, disability should not be treated as a health issue. The joint committee discussed access to education and employment and the issues raised by the Minister of State. A person in a wheelchair is not sick and may have a fantastic mind. My daughter worked with a young man who was paralysed from the neck down as a result of a rugby accident. He worked in a financial institution with the aid of a personal assistant. While his body may have let him down, his mind is good and he has much to offer society and employers. I am pleased he is working with the aid of an assistant, which he needs because he cannot drink water independently or even scratch his nose. We must ensure assistance services remain available.  While there is no centre for independent living in County Kerry - the nearest is in Cork - we have the Kerry Cheshire homes. These facilities are similar to the Centres for Independent Living. Residents live independently in apartments and have access to care and nursing assistance. Early intervention must be provided before people can be enabled to live independently. Last week, I attended a public meeting with the parents of children living in St. Francis's special school in Beaufort. They advised that as a result of service reconfiguration, services at the school had been reduced to 10% of the original provision and they no longer had a service on campus. They are meeting the Minister for Health next Saturday to outline the problems they face. I ask the Minister of State to row in behind them to ensure their services, including speech therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy, are restored.  I had a meeting recently in the Mansion House with a group of people who are living with neurological disease. Someone - perhaps it was Mr. John Doran - stated the issue was similar to fighting a fire as no one knows when or where the next one will break it. The next fire could occur in any of our homes through an accident or sporting injury that results in someone being confined to a wheelchair and requiring a personal assistant. While we have our health, we should fight to ensure services are provided to those who need them.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	156	I thank Labour Party Senators for tabling the motion. This has been a good debate, to which I propose to make a very short contribution. On the issue of people with disabilities returning to work, I recently dealt with a case involving a person who lives in an area of high unemployment - the Minister of State will be familiar with the area - and returned to employment for 20 hours per week. He wanted to work despite being highly restricted in his movement. However, the support provided to him when he did not have a job was subsequently withdrawn. This should not be a black and white issue because people with disabilities need their services. Consultations have taken place with representatives of IBEC, the chambers of commerce and the trade unions. Consultations should also be held with Departments to ensure flexibility is shown to people with disabilities who find employment. They must retain the supports provided previously when they return to work. The individual whose case I raise required physiotherapy three times per week to enable him to work. When his medical card was withdrawn he could not afford physiotherapy and had to give up his job. He was back at square 1, although in fairness to the officials responsible for medical cards, they accepted the strong case I made on his behalf and accommodated him for six months. I hope this period will be extended. Government services must show flexibility on this issue.

In that context, Sinn Féin supports the motion, albeit with reservations, as my colleague, Senator David Cullinane, outlined. Since the foundation of the State in 1922, Ireland has failed to treat differently-abled people with respect and dignity and has not provided the structures and resources they require to live independent and empowering lives. Thus far, the State has also failed to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It has failed abysmally on the issues of living conditions and access to health, education and employment for people with disabilities. Much has been revealed in recent years about the inhumane treatment of disabled people who, through no fault of their own, found themselves in the care of the State or its proxies. It is now generally accepted that the warehousing of disabled people in institutions was inhumane by any standards and a denial of their right to live with autonomy, dignity and respect. The move away from this system and the conscious and deliberate policy shift towards de-institutionalisation is, in the context of that which preceded it, undoubtedly a step in the right direction. However, the national disability strategy whose primary aim was de-institutionalisation is ten years old. As legislators, we are entitled to ask what has changed in the past decade, whether services have improved, if an infrastructural and legislative framework has been put in place to vindicate the rights of differently abled people and whether the State has put in place the funding and resources necessary to ensure disabled people can live empowering and decent lives. Unfortunately, the answer to all these questions is "No".  Obviously, the Government parties will defend their record in government and today's charade is one element of their defence. It is a fact, however, as demonstrated by all the evidence, research and reports, that on all the key indicators, for example, access to employment, education, health and housing, life for disabled people is exceptionally tough. Put another way, access to life chances and the crucial social services that are essential for meaningful and genuine participation in society remains in many respects out of reach for disabled people. Thus, they are more prone to poverty, unemployment, ill-health and neglect. This has been exacerbated by the policies of austerity embraced by the Government. With all due respect to my Labour Party colleagues, it is difficult to support the motion and the policies that underpin it. Lofty aspirations and politically correct discourse do little to improve the lives of disabled people. As those present in the Visitors Gallery know only too well, policies that are not adequately resourced are nothing more than an exercise in optics and political game-playing.Policies that are not adequately resourced are nothing more than an exercise in optics and political game playing. It is now 2014 and it is simply not good enough that an individual's personal assistance hours can be reduced following a service review, in other words when service demands result in one individual's service being cut to address the priority needs of another person with a disability. Sinn Féin is also very concerned by the shift to individual assessment. While this all sounds fine in theory, in practice it is being used to conceal that the Government is cutting important services to disabled people.  When it comes to policy and services for disabled people we need to acknowledge that they and their families know best. We must also follow international best practice. Thus far the State has failed to do both with the result that disabled people are discriminated against and excluded from full participation in society on their terms. Sinn Féin is of the view that the failure to fully vindicate the rights of disabled people rests firmly with the State and this and successive Governments. Disability should not, of itself, predetermine a life that is characterised by a lack of independence, excessive State supervision and dependency. We believe that exclusion, discrimination and poverty are all evidence of the institutional and structural failures of the State. We need to listen to disabled people and take seriously the recommendations they make when it comes to policies that have a huge bearing on how they live their lives. In the final analysis, disability is not the problem. The key issue is the failure of the State to give legislative grounding to a properly resourced and user-centred disability policy, where the buck stops with the State.

One of the problems that has disturbed and distorted the work of the House since we were elected three years ago is that we have to give €85 billion to banks. On today's Order of Business we discussed terms of reference of the banking inquiry and that yet another insurance company is gone. We all want that money to go to anywhere else other than to those banks. What we are discussing today is what we miss out on. We regret as much as anybody that the Exchequer was just emptied in such a terrible way. That makes it difficult to meet the needs that are so well described in the motion and it deprives vital funds from going to address goals we all share. I wish to reassure those in the Visitors Gallery that we did not embrace austerity; we were forced at the peril of bankruptcy to spend that money. We would have much preferred to look after the people who are disabled and who are with us today. It is about self-empowerment and independent living. Some progress is being made. In my examination in TCD tomorrow approximately six students will sit special examinations. They have gone right through the leaving certificate examinations and have come in under special entry categories. Tomorrow is their degree day and they have been an absolute credit. I hope the market will realise that in a smart intelligence-based economy based on computing and call centres relating with the public, the fact that some people do not have physical strength should not be a deterrent. As Senator Marie Moloney has just told us, they are not sick. Participation in the community is supported of course. One of the minor things that occurs to me is that the transport needs of disabled people are being disrupted by people who use their parking spaces. There was even a racket of forging disabled parking permits at one stage. I hope the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, adds extra penalty points to that because it is a heinous thing to do. We support their equal participation through the Special Olympics and sports organisations. The facilities at venues and the games that disabled people can play are all wonderful things. I thank Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh for sharing time with me. We will do whatever we can as the situation improves. When this Minister of State comes in, she knows in Seanad Éireann she will be pushing an open door. I regret that the other things happened because they created the kinds of problems we all wish to see corrected. I thank those who came to our debate today; we are very definitely on their side and we will do whatever we can. It is really difficult; I very much resent this and the people who caused it.

I thank my colleagues, almost all of whom supported the motion. I believe everyone supported the principle and spirit of it. I also welcome the representatives of the Disability Federation of Ireland. I also mention Mr. Michael McCabe, the chair of the Centres for Independent Living, who has been hugely instrumental in putting this together, with his colleagues Gary Lee and Nina Byrne who are present in the Visitors Gallery. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, mentioned the resignation of the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, which occurred as we were speaking. He has been a very enlightened reforming Minister for Justice and Equality in many areas, disability rights being one of those. I thank the Minister of State for giving us such a comprehensive speech and in particular for challenging the rooting of disability issues in Department of Health, which we all recognise as problematic. She spoke very candidly about unemployment and disability. I am very glad that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is developing the employment strategy for persons with disabilities. I am very glad that the Minister of State expressed the Government's support for the provision of personal assistance services, which goes to the heart of the motion. We all take the point, as Senator Sean D. Barrett has said, that it would be done in the context of the current economic climate and also in the context of a broader movement to individualised funding. I thank her for outlining the progress, which is very helpful for all of us and our visitors to hear. In particular she told us that the analysis of the demonstration projects looking at the practical impact of this move to individualised funding will commence this year. I also note her comment that legislation may be required to underpin the move to individualised budgeting and to this new framework. We all look forward to working with her and her officials on that issue. She also said that as the economy improves we can certainly build on the substantial work already done in this area. All of us referred to the themes of empowerment and independent living, and also to autonomy and leadership. We all share the view that we must ensure policies on disability and disability rights take those issues into account and prioritise them. We all see Government support for the provision of personal assistance services as a first step to a more formal recognition of the vindication of the rights of persons with disabilities under Article 19 of the convention. That is the starting point of the motion and that is where it would be appropriate to finish.

Like many other Deputies and Senators, I have grave concern about what is happening with medical cards of late. I had grave concerns when responsibility for issuing medical cards was first centralised in the PCRS. I spent 28 years dealing with medical cards as a community welfare officer. I have never previously experienced such anger over the withdrawal of medical cards and it never happened before the PCRS took over. I know a young lad in my area who cannot walk or talk and cannot eat other than through a tube. He requires care 24 hours a day and seven days a week. He had a medical card for years and it was withdrawn. We spent five months fighting to get the card back for him.There are many other cases of people with, or recovering from, cancer, people with all kinds of disabilities, 90 year olds who have medical cards until 2015, which all of a sudden are being reviewed. One of the problems at issue is in the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, where staff have been stressed out for a long time and cannot cope. For 21 of the past 28 years the guidelines for medical cards increased, not by much, on 31 December. For the past six or seven years there has been no increase. That is a problem. Everybody from the young to the old, the disabled to the deserving, feels intimidated by the review process. Cards validated into the future are being withdrawn or reviewed. People feel that the Health Service Executive, HSE, is trying to find the €37 million for the under-six medical cards by taking it from those who need it most. What is worse are the procedures applied. In every case the PCRS asks for further information. In most cases the information is already submitted but it loses it or cannot find it. When I send in medical card applications I scan everything first and send it off but the PCRS tells me that some information I have e-mailed has not arrived, although it has. This buys time for the PCRS. When I send in the information again the PCRS will not read the application for a further 15 working days. During that time people have no medical cards and the process goes on much longer. I have it on very good authority that the situation in the PCRS is like Bedlam. The powers that be thought it would be a panacea for medical card delivery but it is not. When this was dealt with at local level compassion was shown, there was knowledge of the cases and delivery was expedient. That has all gone in order to take cards away from deserving people. They are deserving not only because of illness but also because many have financial difficulties, which are not taken into account. People have loans that are not assessed for medical card purposes. I do not know if the Minister of State is aware that the HSE has brought in a German company to review the medical cards. One could almost say that Chancellor Angela Merkel is reviewing medical cards in this country because that is how it appears. Due to the moratorium on recruitment this company, Arvato, which has no experience of reviewing medical cards, is here. It shows no compassion whatsoever. If one is over the limit by €1 one is no longer entitled to a medical card. There is no need to consider a third tier medical card. If the work was sent back and dealt with locally, as it was for years, we would not have this problem. The process in the PCRS is a complete and utter failure.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	163	I have every sympathy with the Senator's matter on the Adjournment which I am taking on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White. I thank the Senator for raising the issue. He may be aware that approximately 40% of the population, or almost 2 million people, qualify for a medical card or GP visit card. The scale of the administration of the general medical services, GMS, scheme is very significant. The people in the PCRS are doing a very good job although the scale of the job is significant. Over 700,000 individuals were assessed by the HSE in 2013 and well in excess of 95% of completed applications were processed within the target of 15 working days. The HSE is now completing medical card reviews for approximately 86,000 individuals per month. The HSE operates under the legislative framework of the Health Act 1970, as subsequently amended. In the interest of probity, the HSE is obliged to ensure that a person's eligibility is correctly recorded in line with the eligibility legislation and the national guidelines. The HSE aims to ensure every person who is entitled to a medical card or a GP visit card is given the opportunity to avail of his or her entitlement. The current structured processes in operation in the PCRS concerning medical and GP visit card applications, reviews and appeals must be supported with a range of documentation, as outlined on the application forms. The processing time for incomplete applications is dependent on the furnishing of the required supporting documentation by the applicant. I understand the Senator's point on that issue. Where such supporting documentation is not supplied or is incomplete to enable the assessment of an application in accordance with the national assessment guidelines, the HSE will issue correspondence to the applicant, specifying the additional information required to progress the assessment of their application. It is important to be aware of the protection in place for persons undergoing a review even where delays occur. First, any medical card holder undergoing a review to renew a medical card, who genuinely engages with the HSE, will not have his or her entitlement withdrawn before the review is complete, regardless of the expiry date shown on the medical card. Second, in cases where a decision is made not to grant a medical card, the applicant is informed of the decision and is notified of his or her right to appeal this decision. Contact details for the appeals office are provided to the person. Where a person submits an appeal to a decision not to renew a medical card within 21 days of that decision, he or she also retains the medical card or GP visit card until the appeal is decided. Efforts are also being made to improve the quality of medical card processing through increased co-operation between State agencies. Increased data sharing between the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection and the HSE has the potential to reduce the level of documents and information required from families as their eligibility status is reviewed. The processing of medical card applications and reviews is continuously monitored by the HSE. The Senator may be aware that, each week, the HSE publishes the turnaround time for medical card processing and this data is available on the PCRS website. In view of the assessment processes involved, I am satisfied that every effort is made to assist, support and facilitate persons undergoing review and, particularly, in a timely fashion. I do understand the Senator's point and will convey his thoughts to the relevant Minister.

I have already pointed out the failings in some of its answers. It receives material which is then lost. It would be better to lift the moratorium and recruit staff than to bring in a foreign company to do something about which it knows nothing. In response to the first sentence in the Minister of State's reply, 40% of the population has had medical cards since the 1980s. This did not happen overnight or since the PCRS took over. It was always 40% and on occasion more.  I thank the Minister of State for her response and appreciate her taking this matter.

There are over 250 houses there but it has inadequate telephone lines and broadband, as well as insufficient access to mobile phone reception. There is a letter from eircom, dated 15 April, which indicates the company will not do anything about this issue. There are three old telephone exchanges servicing Courtbrack, with one at Dunoughmore to the west, one at Grenagh to the north and one at Blarney to the east. This area is at the end of the line for each of these exchanges. The problem is that over the past ten years there has been a number of new houses built, and there are over 250 families in the area. One housing estate includes more than 50 houses built in the past four to five years. Nobody has access to any service. The road runs along the River Shournagh and there were a number of serious accidents on a morning when roads were icy but nobody could access emergency services. It took quite a while before somebody could get access to communications, as mobile phones did not work in the area either. I ask that the issue be reviewed. Matehy is not far away and it has been included in the outline broadband roll-out launched in the past few weeks by the Minister but Courtbrack has been excluded.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	168	Having listened to the Senator I wonder if there is something particular about Courtbrack which I should consider. To be honest, the matter has not been brought to my attention before today but as a result of the Senator's remarks, I will examine it. The Senator is already aware that Ireland's telecommunication's market has been liberalised since 1999 and has developed into a well regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. The State is not a service provider in the market and can only intervene in cases of demonstrable market failure. Thanks largely to significant commercial investment, we have witnessed considerable progress in recent years in terms of both coverage levels and improved speeds. However, much of this has been confined to the main urban centres. The Government's national broadband plan, which I published last year, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring high-speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, and this will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment and a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest. Since publication of the plan, fixed-line and wireless telecommunications providers in Ireland have accelerated the roll-out of high-speed services and are now investing €2 billion in services and broadband coverage across Ireland. The extent of coverage and quality of service significantly exceeds the targets to which industry committed at the time the plan was published. On 25 April I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecoms network build-out to rural Ireland with fibre as the foundation for future-proof broadband services as part of the State intervention under the national plan. This commitment is a clear expression of the Government's determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. The fibre build-out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland which cannot access commercial high-speed broadband services. Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. As the Senator knows, I published a preliminary county-by-county list of towns which takes in more than 1,000 locations. I should point out that this list is only indicative and is based on information currently available. It is subject to revision upon completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently under way. Further locations, such as Courtbrack, may be identified as the process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some of the locations will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. From the Senator's comments, that does not seem likely in this case. A comprehensive implementation strategy containing details of all the proposed elements of the State intervention, along with the outcome of the mapping process, will be published for public consultation later this year. It is my intention to ensure that by delivering an end-to-end market intervention with fibre as a core component, all parts of rural Ireland, including Courtbrack, will enjoy opportunities similar to those in urban areas. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21st century.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	169	I thank the Minister. I wrote to the Department some time ago and awaited a response on the roll-out of broadband. I fully accept that the Department and Minister have done much work in the area, which is welcome. This area has seen a number of new estates being built and normally we think about water or sewerage services, although we insert no stipulation regarding the provision of telecommunications services. This is an unusual case, as there is an inadequate phone line and the area cannot access mobile phone coverage. It is a major issue for approximately 250 families, many of which have young people in college. One person working for the ambulance service bought a new house and sometimes he cannot be contacted when he is on-call.He is at a huge disadvantage and he is very concerned about it. I have left a copy of the eircom letter with the Minister. I ask him to ensure that it would be looked at and if at all possible that something would be done to try to bring it in under the remit of the broadband roll-out but also to get Eircom involved. I know it is not physically possible to force eircom to do it but representations will be made. I thank the Minister for his contribution.

It is puzzling that a new community should be left bereft of the services Senator Burke has outlined. All I can say is that we have two very radical initiatives under way which I think will be revolutionary in their impact in the provision of high-quality connectivity to rural Ireland. The first is the legislation that I took through this House some six weeks ago in the matter of enabling the ESB, in conjunction with the leading telecommunications company, to roll out fibre to parts of rural Ireland using its own supply infrastructure. That is a very important initiative and we will make an announcement in a couple of weeks on it. The second initiative is the announcement of last week where the Government has committed €500 million to the direct State intervention to provide such quality connectivity. Unfortunately, we have to go through state aid rules. We have to do a detailed mapping exercise in order to satisfy the Commission that we can make a State intervention of this order. I have the letter from the Senator in respect of Courtbrack and I will be glad to examine it and see what I can do.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	172	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ciarán Cannon, and ask him to pass on my comments and views on the Adjournment matter I raise to the Taoiseach at his convenience. I have raised the need to reconvene the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation arising from my concern not simply at the events of recent days in Northern Ireland but at the drift which has occurred in recent weeks and months which should cause all of us to reflect on the fact that the relative peace which we have had in the northern part of the island since 1994 is not a permanent given and must be worked upon and further developed and bedded down. You were in this House 20 years ago, a Chathaoirligh, in May 1994 when a ceasefire had not been declared. You will recall that in both this House and in the other House statements were required on a monthly and sometimes a weekly basis in response to various atrocities, murder and mayhem on the streets of Northern Ireland. Then in the autumn of 1994 the IRA ceasefire was declared following years of hard work by various politicians from virtually every political party. That helped lead to a process whereby we have enjoyed a relative peace on this island since. One of the developments which played a significant role in building a political process and getting people from different backgrounds into one room was the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. It was at the instigation of the then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation met for the first time in October or November 1994. Over the course of the next two years or so it met on approximately 40 separate occasions. The representatives of virtually every political party in the Republic of Ireland and a significant number of political parties in Northern Ireland came together to discuss problems and solutions and tried to plan for a shared future based on mutual respect, trust and peace. It was a unique forum. As a participant I found the divergence of views interesting. Of note was the respect in which submissions were held and the robust nature of the debate and engagement on some occasions. It all added to a mix which worked in getting people to think about future co-operation on this island. The forum served a significant purpose. Sometimes the phrase “a political talking shop” has negative connotations. One could suggest perhaps that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation was a political talking shop, but I have always thought it was a case of the more talk the better in the context of Northern Ireland politics. At least when people are around the same table no matter what their background or where they are coming from politically or going to, having people speak face to face means progress is at least possible. A huge amount has been achieved but, uniquely, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation did not conclude, it simply adjourned. The then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, was in charge at the time. The official position was that should a future set of circumstances require it, the forum could meet again. I previously suggested it would be an ideal vehicle to tease out and consider the prospect of a truth and reconciliation commission. What we have seen recently in Northern Ireland must be a warning shot that we cannot be sure of permanent peace on the island and that work is required. We must recognise the victims and the atrocities and that much healing is still required. I do not expect a significant statement from the Minister of State, but I would urge him to encourage the Taoiseach to contemplate bringing together again all the political parties who wish to be involved in the process. They all have something to add. One difficulty I have perceived during the past decade is that dialogue is very much Government to Government, in addition to one or two of the political parties in Northern Ireland – depending on whoever is in charge at the time – making the political running. All of those who are interested in the topic have something to say. The forum brought all voices - some politically strong, others weak - to the table and made significant progress. I respectfully suggest that 20 years after the IRA ceasefire and what we all hoped would be the beginning of a new island and a new Ireland – to some extent that has been achieved – we should look back at what worked well. The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation did work very well. It could work equally well in the course of the next few months and years to discuss other matters, not just in terms of the current political situation but in terms of the need for a truth and reconciliation commission, the need to engage with victims, and to ensure a stable political environment on the island. I ask the Minister of State to please pass on my comments to the Taoiseach at his convenience.

He has spoken with a great degree of knowledge and passion on the subject of achieving a lasting peace on the island. The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation was established in 1994 following the first IRA ceasefire, and consisted of membership from across the Houses of the Oireachtas, as well as from political parties in Northern Ireland.It met for the first time in Dublin Castle, chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness. Its terms of reference were, "To consult on and examine ways in which lasting peace, stability and reconciliation can be established by agreement among all the people of Ireland, and on the steps required to remove barriers of distrust, on the basis of promoting respect for the equal rights and validity of both traditions and identities". A draft report entitled, Paths to a Political Settlement, was published in 1996. However, as some Members will recall, the forum was suspended following the Canary Wharf bombing in February 1996. While it reconvened briefly in 1997, the then ongoing multiparty talks, referendum, elections and establishment of the institutions meant that no further meetings of the forum took place until it was reconvened again in November 2002. The context on that occasion was the suspension of the institutions in October that year. The forum met on a handful of further occasions but has not met since February 2003. Several serving Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas were delegates to the forum in 2003, including Senators Paul Bradford and David Norris, as well as Deputies Eamon Ó Cuív and Jan O'Sullivan, and contributed to the important work which it was doing at that time. The political and institutional context has changed significantly since. Since 2007, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly have been operating and delivering power-sharing government for the people of Northern Ireland. Without doubt, there have been significant political challenges over the period since, including in recent weeks and months. As we committed to at the time of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the responsibility and priority of the Government now, working with the British Government, is to support the power-sharing institutions in Belfast as they face the challenges of everyday government and the additional challenges of dealing with the legacy of the Troubles. Taken together with the other institutions established under the Agreement, including the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council, these are the appropriate fora in which to further lasting peace, stability and reconciliation, as the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation had done previously over a number of years. The Good Friday Agreement set out the guiding principles for peace, stability and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, namely, devolution, power-sharing, agreement on sovereignty, human rights, parity of esteem, support for the rule of law and the continued shared responsibility of the two Governments to guarantee these principles. However, we must acknowledge that the full potential of the Agreement has yet to be reached. As is the case in any comprehensive political agreement, full implementation is essential to the integrity and balance of the whole. The Government is also working to consolidate and to continue to implement the outstanding elements of the Good Friday Agreement and its related agreements, including an Irish language Act for Northern Ireland, a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland and a North-South consultative forum. In terms of the North-South consultative forum in particular, many Members will share the view that the establishment of such a forum would stimulate more informed public debate on key societal challenges, North and South. For that reason, the Government will continue to press for its establishment as an essential part of the framework to deliver peace and reconciliation. Most recently at the plenary meeting on 8 November 2013 of the North-South Ministerial Council, the Government expressed support for the re-establishment of the North-South Consultative Forum as a valuable and, as yet, unimplemented provision of the Good Friday Agreement. In terms of the work of the North-South Ministerial Council across government more broadly, we have been working hard and to great effect with the Northern Ireland Executive to advance areas of practical co-operation. We have intensified work since November 2013 focusing on potential new areas of North-South co-operation. Northern Ireland’s First Minister, Peter Robinson, commented recently that North-South relations are better than they have ever been. The Government shares this view. Members of this House and of Dáil Éireann are playing a valuable role in facilitating discussions on the current political situation in Northern Ireland. The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement regularly hears from a wide range of groups in Northern Ireland and undertakes visits there. The establishment of the North-South Interparliamentary Association in July 2012 was a welcome recent development arising from the ongoing implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Under the leadership of the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the association has provided new opportunities for discussions between Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and members of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The association has had exchanges of views with a wide range of experts on EU issues, health matters and economic co-operation. The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly is of much longer standing, having been established in 1990, in the aftermath of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. It is going from strength to strength. At its meeting last month, it considered a report on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement on its 15th anniversary and heard presentations on the workplace of the future. I welcome the opportunity to debate Northern Ireland in Seanad Éireann. While I greatly appreciate the sentiment and concern behind Senator Paul Bradford's suggestion, the Government believes the Good Friday Agreement institutions must be let get on with their work. Members of this House, and of the Dáil, have several different avenues where they can contribute to the promotion of peace and reconciliation on this island and across these islands. The peace and reconciliation thus far achieved on this island has been hard won and will continue to be consolidated by this Government as it continues the work towards the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as the best underpinning and framework for lasting peace, stability and reconciliation.
