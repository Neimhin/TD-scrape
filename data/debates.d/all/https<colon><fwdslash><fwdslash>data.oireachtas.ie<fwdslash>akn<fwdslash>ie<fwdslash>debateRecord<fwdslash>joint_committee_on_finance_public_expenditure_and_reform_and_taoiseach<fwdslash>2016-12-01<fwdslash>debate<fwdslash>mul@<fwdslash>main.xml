          <p eId="para_11">We now move on to our engagement on the banking sector in Ireland with Mr. Gerry Mallon, chief executive officer of Ulster Bank. I welcome Mr. Mallon and his colleagues, Mr. Paul Stanley and Mr. Andrew Blair. I also thank him for the information provided in advance of this meeting in response to questions from the committee which will form the backdrop to this meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> I remind everybody to switch off mobile phones because they interfere with the recording and transmission of the proceedings. I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 172)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I now invite Mr. Mallon to make a brief opening statement.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_3">
          <from> Mr. Gerry Mallon<recordedTime time="2016-12-01T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_13">As this is my first time appearing before an Oireachtas committee, it is an opportune time to introduce myself. As indicated, I am chief executive officer of Ulster Bank Ireland, UBI, a role I commenced on 1 June this year. Before joining Ulster Bank I was CEO of Danske Bank in Northern Ireland, having previously held other senior positions in Danske Bank as well as Bank of Ireland and McKinsey &amp; Company Management Consultants. I am accompanied this morning by Mr. Paul Stanley, chief finance officer, and Mr. Andrew Blair, head of problem debt management, at Ulster Bank Ireland, DAC. We thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> As the committee will be aware, Ulster Bank is a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, and accordingly it is subject to the normal disclosure constraints of a publicly quoted company, although I do not believe this will unduly constrain our responses to the committee this morning. With the agreement of the committee, I will read my opening statement relatively quickly, following which I will respond to any specific issues the committee wants to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The following are themes I would like to convey to the committee. First, Ulster Bank is a strong franchise with an established market position and a loyal customer base. We provide important and much-needed services to Irish customers on a business and personal basis. We also provide competition in the Irish banking market. Second, while the post-crisis recovery continues there are market headwinds to consider, including a low interest rate environment, the impact of Brexit and a challenging regulatory cost environment. Third, we continue to work hard to address our legacy issues. While we have made significant progress, we fully appreciate that there is more to do. Fourth, we are looking with determination and confidence to the future, running the business as efficiently as possible, leveraging the strength of RBS and key market opportunities that exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> I would like now to expand on each of these four points, starting with our strong franchise with an established market position and a loyal customer base. Ulster Bank has been providing banking services in Ireland for the past 180 years. It is unique as the only systemic bank that operates in the Republic of Ireland that is owned by a parent with international reach. RBS has confirmed that Ulster Bank remains an integral part of its plan to build a leading retail and commercial bank, substantially focused in the UK and Ireland. Ulster Bank employs over 3,000 people, it has a network of 110 branches and it serves almost 1.1 million personal and business customers. It has net lending of in excess of €22.6 billion in the Irish economy and it holds circa €17.5 billion in customer deposits. Despite operating in a low interest rate environment, it continues to make good progress in the strengthening of its business.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> The year 2016 to date has been a strong customer focused period for Ulster Bank. We reported an adjusted operating profit of €236 million to end September 2016 and we are demonstrating steady progress through increasing income and reducing our operating costs. Following the announcement by Ulster Bank to pay a €1.5 billion dividend to its parent company, it maintains a strong capital position. Our results reinforce our progress in building a strong and sustainable business as RBS in Ireland. We have a shared ambition across RBS to become the number one bank for customer service, trust and advocacy. By advocacy I mean word of mouth recommendations that generate new business and relationships based not on what we say but on what we do and how we treat our customers. We believe that we are making progress on this ambition. We are growing market share in terms of flow of new business, particularly in the mortgage market, and our customer net promoter scores continue to rise, reflecting the level of service we provide to our customers. We continue to invest in our customers and people and in reinforcing our brand presence.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> While the post-crisis recovery continues there are market headwinds that need to be considered in our outlook. There is no doubt, as indicated as recently at last week by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, data, that the post-crisis recovery continues. However, while the macroeconomic outlook remains favourable it is not as favourable or as certain as it was prior to the UK referendum or US election results. We are also operating in a low interest rate environment which is impacting all banks' deposit margins and our returns on deposit funds remain at historically negative lows. The recent UK vote to leave the EU is also likely to have a negative impact on the Irish economy, in our view, predominantly affecting exports and investment. In addition, we continue to pay increasing Government and regulatory levies which already represent circa 9% of our total cost base and which adversely impacts our cost income ratio by approximately 7%.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">On a more positive note however, the decision of the UK to exit the European Union has strengthened and reinforced the strategic importance of Ulster Bank to RBS. As a bank regulated in Ireland, in a post-Brexit scenario Ulster Bank has a unique position within RBS.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> The third area concerns addressing our legacy issues. As part of our progress to build a sustainable business, there are a number of legacy issues which we continue to manage and which impact on our customers and our recovery. This includes our work, under the direction of the Central Bank of Ireland, to address issues identified in our tracker mortgage portfolio of customers. We are focused on completing this very complex piece of work and ensuring that we do the right thing for our customers, sorting these legacy issues out so that our focus can be on building a strong business and rebuilding the trust of customers, the pride of our people and the support of our stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> In the course of our discussion today, we can touch on any of these issues members want to discuss. However, one area they have already indicated they want to talk to us about is mortgage arrears. From the outset it is important to restate that our objective has been, and remains, to keep customers in their homes. As we have previously indicated to the committee, there is a cost to living in a home. Where customers engage meaningfully with us we can provide, and have in the vast majority of cases provided, a solution to keep them in their home. We have made significant progress addressing and resolving outstanding arrears issues and to date we have supported over 22,000 customers who are experiencing difficulties to stay in their home.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> In terms of loan sales, I remind the committee that Ulster Bank was not part of NAMA and therefore never benefitted from having impaired assets removed from our balance sheet, unlike the other domestic banks in this market. As a result, we have undertaken a number of loan sales as part of our recovery, with the full knowledge of our regulators, both the Central Bank and the European Central Bank, ECB, which have encouraged these processes to address what is a key issue for Irish banks in bringing the volume of non-performing loans in line with acceptable market norms. These types of sales are an essential part of our recovery and enable not just Ulster Bank but all other financial institutions to strengthen our balance sheets, reduce our risk profile and enable us to facilitate lending and growth back into the economy for both personal and commercial customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> We are firmly of the view that the future of Ulster Bank must be built on customer trust and integrity to ensure we are a powerful and competitive presence in this market. Having been in recovery mode, we are now moving into a new phase of our business where we are focused on our customers and transforming our business, unlocking the potential that we know exists, investing in the future and running the bank efficiently. Our clear purpose and ambition is to be the number one bank for customer service, trust and advocacy. Running our business in a responsible, sustainable and efficient way is at the core of that ambition.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> To the end of September 2016, our lending activity increased by 26% year on year, with €970 million of new lending facilities to business customers and a further €810 million in personal lending. Our new mortgage lending is up 49% compared with the third quarter of 2015, with our market share of new mortgage lending increasing by 4% on last year, which is very positive in a competitive market. Our new service-led improvements to customer experience, such as mobile mortgage managers and secure video chat, have increased Ulster Bank's market share to 19% in the third quarter of 2016. Our broad range of fixed and variable rates, which are available to both new and existing customers, are both comprehensive and competitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> We are also gaining market share in agribusiness with a range of propositions and services to support and grow our customer base in this important sector. A total of 34 of our agrispecialists will graduate this week from our unique tailored agriculture programme, designed to provide the best support to our agricustomers. We have been out on the road all of this year talking and listening to business customers and providing support on everything from exporting to new markets, expanding organic SME businesses, the impact of Brexit and innovation in farming. We have also started to offer finance under the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> We are working in an operating environment that is changing fast. International and global events, such as Brexit or various EU or international trade issues, lower-for-longer interest rates, affect the economic environment and, in turn, our customers regardless of the outcomes. We are focused on transforming our organisation to ensure it is fully prepared to meet these challenges in the short and long term. As part of this transformation, we need to factor in the issues of strong competition and innovation from both banks and other non-traditional competitors. Technical innovation, shifting consumer trends, changing demographics and increased regulatory requirements highlight the need to continuously adapt our way of working to ensure a customer-focused sustainable response and strong financial performance. It is clear from the ongoing developments in technology and the customer response that products, services and distribution channels need to be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis to ensure that we meet and are responsive to customer needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> The next era in banking is defined not just by the financial products or services delivered, but by who delivers them, how they reach customers and how they meet their needs. Central to this is the application of rapidly developing technology at both the retail and wholesale levels. These latest developments, led in the main by FinTech startups, pose challenges for market participants and regulators alike, particularly in balancing the potential benefits of innovation with the possible risks of new approaches. It is clear, however, that the evolving banking and payments landscape requires collaboration among financial service providers, regulators, policy makers and FinTech companies to help foster the evolution of this area. Ulster Bank, supported by our international parent RBS, is central to this collaboration.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> In conclusion, I reiterate that our ambition in Ulster Bank is to become the number one bank for customer service in Ireland. We have a strong franchise with an established market position and loyal customer base. While the post-crisis recovery continues, there are market headwinds which need to be considered in our outlook. We continue to work hard to address our legacy issues and while we have made significant progress, we fully appreciate there is more to do. We are looking with both determination and confidence to the future, running the business as efficiently as possible and leveraging the strength of RBS for the key market opportunities that exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> We look forward to continuing our progress in 2017 and beyond. Mr. Andrew Blair, Mr. Paul Stanley and I are happy to take any questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">Mr. Mallon spoke of Brexit and the strategic importance of Ulster Bank within the RBS group. Can he enlighten us on the prospects of Ulster Bank operating in the Twenty-six Counties, on which there have been discussions in the past number of years? Has Brexit strengthened the position of Ulster Bank in the Twenty-six Counties, has it weakened it or has the effect been neutral?</p>

          <from> Mr. Gerry Mallon<recordedTime time="2016-12-01T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_31">There is no question over the long-term commitment of RBS to this bank and to its presence in Ireland. I joined the bank only this year and I would not have joined unless I was fully satisfied that, following conversations I had at every level of the organisation on this subject, it was core to the long-term strategy of RBS. Brexit has increased the strategic value of Ulster Bank within the RBS portfolio but nobody really knows what Brexit is going to look like. The future is very uncertain and there are all sorts of permutations, as well as speculation on what the impact might be. It certainly casts a question over the issue of the passporting of banking capability across borders. RBS has less international presence than it had in the past but it does have customers and services which operate internationally so it needs to think about what its options might be should passporting rights be lost. It has a number of licences in Europe, in Ireland, in Germany and in the Netherlands, and we are a key and very real part of the strategic options that exist.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">Mr. Mallon spoke about last year's request from the Central Bank that the bank carry out a review of how many people were taken off tracker mortgages by the bank, or denied the right to go back onto a tracker mortgage as they would have been entitled to do under their contract. How many such people have been identified within Ulster Bank so far?</p>

          <p eId="para_33">We are very deep into the review of that mortgage book at the moment so I will give a bit of background to the issue. We are trying to identify cases where we failed to honour the contractual entitlements of customers or to live up to the standards we and the regulator would have wanted in terms of full disclosure of transparent information, so that the rate to which given customers were entitled was clear to them. It is in the second area, namely, the need to be unambiguous about information and to avoid the potential for confusion in customer's minds, that we have not lived up to our standards and where we, as a bank, have an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">I have apologised to all the affected customers for this and I reiterate that apology today. This was something that was wrong and we do not want to see this kind of issue. Customer service, trust and customers advocating on our behalf make up the fundamental basis for the development of our bank in the future. We cannot have this kind of issue in the future. It is a very complicated process because we are working through every individual case to understand how customers were communicated with, what their situation was and so on. Approximately 200 people are working on it at the moment and we are continuing to add people to that number. It is important that we get it right and attain the standards we and the regulator would want. The final number of customers has not yet been concluded because we are continuing to work all the way through it but we will be writing to the first cohort, which we believe is substantial, this month. We will be looking to implement immediate steps to rectify the rates on their accounts. We will continue to keep working on that into 2017. It will be into 2017 before we have worked through the entire portfolio and determined what the full extent of it is. I am not in a position to give the Deputy any final number.</p>

Obviously, he does not know it because it has not been completed. That is why I did not ask him for it. I asked him for the numbers identified within his bank to date who have been prevented from going back on a tracker mortgage or who have been taken off a tracker mortgage.

          <p eId="para_40">Of the 2,000 customers we have identified so far, we know for certain that a proportion of them will have lost their homes. I think it is inevitable. I do not know the number who will have lost their homes as a consequence of other events or the fact that they were on the incorrect rate. The reason for their circumstances has yet to be discovered. I think the number is about 14 or 15 out of that 2,000 who would have lost their homes. The question of whether it was a direct result of the tracker rate or something has yet to be determined.</p>

The 2,000 customers were subject to what I would describe as industry theft because that is what it is to me and to the ordinary person on the street. Mr. Mallon's bank wrongly took their money from them and will now be forced to give it back to them in a so-called redress scheme. It is industry language for what is going on here. To how many of the 2,000 customers has the bank written to tell them that the bank was in error in respect of tracker mortgage rates not being provided to them?</p>

          <p eId="para_45">The 2,000 people identified by the bank were not identified yesterday. This has been going on since December 2015 at the latest. Ulster Bank has been identifying where it wrongly took tracker mortgages off individuals since that time and is still making them pay a standard variable rate. While the bank is getting all its ducks in a row so it can make a big announcement and send out a big mail shot next month, for the past number of months, these people have been trying to find the euros and cents to make sure they can put bread on the table. At the same time, members of the bank's board are sitting there knowing that 2,000 customers have been wrongly treated by the bank. When some of these customers have contacted the bank, it has sent them a standard letter, a copy of which I have here, telling them that the review is continuing and has not been completed and the bank will provide them with a further update within 60 days. That letter is being reissued by Ulster Bank every 60 days. It is a disgrace because the bank knows that it has taken the mortgages off some of these people yet it still has not put them back on the proper tracker mortgage rate. How can Mr. Mallon justify that?</p>

          <p eId="para_54">Perhaps I should put this in context. The background to the initial allegations relating to this were made by Dr. Laurence Tomlinson in the UK. Those allegations were that the bank put companies into the global restructuring group in some artificial distressed manner. Those allegations were independently investigated by Clifford Chance, a firm of solicitors, in the UK and by Mason Hayes &amp; Curran, another firm of solicitors, in Ireland. Those investigations showed no foundation for the argument that those customers were put in on a basis that was not appropriate. Since then, the Financial Conduct Authority has conducted its own investigation. That process is not yet complete and the authority's review has not been published. However, on 8 November, RBS announced that it was taking its own action pending the outcome of that review. The Financial Conduct Authority noted on that date that no evidence was found in the review that is ongoing that the bank had artificially engineered a position to cause customers to transfer to a global restructuring group, that any customers exhibiting signs of difficulty that went into a global restructuring group were exhibiting clear signs of difficulty and that there was no widespread practice of transferring companies for inappropriate reasons. There was no evidence that any assets acquired by the bank subsequent to that transfer were premeditated. On the other side, the authority also noted that communication with customers during that transfer process could have been better, that there was a focus on pricing increases for risk at the expense of due consideration of long-term viability and that the decisions made relating to customers were not well documented or explained. The final point made was that complaints were not well identified and handled by the bank. As a result of that, RBS in the UK announced a new complaints process with independent oversight from a former UK High Court judge and an automatic refund of what I would describe as complex fees, which is the expression used.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> In respect of Ulster Bank Ireland DAC, clearly, the review by the Financial Conduct Authority only covers the UK. The Mason Hayes &amp; Curran review, which was conducted on the original allocations, found no basis for those allegations and Ulster Bank has agreed. The bank will seek to provide exactly the same treatment to any similarly affected customers who are identified and that process has started and is ongoing. It will not be a very swift process but I do not think it will take an inordinate length of time to do. We have kept our regulator informed of where we are in that process. As soon as we have identified affected customers, we will be in contact with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> I will make two further comments on this regarding the nature of Ulster Bank customers. It is fair to say that customers that transferred to the global restructuring group to a greater extent in the Republic of Ireland were those with commercial real estate exposure versus more SME-orientated businesses in the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">The incidence of the payment of so-called complex fees is expected to have been relatively low, for no reason other than that most customers just were not in a position to meet ongoing commitments, never mind fees over and above those.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> With regard to the question on the transfer out of the global restructuring group, relatively few of the customers transferred out of the group back into Ulster Bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">I appreciate the background. Obviously, the Chairman has allowed Mr. Blair time to put all that on record. Let me return to my original question again. There were 2,141 businesses involved. They had debts in excess of €1 million up to €25 million. We are talking about the local publican or corner shop owner in Mayo or Donegal, for example. We are talking about some household businesses with whose names we would all be familiar. They transferred into the global restructuring group but Mr. Blair said relatively few were transferred back. Would I be correct in saying six came out of the process?</p>

Is there truth in the allegation made, which is that the group was a vehicle that allowed Ulster Bank to appoint receivers and liquidators for businesses with equity in respect of their assets? Was it not a snatch and grab? The bank strangled businesses. I accept that some would never have survived but the figures are completely out of line with anything we have seen among any of the bank's peers across the Irish banking sector. Does Mr. Blair acknowledge that?</p>

          <p eId="para_66">The primary role of the restructuring group was to try to restore companies to financial health. The people in the business worked extremely hard to try to achieve that. The goal of the bank, be it in respect of companies or personal customers, is always to try to keep businesses viable and keep people in their homes. That is the way we try to conduct our business because it presents the best outcome for the customer and the bank. Therefore, I do not accept that the role of the restructuring group was to distress companies in any way. The Mason Hayes &amp; Curran review that was conducted does not support that allegation.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">The context of this needs to be seen. The vast majority of those customers had commercial real estate exposure. We all know the value of commercial real estate fell by 65%. Residential real estate values fell by up to 55%, depending on where it was in the country. Buy-to-let property values fell by a similar amount. Therefore, the extent of the downturn in this country was extreme. That is acknowledged. The banks all suffered. The community suffered, businesses suffered and the country suffered economically. This was an extreme downturn. The extent to which people recovered from it when they were over-geared was much lower than one might have expected.</p>

Is it 50 less than 100? How many businesses came out of the group? There have been many complaints about the process. Ulster Bank appointed Mason Hayes &amp; Curran to investigate it. The 2,141 businesses would prefer it if there were an independent review of the process. The banks have dealt with them very unfairly. There is a need for clarity in respect of quite a number of issues associated with the group and how businesses were treated. The only way the bank could fulfil its ambition to understand and help the customer would be by having an independent investigation into this matter. As much as the bank wants to recover, in terms of its banking model and role in the economy, so too did the 2,141 businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> Arising from Deputy Pearse Doherty's contribution, I ask that the bank provide the committee with as much detail on the activities of the group as possible, defining the types of businesses that went into it, without naming any. I seek generalities in order that we can have a greater understanding of the matter.</p>

Is it possible for what happened in the UK to happen here in terms of analysing those businesses and seeing which are entitled to compensation? We should go through them systematically and examine them all. I would be interested to know the breakdown of real estate versus non-real estate. Obviously, lots of non-real estate businesses were connected to people who had real estate problems, so they became real estate problems. However, I would be interested to see how many were not related to real estate, how many were a mix of viable businesses caught up in real estate and then pure real estate. Hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation is being paid to people who went through the GRG process, but a similar process has not happened here. Is it possible for that process to happen here?</p>

          <p eId="para_100">Senator Horkan made a very pertinent point earlier concerning SMEs that acquired real estate from which they operated and for which they overpaid and other types of businesses that acquired real estate. When we break down the book by industry code, it is really difficult to see, without examining each individual case, if the problems that existed for them were due to the underlying viability of the business or the fact that they bought property in a rapidly rising market and subsequently suffered from a downturn both in their business and in the property market, which caused them to get into serious difficulties. We can provide some breakdown and I would be happy to do that. I would caution, however, that when one looks behind those statistics one will find businesses that are allegedly a retail business which, for example, because it geared itself to buy its property ended up in serious difficulty.</p>

I accept that there is a grey area between one and the other, but one could set up categories that would make it easier for us to understand what happened to these 2,000 or more businesses. As Deputy Doherty pointed out, it is a 5% success rate by the look of things. I am assuming that the other 2,000 did not survive. I suppose they were sold to vulture funds or something and did not survive.</p>

Can we have a breakdown of that? I accept that Mr. Blair does not know what happened to them after he got rid of them, but how many were not even sold to vulture funds and how many were sold to vulture funds? If he has any knowledge of what happened after they went to vulture funds that would be great, but I am presuming he probably does not know.</p>

          <p eId="para_159">The restructuring group existed long before the financial crisis and it still exists today to look after customers who get into financial difficulties to try to restore them to financial health. That is the primary goal of the organisation. The context is the most extreme downturn in the economic history of the State for the past 70 years. So many customers, who might have been rehabilitated, for want of a better word, back to financial health in different circumstances just could not be rehabilitated back to financial health. The bank was not in a position where it could transfer loans to NAMA. It was not one of the covered banks, so we did not have that opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> In seeking to restore the financial health of the business for the benefit of our customers and staff and build a business for the future, we needed to deal with the issue of the non-performing loans that we had in the organisation. We did that in full view of the public, the regulator, our shareholder. We did it in a fair and reasonable manner in order to rehabilitate the bank's financial strength and put it in a position where we could support growth in this economy in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">Okay. The other members who have spoken have asked for other information. Might I request Mr. Mallon and Mr. Blair to provide an overview and the details requested by the members, including sight of the report by Mason, Hayes &amp; Curran, if published?</p>
          <p eId="para_163">I ask that Ulster Bank provide as much detail as it possibly can on this issue, including on the breakdown of the accounts that were transferred, performing loans versus loans that were in difficulty and so forth. I also ask the witnesses to revert to the joint committee with the specific information requested as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> The joint committee decided earlier to examine in more detail the global restructuring group and the businesses involved, of which there were 2,141. To do this, the committee wants to be properly informed by the banks. We are also seeking information from the Central Bank and other parties involved. </p>
          <p eId="para_165"> I will correct the witnesses on one issue before I proceed. They give the impression that the various businesses concerned contacted Ulster Bank to ask for money to purchase a commercial property and the bank simply gave the money to them. The businesses in question applied for a loan and the banks had a responsibility in that process to apply a stress test to the proposal. Mr. Mallon placed responsibility fairly and squarely on the person who contacted the bank for a loan. However, Ulster Bank gave the loan when it should have tested whether it was worthwhile to do so. The bank has a responsibility in this process, including to the 2,141 customers involved, notwithstanding that it dumped 1,800 of them into vulture funds. It is an incredible performance on the part of the witnesses with respect to the questions asked by members. It is shocking that they do not know off the top of their heads the exact numbers and the general positions regarding these companies. The bank gave the same answer to Deputy Pearse Doherty on the 2,000 tracker cases it is examining. There is an urgency to this for the mortgage holders and the 2,141 businesses involved, behind which there are families and individuals. Mr. Mallon seems to have no care or respect for them, notwithstanding his words of comfort on how he is trying to rebuild the bank. </p>
          <p eId="para_166"> I ask the witnesses to provide the comprehensive information we are seeking as quickly as possible. I understand the Official Report of this meeting will be published within three days. I ask Mr. Mallon to read it and to address every single issue in a comprehensive way in order that the committee can undertake a further review of this matter.

We fully adhere to all the disclosure requirements which we have as a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland. The disclosure requirements for the primary company, as opposed to the subsidiary, are somewhat different and the disclosure requirements for covered banks are slightly different from a bank such as Ulster Bank, which is not among the covered banks. I apologise if the Deputy finds this unhelpful but it is our intention to be as helpful as possible.

He initially stated in response to Deputy Doherty's question that he did not know how many of these mortgage holders lost their homes. He stated he did not have figures on that and subsequently suggested a figure of 14 or 15. Surely he either has the figures or he does not have them. I do not understand that the bank would not know exactly how many tracker mortgages were affected considering it is on the point of sending out letters and will have done an analysis of how many homes were lost.</p>

The number of approximately 2,000 to which I referred is the number that we have arrived at at the moment in terms of the biggest and, we believe, most significant cohorts of the people who were subject to certain conditions and certain communications in a particular way. That was what I meant by not having finally arrived at a figure. It is very much a live situation. It is a complex process of working through each case individually to try to work out what has happened. This number will continue to develop but I hope it will not be a dramatic increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> Second, I was just trying to respond to the question of who we thought may have lost their homes as a consequence of having been put on the wrong tracker rate. We know out of the identified population that we have either 14 or 15 people among the population that we have identified so far who have certainly and very regrettably lost their homes. </p>

          <p eId="para_197">Yes. It is clear that an increase in the house price index and broad house price inflation reduce some of the risk overhang that a bank has. However, I do not think it is in anybody's interests, particularly those of banks, for house price inflation to be anything other than sustainable, measured and validated by what is affordable. The macroprudential restrictions in place are a positive thing for Ireland as they constrain overexuberant house price increases and hotspots in a supply-constrained market, which we have at the moment. It would not be in our short-term interests to see rapid house price growth, even though it might make an impact on the balance sheet of the bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">I will explain a little about the dividend and the RBS stress test. Ulster Bank has made a lot of progress in recent years in resolving its problem debt and it has shrunk the total size of the lending book. We need to hold capital in proportion to the size of the bank and its lending book and, as a consequence, we have surplus capital. Holding this costs money and, ultimately, the cost could be borne by our customers. We are also profitable and the profits add to our capital. We are adding to it at the moment, rather than depleting it, so it makes sense to us and the regulator to return some of it to our parent and allow it to redeploy it in some other way.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">As the capital we hold on our books still counts as RBS's capital overall, it does not matter if it is in Ireland or wherever else. Considering the stress test in the context of the capital repatriation or the payment of the dividend is not necessarily relevant. It will be and it remains a long-term objective that we have a functioning, viable bank, that we produce profits and in the same way that any company that produces profits pays a dividend to its shareholder, we will be in a position where we can continue to do that. We still hold very high capital levels - probably the highest of any Irish bank at the moment. The intention is to continue to work with our customers, to attract more customers, to support them to grow and to earn profit for the longer term.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">I think this activity looks at 2008 and magnifies it into a global recession as well. RBS has been improving and continues to improve its capital position overall. The outcome of this stress test was that it modelled RBS as still being solvent and still performing, albeit below the levels of the systemic reference points that it wants to adhere to and that the board would seek to get to. These stress tests were based on 2015 and RBS has already taken steps to improve its capital position subsequent to that. A revised capital plan has now been accepted by the Bank of England. The approach is very much to continue to work through legacy and resolve legacy problem debt, which we continue to do and have been continuing to do. It also has been to look at building a stronger, more efficient and more effective business, which will make more profits. So there is no change in our strategy; it is consistent with what we have been doing in the past and what we will continue to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">The difficulty is that the work of the team leader is being put on the branch manager and the branch manager is judged by sales, which means there is a direct conflict with his or her role, with risk control compliance on the one hand and generating more sales - probably riskier sales - on the other hand.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">I think it is incumbent on everybody in a leadership role in this organisation and in this industry to have a balanced approach to being able to grow the business and manage risks at the same time, and we require that. We have a balanced approach to assessing performance, involving both risk and growth in the performance of the business. We look at it over the long term, particularly in terms of what people are paid and what subsequently gets clawed back if those risks manifest themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">I think it would be disingenuous of me to give the Senator that assurance. The nature of banking and how customers interact with us is changing over time.

          <p eId="para_242">We continue to review branches based on what customers demand. We measure what customers demand based on the extent to which they use our branches and how they engage with us. If customers come into a branch much less frequently then obviously its viability decreases. We are incredibly cognisant of the need to support customers in every location. That is why, for example, we have our relationship with An Post. There are 1,100 locations where people can make deposits, cash a cheque, withdraw cash with a debit card and can get a balance. It is about trying to find the right level of support in every location. In some locations, a branch may be viable whereas in other locations, we may look at the service RBS has regarding the mobile branches - the mobile vans. In other cases we also look at An Post; we look at our online capability; we look at our mobile capability and so on. There is investment across the spectrum in all sorts of areas. It is very difficult to give clear guarantees over the long-term sustainability of any individual channel when things are changing so much, particularly in how customers are choosing to use mobile technology.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">This is a big issue we will be addressing within our report. I think excluding cohorts of customers particularly in rural areas will form part of it. It seems that Ulster Bank is going along the same lines of other banks in trying to force customer behaviour to maximise profits for the shareholders. That is an observation that we will address in the report.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">I will lighten the load somewhat for Mr. Mallon. I ask Mr. Mallon to give the perspective of Ulster Bank and that of its parent on Brexit from a macroeconomic viewpoint. He spoke about some headwinds coming down the track regarding Brexit. He spoke about Ulster Bank's strategic position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the parent company, which has inoculated it, for want of a better word.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> This committee and the Houses in general are trying to get as many perspectives as possible on the outworkings of Brexit. It would be interesting to get Mr. Mallon's perspective on the significance of Brexit. I do not necessarily expect him to go into the political realm, but there are the permutations of the triggering of Article 50 and the permutations of a hard Brexit. Is Ulster Bank doing any forward planning for a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit with access to the European market?</p>

          <p eId="para_246">It is difficult to be very precise on what the impact will be because of the enormous range of potential scenarios and outcomes. We are concerned about and focused on the short-term impact on Ireland and our customer base. The move in sterling clearly makes life very difficult for exporters, particularly those in the food sector with such a high proportion of food exports going to the UK. Many of our customers have hedges in place. They have planned and bought forward and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">Many hedges will unwind in the first and second quarters of next year. Those kinds of hedges buy time, but only a certain amount of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Our focus has been on working with those who are caught to help them plan and work through the issues that come with it. Can they look at broader hedges, for example structural rather financial hedges, such as buying raw materials, relocating, buying another business elsewhere, or ways of putting through price inflation into the markets in which one is selling? I think the UK is bound to suffer from a degree of price inflation, particularly in food. In some ways UK consumers are already mentally ready for that and they have accepted the fact that their currency has dropped. It is difficult to get through to retailers.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> We are also working with customers to look at how they transition away from a reliance on the UK market. It is a difficult period for many but the levels of sterling that we are operating at are not significantly different from that which existed in the 2009 to 2014 period. It is difficult, it is uncomfortable and it causes some pain but many of our customers are still able to deal with it, albeit with difficulty. Our main focus is looking to support them to be able to do that and help them to think longer term about how they manage. If one were to add tariffs on top of that, it would make the situation extremely difficult. That is one of the other things we are trying to help them on </p>

          <p eId="para_252">I am not privy to the detail of the discussion between RBS, the Treasury and various other areas. However, our chief executive and our chairman are very prominent and are well connected in UK business circles. I know our chairman, in particular has talked privately and publicly about the discussions he has had, particularly on the future of the financial services industry and the passporting rights for banks around Europe with a focus on the City of London and the impact of what a disconnect would be on the broader UK economy. I guess there would be ripple effects for all of us, were the UK economy to be in a difficult position.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> On a more positive side, the Irish economy was in pretty strong growth mode prior to the Brexit vote, so there is a buffer. We may suffer some decline in our growth rate but we start from a relative position of strength. To the extent that a hard Brexit isolates the UK to some extent from the rest of Europe, I think the consequence would be a flow of investment that would have gone to the UK coming to other parts of Europe, including Ireland. The harder the Brexit the more upside Ireland is likely to see in relation to FDI in particular that may otherwise have gone to the UK. I think there is a net loss of confidence. There is greater uncertainty and that causes a deferral of investment or investment not to happen, that reduces economic growth. It is not good for us, it is not good for our economy. The net impact of Brexit or even the decision of the Brexit vote is not beneficial for the Irish economy in the short to medium term. </p>

          <p eId="para_254">In regard to the submission by Ulster Bank Ireland to the Central Bank on the mortgage changes, I want to zone in on one specific issue, that is the loan to income ratio. The standard metric measure being used at present is 3.5 times earnings. I note Mr. Mallon's observations that this is not the most precise tool as an affordability measure and may not be the only metric to use in the longer term. One of the issues that is coming to light in recent times is the phenomenon of people in their mid-30s who would have bought a property in the years 2004 to 2006, which is more than ten years ago, and now find that the apartment, which is in negative equity, is too small to live in and they end up effectively renting out the apartment and renting a house for their family. The mortgage for the apartment is covered by rental income and they are paying rent on a house, which is effectively a quasi mortgage. In many cases they will not qualify for a mortgage and yet on an affordability basis they can qualify. I believe they are caught in a trap of "almost homelessness", they are effectively paying prohibitive rents on their rental home and are in negative equity on their property. They are utterly frustrated. Has this informed Mr. Mallon's thinking? I note he referred to the customers' other commitments, payment of rent while saving to purchase a property. I think this will become more relevant as time goes on.</p>

          <p eId="para_255">I thank the Senator. I wish to make two points, first, I will outline what we do with customers who are in negative equity and I will ask my colleague, Mr. Stanley, to comment on the options for those customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> In respect of our submission on loan to income, what we were trying to say is that the loan to income ratio is a coarse tool and does not take cognisance of an individual's commitments. Two people may have the same loan to income ratio, but one person could have a great many other commitments, debt or a second family to support or whatever. To make a sensible lending decision one would need to sit down with a customer and look at their income and look at their outgoing and decide what is affordable and this is too coarse a metric. It might work at a macroeconomic level across an entire portfolio but on a customer to customer basis, it does not really work.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> I completely appreciate the Senator's perspective in respect of people who find themselves caught in a negative equity trap and we have an approach to dealing with that, which my colleague Mr. Stanley will outline.</p>

What would the bank do in their case? If the apartment is worth €130,000 and they have a mortgage on it of €150,000 and they identify a family home which they would like to buy for €200,000, what would the bank say to them?</p>

          <p eId="para_283">From the point of view of the ordinary person looking at these proceedings and the small and medium enterprise, SME, Ulster Bank has a very strong presence in Limerick, where I am from, and it would be fair to say that Ulster Bank would have been pushing SME lending, particularly among the farming community and among SMEs. It would have had a reasonably good track record and brought some competition to the market for the other large mainstream banks. This was a situation where it is clear there was a bonus scheme in place in terms of these loans being advanced, many of them property-related loans. The bank suddenly came along and sold €14 billion of gross loans, which was approximately 90% of customers, clearly at a significant discount rate. Many of those people have been in contact with us. Many of them advised us that they were performing loans. They are now being pursued vigorously by the vulture funds that took them over. Does Mr. Blair believe Ulster Bank had a fiduciary responsibility as the bank that would have advanced these loans for which staff would have got bonuses? First, does Mr. Blair believe Ulster Bank should have worked out those loans? Second, what measures would Ulster Bank have sought to be put in place by the vulture funds that purchased the loans to ensure that the customers were treated in the same terms under which the original loan agreements were signed? The problem here is that in the real world, these are family businesses. They employ many people. Many of them cannot sleep at night. Mr. Blair speaks about what is best for the bank, but what is best for the bank is best for the customers. Will Mr. Blair outline the thinking around selling these loans, how the bank justified selling them on with discounts and the type of due diligence it would have done in respect of responsibilities to customers in that when they were being sold on, the vulture funds that purchased them would have treated them in the same fashion Ulster Bank was treating them?</p>

          <p eId="para_291">The bottom line is that the way these people are being treated by the vulture funds appears to be in reasonably stark contrast to the way they were being treated by Ulster Bank.

          <p eId="para_292">I will add two further points to that. The first point is that in selling to the people who acquired these loans, all of those loans are now serviced by independent parties who are governed by the Central Bank regulations just as we are governed from a conduct of business perspective by the Central Bank since 2015. The way that they are treated and the way they behave is subject to exactly the same form of regulation to which the banks are subject. The expectation is that that would be carried through in exactly the same manner that we would be expected to carry it through from a regulatory perspective. That is a very strong comfort to us in ensuring that when we pass these loans to somebody else, the requirements they are required to meet are the same as the requirements we are required to meet.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> To go back to my point earlier, the loan agreement is the loan agreement as it stands. If the Senator is talking about behavioural aspects as distinct from contractual aspects-----</p>

We wanted to build a business that was sustainable. We wanted to build a business for our staff and our customers that would be able to grow in the future. That is why we set about trying to reduce the impact on our balance sheet of non-performing loans. In our case, the way for us to achieve that same disposal of assets that was available to others via NAMA was to conduct it ourselves.</p>

I have had representations from people who had perfectly performing businesses that were doing nothing wrong but whose debts were transferred to vulture funds. They are finding it incredibly difficult to deal with those funds. They have never missed a payment and have never failed to perform, but the way they are running their businesses is being scrutinised and hampered. They cannot expand or get planning permission to build extensions to their business premises. They had a perfectly good relationship with Ulster Bank but the entities to which the bank has transferred their debts are very difficult to deal with. I am trying to find out why the bank sold off the debts of perfectly performing businesses. Many of those business owners feel that the vulture funds want to get them out of their businesses, take possession and flip them.</p>

Are there ten or 40 branches being examined with a view to turning them into cashless or machine-only branches? How many branches are not viable in the longer term? Many of us have applications on our phones and we do business in different ways now. There is an element of rural proofing in terms of access to broadband, but it is not that long ago that Ulster Bank had very significant IT issues. Will the witnesses elaborate on the bank's branch network and its IT system's robustness?

          <p eId="para_326">At the time of that serious IT incident I was running a competitor bank and I did my very best to steal as many customers from Ulster Bank as possible. I was ultimately frustrated in that because of the bank's very loyal customer base and the phenomenal performance of the staff, primarily in branches, to help customers. They went above and beyond the call of duty in helping customers. It was primarily the efforts of the staff in the branches, on the front line, that allowed the bank to overcome that crisis. RBS has put a very substantial investment into repairing the IT system and ensuring such a serious incident will not happen again. The technology platform is in a very different position from the one it was in at the time of that incident.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> The branch network is incredibly important to the bank. It is one of the most important channels. Our customers have told us they like talking to people. They like the staff in Ulster Bank. Ulster Bank has managed to differentiate itself from competitors in the market by providing superb customer service at the front line. Having said that, customers are using the branches less and less and they are using them for different things. They are telling us that it is important to interact with our staff when they have an important transaction to carry out, like securing a mortgage or personal loan or when there is some other change in their lives and they need help from the bank. They are using the branches less and less for the more mundane transactions like paying bills or lodging cheques and so forth. The branch network needs to reshape to be able to adjust to the fact that people are doing things in different ways. In the future there will be fewer bank branches in the same way that there are now fewer travel agents and record shops. Consumers have voted with their feet in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> As a consequence of that, I cannot give Senator Horkan a definite number. The way in which the technology has evolved makes it incredibly unpredictable. There has been more change in the past five or six years than in the previous 50 or 60. When I started working in the banking industry, there was a 1970s model of banking still in place. Banks were still closing at 3.30 p.m. and not opening before 10 a.m. It was all very manual and paper based, but that has changed completely in the time I have been working in the industry. I cannot forecast how much more that will change over the course of the next few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> All I can say is that we do two things. The first is that we keep everything under review in order that we ensure we are giving customers what they need. Second, we take extreme cognisance of the position of customers or particular cohorts of customers. We take cognisance of rural customers and the impact of any proposed changes on them. We also take cognisance of elderly or other vulnerable customers and try our very best to ensure that where we cannot keep unsustainable branches open, we at least protect them or mitigate the effects in every possible circumstance.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">We cannot do that in the long term, but we will consider where to protect and mitigate in every circumstance.</p>

Investment funds can package loans and put their interests ahead of the interests of the borrower. They meet the letter of the criteria, but not their spirit. For any company that is over the €3.5 million threshold, its only recourse is to a court of law. It does not have the faster prospect of the Financial Services Ombudsman.

          <from> Mr. Padraig Cribben<recordedTime time="2016-12-01T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_418">I thank the Chairman and the members for the invitation to make the presentation today. The Vintners Federation of Ireland represents publicans in the 25 counties outside of Dublin. We currently have a membership of 4,000. The vast majority of these 4,000 outlets are family owned, family run, small businesses. Pubs must renew their licence each year and the fee payable is based on six different licence bands. The Revenue Commissioners issue figures showing the number of pubs in each band and they are as follows: a total of 53% of pubs with a turnover of under €190,500 per annum are in that licence band. Some 24% of pubs are in the licence band of €190,500 to €380,999. This is 77% of all pubs in the State have a turnover from alcohol of less than €4,000 per week. In the remaining four licence bands of €381,000 to €635,000 there are 10% of pubs, the €635,000 to €952,499 turnover band has 6%, the €952,500 to €1.27 million turnover band has 3% and there is a modest 4% of pubs that turn over more than €1.27 million. These figures show a vast accumulation of very small businesses where the control of every element of cost becomes critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> Over the past decade alcohol sales in pubs have fallen by a third for a myriad of reasons that are not necessary to be recounted here. This reduction in sales has resulted in the above set of statistics. Notwithstanding these figures, pubs are still a major source of employment right across the country with in excess of 50,000 people currently in gainful employment in the sector. Over the past 12 to 18 months we have been increasingly exercised by calls from members in relation to significant increases in insurance. With that in mind we conducted a wide-spread survey of members in September of this year and the findings are quite instructive. A total of 88.3% of our members have seen an increase in insurance in the past two years with 38.5% of members seeing an increase of between 10% and 20% in the last 12 months. Increases of between 20% and 40% were seen by 39.5% of our members in the last 12 months and 12% have seen increases in excess of 40%. More frighteningly, 37% of members have indicated that they have experienced significant problems in insuring their business.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> Like all business owners publicans have many costs to contend with and we asked our members to rank the costs that currently cause them most concern. The top three in order of concern were: business insurance, commercial rates and TV subscriptions. The third concern may surprise people who do not understand what happens in pubs but TV subscriptions can cost up to €1,000 per month. Clearly, business insurance is a cause of major concern within the trade and we have quite a bit of anecdotal evidence of some members experiencing extreme difficulty in getting adequate cover and some of these in situations where there would appear to be no enhanced risk from previous years. Over the past number of years we have seen a number of insurance companies declining to even look at or quote for business in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> We can speculate forever as to the reasons for the current high cost of insurance and until there is more transparency within the sector it will remain mere speculation. We do know, however, that in Ireland the cost of settling claims is significantly higher than in most other European countries. We know that legal costs play a very big part in the total cost of a claim and we know that the collapse of various insurance companies has led to various increases in premium.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> So what needs to be done? While the Vintners Federation of Ireland does not believe that it has the silver bullet solution, we believe addressing the following measures would go a long way towards bringing a level of sense back into the cost of insurance for businesses. Enhanced powers could be given to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, to determine liability on all public liability claims with very limited exceptions. In particular, all detail upon which a claim is based must be produced at the PIAB stage. An appeal from the PIAB stage should be such that it is only on a point of law. There should be no legal fees for either side at PIAB. There should be a review of the Book of Quantum with a view to bringing it into line with European norms. We know there are a significant number of fraudulent claims and there should be enhanced penalties for people found guilty of bringing fraudulent claims. Any alleged incident or accident must be reported to the company where it is alleged to have happened within 30 days of its occurrence. If the current position is allowed to prevail more businesses will close simply because they cannot access insurance or cannot afford it. There is still a window of opportunity to bring meaningful reforms that will allow businesses to survive and to continue to give employment but that window of opportunity is fast closing. Action is urgently required. I thank the Chairman for the opportunity and we are prepared to take any questions members may have.</p>

          <from> Mr. Donall O'Keeffe<recordedTime time="2016-12-01T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_424">I would like to begin by thanking the Chairman and members for the invitation to speak to the committee on the important topic of the cost of business insurance. The Licensed Vintners Association, LVA, is the representative organisation for the publicans of Dublin. We have some 600 members which is over 80% of the pubs in our capital city. Collectively our members sell 30% of the alcohol in the Irish on-trade and employ 12,000 staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> In simple terms there are three elements involved in business insurance; property cover, employer’s liability and public liability. The LVA’s concerns are entirely focused on the issue of public liability covering the premiums and the cost of claims, as we understand that such claims account for 89% of all liability claims in the licensed trade. To provide the committee with some flavour on the nature of public liability claims in our sector our analysis shows that some 71% of these claims are related to slips, trips and falls.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> The LVA surveyed its members in September on their experience of the cost of insurance renewal over the past three years, 2014 to date. The figures are stark. Average premiums paid in 2014 were more than €16,670 per annum, rising to €20,463 per annum in 2015 and rising again to almost €25,000 per annum in 2016. This is an average annual increase of 21% and 22% in the previous two years. These figures disguise the huge range in premiums paid by pubs across Dublin with many of our suburban members paying €20,000 to €25,000 annually, which is a very high figure and increasing by 20% annually. The late bar scene, however, faces enormous insurance bills, with many of these businesses facing annual premiums in the €50,000 to €100,000 range. One of our members reported an insurance premium of €145,000, up from €80,000 two years previously. It is clear that insurance premiums are a very significant cost for the Dublin licensed trade and that premiums are escalating at an unsustainable pace. It is hampering the competitiveness of our industry and is threatening the viability of some pubs. In a shocking case for one of our members a customer was awarded €90,000 for a dislocated thumb as a result of a fall on stairs. The impact of this claim was that the insurance premium doubled to €150,000 per annum, which is not sustainable or viable. The nightclub part of his business had to be closed with the loss of 15 full-time jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> The Dublin licensed trade has a particular concern with claimants having up to two years to lodge a claim. This is completely excessive as it makes it difficult for the business to prepare a defence as staff and/or customer witness statements cannot be obtained at that stage and CCTV footage would no longer be available.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> On the availability of statistics, we understand around 20% of claims are settled by the PIAB and that a further 5% to 10% actually end up in court. This means that 70% to 75% of claims are settled directly between insurers and claimants. There is absolutely no information available on the majority of public liability claim settlements. This is simply unacceptable in a modern economy and a real deterrent for new entrants to the insurance market. The Government needs to conduct an independent economic analysis of the cost drivers of escalating public liability insurance premiums to bring greater transparency to the opaque insurance market and allow both regulators and the public to understand the factors and the extent to which they contribute to higher premiums. It is not possible to regulate for a better functioning insurance market without understanding and quantifying the cost drivers. For example, we note from the PIAB that the trends in the past three years, from 2013 to 2015, show a 6% increase in the number of public liability insurance claims to 8,906, with the average award being very stable at approximately €25,000. These figures do not support the view that higher claim costs are causing the hikes in premiums. Others point to legal costs as being a factor, but there is no such statistical evidence available. Absolute clarity on the cost drivers is, therefore, needed. The Government needs to legislate for the mandatory provision of statistical information on public liability insurance claims, to include the number of injury claims; the nature of these claims; the settlements paid; the legal, medical and other fees identified; and the duration from claim lodgment to settlement. There should be a publicly available national claims register to provide for transparency on awards, costs and claimant details to minimise the risk of repeated claims by individuals. </p>
          <p eId="para_429"> The Government should review the functioning of the PIAB to ensure that at least 75% of public liability insurance claims are settled by it without legal representation and oblige all claimants to notify the business concerned with full details of their claims with 30 days of an incident occurring. It should also review the book of quantum which include all settled claims data, not just PIAB awards, and benchmark awards intentionally to ensure competitiveness from a business perspective. It should also ensure the Judiciary consistently applies the book of quantum guidelines. </p>
          <p eId="para_430"> We welcome the committee's focus on this important issue and are available to answer questions members may have.</p>

          <p eId="para_431">The delegates' recommendations for oversight of the insurance industry run along the same lines as those made in our report on the motor insurance industry, bar one, the recommendation relating to the PIAB and legal costs. Generally, the recommendations are the same, which is welcome. Have the Vintners' Association of Ireland and the Licensed Vintners Association made submissions to the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on what is happening in their trade? They are involved in the retail trade, but the problems in the motor industry are similar.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">Absolutely, that is one of the big bugbears of members and nothing new. Before I became involved in this business, I managed other businesses for 30-odd years and had the same problem for 30 years. One had to extract information from insurers and very often found when one went looking for information on a claim that it had been settled. It is an age-old problem and a major source of concern for our members which do not have an input. Even in cases in which they have what they believe is absolute evidence such as CCTV evidence contradicting some of the claims made, they find that they are settled.</p>

          <p eId="para_438">In the past couple of months we met Insurance Ireland, the three largest insurance companies and some of the largest brokers in Dublin. The insurance companies' perspective is that claims are always considered on a case-by-case basis. They are very concerned that the outcome of a court case is uncertain. Average awards can be extraordinarily high. They take the view, rightly or wrongly, that it is better to settle and have a defined outcome with which they can work rather than going to court. Our concerns are the same as those expressed by Mr. Cribben and the Brokers Federation of Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_439"> Let me make a couple of other points. There are significant costs involved in preparing a defence, including the time of the owner and management, in seeking legal advice, preparing the file, talking to staff and taking witness statements, all of which can be for naught. Usually, when a publican goes to that much trouble, it is because he or she genuinely believes he or she has a defendable case, only to discover, typically within the week of the court hearing after the case has rumbled on for two years, that it has been settled without discussion with him or her and his or her views being taken into account. It is extremely frustrating.</p>

          <p eId="para_440">I thank the delegates for coming. As I used to run a pub in London, I know a little about bars. It is hugely important that the delegates are here and that we hear from them because while we have focused on motor insurance, I have always said there are the same fundamental conditions in other areas of the non-life insurance market. There have been increases in the cost of insurance for business and health cover. It is inevitable that we will consider the pressures business is under and the model being operated. The work we have done on the motor insurance sector should have a positive impact. Claims being settled without reference to the business paying the premium has to stop. Do the delegates think the insurance industry which provides cover for business has the characteristics of a cartel?</p>

          <p eId="para_441">Certainly from a Dublin perspective, only one company is operating in the insurance market for the licensed trade. A lot of business is placed via brokers in London, particularly for those involved in the late night scene, but it is not an industry that is characterised by the high number of players actively involved and competing in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_442">Twelve months ago we felt so strongly that there was so little competition in the Irish market that we engaged with a firm of brokers here to specifically look at almost bespoke policies for the licensed trade using underwriters in London. We have probably since been able through that medium to help in excess of 10% of our members to find alternative insurance providers. I am not so sure that there is a cartel, but what I am sure about is that there is very little appetite within many of the insurance companies operating in Ireland to provide insurance cover for those involved in the trade.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">Today we are focusing on businesses as claimants. Will the two associations tell us about their experiences as claimants? Has there been any change in the attitude of insurers when one makes a claim, for example, for damage caused by fire or flooding? Are there ongoing concerns that insurers are reluctant to pay out and seeking not to pay based on technicalities?</p>

          <from> Mr. Donall O'Keeffe<recordedTime time="2016-12-01T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_444">Thankfully, there has been a low level of exposure to catastrophic claims in Dublin. A small number of very large premises have burnt down. In those scenarios, cases were handled pretty well. In 2011, there was a big issue with flood damage. The experience of our members in that scenario depended very much on which companies they were insured with. Some companies are very thorough, professional and fair while others have sought to exploit what we consider to be loopholes and various clauses in contracts to minimise what they pay out.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> While property insurance can be potentially catastrophic for a business, this is not where our concerns lie. Our concerns are centred on public liability. Public liability claims are overwhelmingly the main types of claims our members face from day to day. The property side and, in fairness, the employer liability side are generally very contained, but the public liability side is where all the pressure is.</p>

          <from> Mr. Padraig Cribben<recordedTime time="2016-12-01T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_446">We do not see major problems in that area. One of the things we have noticed is that a number of insurance companies write into their small print that if one does not notify them as soon as one is aware of any potential incident, they will not cover the claim. Who reads the small print in an insurance policy document? This was a bigger problem with some of the people who were in the business than those who are currently in the business. This matter has to be managed quite carefully. I know of a case from some time ago in which there was an incident that did not seem to be anything more than an incident. It was not reported but it turned into something very big. The pub was not covered. The insurance company refused cover for what turned out to be a six-figure sum. Obviously, this meant it was curtains for the business.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Flood insurance apart, the property insurance side is not necessarily a big problem. Mr. Jerry O'Dea has some anecdotal evidence to give.</p>

          <p eId="para_448">I am Jerry O'Dea and I am here in my capacity as secretary of the Vintners Federation of Ireland. It is not an executive position. I am also a publican in Limerick. To answer the question directly, there is not a major problem with claims being processed or contested, as Mr. O'Keeffe and Mr. Cribben have alluded to; our main issue seems to be public liability. There will always be problems with claims from property but that is not the big issue. I can give many anecdotal stories but they may not be relevant for today. In my case, for example, our business has been in the family for three generations. Up to two years or 16 months ago, we had been with the same major insurance company for 30 to 35 years. When it came to renewing the insurance policy, despite our not having made a claim in the previous 15 years, the company declined to quote for the business. Essentially, everybody was put into the one basket. As Mr. O'Keeffe mentioned, the company was just not interested in taking on any business in the area. This goes back to the public liability problem that exists.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">The Licensed Vintners Association makes a good point that, despite what we might hear, there is actually very little evidence that higher claims costs or increases in legal fees are leading to higher premiums. I am not saying these are not factors but there has been a dramatic increase in premiums. The increase cannot be attributed to them, at least not in the whole. Has the delegation met Insurance Ireland or the Central Bank to question them about their business model or the effect on the decreased dividends from their investments?</p>

          <p eId="para_450">We have not met Insurance Ireland but I suspect that if we were to do so along the lines referred to by the Senator, we would be as wise after the meeting as before it. This is where there is a need for some watchdog with teeth to get behind what is actually driving the costs. That is the only way we can proceed. Unless we know what is driving the costs, we cannot actually decide how to address them. Again, I suspect meetings of the kind proposed with organisations such as ourselves are pretty futile.</p>

          <p eId="para_454">We met Insurance Ireland. It was the first meeting we had when we started to explore the insurance issue in late August or early September. The insurance industry is inclined to point to the legal expenses and the level of the awards as the core problems while the legal people point to the insurance industry, the lack of competition and escalating premiums as the core problems. Everybody is alluding to false and exaggerated claims as issues. Specifically in the context of the insurance industry, there is no doubt that solvency, low interest rates and low market returns are affecting its finances but this element is not core to the business of insurance, as in managing premiums and dealing with claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> Our first request to this committee and the Government is that there be an economic analysis to quantify exactly which factors are driving the premium rises. Is it awards? This does not seem to be the case. Is it the number of awards, as in an escalating claims culture? We do not believe so. Is it the legal costs? We have no clarity on it. Is it exaggerated, false or bumped-up claims? Nobody seems to have information on that or, at least, there is none that we can lay our hands on. The lack of clarity or the opaqueness that is applying in the market is a fundamental problem. Certainly, no insurance company from outside the country will look into a market in which one cannot figure out the dynamics and invest heavily. There is a very big demand regarding solvency capital requirements. The companies will not take a risk in this regard when they cannot understand the dynamics. An economic study, independent of the industry, to quantify the drivers of costs, is the single most urgent step that needs to be taken.</p>

          <p eId="para_457">I fully agree with the focus on the need to empower the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. That is a key demand in the report on motor insurance but it obviously has implications for the delegation. There is a fine line to tread here. For example, when we look at the book of quantum and the delegates' recommendations, we note the desire to bring the book into line with European norms. The book has been updated but it cannot be brought into line with that of any other country as it is simply a record of the claims. Likewise, making a related suggestion on the right of appeal or to legal representation within the PIAB raises many questions for me. In general terms, it would be legally dubious. There may be points to be clarified in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_458">We have a similar situation with the old Employment Appeals Tribunal. We are not suggesting that one cannot have legal representation at the PIAB but that, if one has, it is one's decision and also one's cost. If one goes into the Employment Appeals Tribunal, one does not get costs there. We are certainly not suggesting one cannot have a lawyer, barrister or senior counsel, if one so wishes, but that one must pay the cost, including out of one's award, if one gets one.</p>

          <p eId="para_461"> There was another issue, and it has not been alluded to in much detail. All information pertinent to the claim should be lodged with the PIAB at the time of making the claim. If the matter subsequently goes to court, where the award is not accepted or either side contests it, no further or new information can be introduced at that stage. In fairness to the PIAB, it is very difficult to adjudicate on an award if there are no medical reports and no loss-of-income statements. How does one go about calculating the value of the award in that scenario? There is a lot of opaqueness associated with what is happening in this regard. That is facilitating the involvement of legal advisers. If one were suspicious, one would worry about why that is happening. Surely the information should be lodged at the start of the making of the claim. It must be made available for the court in any event if the case ends up in court.</p>

          <p eId="para_462">I am extremely concerned about the future of pubs, particularly rural pubs, and the part they play in the community in addressing isolation and social exclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Burdens are being put on rural pubs, which have almost been forgotten about, in terms of trying to meet all the overheads. Mr. Cribben cited rates, the cost of which for pubs that do not have a high turnover is deplorable because they are based on the square footage of the premises. I cannot see how pubs in rural Ireland will survive. If we were to do a survey of publicans across rural Ireland, we would find that most of them want to get out of the game. These pubs play a huge role, not just in serving drinks to people. It is the social inclusion aspect that concerns me. That is why the members of this committee should give a commitment to do everything we can to address the rising and unexplained costs across the board, not only in terms of insurance but also other costs such as television licensing and so on. This committee will continue to work with the witnesses and the recommendations in the reports from both organisations are robust and should be implemented immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_465">I welcome the members of the deputations. Four areas were mentioned, namely, the cost of the awards, the number of awards, the legal costs and the false claims. Who do the witnesses believe should correlate that information to determine which of those factors is the reason for the increasing costs or if it a combination of all of them? I know a publican whose insurance cost annually was in the region of €27,000 but in the past 12 months, that figure has increased to €67,000. That is an enormous increase. It is a pub in a commercial town that offers food. It does not have a very late bar but it has had a number of claims. An increase to €67,000 is enormous and that is probably put down to the claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> Have the witnesses examined the new book of quantum published recently to see how it fares in terms of awards made arising from claims in the trade business? Publicans will not be able to justify those costs, which are probably a bigger charge than the rent of the property, rates or both combined. With regard to motor insurance, particularly in terms of the haulage business, the Government decided to reduce road tax for hauliers but following that the insurance companies increased their costs. The insurance companies tune in to these issues and I would be interested to know how we can help with regard to going through those, whether it is the awards, the costs, the legal expenses or whatever, and how all that information can be brought together to put pressure on the insurance companies.</p>

          <p eId="para_467">There are two obvious options. The Regulator is the Central Bank. The Regulator should have the wherewithal to carry out that study and publish the findings but, ultimately, it is a function and responsibility of the Department of Finance. The Minister could mandate that such a study be carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> The key point is that an independent evaluation would bring clarity in terms of the elements driving up the cost of premiums because a series of bodies and sectors are pointing at each other. The insurance companies are blaming the legal eagles and the legal eagles are blaming the insurance companies. Medical costs, false claims and the high level of awards are coming into play but nobody can say how much of the costs is attributable to each element and without that, we are all in the dark. I would assume the Central Bank is the obvious body to do this but also the Department of Finance.</p>

          <p eId="para_469">If there is that lack of clarity, there is probably scope for all the above to be creaming, so to speak, because nobody knows who is creaming. As Mr. O'Keeffe said, the only people who can do it is a regulatory authority, probably the Central Bank but in the absence of the Regulator doing it, there is a political imperative on the Department of Finance to take action.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> The kind of case the Senator cited, which I may not be unfamiliar with in terms of the detail, will close businesses. While that is a relatively extreme case, it is not unique.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> To go back to the point made by Senator Conway-Walsh about the tight margins, 52% or 53% of all pubs in the country have a turnover of less than €190,000. Taking a midway point of approximately €140,000 or €150,000, every increase of €1,000 or €2,000 in cost is a nail in the coffin. In terms of somebody whose insurance premium increases from €6,000 to €8,000, when other things are taken into account that extra €2,000 is a cause for extreme concern, particularly when businesses have such a low turnover. That is a turnover level and when that is brought back to gross profit and one starts looking at the cost base and other costs that have been increasing, a 25% increase on an €8,000 insurance bill will bring that up to €10,000. That €2,000 just may be the €2,000 that is not available.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">I am vice chairman of the Licensed Vintners Association, LVA. We own a family-run pub in suburban Dublin and we have found there is lack of competition when we seek a quote every year. We have had no public liability claims in the past ten years but our insurance is increasing by at least 20% year on year. We deal through a broker. The broker goes to the market. One big player has at least 80% of the Dublin pub market, so there is a lack of competition. One can go through the United Kingdom where sometimes one might be dealing with an agency that deals with lower A rated companies. The basic problem is a lack of competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The only way to drive competition is to provide more clarity in the market. If there is competition, one can see exactly how claims are settled, the volume of claims and what is happening in the market. The Government needs to legislate for the mandatory provision of statistical information regarding public liability. The more information that is gathered, the more chance of outside companies coming in to compete in Dublin and the rest of the country. That is where we are coming from.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">In our survey, 37% were having extreme difficulty accessing insurance. There are two issues facing us. The first is access to insurance and the second is cost.</p>

          <p eId="para_489">I have no direct evidence but I have no doubt that there have. The last thing somebody will tell you is, "I could not get insurance so I am operating without it". That is not something we would advise any vintner to do. I am aware of one or two publicans who had extreme difficulty and it was very much a last minute job for them to get cover.</p>

          <p eId="para_491">Yes, but that is one side of the coin. The other is that the cost is going up for those who can obtain insurance. As I said in response to Senator Burke's question, the additional 20% to 25% increase in premium may tip them over the edge.</p>

          <p eId="para_492">I refer to the two publicans who are operating in a dual capacity. I know Mr. O'Dea from Limerick. What are their priorities to ensure their businesses continue to function and they continue to employ people?</p>

          <from> Mr. Jerry O'Dea<recordedTime time="2016-12-01T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_493">Mr. O'Keeffe and Mr. Cribben both alluded to the issue of public liability and the lack of information. An insurer who may want to come into the market does not know what he is dealing with. I outlined my own story earlier. There was absolutely no reason other than the company wanting to reduce its exposure. It is like every publican is the same basket. Senator Burke mentioned that somebody who had three claims over the past number of years was suddenly faced with a 300% increase in his insurance premium. That might be extreme but, fundamentally, the lack of information as to what is driving the cost is preventing other insurers getting interested in the market.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">There is also a provision whereby somebody can claim up to two years after the incident. Most pubs, including ours, have 30 days CCTV footage at a maximum and then it is gone. If someone comes in and says, "I fell in your place four months ago", we have no evidence and the claim can still proceed, even though we have no CCTV footage. A 30-day rule should be easy enough to implement.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">Addressing the two-year provision seems to be most obvious and easy quick fix. Nobody would get away with coming in 23 months and 30 days after an incident to make a claim in any other business or industry. A week, a fortnight or 30 days would be adequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> The committee did not appreciate the lack of competition. There are technically 24 operators in the motor insurance market but, in reality, there are six. We are being told that in Dublin - I presume it is the same in the rest of the country - that there is a predominant single insurer. The awards, legal costs and the number of fraudulent claims are also issues. An award of €90,000 for a dislocated thumb is an issue but I am not sure it reflects the injury involved. Insurance companies highlight the lack of predictability in claims. Different courts award different amounts for the same or similar injuries.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> I thank both delegations for their written submissions in advance of the meeting. We need the anecdotal instances of pubs without a claim for ten or 15 years being declined by their existing insurer or who are facing massive increases with no transparency and no indication as to why. The PIAB and court figures have not changed. In theory, it is down to the insurance companies making money out of the pubs to cover other losses or many claims being settled for higher amounts than previously either in terms of the volume of claims or the awards. Do the two vintners have other stories or evidence that they would like to share with the committee? The committee should write a letter to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, outlining our concerns about business insurance with particular reference to the vintners, both rural and urban, together with copies of the two submissions and a transcript of the meeting. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> Is there anything further the delegations would like to add for the committee and the Minister of State?</p>

          <p eId="para_503">Many of the stories are anecdotal but there is no smoke without fire. I know of one case where a claim was lodged after 15 months. The vintner had CCTV footage, having filed away disks. The person apparently was not even on the premises at the time of the event. A year and a half later, one is trying to find evidence, eyewitnesses and staff. Our business is transient when it comes to staff. For example, people work part time in pubs while attending college and so on. The two-year provision is a problem for vintners. Somebody can come along two years after the event and say, "I fell". If I do not have CCTV footage or any other evidence, the claim will be settled by the insurance company and I will not know why, how or for how much.</p>

          <p eId="para_510">Soft drinks are included. I would like to make just one other point which sometimes gets lost in all of this. Because of the pressure that guys are under - not just pubs, but all small businesses - if somebody comes into the market with insurance they do not look to see if these guys are triple-A, double-A or A-rated. In the last six weeks we have seen an insurer who came into the market and has been here for some time, which was regulated in Lichtenstein. It has gone belly-up, as they say. There were one or two brokers around the country using this particular underwriter. Whatever premium they have paid they have no cover for that period. There is a downside, therefore, in that unless we tightly regulate who is insuring them in the country, people under pressure will go to, let us call it, the lowest common denominator that will give them insurance. It may turn out, however, to be a false hope.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee. I wish to echo what was said earlier. The pub trade, both urban and rural, is a vital part of all our communities. I value the work that all the witnesses are doing in Dublin and elsewhere across the country. It is a meeting place which provides an opportunity for people to gather together, thus combatting both rural and urban isolation, which is a big issue for many people. People can meet in the pub to celebrate or commiserate. It provides a service without which many communities would be worse off. I wish therefore to thank the witnesses for their contribution to Irish life and society. I thank them for their submissions and contributions today. We will formulate a letter to the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, with the transcript of today's meeting and a copy of both submissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> I also wish to thank members of the committee and on that note we will now adjourn until 6 December 2016 at 2 p.m.</p>
