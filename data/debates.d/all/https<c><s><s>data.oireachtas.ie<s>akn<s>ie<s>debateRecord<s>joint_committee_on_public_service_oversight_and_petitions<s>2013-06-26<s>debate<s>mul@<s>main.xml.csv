Petition No. P00061/12 from Ms Patricia O'Neill calls for a media campaign, similar to the anti-drink driving campaign, to increase public awareness of suicide. As we have already discussed this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, I propose that we convey the transcript of the meeting and the opening statements to Ms O'Neill and thereby close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. Petition No. P00043/12 from Mr. Thomas Kevin Walshe relates to the eligibility criteria for the back to education allowance scheme. As we have had the petitioner before the committee to discuss the issue, I propose that we convey the transcript of the meeting and the opening statements to him and thereby close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. Petition No. P00031/12 from Mr. Pat Clarke concerns An Bord Pleanála's position on planning precedent in local authorities. Do members have any comments?

In fact, several speakers referred to similar cases in their own area. I propose that we go with recommendations Nos. 2 and 3 from the secretariat, namely, to refer the matter to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for his consideration, and seek the comments of An Bord Pleanála and the relevant local authority.

Agreed. Petition No. P00053/12 from Ms Catherine Doran is concerned with the revised eligibility criteria for the contributory State pension. Are there recommendations in regard to this petition?

A discussion on this issue would be a useful exercise.

Agreed. We will arrange that meeting in the autumn session. Petition No. P00054/12 from Mr. Tom Kelly relates to the imposition of the 0.6% pension levy on the pensions of former Tara Mines workers. Do members have any recommendations?

For the purpose of a computation, 17 years multiplied by the average pension of €10,000 amounts to €170,000 when calculating the 0.6% levy. That is a concoction, which is not covered by the legislation. In the interests of equity, therefore, we should write to the Minister asking for the issue to be revisited in order to achieve a fairer outcome.

Agreed. Petition No. P00051/12 from Mr. Michael Callanan sets out concerns in regard to fishing legislation. Do members have a recommendation for this petition?

Agreed. That completes our consideration of public petitions. I thank members for their co-operation. Our next meeting will involve a discussion with representatives of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission regarding both its annual report and its special report to the Minister for Justice and Equality on the failure of the Garda to co-operate with the commission's investigation into the implementation and operation of informant handling procedures.
