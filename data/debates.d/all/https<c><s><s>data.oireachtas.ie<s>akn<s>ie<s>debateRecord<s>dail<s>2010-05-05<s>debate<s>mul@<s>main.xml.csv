#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The enhancement of the public transport system is at the heart of the sustainable travel agenda.  In this context, notwithstanding the very real challenges the Government faces in the current difficult economic climate, it remains committed to providing the infrastructure and services required to deliver a modern, high quality public transport system.  This has been demonstrated by continued Government support for bus services.  The provision of Exchequer subvention to CIE in 2010 is €276 million, of which €76 million will be allocated through the National Transport Authority to Dublin Bus.It is imperative in the current environment that public services are delivered in an efficient and effective manner and reflect the economic, social and demographic changes of recent years.  In response to this challenge, Dublin Bus is currently undertaking the biggest redesign of its network in the history of the company.  The objective of the redesign is to provide current and future bus customers with a service that will be modern, accessible, integrated, easy to understand, punctual and frequent.  The redesign will deliver real and tangible benefits to the vast majority of bus users.  For example, there will be a doubling in routes with a frequency of ten minutes or better and 60% of customers will be carried on high frequency routes — currently this stands at 23%.  Complementary measures supporting the quality of the service to customers will also be introduced during 2010, including the provision of integrated ticketing, real time passenger information and further investment in bus priority measures.The proposals to streamline and improve the frequency of bus services in the Dublin area, improve the quality of service, attract more customers from cars are perfectly aligned with the intent of "Smarter Travel".  This is also fully in accordance with the Government's aim of measuring outputs for taxpayers' money and getting more for less.

Also, there was a decrease of 210 in the number of buses on the road and owned by Dublin Bus in January 2009.  The company has cut back its fleet by more than 200 which means the public are getting a rougher and raw deal.  Perhaps the Minister will state if this is true.  Also, is it not a fact that the Government's concept of smart travel, as enunciated in Government policy, is completely and absolutely riddled with inaccuracies and is resulting in a poor service?  The ultimate fact is that Deputy Dempsey has, as Minister for Transport, failed miserably to insist on a proper public transport system for Dublin.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Deputy is quite incorrect.  I am surprised to hear him state that we have a very poor public transport service.  This is not true.  We may have a somewhat lesser service than we had but we certainly do not have a very poor service.With regard to the number of buses, I made it very clear from the very start of my term as Minister for Transport that I would not measure success by the number of buses but by how effectively and efficiently they were organised.  If I had listened to advice from across the floor of the House in 2007 when I became Minister for Transport I would have purchased another 300 buses at huge cost to the taxpayer — approximately €200,000 apiece — and those buses would not be used now.  We are doing precisely what the Government wants in getting more from less, ensuing that the buses in the fleet we have are properly streamlined and serve the needs of customers.  The Deloitte report emphasised this and the changes being introduced will further emphasise the quality of the service rather than the quantity of buses.  It is possible, with the changes that Deloitte proposed which the Deputy opposite has supported, to provide an even better service with fewer buses, as I outlined in my answer.

There are 210 fewer buses owned by Dublin Bus on the streets of Dublin today and the subsidy has increased by almost 400% in ten years.  Is it not a fact that there is a sweetheart deal between the National Transport Authority and Dublin Bus?  The authority was established last December and has agreed to allow Dublin Bus to close off the market to competition.  Private enterprise cannot compete with Dublin Bus on any new routes that have been opened up or are about to be opened up.  This is a shame and it is a mockery of democracy and of the right of people who own private transport to compete with Dublin Bus to service these routes.  It is an absolute disgrace.

The subsidy has increased substantially over the past ten years because the number of buses, capital expenditure and the service have improved.  Admittedly, in recent years the number of passengers has decreased.With regard to Deputy O'Dowd's final point, he completely misunderstands the role of the National Transport Authority.  It is not possible for it to advertise or put in place any new public service obligation routes without opening it up to competition.  The commercial market has been open for many years.

The group reported to the Minister for Finance in October 2008 and recommended that all used vehicles should be examined prior to registration in Ireland.  Section 61 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 provided that the Revenue Commissioners could appoint a competent authority to carry out pre-registration checks on used imports on their behalf.I understand there is a separate contract between the Revenue Commissioners and the NCT operator on import conformance inspections.  The operation of this contract is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	9	This change and the granting of this contract to Applus+ is a very significant development given that almost 11,400 cars were imported and had to be re-registered here during the first quarter of 2010.  The performance of Applus+ with regard to the NCT test is the key concern of those who import cars — whether for personal use or for resale.  This was the main thrust of my question, which was deleted unfortunately.  The key concern relates to the administration of the NCT.Is the Minister satisfied with the current performance of Applus+ Technologies?  Does he know how many people are waiting for an NCT appointment and what is the average waiting time for an appointment?  Is it still the case, as The Irish Times found last month, that at 34 of the 46 NCT centres it was not possible to receive a date for a test within six weeks and that one could not book a test more than six weeks in advance?  The Minister is presiding over an NCT system that has been a total shambles and grossly unfair to our constituents since Applus+ started to operate it in January.A few weeks ago, the late Gerry Ryan, the much missed broadcaster who died in recent days, received a call on his show from a person who, on seeking to arrange an NCT in Tipperary, was offered a test in the Dublin area several weeks later.  Applus+ is responsible for the collapse of the NCT system yet the Minister does not appear to be remotely concerned.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The Deputy is incorrect that I am not remotely concerned.  I agree that the start of the contract with Applus+ has been difficult, largely due to the success of my efforts to ensure people comply with the national car test.  I was criticised in the House when I introduced a proposal to impose five penalty points on those who do not comply with the NCT.  This proposal resulted in a surge in the number of applications for the test.In addition, the first quarter of the year is generally very busy as most cars are registered in this quarter.  I accept that difficulties have arisen.  Under the contract agreed with the Department, Applus+ must reach specific targets and failure to do so will result in the company being penalised vis-à-vis the payments it receives.  In response to concerns raised by my Department, Applus+ has taken a number of steps to address the problem.  It employed an additional 14 vehicle inspectors and a further 18 inspectors will soon commence employment.  This will bring to 420 the number of vehicle inspectors available to the company, the highest figure ever.  An additional 29 posts are being created in the company’s call centre, 26 administrative staff will shortly commence employment and two new test centres are in operation.While I accept that a problem arose at the beginning of the year, it is being tackled.  In the period up to mid-April, the number of applications on the waiting list peaked at almost 32,000.  By 30 April, the waiting list had fallen to 7,180.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Under the old system, the testing company, which at that time was SGS, informed vehicle owners that the NCT was imminent.  Why did we not keep a system which appeared to work well for most citizens?  Deputy O'Mahony has repeatedly raised the four week rule, under which drivers who are not given a date for a national car test within four weeks are, it seems, entitled to a refund.  Refunds do not appear to be forthcoming, however.  Is the Minister aware of the position in this regard?The Road Safety Authority was reported to be considering serious sanctions against Applus+ on the basis that it was not performing according to its contract.  Has the Minister received a report on this matter?  Does he agree that the RSA should take stringent measures against the company if it does not implement its contract, which runs for nine years and is worth €400 million?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The current system is largely the same as the previous one.  The contractors involved have changed as a result of a tender process which was established following the completion of the previous contract.  SGS provided a reasonably good service, although it was not without its problems and there were complaints from Members about some aspects of it.I am aware of the difficulties.  I visited the RSA recently and I was briefed fully on the new contract, which includes penalty clauses, meaning that the company will lose money as a result of not meeting certain criteria on the notification of tests and so on.  If people are not informed within four weeks, they are entitled to a free test and that is at the expense of Applus+ rather than at the expense of the taxpayer.  There is a very good contract in place and I commend those who put it in there.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Appointments to each State board under the remit of my Department are made in accordance with the relevant legislation.  I believe that strong State companies need strong boards to lead them.  Appointments made by me are done on the basis of the appointees having the necessary skills, competencies and experience to contribute effectively to the work of the board.  I am conscious that there are many skilled and experienced people in society who would welcome the opportunity to contribute their expertise by becoming members of State boards, but who may consider that they have no avenue for expressing this interest.In preparing for the establishment of the National Transport Authority, I took the decision publicly to invite applications from members of the public who wished to be considered for appointment as an ordinary member of the authority.  The application process was straightforward.  Applicants were simply asked to demonstrate their experience of certain areas, such as finance, transport, land use planning and so on, as provided for in the legislation establishing the authority.  I received 68 applications and I appointed four of these to the board of the authority on its establishment on 1 December 2009.   This was a very useful experience and one that I may draw on again.  Future appointments will be considered when the proposals contained in the current programme for Government are finalised.

Given this appointment was made after the Minister's experiment with the National Transport Authority, which we all supported, why did he not advertise the position publicly?  It is important that the principle the Minister rightly supported for that authority should be continued, but he ignored it with his reappointment of the chairman of CIE.  While I am not questioning his capacity to do the job, there are dozens of other people who would love to have a go.  The transport committee would be very happy to invigilate the Minister's nominee, especially in respect of policies, transparency and accountability in the CIE group.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	15	It is true that the Government reappointed Dr. Lynch on my recommendation.  I do not think the Deputy is comparing like with like.  Dr. Lynch is an executive chairman and that is a completely different situation from appointing a member of the board.  I reappointed him on a three monthly rolling basis for 12 months in order to ensure continuity at the company at this critical juncture.  It is not any secret that the finances of CIE are in a very precarious position.  There have been ongoing negotiations on change, including the implementation of the Deloitte report.  Dr. Lynch has a very "hands on" approach to these matters, so I felt it was in the best interests of the company that he continue in his role for up to 12 months.Different issues will have to be discussed.  Dr. Lynch went in there at a particular time for particular reasons.  The company was not in great shape at the time and it had been involved in various controversies.  He was appointed because of his expertise and experience.  He has done well on that but the question now arises as to whether or not there is a necessity to continue with the role of an executive chairperson.  That is something we could discuss at some time in the future.

Fine Gael agrees that the person should be appointed as a chairman rather than as an executive chairman.  However, there are critical issues concerning transparency and accountability within CIE, and particularly concerning the exceptional audits that took pace within the company.  Arising from the Baker Tilly report, there are issues concerning further audits on which CIE is refusing to make a public statement.  That is of great concern to me.One of the key accidents that happened in recent decades was the one at Malahide.  CIE and Irish Rail, however, have lost their corporate memory on the construction of that viaduct.  It is terribly important that the chairperson the Minister appointed should be invigilated on all these issues in his capacity as chairperson. However, the Minister has reappointed him for another year without any accountability or transparency.  It is more of the same and that is what we are concerned about.

As I understand it, Dr. Lynch has been involved at least twice on the Baker Tilly report and, in addition, concerning the Malahide viaduct.

Ultimately, however, the Deputy and I will never agree on this matter, as I am the person responsible.  I am the person who has to answer questions in the House and I am not going to allow a committee to appoint a chairperson, unless the committee is prepared to take full responsibility for all of his actions.

On the basis of a recommendation agreed unanimously by the national authorities of the 38 members of Eurocontrol, ministers agreed to new measures which would allow for the progressive and co-ordinated opening of European airspace with effect from Tuesday, 20 April.  These measures involved the designation of zones based on ash concentration levels.A further Council meeting was held yesterday in Brussels.  Ministers agreed that the implementation of the second phase of the single European sky initiative should be accelerated including, in particular, the establishment of functional airspace blocks, also known as FABs, and the appointment of a network manager.  The Ireland-UK FAB established in 2008, was the first in Europe.  The appointment of a European network manager is expected to take place by the end of 2010, which will greatly improve co-ordination of European airspace.On the question of the financial impact of the crisis, Commissioner Kallas recently gave his preliminary estimate of the financial impact across Europe, which was in the order of €2.5 billion.  Aer Lingus and Ryanair have estimated their losses from the crisis to be €5 million and €6 million respectively per day.During yesterday's discussions, Commissioner Kallas confirmed that member states could give financial aid to the industry.  I have already publicly indicated that Ireland is not in a position to provide financial aid to the industry because of the state of the public finances.The Council acknowledged that the current European rules on passenger rights must to be applied in full so as to guarantee rights of those stranded during the recent crisis, and that more work needed to be done to ensure entirely consistent application of the rules across all member states.

However, as it is now proceeding, this is the last thing the Irish economy needed.  Have the Department of Transport and the Department of Finance collated any figures in terms of the overall, ongoing economic damage to aviation, airports and tourism?  We are aware that our two national airlines are losing €6 million or €7 million a day.  The Transport Commissioner, Mr. Kallas, to whom the Minister referred, said in that context that this is an exceptional event similar to that which occurred on 11 September 2001 and therefore European governments should consider some support framework programmes for their airlines.  Should the Government not urgently reconsider the entire situation and perhaps propose some support mechanism for the airlines if this continues?When we last met we had a debate on the travel tax.  Is it not time to finally axe that tax, which we know even from a cursory cost-benefit analysis is not beneficial?  The yield is lower than the damage it does to the country.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	23	When the task force met, the various State agencies were tasked with trying to assess the economic aspects of the closure of airports owing to volcanic ash and that work is still ongoing.  In the reply I said that Aer Lingus and Ryanair have estimated their losses from the crisis to be €5 million and €6 million respectively per day.  I recollect that the airport authority mentioned losses of approximately €8 million over the course of the previous closedown.  On that aspect alone the losses total approximately €85 million or €90 million.  From a tourism point of view, obviously, there is a loss of incoming passengers.  However, I suppose that is somewhat counteracted by some people having to stay longer than they intended and some Irish people who had planned to travel abroad staying at home and probably making some other arrangements.  That kind of sum needs to be done.On giving compensation, the Deputy knows the current state of our finances.  He has proposed to add a further €140 million to that.  Would he like to make some proposals as to what expenditure we might cut to eliminate the air tax——

There are resources we can find from segments of the population who should contribute more to help deal with the national crisis.  On the scientific advice, obviously the IAA is taking advice from the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in London.  What is the most recent advice the Minister has received?  Is he having video conference calls with his European colleagues on a daily basis to monitor this?  What is the worst case scenario the Government is prepared to meet?  For example it is said that when this volcano erupts, its big sister, Katla — I will not try to pronounce the name of the erupting volcano itself again — is an angry sister and always erupts on time.  If this turns into an event that lasts for several years, what is the Government's thinking in that regard?Once again Irish citizens are stranded abroad and visitors who are very valuable to our country are stranded here.  Has the Minister made any special arrangement to ensure that European legislation is enforced for those passengers?  In the past week or so we all met people who managed to get back during the previous ash outbreak and found it very difficult.  Will the Minister insist that their rights will be respected?  Does he welcome that the chief executive of Ryanair, Mr. Michael O'Leary, finally decided to follow European law in this regard?

It would be a criminal offence to break that law so I am glad everyone has agreed they will obey it, that is what I expect from our citizens.On the broader question of fairness in the context of an extraordinary event like this one, that is a debate that will no doubt take place in future.  It might not be useful to have it right now in case people feel they could renege on current commitments.No one can say how long these disruptions will continue, it depends on the volcano and the weather.  If the second volcano erupts, the rules agreed by EU Ministers that are being implemented now would be put in place across all European airspace.  If it was clear the disruption would last for a long time, contingency plans would have to be put in place.  That does not arise at the moment.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	32	The renewed programme for Government contains a commitment to the provision of a safe and efficient network of rail services.  Under Transport 21, rail services, including commuter services, have expanded significantly resulting in substantially increased capacity for passengers.  The 67 new intercity carriages on the Dublin to Cork line and the 177 new intercity rail cars have provided increased capacity on all major intercity and commuter routes.  An additional 51 intercity rail cars will begin to arrive in Ireland next year.  A number of other projects have also been completed, including the reopening of the Cork to Midleton line, phase 1 of the western rail corridor and the Kildare route.  Work is continuing on phase 1 of the Navan line which is due for completion this autumn.The DART underground project, including associated resignalling, electrification and rolling stock projects, will lead to a trebling of capacity for commuter services in the greater Dublin area, providing for up to 100 million passenger journeys per annum.  The Docklands Luas extension opened last year and the extensions to Cherrywood and Citywest are due for completion in late 2010 and mid 2011 respectively.A decision on the railway order for metro north is expected this summer.  This project and the DART underground project are key priorities for public transport in the renewed programme for Government.

I was brought up 50 yards from a railway line so I have a great interest in railways.I did not want to get involved but I cannot understand the decision taken on the location of a station outside of Dunshaughlin.  When I was first elected and made spokesman on road safety and transport, I had a meeting about the railway line with Iarnród Éireann and was told how sensitive the issue was, the costs of building it and that enough passengers must travel on it.  I was delighted when the line reached Dunboyne and then Navan.  I cannot understand, however, why it has been taken away from Dunshaughlin.  No one has explained how building a railway station outside a town is the way forward, it must be within the town.  The people of Ratoath, Ashbourne and Dunshaughlin are being left out in the cold, it is a waste of time if we are not joined up in Dunshaughlin.The M3 is being built with two tolls on it, which is stupid, because those from Kells will not drive on it because it is too expensive.  The railway line to Navan is going down the old route but that line was used 70 or 80 years ago to bring fodder to Dublin when Dunshaughlin was a very small town.  The people of Dunshaughlin and County Meath in general cannot understand why this route has been chosen for the railway line. Can the Minister explain to the people of Dunshaughlin, Ratoath, Ashbourne, Screen, Curragha and the rest of County Meath why the line is going in a straight line and cutting out these people?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	34	The route of the rail line was the subject of extensive consultation and study.  A number of routes were looked at in the course of this preparation, to both the east and west of Dunshaughlin and also following the old route all the way.  There was extensive study from the environmental, economic and cost benefit analysis points of view.  The unanimous agreement of those who undertook all the studies was that this route would give the best return and would be best placed on the old alignment which happens to pass to the west of Dunshaughlin.The only people I have heard recommending it should go east of Dunshaughlin are those who may have a vested interest in land on the east side because the line would enhance the value of their property.  However, from the point of view of trying to ensure the rail line is built at an economic cost and within the time scales in question the line to the west was the one recommended.  Going to the east of Dunshaughlin would add at least €100 million to the cost, without taking into account the cost of land, and would involve two crossings of the M3.  For that reason it was decided not to take that route.

That is why we were at the top of the list the other day.However, my interest in this has nothing to do with that issue.  I do not even know who owns the land but a railway is built for people.  The previous rail line was built for cattle and for shipping hay, turnips and carrots to the markets in Dublin.  Now, however, we are talking about Ratoath and Dunshaughlin, two major towns.  There is more to life than the town of Navan.  I want to know who picked this route and I will find that out in the end and will discover how this could be announced on a day when Irish Rail did not even know about it.  It was announced for political reasons.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 75 together.I announced on 22 December 2008 that I would be deferring a decision on the separation of the three State airports until 2011.  Pending a decision on separation, the boards and management of Cork and Shannon Airports carry out devolved responsibilities in respect of the day-to-day management, development and promotion of their respective airports, with appropriate accountability to the Dublin Airport Authority.  Under these new governance arrangements the Chairmen of the Cork Airport Authority, CAA and Shannon Airport Authority, SAA, have been appointed to the DAA board and DAA senior executives have been appointed to the boards of the CAA and SAA.The recently published 2009 DAA annual report and accounts indicate that DAA has been adversely affected by the slow down in air travel due to the economic recession.  As compared to the previous year, both Cork and Shannon in 2009 experienced a fall of in passenger traffic of 15% and 11.8 %, respectively.It would be premature to speculate on any decisions to be taken in 2011 on airport separation having regard to the current commercial environment facing the three State airports. In addition to exercising my shareholder and policy responsibilities as regards the State airports, I continue to keep the position regarding the financial sustainability precondition for airport separation under review in my Department.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	57	It is now six years since a Government which included the Minister made the decision to move the three State airports in Cork, Shannon and Dublin towards autonomy and independence.  That brave decision was taken for a good reason to encourage competition between the three airports that would result in a reduced cost for passengers and improved service.Much has happened since and two years ago the Government attempted to resolve the dead issues around the new Cork airport terminal by mediation.  That process also collapsed.  We are now in a position where the Government has postponed any separation or autonomy within those airports until 2011.  That is only seven or eight months away.  What is the Government doing now in terms of talking to the boards in the three airports?  Is it making an effort to pursue the original strategy of allowing the three airports autonomy?  With regard to Dublin Airport, is it not the case that because of financial pressures, decisions being taken in Shannon and Cork are being influenced by difficulties at Dublin Airport?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I want to allow questions from a number of Deputies.  Deputy Coveney has asked many questions.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Is it not the case that the Government's rationale for independence within the three airports is now stronger due to the recession, when we must see the benefits of competition and autonomy within the three airports?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	60	As the Deputy is aware, the decision to separate the three airports was taken prior to my time in the Department.  Had the method of moving forward been accepted by the board of Cork Airport, it would now be an autonomous and independent airport.  That did not prove possible and the Deputy has outlined some of the processes put in place to try to bring the matter to a conclusion.  Events caught up on that action and in my first year in office, those difficulties were ongoing.  We attempted mediation but as the Deputy noted, it did not resolve the matter.By the time it had concluded in mid 2008, there were wider difficulties in the economy and eventually the chair of the board in Cork and Shannon recommended that I defer the separation in the economic climate as it was, and which has not improved too much since.  We agreed to defer the decision until 2011.  As the Deputy noted, the beginning of 2011 is approximately eight months away but the end is approximately 20 months away.  The decision will be made at some stage during the course of that year.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	61	The Labour Party is opposed to the breaking up of Aer Rianta, which is an historically strong aviation company which has served the State so well.  At the same time we have recently seen a number of State companies in the electricity market, such as Bord Gáis and the ESB, competing strongly against each other.I wish to ask about the debt situation.  The Minister was not in his current portfolio before the last general election, but his party made a promise to the people of Cork that their airport would be established on its own debt free.  The Government then came along in a cavalier way, tried to lumber the airport with €113 million in debt and put pressure on it to sell some of its 500 acres.  How does the Minister stand in respect of this question and that on Cork Airport's viability?Cork and Shannon airports have suffered grievously from the recession and the downturn in numbers.  Has the Minister spoken with the DAA in the context of putting major new initiatives into the two sister national airports?What does the Minister expect Dublin Airport's debt levels to be?  When Mr. Declan Collier, chief executive of the DAA, attended the Joint Committee on Transport, he mentioned debts of €500 million in light of Terminal 2, T2, and other works.  He then stated the debts could escalate to €1.2 billion in the next decade.  Is the Minister concerned by these debt levels and what does he intend to do?  Is he just trying to pass the task on to the next Government?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	62	No, as I hope to be a part of that as well.  What I intend to do is what I try to do at all times.  When one sets up a semi-State organisation, particularly a commercial one, it should be allowed to do its own business, organise its own affairs, pay for itself and, if at all possible, pay a dividend to the State.  This is basically my approach to the DAA, as it would be to any other commercial semi-State organisation.Regarding the question on debt in Cork, the position was made clear and a proposal was tabled and eventually accepted following the mediation process.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	63	By a board that then disbanded.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	64	If Cork Airport were to separate, it would be responsible for its debt and be able to meet the cost of that debt from its substantial Aer Rianta property.  This was a reasonable approach and, had it been accepted, there would probably have been an independent Cork Airport by this stage.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I congratulate the new chairman of the Shannon Airport Authority, Mr. Brian O'Connell, who will meet Oireachtas Members next Friday.  The situation in the aviation sector has changed dramatically since the idea of a separation was mooted several years ago.  Does the Minister believe Shannon Airport could survive if it completely separated from the DAA?  I am sure the Minister agrees with me when I say it is important that Shannon Airport has the autonomy to make decisions about its future.  We all know of the airport's current problems.  For example, Ryanair provides a limited service into it.  Could Shannon Airport survive separated from the DAA?  This is an important question.Regarding the airport's debt, does the Minister know how much money it is making or losing?  I understand that it has lost much money in recent years.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	66	The question has been expanded on somewhat, but the Minister has the information to hand.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	67	Yes.  I do not have detailed information, but I can tell the Deputy that circumstances for all of the airports are difficult.  We saw the fall-off in passenger numbers in the past 12 months.  Shannon Airport's numbers fell by almost 12% and Cork Airport's fell by 15%.  It is a difficult time.At the time of the proposed separation, Shannon Airport needed investment.  The DAA had already invested approximately €40 million in it, but further investment was necessary.  The Deputy asked whether it could survive independently.  If the airport wants to be independent — this matter will be reviewed next year and we will talk with the DAA — then it must be truly independent.  It cannot be independent when making decisions but dependent on the DAA to pay for them.  If there is to be independence, it will be true independence.  The call that must be made at that point is whether the airport can survive on its own economically or whether it would be better served being part of a two-airport or three-airport company.  It is too early to speculate on that question at this stage.

When T2 was opened to competition, vibrant international companies failed to get through the process.  Is it not time to re-examine the principle of the DAA running those airports and to invite tenders?  International airport companies have assured me that there is vibrancy and competition among the international airlines, which were prepared to work T2.  The DAA should consider opening up and making the other airports in the country financially independent, as I agree with the Minister on the latter point.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Is the Government still committed to the principle of competition between three independent airports, namely, Dublin, Cork and Shannon?  As a policy position taken by the Government, I believed it to be correct.  Is the Government still committed to trying to make it work next year or is the policy up in the air in light of the review and the decision to be taken next year?Can the Minister stand over a situation whereby Cork Airport's largest competitor is Dublin Airport despite the fact the former cannot take any decisions without getting the latter's approval?  It is a farcical position and we have the worst of both worlds, namely, a half-way house that has all of the structures of autonomy in decision making but none of the responsibilities.  This is a major contributory factor to Cork Airport's poor figures.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I do not accept that.  Cork Airport is suffering like the other airports from general economic trends.  It has been given a considerable amount of autonomy in its day-to-day decision making on the airport's management.  I am unaware of any significant conflicts that have arisen between Cork Airport and the DAA as regards plans to promote the former since the new arrangement was put in place.The same applies to Cork as applies to Shannon.  If it is to go independent, then it must be independent.  This means that, at some point in the future, it will be unable to ask the Government for further injections of capital.  This would not be allowed under State aid rules.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Nor will the DAA.

The taxpayer has not paid for anything at Dublin Airport.The principle of the separation of airports outlined in the relevant Act still remains as Government policy.  It is subject to review in 2011, but it is the principle on which we are operating at the moment.  Probably the fairest way to say it is that this is the default position.  In 2011, a final decision will be made, but we are looking at the situation from the point of view of three separate airports.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Following the decision to terminate the facilities management procurement process relating to Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport, I announced, on 10 March, that I was mandating the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, to operate the terminal, while requiring it to demonstrate that it can do so within a benchmark set by the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  In this context, the Dublin Airport charges determination for 2010 to 2014, made by the commission, in December last year, has set very specific and stringent operating cost targets for operating an efficient Terminal 2.  I asked the DAA to report back to me within three months on its capacity to operate Terminal 2 satisfactorily with effect from November 2010.  I understand from the DAA that it will report back within the specified period.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	76	On the previous occasion on which the Minister took questions, we engaged in a lengthy discussion in respect of this matter.  It is extraordinary that a dummy competition or tendering process, in which many distinguished companies were involved, was run by his Department, only for the latter to then fall back on the Commission for Aviation Regulation's basic charging determination.  In view of the fact that it was already in possession of that determination, it appears that the Government, on behalf of the State, has spent €700,000 on something which did not yield a result.The Minister indicated that the DAA must provide him with an outlook on its capacity to run Terminal 2.  When does he expect to be presented with the DAA's report?  Will it emerge before November?  What would happen if the Minister decided that, in effect, he needed to fall back on a competition process?  Would it then be necessary to run a second tendering competition.  He indicated previously that none of the bidders, such as Ferrovial, the British Airport Authority, and so on, met the requirements set down as part of the tendering competition.  This is despite the fact that many of those bidders run massive operations elsewhere.  When does the Minister expect to be in a position to approve the DAA's plan?  Does the Minister expect Terminal 2 to open, as planned, in November?Recent media reports indicate that companies such as Air India are considering establishing a European hub to be based at Terminal 2.  Is there any basis to such reports?The new Terminal 2 will be a valuable national facility.  However, there are grave fears that the wages and conditions of those who work there will be significantly less favourable than those enjoyed by employees at other airport terminals throughout the country.  Does the Minister possess any information in respect of this matter?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	77	The result of the tendering process to which the Deputy refers was that none of the outside operators submitted tenders that were sufficiently robust.  I would not agree with running a process and then stating that even though none of those who tendered for the contract met the criteria, one should be given it in any event.  That would not be very smart.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	78	So it was not possible to return to them in the interests of seeking improved tenders.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	79	We returned to them to establish why their tenders were not sufficiently robust to allow us to proceed to the next stage of the tendering process.  We also tried to establish whether the result would have been any different if the process had been reopened at that stage.  Consultants that were involved were satisfied that the result would probably not have been any different.  On that basis and rather than delay the opening of Terminal 2, I decided to place stringent conditions on the DAA to operate the terminal within the parameters of the limits set down by the Commission for Aviation Regulation.We have given the authority until mid-June to decide whether, and to show us if, it can operate the terminal in this way.  If it cannot prove to us that it can operate the terminal, we will be faced with a problem because we will probably be obliged to put the contract out to tender again to try to obtain the best possible price.  That could delay the opening of Terminal 2.  However, if that is what it takes to obtain the best value possible, then we will just have to proceed.

Notwithstanding what the Minister said, would it not be possible to ask those companies — which, having met certain criteria, were pre-selected before entering the tendering process — to put forward the best deals they can draw up?  These could be compared with the DAA's plan and the contract could then be awarded to the most competitive bidder.  If the DAA ends up running Terminal 2 in addition to Terminal 1 and the other airports throughout the country, there will be no competition, no choice, consumers will be obliged to pay more and taxpayers will ultimately lose out.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	81	That is not strictly true because the DAA is a regulated entity.  In that context, the Commission for Aviation Regulation acts in the interests of several different parties, but mainly the stakeholders in and customers of the airport.  It has decided on a level of charges it believes to be reasonable from everyone's point of view.  This is not quite the same as an open market scenario where the DAA could just decide what it wants to charge and impose increases whenever it desires.The companies which tendered in respect of this project operate airports in other countries.  It was only natural that they should tender for the contract relating to Terminal 2.  As already stated in quite diplomatic terms, they did not submit sufficiently robust tenders.  In all good conscience, I could not accept tenders that were less than robust.Deputy Broughan referred to media reports which indicate that certain companies might have an interest in establishing operations at Dublin Airport.  Speculation is not helpful and I would prefer not to comment directly in respect of individual companies.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 49 together.Substantial progress has been made in respect of Transport 21: the five major inter-urban motorways and the M50 upgrade will be completed this year; the Irish Rail fleet has been renewed; the Cork-Midleton line and the first phase of the western rail corridor have opened and the first phase of the Navan line will open later this year; the Kildare railway line has been upgraded and a number of new Dublin suburban stations have opened; the Luas docklands extension opened last December and the Cherrywood and City West projects are well advanced; and more than 500 buses have been purchased.  No major Transport 21 projects will commence in 2010 because of the substantial number currently under construction.  However, increased smarter travel investment will allow a number of new projects to begin.As a result of the changed economic circumstances, transport investment priorities have been reviewed.  Future national road priorities are: progression of the Atlantic road corridor; and improvement of other key strategic routes.  The public transport priority is increased long-term capacity, particularly through: the construction of metro north; and the construction of DART underground and the implementation of the associated electrification, signalling and rolling stock investments.  It is also a priority to continue planning other projects for earliest possible delivery when the economic situation improves.  The investment in smarter travel initiatives will be increased.Future funding will be decided by the Government, which will have regard to the capital review carried out by the Department of Finance.  In addition, strategic priorities will be set by the Government.  The National Roads Authority and National Transport Authority will be guided by these priorities when deciding on detailed project allocations.

The statement appears to indicate that the completion date for this project has been put back to 2018.  While it is obviously expensive to build an underground connector, it would never be less costly to do so than now.  Costs, particularly those relating to steel, have never been lower.  Should the planning process relating to such a major infrastructural project not be accelerated?  What does the Minister know about this decision?  Was he consulted or informed about it?

I was with the board of CIE this morning but the matter was not mentioned.  I reiterated that the Dart interconnector and the metro are the two major public transport projects that should be completed within the timeframe set out in Transport 21.

Although I met the board of CIE earlier this morning, this was not mentioned to me.

I do not know how the statement in respect of planning could be made because, although I stand to be corrected, I understand the statement cited delays in the planning process as the reason the project was likely to extend until the aforementioned time.  However, I do not know how anyone could make such a statement because no one knows how long it will be in the planning process.  As far as the Government is concerned, the two priority public transport projects are the DART interconnector and metro north.

This constitutes a snub to the Minister, particularly in view of his earlier response to the question on the appointment of Dr. Lynch as chairman of CIE.  It is unacceptable to both the Minister and this House that this project, which is critical to Dublin's future transport options on foot of the connectivity it will bring, is being put on the long finger by a company that is not accountable to this House, which will not answer questions before the Joint Committee on Transport and the chairman of which the Minister reappointed without consulting anyone.  This demonstrates where the Minister's policy has put him, namely, in a complete mess.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I had consultations on the appointment of the chairperson.  While I do not consult anyone and everyone regarding such appointments, Government consultation took place.  As I stated previously to the Deputy, I am unaware of any change the company has proposed on this matter.  I am aware of a statement that was made and I will seek clarification thereon.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I am astonished by this admission that the board of CIE could make a statement to the effect that the interconnector will only be completed by 2018.  Why was the entire Fianna Fáil party in Dublin not lined up, both Deputies and councillors, as was seen at the recent opening of Clongriffin DART station?  Although the Minister seemed to know all about that event, he was not aware of the further postponement of what he has acknowledged to be the most important project in public transport to connect finally the railways and DART services across the east Leinster region.  This is an astonishing admission and is deplorable.  How can this possibly work?  The Minister is aware that in a couple of months' time, the metro north project will finally move towards its planning railway order and construction will begin on a number of what it calls "boxes" throughout the city.  As the interconnector is supposed to be integrated with that project, how can these two projects not move ahead together?

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	103	As I stated, everyone here is talking about a statement that no Member has seen.  The Opposition is engaged in putting their own political spin on it.  I am telling the truth as I am obliged to do in this House.  I was not informed of this development and am not aware of any postponement of metro north, which should be delivered on schedule as far as the Government is concerned.  While some completely unforeseen difficulties may arise and so on, as far as Government policy is concerned, the interconnector project and the metro project are the two key public transport projects.  Moreover, as far as the Government is concerned, there has been no postponement.  Furthermore, this would not be a policy decision on the part of the board.  I make general policy and consequently, I await with great interest the information that I expect to receive from the board about this project.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	104	Deputy O'Dowd, with a brief supplementary.

The statement from them is incredible and the Minister appears to be saying that if the interconnector is gone, significant questions may arise about metro north.  If this is the case, it is imperative that the Government and the Minister insist on immediate clarity on this issue and insist on being the dominant party.  The Government provides the money and appoints these people to their positions and therefore should insist on immediate accountability on this fundamental and critical issue for public transport.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	106	There is no foundation to the suggestion that were one of these projects to go, the other one could not go ahead.  I wish to knock that idea straight away, given that an advanced state of tendering has been reached for metro north.  Either project can proceed separately and while some works could be common to both, they can be accommodated and that is the intention.  However, that does not mean that if one project could not proceed for some reason or other, the second project automatically would be postponed.  I wish to make clear that point.  Furthermore, I do not believe in big dramatic gestures like this.  I am sure that by the time I return to my office, I will have a full explanation from whoever made the statement and from CIE regarding the DART interconnector and I will communicate thereon with the Deputies.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the member in each case: (1) Deputy Joe McHugh — the delivery of new school buildings to St. Eunan's College, Letterkenny, County Donegal; (2) Deputy Pat Breen — the need to amend the Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2008; (3) Deputy Leo Varadkar — the need for the Minister for Transport to intervene in the dispute between residents and the NRA and M50 concession with regard to the M50 embankment at Castleknock Glade, Laurel Lodge, Castleknock, Dublin 15, wherein the trees at the rear of the houses were removed by the M50 concession despite assurances from the NRA in writing that they would not be removed, where large amounts of soil have been taken out from the embankment to facilitate the M50 upgrade resulting in a serious loss of residential amenity for residents of the houses affected and a serious reduction in the value of their properties due to the loss of privacy, increase in noise, pollution and spill from the lights and given there have been several meetings with the NRA and M50 concession but with no resolution to date; (4) Deputy Noel J. Coonan — the need to address the campaign of the National Coalminers Group for redress, which arises from various health problems acquired during coalmining activity; (5) Deputy Catherine Byrne — the need to maintain the Inchicore-Ballyfermot home help service, Dublin; (6) Deputy Joe Costello — the need to end the practice of dispatching leachate from the landfill in Balleally to the treatment plant in Ringsend through the sewerage system of Dublin City Council; and (7) Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin — the need for the Minister for Finance, in light of the now signalled loss of 900 jobs at Quinn Insurance and the devastating consequences thereof, to explain why the Financial Regulator decided to ban Quinn Insurance Limited from trading in the Six Counties and in Britain hours before he sought the appointment of provisional administrators; why it has taken so many weeks to restore even partial access to these markets and what efforts the Government has employed to ensure that all decisions of the Financial Regulator have been justified given the serious consequences for this company's reputation and viability in all markets and the serious loss of jobs now consequential on the Regulator's actions.The matters raised by Deputies Catherine Byrne, Noel J. Coonan, Pat Breen and Joe McHugh have been selected for discussion.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Last week, in respect of the matter that was causing some concern around the country about Oireachtas Members being in receipt of ministerial pensions, I asked the Taoiseach whether he would choose either to accept the Fine Gael Bill to legislate for this issue for everyone or to discuss with Members in his own party their opportunity to give up ministerial pensions and to show leadership at a time of national economic crisis.  As the Taoiseach is already committed to voting against the Private Members' motion to be debated this evening and tomorrow, has he already had discussions with those Members of his party who are not willing at present to give up their ministerial pensions and if so, what has been the outcome of those discussions?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	109	My position in this matter has been consistent all along, namely, it is a matter for individual persons who are in receipt of such pensions as to what they wish to do.  I also made the point to Deputy Kenny last week that the Attorney General's advice is that the immediate and total abolition of pensions for a single category of pensioner would be unconstitutional.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government already has been proactive in this area by reducing the pensions by 25% and by indicating they will be abolished as and from the next Dáil, which is what is regarded as being within the parameters of the law.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	110	The Taoiseach will celebrate his second anniversary as Taoiseach in two days' time.  He has presided, with his Government, over such an unprecedented destruction of so many things in Ireland that it is quite incredible.  I refer to national debt, unemployment and Exchequer figures and the position regarding health.  It is important at a time like this that political leadership be demonstrated by the leader of the country.The Taoiseach came into his office with a very high reputation of having the potential to change, lead and direct but, unfortunately, that has not happened.  In the area of judges' pay, he failed to introduce legislation to make it equal for all those involved.  In respect of higher civil servants, he exempted them from the recommended pay cuts.  In respect of insiders taking privileged positions in banks, he failed to get his way there.  The Taoiseach is now the only party leader, as I understand it, who has failed to get consent from members of his party to give up their ministerial pensions.  He has failed in that act of leadership and to demonstrate such leadership at this time of national crisis.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Does the Deputy have a question?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	112	The Taoiseach has made the point that the Attorney General has advised him and the Government that it is unconstitutional to take away ministerial pensions and that this deals with the question of legitimate expectation.  He put through a Bill last July making it effective from the day of the first meeting of the next Dáil that no serving Member of the Oireachtas will receive a ministerial pension; I support that legislation.  I supported the case that this should apply to everybody across the board in equal fashion.  I have the advice of three senior counsel, which makes it clear, from their perspective, that this matter is quite constitutional.  The Taoiseach has already reduced ministerial pensions, which deals with the question of legitimate expectation.  He has done that by Government decision.When the Taoiseach served as Minister for Health and Children and Minister for Finance the Government received advice from the then Attorney General that it was constitutional to take money from old people going into nursing homes.  However, that was deemed to be unconstitutional and the advice of the Attorney General is only advice and has to be acted upon by the Government in session.I can furnish the Taoiseach with the evidence of these three senior counsel that this matter is constitutional.  I ask him again if he has spoken to the three Members involved.  Is he in a position where he will continue to abdicate responsibility and leadership at a time when hundreds of thousands of people, as he well knows, are suffering from economic stress and pressure and this is an issue to which they consider leadership, and the demonstration of it, should apply?  Every other Member of the House, as I understand it, who legitimately earned a ministerial pension has either given it up or allocated it to charity except for three members of the Taoiseach's party.  Has the Taoiseach spoken to, encouraged and advised those three Members that in the interests of many people this perception and demonstration of leadership is important, or will he leave this matter drift along with the litany of other matters on which he failed to deliver?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I refute again the misrepresentations the Deputy has made.  I make the point that it is not possible to give back a pension and at the same time to give it to charity.  People either give it back or they do not.  It is not a matter that can be designated by the individual pensioner.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	114	One can direct debit it to a charity.  That can be done by law; I have checked that.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I have set out the position.  One has to return it.  One does not have discretion as to the purpose for which it will be used.  If one wishes to use it for that purpose, it is a matter of one retaining it and deciding to do something with it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	116	Yes.  One can allocate it to charity and one would not therefore receive it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	117	That is a different point of view.  I outlined the position for the purpose of setting out the facts.The second point I want to make to the Deputy is that, as I have outlined already, we took proportionate steps on this matter.  We were proactive on it.  We decided to reduce the pension and from next term have arranged for its abolition.  In the meantime if there are people who wish to gift their pension, that is a matter for those individual pensioners to decide upon.   A number of sitting Members of the Houses and other assemblies have decided to do that with their ministerial pensions.  It is a matter for each individual to decide that.  The Government has to follow the advice of the Attorney General in these matters in all cases.  I do not know what the Deputy's advices are, but the advices to us are as I have outlined them.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I will give them to the Taoiseach if he would like them.

The Attorney General has given his view on this matter; he has explained it.  We have legislated for it and in the meantime this does not in any way pre-empt people from gifting their pensions if they so wish.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	129	The problem here is that the Taoiseach does not have the bottle to give the people of this country the same opportunity.It is perfectly clear from the Taoiseach's disposition, despite the fact that he has lost the confidence of the people and no longer has a mandate to govern, that he has no immediate intention of giving the people an opportunity — like the people of Britain will have tomorrow — of having their say.  There is no excuse for the Taoiseach denying the people of Donegal, south Dublin and Waterford their full representation in Dáil Éireann.Deputy Ó Caoláin and his Sinn Féin colleagues will later today table a motion to move the writ for the by-election in Donegal.  By-elections are also pending in south Dublin and in Waterford.  Donegal has been down a Deputy since 8 June last, some 11 months, south Dublin has been down a Deputy for 14 of the past 22 months, and Waterford has been short a Deputy since the former Minister, Martin Cullen resigned on 8 March.  People in these constituencies in Donegal, Dublin and Waterford have the same concerns as other people in other constituencies about job losses, businesses in trouble, shortage of credit, people who find it difficult to pay their mortgages and people who are worried about their future.  They have a right to have their full representation in Dáil Éireann.  The question I want to ask the Taoiseach is when will he allow the people of Donegal, south Dublin and Waterford to complete their full representation in the Dáil?  When will he set a date for the three by-elections?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	130	We have a mandate to govern.  It derives from the Dáil, in the same way as when the Deputy was a member of a Government.  That mandate is legitimate, proper and appropriate.On the question of the by-elections, that is a matter for the House to consider at any time.  As the Deputy said, there is a matter to be discussed here and at the instigation of Sinn Féin it will be debated in the House.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	131	There is a flaw in the Taoiseach's logic.  If the mandate to govern comes from the Dáil, then surely it should come from a full Dáil and therefore it should not come from a Dáil where, for the first time in a long time, there are three seats which have not been filled.Every time the Taoiseach is asked this question, he has a way of dodging it; he has told us that the Government has not made a decision on this.  He is making it sound as though the right of people to be represented in Dáil Éireann is some kind of a form of political patronage that can be doled out by Fianna Fáil and that a by-election is something that can be handed out like a national lottery grant.  It is not like that.  People have a right to vote in elections and to have their full representation here.  We are in a ludicrous situation such that if we were to ask the Taoiseach if he will have an election for the Dublin mayor, he would find every reason under the sun to give us a vague answer rather than commit himself to a date for that election lest he might have to have the by-elections on the same date.There is a long overdue referendum on children's rights and every time he will be asked when he will set a date for that referendum, he will give some other vague answer, again in case he is pinned down and he might have to set a date.  If he sets a date for the referendum on children's rights, he will have to hold the three by-elections.I have rarely seen any Taoiseach or a Head of any Government anywhere running so scared of the public as the Taoiseach is now.  He should set the date for the by-elections and allow the people of Donegal, Dublin South and Waterford to have their right, a right that was fought for by people who have gone before us, to have their full representation in the Dáil and to accept the verdict of the people.  When we hold these three by-elections, we can then put to the test whether the Taoiseach has a mandate in the Dáil to continue governing.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Deputy Gilmore seeks to lecture us again on how we view the situation.  I do not regard it as a matter of political patronage.  I am elected here on the same basis as the Deputy, perhaps for even longer.  To be lectured on those issues is not something I have to consider from him.With regard to the business the Dáil is conducting, the Government has, uniquely in this House, shown the capacity to take the decisions which have been necessary to ensure we did not find ourselves in the situation in which, unfortunately, some other country has found itself at present.  It is because of that coherent response to those sorts of difficulties that we are able to look forward to continuing with these kinds of actions and decisions in the months and years ahead.Specifically, it is a matter for the House to decide these matters; it is not a matter for Government.  If matters are moved, they will be voted on in that way.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.I appointed the innovation task force on 29 June 2009 to advise the Government on its strategy for positioning Ireland as an international innovation development hub and to assist in making the smart economy a reality.  I very much welcome the report, which was launched on 11 March last and provides a roadmap for one of the five action areas in the smart economy framework and complements the progress which has already been made on other aspects of the strategy.  Specifically, it endorses the Government's vision for Ireland as a global innovation hub and suggests we have the potential to achieve this goal.The report contains many new ideas, as well as calling for a reinforcement and better alignment of existing efforts and programmes.  It has made a wide range of recommendations, including in the areas of investment in research and development, the higher education sector, access to intellectual property, public procurement, tax and other incentives, convergence and other opportunities for transforming existing companies, infrastructure and marketing.  In particular, it suggests we need to re-focus and re-invigorate all parts of the "innovation ecosystem" and stresses that the focus of all efforts must be the entrepreneur and enterprise if we are to deliver the step-change in job creation we need.  It also poses a challenge to industry to seize the opportunities arising.The detailed recommendations of the task force will, as the report itself recognises, require detailed consideration in the context of budgetary policy.  I have signalled the Government's commitment to the agenda through the restructuring of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  The transfer of responsibility for the programme of research in third level institutions to that Department is in line with a more strategic approach to public investment in research and development recommended by the task force.It was also agreed, as one of the recommendations of the task force, to have an ongoing committee, chaired by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, to consider and oversee the implementation of the report.  The membership of that committee is being finalised and will be announced shortly.  In the meantime, progress is already underway in a number of Departments to prioritise implementation of the recommendations of the task force which can be progressed in the short term.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	135	This is the report which arose from the initiative the Government took in December 2008.  I want to ask the Taoiseach about the implementation of some of the recommendations.  First, the report stated that at least 117,000 jobs could be created, which is very welcome.  Can we have some indication as to when we are likely to see the first of those jobs appearing?  Second, there was a recommendation to reduce the effective corporation tax rate on innovative activities to 5%.  Has the Government accepted that recommendation and when is it intended to be followed through?  Third, there was a recommendation that a committee would be appointed, reporting directly to the Taoiseach, to ensure the recommendations are implemented in a dynamic fashion.  Do I understand from the Taoiseach that the committee he says will be chaired by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation is that committee, and that it has not yet been appointed?  Fourth, there was a recommendation that there would be a scheme to give public servants relevant work experience in high growth business in order to give them the skills necessary to build up a smart economy.  What has been done about that recommendation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	136	The task force report made certain proposals and it has outlined what it believes could be the potential of the report in terms of job creation over the longer term.  It is not suggesting that this would be done overnight but it talks about change.  There will be issues for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work through.  There will also be issues for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to work through in terms of trying to improve the visa and residency situations.As the Deputy knows, fiscal matters must be considered in the context of the budgets of the future and also, of course, the various committees which consider taxation proposals pre-budget.  The committee to which I referred, which is one of the recommendations and is to be chaired by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, is being finalised at present and will be announced shortly.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	137	On those recommendations, I understand the committee has not been set up yet, the fiscal issues such as the reduction in corporation tax for innovative activities have not yet been considered, we are not sure when the first jobs will appear and there was no answer regarding the public servants getting work experience in high growth business.Turning to some of the other recommendations, the report recommended that the country should re-brand itself as an innovation hub and that a €500 million innovation fund would be established.  What has been done about these matters?  There was also a recommendation that Ireland should modernise its bankruptcy laws.  Has any progress been made on that matter and which Department will bring in the legislation to modernise the bankruptcy laws?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	138	The whole purpose of the group which will be working on this is to monitor the implementation of these recommendations with the various Departments and agencies, and that this is in the process of being set up.  The net job creation in high-tech firms of the order of 117,000 jobs to which the report refers is to happen between now and 2020.  The report believes the implementation of the recommendations, supported by a favourable economic context, has the potential to contribute that sort of number of jobs, and this excludes the creation of additional jobs through the multiplier effect.  It is not a forecast or a prediction but it is an indication of what the report believes is possible and the potential of what we are talking about in terms of seeking to implement the report.With regard to the venture capital fund, innovation fund and so on, I have stated to the House on previous occasions that work is ongoing by the National Treasury Management Agency on that issue.  While there has not been a great background on which to work on the setting up of new venture capital funds given the present climate, much work is ongoing in that regard and will continue.The bankruptcy issues to which the Deputy referred will be for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to progress.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	139	There are 435,000 people out of work in the country.  Having a report prepared on the smart economy and innovation was an initiative taken by the Government, and one I welcome.  It was a very good report and, broadly speaking, it is something the Labour Party would support.  We might have issues about particular recommendations but by and large this is the direction in which we must go.  My difficulty with the Taoiseach's answers is that I cannot put my finger on a single recommendation of this report about which the Government has done anything.  The Taoiseach cannot point to a single recommendation that has been implemented.  The Taoiseach keeps telling us work on recommendations is ongoing and that this agency and that agency is working on them.  The Government announced the establishment of this task force in December 2008 but did not appoint it until the end of June 2009.  In fairness to the task force, it reported in March 2010.  There was great fanfare in respect of the launch of the task force report, as is normal in respect of the launch of reports.  However, the problem we now have is that the Government does not appear to have done anything about it and everything is being long-fingered.  It is a great idea.  We are all for the smart economy and innovation but nothing is happening.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	140	As the Deputy stated, the report only issued last month.  It sets out various short, medium and long-term initiatives which it advises should be progressed in that manner.  We are in the process of ensuring that Departments take up recommendations which apply to them and incorporate them into their plans for this and future years.  Also, there have been rearrangements in regard to Departments, including the transfer to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation of the programme of research in third level institutions, PRTLI .  These are fundamental decisions which are part of a wide range of recommendations which will now be monitored and implemented over the course of the coming months and years.  This is precisely as outlined in the report.  It is a little facetious to suggest all of this was going to be implemented the following month.  That would do a great disservice to what has been done.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	141	The Government has not yet set up the committee.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	142	It is being set up.  It is being finalised.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	143	Perhaps the Taoiseach will indicate three recommendations from the innovation report that have been implemented.  Given that his nominee, Commissioner Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, has been appointed to an important and influential position in terms of innovation, which has a €50 billion budget, does the Taoiseach intend to send the task force to meet the Commissioner in a European context or to invite her to meet here with the task force in regard to her proposals, in a European sense, for an innovative strategy for the next ten years?The Taoiseach will be aware that with the changes that will come in terms of the Internet, robotics, biotechnology and genetics, the world will change utterly in the next decade and that innovation is a central feature in this regard.  Is this potentially important dimension of Ireland's membership of the European Union being explored by the task force?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	144	We are already involved in setting up the process by which implementation is taking place.  Increasing our competitiveness by reducing costs, stabilising the public finances and preparing for global recovery are not enough to ensure we return to economic growth.  Increasing productivity and developing new ways to get a higher quality and quantity of output of goods and services from each unit of input is the key driver of economic performance and sustainability.  Innovation in the production and use of ideas, technologies and processes, is important in this context because it is the key driver of productivity.  This is what will inform all of the actions of the various Departments in so far as these recommendations affect them.The report was launched last month and was used by all Ministers during their St. Patrick's Day trips around the world as part of their promotion of the country.  We are now in the process of setting up the committee that will monitor implementation of the report.  Obviously, the first responsibility lies with the Departments and agencies to whom these recommendations refer.  None of the recommendations of which I am aware relate to implementation within the first month.  They relate to rearranging how matters are organised, how issues are dealt with by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in terms of how they interface with technology companies.  There are fiscal issues which require to be dealt with in due course in the context of financial provisions by way of Finance Bills, which is the way these matters have always been dealt with down through the years.  To suggest otherwise is to seek to be simplistic and rather puerile about what is involved.Under the seventh programme the Commissioner, Ms Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, will continue to liaise with the relevant Departments.  It will be a matter for Ireland to apply.  The Commissioner must consider the matter in the wider European interest.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I am aware of that.  That is the reason it is important the Commissioner is in a position to outline to Government and, in particular, to the task force, her plans so that Ireland can get in early to make a pitch for whatever might be appropriate for us.The terms of reference delineated by the Taoiseach are precisely what we have been talking about for ages, namely, forcing down Government costs, increasing focus on competitiveness and so on.  The Taoiseach should consider meeting the officials of the county enterprise boards who work with small business operators and employers who are literally being strangled by red tape.  It would do him the world of good to meet them and obtain their reflections on the system within which they must operate, which system is strangling innovation and directly contradicts what the Taoiseach read into the record in regard to the task force innovation programme.I did not hear fully the Taoiseach's response to Deputy Gilmore on the €500 million fund.  From where will this money come?  Has any of it been spent or is there in place a programme in regard to that which it is to be directed at?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	146	As I explained previously to the Deputy, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, working with Enterprise Ireland, has been leading a market assessment process involving engagement with leading venture capital companies in the United States, Europe and other stakeholders.  It is taking account of the impact of recent developments on the domestic and international financial markets as well as the current fund raising rounds in international venture markets.  The opportunity is also being taken to avail of the expertise of members of the task force, which has assisted in further defining the role of the fund as part of a wider goal of developing Ireland as an innovation hub.  The engagement with the market, led by the NTMA, is continuing and will determine the appropriate timing and structure of funds to be established.  This engagement is by its nature confidential.  In the meantime, Enterprise Ireland continues to provide venture capital through its existing seed of venture capital programmes.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	147	The NTMA has a particular function.  I would like to know from where this €500 million will come and how and on what it will be spent.  I support travel by Ministers, in terms of representing the country, to some locations in the context of St. Patrick's Day celebrations.  It is Ireland's national day and is an important element of a dimension abroad.  In the context of this year's travel, the Taoiseach was quite rightly adamant that every Minister who went abroad meet with a number of companies interested in doing business with Ireland.  While the Taoiseach may not have to hand information on this, perhaps he will supply us with a report of the interested companies the Ministers met while representing Ireland abroad and in regard to how we might monitor the benefits to Irish business in terms of investment in Ireland.  It would be in everybody's interests to analyse this element of those visits in terms of impact and effect.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will in time send me a report in this regard.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Some of that contact and discussion may be commercially sensitive.  The Deputy could table a parliamentary question on the matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs whose Department collates information in regard to ministerial visits when Ministers return.  It is possible for the Deputy to obtain some of the information he requires in this way.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I thank the Taoiseach.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	150	On the previous occasion we had this set of questions, I asked the Taoiseach about Innovation Fund Ireland's €500 million designed to increase the availability of capital for research and development by small and medium companies but his answer at the time was not very clear.  Is he now in a position to tell us how much of that fund has been accessed since its establishment?  What is the current take up and the processing procedure regarding the fund?One set of recommendations of the innovation task force is to ensure our education system promotes innovation and creativity.  Is the Taoiseach aware that it calls for the raising of levels of competence and attainment in maths and the sciences?  How can the Taoiseach reconcile such an objective with imposing savage cuts throughout the entire education budget?  The budget for 2010 saw an overall reduction of 4% in the provision for institutes of technology and universities.  Students must deal with diminished practical and tutorial supports and limited access to libraries and laboratories.  Last winter, the Dublin Institute of Technology had to cancel a raft of opportunities in laboratories and library services were cut.  How much more of this can we expect?  How does it sit comfortably with the stated objectives of Innovation Fund Ireland's recommendations?How does the related area of people preparing for third level education in line with the attainment of higher standards of accomplishment in maths and science rest against the further cut in teachers' pay, the reduction in teacher numbers and the increase in class sizes and the pupil-teacher ratio in terms of the passage through second level education in preparation for third level access?  It defies understanding.  Whatever good there may be in increased bonus points for CAO awards in the area of maths and the sciences, I feel it is cancelled out by all of the other measures introduced in the budget for 2010 throughout the education sector.  There is a reduced number of teachers and class sizes have increased.  It is totally contradictory and does not stand up to any serious scrutiny whatsoever.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I do not accept that contention.  Much work has been done on advancing science and maths and thankfully we are seeing a higher take up this year compared to recent years in terms of leaving certificate participation.  Much work is being done on Project Maths.  Much effort has been made by professionals and educationalists to try to ensure the attention of the student population is brought to the importance of science, technology, engineering and maths to future career prospects and to encourage a greater level of participation in higher level mathematics by leaving certificate students.It is important that this happens and there has been some improvement because of the initiatives already taken.  More work is required to be done and the question of double points for maths is under consideration as part of the initiative and I believe it is one of the recommendations made.  However, this issue is wider and the question of the innovation fund is not simply a matter of public funding; it is a matter of how one leverages private funding and ensures public funding is concentrated in such a way that it can be augmented by existing research capacity in the private sector.  Some research will be applied and some will be pure research.Much funding and capacity has been invested in this area since we started with this strategy on science, technology and innovation.  Previously, there had been no overarching strategy.  The strategy was introduced some years ago by the Government and has been regarded as successful and far more coherent than what was in place previously.  The task force report has further recommendations for consideration in this respect.  Moving responsibility for the programme for research in third level institutions to the Department with responsibility for enterprise was part of the process of bringing that funding together into a more single-stream fund where one could see the overall situation and see where the priorities were and the extent of output for the amount of money being provided.  This has been regarded by the research community as a great advance.There is the wider issue of how we develop industrial policy to increase productivity across the board, and not regard this simply as a niche activity but something that relates to the production of goods and services throughout the economy.  We must also consider how we can get more from less and use funding that can leverage further funding from the private sector as a means of ensuring that we stay competitive and that we develop product lines that enable us to sell our goods and services competitively in the international marketplace.  This will determine the extent to which recovery can take place, growth can return to the economy and employment creation can be generated on a sustainable basis.I do not agree with the contention that the fact we had to meet budget realities and ensure we indicate at home and abroad that we are prepared to bring our public finances into line has meant the need to adjust our budgets.  It is part of a wider objective, which is to ensure that the country is seen to be taking charge of its own destiny and not leaving it to others to make decisions for us.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I have heard the Taoiseach and others of his Cabinet colleagues, particularly a succession of Ministers with responsibility for education, state that education is the engine for the recovery and development of our economy.  However, will the Taoiseach accept that the measures he has introduced recently, particularly in the budget for 2010, run totally contrary to that understanding and that what is happening is that we are prolonging the current recession?  If education is indeed the engine for recovery and development, is it not the case that taking away from education, as the Government has so savagely done, will prolong the agony and the recession will be deeper and prolonged as a consequence?Will the Taoiseach accept the innovation task force recommendation to accelerate progress towards the introduction of broadband and fast-track the signalled Government spend under the national development plan of €435 million by 2013 and bring forward the intended date for the full roll-out and spend to 2012 or 2011?  Accessibility to broadband throughout the country will itself contribute to a speeding up of recovery in terms of rural economies the length and breadth of the State.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	153	We have been encouraging investment in the broadband sector for some time and have put forward direct funding from the taxpayer through the MANS network.  There has been significant improvement in that area, although obviously there is some more work to be done, despite the fact that people like to portray that no progress has been made in that area.The Deputy suggested that it is possible to continue regardless of the position of the public finances in every area of spend and that not to do so is a backwards step.  The problem is that if we do not get our public finances in order, stabilise our deficits and consider, as we will have to do in the coming years, reducing that deficit, we will put at risk all that has been achieved.  Therefore, whatever adjustments are being made are against a background of significant improvements during good times.Some steps backward have to be taken to adjust to the budget realities but the current position is still far better than where we were five, ten or 15 years ago.  Unless people are prepared to maintain some sort of perspective on what the economic and financial realities are, this discussion will not be relevant.  People are trying to suggest we can continue to borrow €400 million per week regardless and it will all be paid for some day.  It is not possible to have that sort of debate or to fail to bring that into the context of what we are talking about.Considerable investment has been made in a range of areas in education.  Only last week, an advanced microscopy laboratory was opened in CRANN, a centre in Trinity College Dublin, with an investment of about €12 million by Government through the Higher Education Authority and Science Foundation Ireland.  The most up-to-date microscopes and lasers will be made available to Irish companies, both multinational and local firms.  The investment relates to ongoing research in medicine and technology.  This is an example of the types of investments that are being suggested by the innovation task force and others.Through Science Foundation Ireland and the Higher Education Authority, significant funding is being made available to develop incubation facilities in which research can be conducted in a way that allows it to be commercialised thereafter leading to the creation of jobs.  While some research is pure or more "blue sky" in nature, much of it is applied.  Our objective is to get companies to see the value of research and development, as many of them do, whether in Trinity College Dublin in the type of advanced operation to which I referred or through institutes of technology where various manufacturing and other companies are engaged on an ongoing basis with developing products and services.In Carlow last week, I saw a good example of local entrepreneurship working with institutes of technology to develop opportunities, jobs, products and services.  This is the practical reality for those who are engaged in this area.  They have a much more positive view of it than is often portrayed here.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	154	On the specific example cited by the Taoiseach, the various skills of the approximately 10,000 PhD students working here could provide the advanced products that would, in turn, provide the maximum number of jobs, as referred to in the innovation task force report.I will set out the contradiction evident in the Taoiseach's comments.  There are a couple of hundred incubation units in third level colleges and institutes of technology, from which perhaps a couple of dozen advanced products have spun out, including some in which former presidents of universities have put in private equity.  Unfortunately, the incubation units are starved of capital and have to place their product in the market.  The result is that three or four of the most successful products have been bought immediately by multinational companies from abroad.  This means the person who did doctoral and post-doctoral work funded by the Irish taxpayer has been subsidising the research and development budget of a foreign multinational.I can think of four products which have been sold in this way.  Approximately 15 such products have been successful.  In each case, the individuals who made these discoveries and applied them technologically have stated that if capital had been available, rather than hiring four people, they could have employed 40 or 50 people or even 400 or 500 people.  If funding had been available to capitalise their discoveries, as was understood in the innovation fund, they would not have had to sell on the huge yield of the intellectual work they produced individually and in groups.  Instead, we would have kept these high end developments and created the highest quality jobs in our own system instead of, as it were, forcibly migrating them onto those who are getting research on the cheap.  While individuals, including those who have put in some private equity, will make a large short-term yield, we will lose the benefit of the investment we made in education, the discovery itself and the employment it creates in future.  This does not make sense.  Why is the innovation fund not seeking to respond in the short-term to capitalise such projects given the rich yield from them?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I made the point in previous replies that the National Treasury Management Agency is actively seeking to address this issue with Enterprise Ireland and is making some progress.  The innovation fund is not simply a publicly funded research programme.  It is using publicly funded research in as coherent and cohesive a manner as possible and leveraging venture capital.It is true that it has been difficult for entrepreneurs to access banking facilities or get capital into some technology companies.  Due to the long-term return that is sometimes involved, people find it hard to get support from banks, the State or agencies or moneys that would help them develop their companies and perhaps internationalise them.  The idea is to try to develop Irish multinationals, internationalise these companies and prevent their intellectual property value being transmitted or purchased by larger entities.  That is an issue which arises from time to time and has been experienced, as the Deputy stated, in some cases, perhaps even the majority of cases.  We need to try to change this development.Enterprise Ireland and other bodies are conscious of the need to find ways and means of supporting companies which have been spun out, such as those to which the Deputy referred, and try to keep them in Irish ownership, with a view to developing them commercially in this country, rather than have their intellectual property sold on to multinationals.  In some cases, it is retained in Ireland but in other cases it goes elsewhere.It is in some respects the prerogative of inventors as to whether they want to bring their idea further along the commercial path or take its immediate value by recognising that there may be a means by which it can be advanced and developed more quickly under a larger company such as a multinational than would be the case if they were to do so themselves.  That is a commercial or value judgment that is made by entrepreneurs from time to time.  Some stick with it in terms of ownership of the development of the idea, while others sell on their idea.  As has been said, what we need to do is try to provide a support structure which will encourage more of them to develop their ideas themselves.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	156	The Taoiseach referred to sums of billions of euro.  Many of those who have innovative ideas or are seeking to create jobs require relatively small sums of money.  Last week, I spoke to man in my constituency who wants to create jobs for an on-line business.  He has been told that while he has been approved for a grant, the city enterprise board ran out of money at the end of April.  This is true of enterprise boards around the country.  The lethargic response of the Government is not good enough for individuals who want to create jobs immediately.  Are options available to the individual to whom I referred to secure funding to create employment and develop the business he has established?The chairman of a previous task force established following the loss of jobs at Dell, Mr. Denis Brosnan, publicly stated that none of the recommendations produced in his report had been implemented.  Have any of his specific recommendations been implemented since Mr. Brosnan made a public statement on the matter a few months ago?  One recommendation related to the Lynx Cargo project in Shannon Airport, for which only €7 million was required.  Has progress been made on that project?  We, in the Chamber, can waffle all day but what we need are specific responses to specific proposals made by specific task forces on specific innovators.

It is a question of the Minister figuring out if it is possible to allocate funds out of existing budgets, but that is a matter for him to consider.  We have a set amount of money to discharge and it is not a question of finding money, given that we are borrowing a considerable amount of money to do so many other things.  The purpose of these exercises is to try to pull together public policy in a way that will bring more effectiveness and greater output for the funds invested.  These funds are not infinite.

There are hundreds of companies going out of business at the moment, not because they are fraudulently or recklessly trading, but because of market conditions, banking conditions and so on.  Our bankruptcy laws are from another era and are completely unsuited to dealing with this phenomenon at the moment.  Can the Taoiseach indicate when such legislation might be introduced?  Which Minister is sponsoring it?

I am aware that various recommendations have been made by the Law Reform Commission and others on the bankruptcy laws.  It is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to proceed with the bankruptcy laws, unless it is dealt with by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I will have to check on that.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.On 23 March 2010 the Government appointed Deputy John Curran as Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at my Department and at the Department of Defence, and Deputy Dara Calleary as Minister of State at my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation with special responsibility for public service transformation and labour affairs.  Deputy Dick Roche was reappointed as Minister of State at my Department and at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for European affairs on 22 April 2009.As Chief Whip, Deputy Curran is primarily responsible for the organisation of Government business in the Dáil and for the Government's programme for Dáil reform.  He also oversees the preparation of the Government's legislative programme.  In addition, my statutory functions covering the Central Statistics Office have been delegated to the Deputy.In my Department, Deputy Roche chairs an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on European Union affairs.  The committee keeps under review, and works to ensure coherence on, the full range of issues on the EU's agenda.  The committee has a particular focus on the correct and timely transposition of EU legislation.  In addition to these duties, Deputy Roche represents the Government at a wide range of EU and international meetings.  Deputy Roche plays a central role in consolidating and further developing Ireland's bilateral relations with EU member states.  He also plays a key role in communicating the importance of the European Union to Ireland and thus fostering enhanced public understanding of EU issues.Deputy Calleary has special responsibility for public service transformation.  This responsibility is in addition to his role as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for labour affairs.  His new role will allow him to co-ordinate the transformation effort across the public service, with a view to creating a more integrated, customer focused, and essentially "fit for purpose" public service.As always, questions on the functions of particular Ministers of State in other Departments should be tabled to the relevant Ministers.

Has that board been appointed and who is on it?  If it has not been appointed, when will this take place?When the Taoiseach announced the new Ministers of State, he also announced a renaming of various Departments.  Since then, the respective Ministers have continued to function under their old titles.  Today's Question Paper will have listed the Ministers under their old titles, such as the Minister for Education and Science rather than Education and Skills.  Has the idea of renaming Departments been dropped?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	175	No.  It is an administrative matter that is being attended to, and I do not attach importance to it.The public service board has not been appointed and I was anxious to get through it, given the context of the current discussions with the public service on the draft pay agreement.  It will be dealt with in due course.

What will be the statutory basis for the name changes?  There is also concern about the decision to abolish the position of Minister of State with responsibility for the drugs strategy.  There is a lot of concern that this would signal a lowering of priority for the drugs issue.  Given that the office of the Minister with responsibility for drugs was established within the last two years, what now will happen to it?

I want to put on the record the discriminatory nature of this high level of carbon tax on the farming community, particularly on agricultural contractors who must absorb this cost themselves as their farmer clients will not be able to pay.  This will put several small contractors out of business.  It is now estimated that a relatively small-scale agricultural contractor will be liable for an extra expenditure of almost €500 per week as a result of this exorbitant level of carbon tax.  I ask the Taoiseach, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to cushion this devastating blow to the farming community.

Why has it taken so many weeks to restore even partial access to these markets?  What efforts has the Government employed to ensure that all decisions of the Financial Regulator have been justified, given the serious consequences for this company's reputation and viability in all markets, and the serious loss of jobs now consequential on the regulator's actions?

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 9 shall be decided without debate; and in the event of the motion re by-election for Donegal South-West being moved, the proceedings shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 20 minutes today, with the speeches confined to the main spokespersons for Sinn Féin, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and to a Minister or Minister of State, who shall be called upon in that order, who may share their time and which shall not exceed five minutes in each case. Private Members' business shall be No. 76, motion re ministerial pensions, and shall also take place tomorrow immediately after the Order of Business, to be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes on that day.

Is the proposal for dealing with No. 9, motion re implementation of new powers of national parliaments under the Lisbon treaty, without debate, agreed to?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	205	No, it is not agreed and I want to explain why.  There should be a discussion about this matter.  The Fine Gael Party produced a series of recommendations about how we should deal with Europe on the committee, which was chaired by Senator Paschal Donohoe last year before the Lisbon referendum.  The chairman of the Committee on European Affairs, Deputy Bernard Durkan, has made a number of suggestions about how we should deal with European issues here, as has the chairman of the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny, Deputy John Perry.  There is an avalanche of matters coming down the track from Europe.  There needs to be a discussion on how we will deal with those kind of issues from a European viewpoint here in our own Parliament.In addition, we need to discuss the consequences of the very serious economic situation in Greece.  The Taoiseach has been briefed by the Minister for Finance in respect of the decision within the eurozone to bail out the German and French banks exposed to Greece at this time.  That is a momentous decision for the Government to have to make.  It is the first time in many years there has been a transfer of wealth or finance to this extent to another country.  It is fundamental to maintain the euro and the strength of the EU.  There will be a meeting in Brussels on Friday and there is ample time to have a discussion about the Grecian issue either today or tomorrow.  If the Taoiseach confirms that we can have a debate or statements about this matter I will withdraw my objection.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	206	On the same issue, I understand the particular motion that is before the House deals with the arrangements for the way in which national parliaments, and the Dáil in particular, will deal with European matters under the Lisbon treaty.  I agree with Deputy Kenny that, as a parliament, we have now been give a greater role in European matters and in the way the Government represents the country on such matters at the European Council.  The big issue that requires to be addressed in the House is that of the euro and the assistance that has now been agreed among European states for Greece.On behalf of the Labour Party, Deputy Burton has been seeking full information on these issues, as well as seeking a debate on them here.  We are told that legislation will have to be introduced to allow Ireland to make its contribution to the bilateral loans which are being provided.  We need to hear at what stage of preparation that legislation is and when it is likely to be brought before the House.  Many people have been surprised at the size of the contribution which is required.  We understand the principle that is involved, which is the need for assistance.  However, given the fact that increased powers and responsibility are available to the Dáil concerning the Government's handling of European matters, the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance should come before the Dáil to give us information on the issues that have been discussed with the European partners concerning Greece.  We need to know when this legislation will be presented to us.

I also reflect on another matter at this point.  Pending the response the Taoiseach will give, I shall reserve accepting the Order Paper because a very serious matter has been unfolding over recent days following a decision of the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE.  Almost all dental treatment under the medical card scheme has been withdrawn.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	217	It will be recalled that the Dáil passed a resolution on 10 December 2009 agreeing interim arrangements for the implementation of the relevant Lisbon treaty provisions.  The motion before us seeks an extension of the deadline to report back to both Houses on the review from 10 June to the summer recess and also seeks to have the interim arrangements in place beyond the summer recess in 2010.The other matter that has been raised is a matter that has to be subject to parliamentary approval and a Bill will be brought to the House.  The general scheme will be considered by the Government next week and will be brought to the House where there will be a full debate on the matter.  As people will know, following a request from Greek authorities, euro area finance ministers have unanimously agreed to activate stability support to Greece via bilateral loans, centrally pooled by the European Commission.  Finance Ministers in the euro area have concurred with the European Commission and the ECB that market access for Greece is not sufficient and that providing a loan is warranted to safeguard financial stability.As with some other countries, Ireland requires parliamentary approval before this member state can release our share of funds.  Therefore our participation will require domestic legislation.  It is under preparation and will be brought before the House as soon as possible.  The general scheme should be considered by the Government next week.  The Heads of State and Government will meet on Friday to conclude the process and I will convey our agreement to participate, subject to parliamentary approval and the enactment of our legislation.  This agreement is first and foremost designed to safeguard financial stability in the euro area, something which is essential for Europe, euro area member states and Ireland.  The financial support package for Greece is being drawn up and the process will be concluded on Friday.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	220	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 10, motion re by-election for Donegal South-West, agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with Private Members' business tomorrow agreed to?  Agreed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	221	The Taoiseach said legislation would come before the House in regard to Ireland's decision to participate in the European bailout of Greece.  When does he expect that legislation to be introduced in the Dáil?  Can he give a guarantee we will get back the contribution we will make to Greece, namely, €1.3 billion?  Will such a guarantee be contained in the legislation?  Has the Taoiseach, as head of Government, received any guarantee we will be repaid?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I ask for ciúnas, please.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	223	A fundamental facility for those elected to this House is the receipt of answers to parliamentary questions.  These answers are not being made available at present because of an industrial dispute.  However, I understand that in some, if not all, cases, Ministers are able to get information supplied to them in the course of their duty.  Is the situation to be one whereby all parliamentary questions are to be regarded as requests from Ministers to their line staff in Departments?As chairman of the Dáil, the Ceann Comhairle should strive to bring about a situation where Deputies can get answers to parliamentary questions.  On many occasions in the past we were told this is the most fundamental, democratic weapon available to an elected representative in the Dáil.  That facility is not being made available now and valuable parliamentary political information is being denied Deputies on all sides of the House, although, in evidence given last week, it appears that some Deputies are more equal than others.Has there been any consultation on this, to the effect that, at very least, information genuinely and validly sought by Deputies will be made available to them, or must all parliamentary questions be translated into requests from each Minister to his or her Department that the information sought be supplied?  This is a problem.  I am aware of the difficulties trades unions are having in respect of the Croke Park agreement but this is a cause of some angst among Deputies on all sides of the House.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Regarding the first matter raised by the Deputy I remind him that we all must be careful about the terminology we use in this regard.  These are bilateral loans and will be repaid as the economic position in Greece improves.  Obviously, strong conditionality attaches to these loans, with a quarterly monitoring and evaluation to take place and a review at the end of the year.  I ask that we be responsible in respect of the terminology we use.The conditionality attaching to the bilateral loans can be discussed and debated when the Bill comes to the House in the normal way.  The general scheme of the Bill should be before Cabinet next week and we can take the Bill as soon as it is approved by the Cabinet.  It is important that we use the correct terminology and do not give an impression that money is being handed over, willy nilly.  The conditionality here is strong.  This is a financial support package.  Greece does not have access to markets at present but is making a very significant adjustment, cutting €30 billion, or 13% of GDP, over the period to 2014.  It is important, in the interests of financial stability in the euro area, and in the national interest regarding our economy and its effective recovery, that we be very specific and accurate in terms of how we portray this.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I call Deputy Kenny, briefly.  We must move on.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	226	If we were to have a debate and statements in the House we could have all that information from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, who has briefed the Cabinet.  However, nobody else in the House knows the conditions and terms that apply to these bilateral loans.  It is in everybody's interest that we have a full and thorough discussion about this.  It is important for the European project as it goes forward.I ask again about the other matter, namely, responses to parliamentary questions by elected Deputies.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	227	The intention will always be that information should be available to every Deputy, regardless of what side of the House he or she sits on.  That is what we would like to see and there has been no instruction to the contrary from Government that the situation should be any other way.  If industrial relations issues arise that is unfortunate but this is not at our instigation, or of our making.  We wish to convey to everybody that we would like to see the level of information being sought in the normal way by Deputies being made available, no matter what industrial relations issues arise.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I hear what the Taoiseach says but Members from his party are being given answers to questions.  Other Members of the House, elected in the same way as all of us are, must resort to freedom of information requests because they do not get information from certain Departments due to the industrial dispute.In the interests of having everybody in the House treated equally in terms of the information they receive, will the position be that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, will treat parliamentary questions as requests from Ministers to their Departments?  Such requests are being answered in full and Ministers are being given full briefings regarding information they need.  They were elected in the same way as every other Deputy.  It is not good enough that certain Deputies of the Taoiseach's party get answers to parliamentary questions and other Deputies do not.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	229	We must move on from this issue.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	230	If there are specific issues people want to raise, that is fine and they can be brought to my attention.  Government simply seeks to function.  If specific information is required or is being sought by Deputies it should be provided to them in the normal way.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	231	As Members of Parliament we are entitled to receive information.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	232	If there is a specific issue the Deputy wishes to bring to my attention, I shall look into it.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	233	There is an issue of national interest in respect of the arrangements being made to provide assistance for Greece and its membership of the euro.  It would assist greatly if we could have the issue discussed in the House.  The Taoiseach has been a little vague as to when the legislation will be before the House.  He said it would be considered by Government but it would be useful to know when it is to be introduced in the House.  Given that Government has yet to agree the legislation it would be helpful also if there were an opportunity for the House to be given a report by the Minister for Finance, with an opportunity for spokespersons to respond to it.Ireland is not Greece.  Invidious comparisons are being made at present, some domestically, some internationally, which are not helpful to the country's overall interest.  In addressing those issues and maintaining a position which puts the national interest and the overall interest of the country's finances at its heart it would be helpful if the issue were discussed in the House.  I ask the Taoiseach whether some arrangements might be made for that and if he can be more specific as to when the legislation will come before the House.Ministers have responsibility to answer parliamentary questions.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	234	Correct.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	235	We do not ask the questions of civil servants.  We have tolerated a situation where, because of the industrial action, replies have not been forthcoming.  The fact that civil servants are taking industrial action does not absolve Ministers of their responsibility to the House.  To be fair, there has been a mixed experience regarding the replies Members are getting in response to parliamentary questions.  That aspect must be revisited.One parliamentary question I recently tabled to the Taoiseach related to meetings he had with groups of survivors of abuse in various institutions and discussions he had with the religious orders concerned.  I want to ask the Taoiseach about the meetings he had with both interests in that regard.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	236	Does this concern promised legislation?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	237	Unfortunately, the Taoiseach transferred the question to the Minister for Education and Skills so will the Taoiseach reconsider that transfer?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	238	He could answer the question.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I ask him to agree to answer the question in the House.  It relates to meetings he led with those groups and I would like the opportunity for him to address the House on it so we can question him.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	240	This is the issue I raised last week.  It is the meeting of 15 April, if I recall it correctly.  Deputy Gilmore may not recall that I raised this last week and the Taoiseach provided the information to another Deputy in this House while transferring my question to the Minister for Education and Skills.  He provided the information regarding that meeting in a parliamentary reply the same day to a Deputy from his own party on the backbenches.  I referred the matter to the Committee on Procedures and Privileges because it is absolutely unacceptable.This is a serious matter relating to the provision of replies.  That instance shows a two-tier attitude of the Department of the Taoiseach in responding to Deputies' parliamentary questions.  Deputies Kenny and Gilmore referred to the wider issue in that we are not getting responses in the main to parliamentary questions tabled to a raft of different Departments.  Those of us who are spokespersons for health are well used to our parliamentary questions being kicked to touch for anything up to four months by the Minister for Health and Children but now a much graver position applies across a range of Departments.It is a serious matter.  The responsibility in the first instance lies with respective Ministers, to whom the questions are put.  They have a responsibility to provide the answers and my experience is that the answers can be provided to some Deputies while being refused to others.  Deputy Gilmore has already indicated that he had exactly the same experience, which is totally unacceptable.  I urge that the matter be addressed with the required urgency.As I have the opportunity on the Order of Business, I wanted to raise two matters relating to promised legislation.  This is also against the backdrop of my earlier request on the ordering of business as to whether the Minister for Health and Children would be called to give account of the reasons for a decision — and what steps will be taken to reverse this — to have the HSE advise all dental practices that they will no longer be in a position to provide dental treatment——

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	243	There is no other way.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Is it linked to legislation, or is the Deputy inquiring about specific legislation?

The decision stands except with regard to so-called emergency cases.  There is no explanation of an emergency case.  I have seen instances concerning this issue over a number of days.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	246	The Deputy could take this up with the line Minister.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	248	There are other ways of pursuing this.

The legislation is the health and social care professionals (amendment) Bill and the licensing of health facilities Bill.  Will the Taoiseach give a response on the promised date of publication and indicate whether he will intervene to have the matters I have highlighted here addressed so we can be afforded an opportunity to question the Minister for Health and Children in this Chamber?  The issues are very important and the medical card scheme has almost been flittered away by this further measure.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	252	This is not a Second Stage speech.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	254	Is there promised legislation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	255	The first Bill sought by the Deputy will be next year.  There is no date for the second Bill mentioned.  The Deputy can put questions to the Minister for Health and Children at any time on these matters regarding legislation.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I do not know how it happened.  I have to check that out but the question may have gone to two different people who replied in different ways.  I do not know.  I do not dictate the answers or tell people how to conduct their affairs in the office.  I have never done so.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	260	The replies go out in the Taoiseach's name.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I will have to check that out.  I do not know what it is about.On the other matter raised by Deputy Gilmore, the process will be finalised next Friday with the heads of state and government.  There will be formal adoption of the proposal agreed by the Eurogroup ministers earlier this week.  It is subject to parliamentary approval.  There will be a debate.  We hope to have the Bill before Government next week and will probably bring it to the House the following week, if that can be agreed.  We will deal with it in the normal way with a full debate.People will know from statements issued by the finance ministers and previous statements on 11 April by the heads of state and government as to the nature of this support.  It is upon request of the Greek Government and it is important to emphasise that these are bilateral loans to be managed by the Commission pulling the issue together using the European Central Bank as the paying agent.  A strong conditionality attaches.This constitutes an international agreement and one of our parliamentary procedures is to append the international agreement to the Schedule of any Bill brought forward.  That is currently being finalised by the Commission officials based on the discussions which have taken place between the ECB, the Commission, the IMF and the Greek Government.  We must await that as part of our legislative preparation for consideration in the House.  It is a technical issue but it must be taken into account.  That is the full information I can give to the House at this point.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	262	Approximately two months ago I put down a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, regarding the national property services regulatory authority.  It has been up and running for two years now and employs a number of staff.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	263	Does this relate to promised legislation?
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	264	Yes, and if the Ceann Comhairle gives me a moment I will make it abundantly clear.  The national property services regulatory authority has offices with eight members of staff and costs €600,000 per year to run.  The bill has arrived at €1.2 million.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	265	The Deputy should just tell us about the legislation.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	266	The question I put to the Minister in February received a reply indicating clearly that the legislation enabling this authority to do its job properly has to be completed in the Houses.  The agency costs the Exchequer money and the offices are staffed, with people sitting behind desks, but the Bill to enable the agency to do its job properly has yet to be enacted.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	267	We will make inquiries as to when the legislation will come before us.

She has now, no doubt, been briefed by her officials on the onerous legislative programme at the Department of Education and Skills.  It is similar to that in the justice Department.  Is she in a position to tell the House when we will see the legislation to put on a statutory basis the patronage of community primary schools by the VECs?  When will we see the legislation to bring together the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, and the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC?  When will we see legislation to provide for the abolition of the National University of Ireland?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	274	The Tánaiste is working on both of the first pieces of legislation that were mentioned.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	282	As I said to the Deputy last week in relation to this matter, there is a proposal from the joint committee in relation to the children's referendum.  That is being considered by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  It has not yet been considered by Government because he is currently liaising with various Departments and the Attorney General's office.  As soon as it comes to Government, we can deal with it then, but obviously I do not want to pre-empt that discussion.

This is to be acknowledged.  However, a growing number of Ministers treat the House with absolute contempt and give as little information as possible on every subject.

This is not democracy and we have put up with it for long enough.  The Government views this as fun, something for its entertainment.

The only person who can do anything is the Taoiseach.  The Opposition has one or two methods to assist and they will come to pass if something is not done as a matter of urgency.  I am not issuing a threat, but the Ceann Comhairle or any long-standing member of the Opposition knows as well as I do that this situation has gone on for long enough and will be tolerated no longer.  If the Government wants to try it out, let us try it and see what happens some morning.The other issue is the national vetting bureau Bill, which is urgently needed and much promised.  The Taoiseach has updated the House a number of times.  Is it likely to appear in the House soon?  The Taoiseach has a quizzical look on his face.

Given the extent to which legal costs are likely to impact on the economy in the not-too-distant future, will the Taoiseach indicate to the House whether it is intended to introduce the Bill into the House with some degree of urgency or, at least, a little more urgency than has been displayed heretofore?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I understand that will be next year at the earliest.  All I can say to the Deputy is that the whole idea of bringing forward a listing process at the beginning of every session is to give an indication of what is likely to appear during the course of this session.  People will know from replies to parliamentary questions or, indeed, repeated statements by myself that confirm what has been said in recent times regarding where legislation is in these matters.  It is important to point out that, of course these are matters that can be raised on the Order of Business, but the legislative programme is outlined on the listing and that is usually the best gauge of what timing is involved.

Will the Taoiseach make some effort to bring this issue forward so as that we can at least get some truthful information about the situation in the health structure?In light of a report in the weekend's newspapers to the effect that grant aid was provided for a structure in south County Tipperary that was never built, when will the dormant accounts (amendment) Bill be introduced in the House so that we can discuss how such issues can arise?  It is a serious situation to which I take exception.  Some 5,500 jobs are at stake in our country and there seems to be no way to put a structure in place, but this grant——

Is this not in breach of people's rights under the Health Act 1970?  The eligibility for health and personal social services Bill is on the list.  Had what has occurred been done under that legislation, there might have been a justification and we might have had an opportunity to debate it.

He was a Government candidate, so the Government was in a position to provide for the eventuality of his election to the European Parliament by planning a by-election within a reasonable timeframe.  Almost a year has passed and there is no indication that the Government intends to restore full representation to the people of Donegal South-West.  The refusal to hold the by-election is unsurprisingly political — particularly in view of the disastrous nature and massive unpopularity of this Government — and democratically unacceptable.Sinn Féin last moved the writ for this by-election in July of last year.  In the interim, the Government has made no movement to fill the vacancy.  Since the seat became vacant, unemployment in Donegal has risen from 19,895 to 21,075 — an increase of 3,180.  Some 4,697 young people in Donegal under the age of 25 are out of work.  A total of 336 jobs have been lost in the local authority alone since July 2008.  The fishing sector is on its knees and there has been a 30% decline in overseas visitors since 1999.The infrastructure deficit in the constituency is massive: there is no railway link, little access to broadband, local and regional roads are in a state of disrepair, and it is not connected to the national gas grid.  Public transport is inadequate at best.  Community hospitals are under threat of closure due to the current HSE review on long-term residential care.  Schools are in desperate need of both repair and new buildings.  This year alone, 78,000 home-help hours have been cut across County Donegal.Taking these various issues into account, there is a clear indication that, now more than ever, Donegal needs and deserves full representation.  The Fianna Fail-Green Party Government has failed the people of Donegal South-West.  It has failed to implement a job creation and retention strategy for the county, which is haemorrhaging jobs left, right and centre.Our system is flawed in that Government can obstruct the process of calling a by-election for selfish political purposes.  This should change and a constitutional obligation for a by-election to be held within a set period after a vacancy arises should be put in place.  The holding of by-elections should not be determined on the basis of what is politically expedient for the party or parties in office at any given time.In 1986, Pat The Cope Gallagher, MEP, said it was "morally and democratically wrong" for the then Fine Gael-Labour Government to oppose the holding of a by-election in Donegal South-West.  The by-election for Donegal South-West should be called without delay.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Science, who represents the constituency in question, was present in the Chamber until this motion was moved but has now left.  I call on the Government to set the date for this by-election and to recognise that by-elections must be also held in two other constituencies elsewhere in the jurisdiction.  Holding these by-elections is imperative and no other course of action will suffice.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	333	As one of the two remaining Deputies representing Donegal South-West, I have no difficulty supporting the motion.  I am sure my party will also support it.I agree that there is a democratic deficit in Donegal.  It has been almost a year since Pat The Cope Gallagher, MEP, was elected to the European Parliament.  In terms of area, Donegal South-West is one of the largest three-seat constituencies in this country.  It stretches from Creeslough in the north to Bundoran in the south, a distance of 105 miles by road.  The constituency runs along the Atlantic coast through Cloghaneely, Gweedore and The Rosses and stretches east to the borders of counties Fermanagh, Tyrone and Derry.  It also includes half a dozen inhabited islands, namely, Tory Island, Arainn Mhór, Gola Island, Inishbofin, Rutland Island and Owey Island.As already stated, this large constituency is now represented by two remaining Deputies, namely, the Tánaiste and me.  The Tánaiste is an extremely busy lady and is obliged to fulfil her governmental responsibilities throughout the country.  This means that I am obliged to spend a great deal of time catering for the needs of the people of Donegal South-West.  I enjoy every minute of this work and I like meeting the people who live in the area.  Last weekend I travelled around the constituency a total of three times.  I will repeat that exercise next weekend and the following weekend.As Deputy Ó Caoláin stated, Donegal has suffered greatly in recent years.  He also referred to comments made by Pat The Cope Gallagher, MEP, in 1986 when Fianna Fáil moved the writ for a by-election in Donegal South-West.  At that time, Pat The Cope Gallagher, MEP, painted a dismal picture of the state of Donegal's economy and indicated that 12,500 people were unemployed.  Today, some 23,000 people in the country are unemployed.  That is enough said.  I will not embarrass the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, by repeating anything else that was said in 1986.Donegal has suffered a great deal.  Its industrial base has been decimated and its traditional indigenous industries — fishing, agriculture and tourism — are in crisis.The Tánaiste and I represent almost 70,000 people in Donegal South-West.  The constitutional guidelines stated that individual Deputies should represent only between 20,000 and 30,000 constituents.  We are, therefore, in contravention of the guidelines to which I refer.  As a result, I am of the view that the current position is open to challenge in the courts.We should not be seeking a by-election for Donegal South-West, we should be seeking a general election.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	334	That is correct.

The country is in an awful state.  It is not possible to fly into Ireland because of the clouds of volcanic ash overhead.  People cannot leave the country because they cannot obtain passports.  We are prisoners in our own land.  At least the Greeks can enter and leave their country.  We cannot go anywhere.  If it is not possible to hold a general election, then the Government should at least allow the by-election for Donegal South-West to proceed.  My party's candidate, Councillor Barry O'Neill, is ready to run and will win.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	336	I support the motion.  I echo what Deputy McGinley stated in respect of the need for democratic representation.  The Deputy referred to the massive size of the constituency of Donegal South-West.  The Minister of State could probably traverse his constituency on a bicycle.  I speak to Deputy McGinley a great deal and I know he visits St. Johnston one weekend, Creeslough the next and thereafter he travels to Gweedore, Ballyshannon and elsewhere.  It takes a massive effort to cover the entire constituency of Donegal South-West.  Deputy McGinley's workload has probably doubled in recent times but there is no better man to shoulder such a burden.  The Deputy is working hard in his constituency.  However, the people who live there are of the view that two Deputies are not sufficient to represent them in Dáil Éireann.Deputy McGinley and I engaged in some sampling in Donegal town the weekend before last.  We went out and met the people and from listening to their views we are aware that there is a demand for the by-election to be held.  They are asking what the Government has to fear by holding the by-election.  What do the Government and the Fianna Fáil Deputies in Donegal have to fear?  Deputy McGinley referred to our candidate, Councillor Barry O'Neill.  Is he the man that those opposite fear?The Government does not appear to want to hold this by-election.  The third seat in Donegal South-West has been vacant for 11 months.  This matter must be addressed.  I again wish to indicate my support for the motion.  I hope the Government will see sense in respect of holding the by-election.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	341	Given that Fianna Fáil does not have the confidence to hold its annual Ard-Fheis, it would be surprising if it agreed to hold a by-election in any constituency.  This is what Members are debating this evening.  The issue of a motion to contest the by-election in County Donegal ultimately is a motion of confidence by the present Government.  Its determination not to allow this by-election to proceed is a reflection of its confidence in Government, and not simply its confidence in its ability to hold or to retain a seat in that county.The Labour Party supports, welcomes and will back the Fine Gael motion this evening.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	345	The Labour Party will back this motion.  This is the second time this motion has come before the House.  It came before the House last July.  Perhaps legitimate concerns could have been raised at that time because had the by-election been called, it would have been held at the beginning of August in the middle of the holiday season.  However, a year has passed since the call to issue the writ was made last July and there is no excuse for what the Government is doing at present.  In fact, there was no excuse for its failure to hold the by-election on the day of the second Lisbon treaty referendum.  Consequently, Members are witnessing deliberate prevarication by the Government to defer and to put off the inevitable giving of a day to the public in County Donegal on which they can determine who will represent them.The issue of by-elections to this House in recent years and in particular during the lifetime of this Government is creating a dangerous precedent.  Counties Donegal and Waterford and the constituency of Dublin South are without representatives in this House.  I can understand the Government's position to some extent because by its own reckoning, it will not win any of the seats in question and were the three by-elections to be called, the country would enter general election territory.  Perhaps this is the only reason for deferment of all the by-elections on an ongoing basis.  It has been indicated that an election will be held to choose a mayor of Dublin sometime in the early autumn.  In his response, the Minister of State might commit the Government to holding the aforementioned three by-elections on the same day, if such an election is to take place.However, I believe none of the three by-elections will take place.  Moreover, I believe the Government will try to stymie the election of a mayor of Dublin because of the consequences arising from the three by-elections coming into play on the same day.  Similarly, other matters, such as referendums on children's rights and so on will be put on the back burner as the Government does everything within its power to hang on to power and to ensure that such elections will not take place.I will conclude by noting that European elections are held every five years.  This is predictable and they coincide with the local elections.  It is almost inevitable that one outcome of these elections is that one or more Members of this House will be elected to the European Parliament.  It is about time to put in place legislation or a Standing Order on this issue.  I note this is not a constitutional issue and does not require constitutional change.  Consequently, Standing Orders of the House should be adapted to set out a predetermined time following the vacancy of a seat arising.  It is evident that this will happen again following the next European Parliament elections.  This was predicted before the last such elections and ultimately, a code of conduct is required to ensure that unless exceptional circumstances have arisen, no more than three to five months should elapse before filling a seat.

I hope to set out some of its reasoning for this decision.  As Members are aware, over the past two years this country has experienced one of the most turbulent economic periods in its history.  This has occurred primarily due to a deep international recession, which has significantly affected people in the constituency of Donegal South-West and elsewhere.  During the past two years, the Government has been working hard to ensure that Ireland and the Irish people will be able to come through this difficult period.  In this House, Members have passed some of the most important legislation in the history of the State.  Following a period of real difficulty and uncertainty, I am glad to note that such decisions and legislation are beginning to show signs of a turnaround in the country's fortunes.  While I do not believe for a minute that the road back to recovery is complete, the actions of the Government have helped to place us firmly in the right direction.  Today, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs indicated that the economic plan being implemented by the Government is bold and credible.  He continued by noting that the Irish economy is recovering.  This follows previous comments in an edition last week of the Financial Times, which stated that the country had a credible recovery plan.  Moreover, today’s Exchequer returns also bear this out.It is in this context that the Government does not believe it now would be in the best interests of either the people or of Donegal for the Government and the political parties to take their eyes off the recovery of the economy to focus their attention on running electoral contests.

Its primary focus is to protect existing jobs and to create job opportunities for those who are without work at present.  It also is committed to building on its strong record of delivery in County Donegal over more than a decade, particularly in respect of the roll-out of new infrastructure and improved services.  At a national level and despite the difficult economic position, the Government has continued to invest in building a new high-quality road network to link Donegal through the North to Dublin.

I will outline some of the investments made by the Government.  Substantial improvements in its road network and completion of significant upgrading to primary and secondary routes, coupled with completion of substantial town bypass projects have been key to improving access to the county.  More than €228 million has been invested in the county's non-national road works since 2004, which has led to many smaller local road projects being undertaken.  Investment in and ongoing support for flights at Donegal Airport by the Government has ensured the viability of air links to west Donegal, which is essential to attract investment to that part of the county.  The work of Údarás na Gaeltachta, strongly supported by the Government, has seen new jobs created in Gaeltacht areas and in Gweedore Business Park in particular.  The IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards also have been key in support of business projects in the county and in job creation.The Government will keep under review the moving of the writ for Donegal South-West.

The Financial Regulator was responsible for overseeing the auditing of accounts by these banks.  One wonders what was going on.  I understood that the regulator was answerable to Government and, in the main, the Minister for Finance of the day.  Did the Minister for Finance have his head in the sand given the skulduggery going on within these banking institutions?  On the last occasion I spoke on the Bill I made the point that when an official of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Willie McAteer, told Mr. Patrick Neary, former Financial Regulator that he would have his bank books in order by the end of the year the Financial Regulator replied saying, "Fair play to you Willie", which is something one might hear in a circus.  We all believed Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society were upstanding banks.I read in a Sunday newspaper a few weeks ago of how close some of the banks were to Members of the Oireachtas and how they were lending money without any security.  Surely, this was wrong on behalf of our banking institutions given the number of people now unable to meet their mortgage repayments.  Like other Members I, too, have been visited at my clinic by people who have lost their jobs, some of whom come from one-income families, and are unable to meet their mortgage repayments.  I made representations to several banks to see if alternative repayment arrangements, such as interest only payments or mortgage freezing for a number of months or a year, could be made to allow these hard pressed people sort themselves out.  However, the banks would not listen to me and did not want to deal with me.  In some cases, houses were repossessed and people were forced out of their homes while other cases were referred to the High Court, which is unbelievable given what Mr. Fingleton and Mr. FitzPatrick are getting away with.We were all told to expect a soft landing.  Where is this soft landing we were promised by former Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, and former Minister for Finance and current Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen?  There has been no soft landing for many people.  Like other Members of the Oireachtas and this House I, too, am aware of the number of small and medium sized businesses closing each week as a result of the skulduggery in the past by people involved in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  These people have walked away scot-free.  NAMA will take over their loans and they will retain a wealthy lifestyle.  The people really feeling the pinch are those who got nothing from the boom.This Bill is welcome.  However, do the reforms contained therein go far enough?  We have not yet learned from what happened.  This Bill should be withheld for another time.  There is much more we, as a Parliament, need to learn from what happened.  We must enact rigorous legislation to prevent this happening again.  As stated previously, people in other countries engaged in similar practices were imprisoned.  For example, in America when the skulduggery of the banking institutions was discovered those involved were brought out of their offices in handcuffs and imprisoned.  This is what people outside this House want to happen here.  It is up to us as parliamentarians to ensure we enact water-tight legislation to ensure what happened in the past does not recur.  We are moving a little too fast in terms of the introduction of this Central Bank Reform Bill.  We should hold off enacting this legislation until we have learned more from what happened.In recent months I have seen the current Financial Regulator, Mr. Elderfield, in operation.  I compliment him in terms of some of the decisions he has made.  We must have in place a tough regulator who can face down tough decisions such as those that will have to be made if we are to recover.  We must enact tough legislation to ensure the financial institutions learn a lesson and are not allowed to conduct business in the manner they have done during recent years.  We need tough water-tight regulation and a Financial Regulator who will enforce those regulations.  It is up to us as Members of the Oireachtas to ensure we put tough regulation in place.   I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  There is more we can learn from what happened in the past and major changes to the Bill will need to made on Committee and Report Stages.
#NiallBlaneyIND	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-party	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-dob	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I welcome the opportunity to speak this evening on the Central Bank Reform Bill, which is another positive measure being introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  Positivity is an attribute that has been sorely lacking in this country for too long.  I welcome that the Minister is, through this Bill, bringing to the forefront regulation in regard to our banking sector.There is outrage among ordinary people at how we got to this point, who is to blame and why we, as ordinary people, have to suffer for the wrongdoing of others.  These emotions are understandable in the current economic crisis.  There has been unforgivable reckless behaviour by some of those in the banking sector and I look forward to the day when they face the full rigour of the law.  In the meantime, we must continue to focus upon fixing the problems with which we are faced.There have been many measures introduced by the Minister for Finance, measures that received ample criticism from all sides of this House and the wider public.  However, I have always had confidence in these measures, many of which have already been applauded by experts in the field as being the correct course of action.  It is the Government's job to ensure that the correct measures are implemented.  It is not in the business of trying things out; there is simply too much at stake.  Those in Opposition can make suggestions knowing they will never have to implement them, thus their reliability will never be tested.  This type of behaviour does not bode well for our economy.  It pokes the problem but never offers a solution.  I know individuals, families and businesses across the country are suffering, be it as a result of unemployment or a fall in income or business.  I meet them every day in my constituency in Donegal which faces these problems and also problems because of close proximity to Northern Ireland.  I have huge empathy for their situation.  However, we were elected to this House to shape solutions and that is what this Government is consumed with.Last week, the late Mr. Gerry Ryan passed away, may he rest in peace, and we witnessed an outpouring of grief from our nation.  He was a superbly talented broadcaster who spoke his mind regardless of who might take offence.  One of his many attributes that I admired was his ability to turn a negative into a positive, and this could be seen on a daily basis as listeners turned to him with individual problems that were affecting their lives, some large, some not so large and some small.  Gerry always revelled in the challenge of finding a solution no matter what the problem.  His positivity was enthralling and he was a strong advocate of not talking ourselves down as nation.  It is this frame of mind with which we should all move forward.  Talking ourselves down is a dangerous concept and no matter what the task, we must as a Government shape a solution, as we have been doing for the past 18 months to two years, finding solutions to the banking and economic crises.There is no simple quick fix; it has required several very large steps, all of which have cost our economy much money.  However, we had to find a solution.  Winding down some of the troublesome banks would have been wrong, although it would most likely have been the easiest way.  I know I could have sold that solution to my constituents much more easily than one involving having to invest billions of their money in our banks.  However, it is not about taking money out of the economy and giving it to the banks; it is about building this country back up, and this involves having a fully working banking system.  If it could have been done in another more simple way, of course we would have done it.  We are in the ultimate phase in the resolution of our banking crisis.  NAMA is up and running and has forced banks to acknowledge reality and to recognise their losses, which were sobering.  Prudent capital requirements have been set by the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank to ensure that the reckless lending of the past does not repeat itself.Bank of Ireland recently announced that it would be able to meet its capital requirements through private investments, which show that the market has confidence in our strategy.  The EBS is currently exploring the availability of private market capital and has had an expression of interest to date.  Many of the other banks are not in such a favourable position but rest assured that any investment by the Government will realise significant gains for our citizens.I acknowledge that the Central Bank Reform Bill is a crucial step in a comprehensive programme to put in place a domestic regulatory framework for financial services.  I commend our Minister for Finance in his unrelenting pursuit of stability and reform.  This is a very real effort to maintain the stability of the banking system while safeguarding the interests of consumers and investors.I look forward to publishing two reports investigating the collapse of the banking system later this month.  The Governor of the Central Bank will report on the performance of the functions of the Central Bank.  The second report will investigate the recent crisis in our banking system to assess what lessons can be learned and to inform the future management and regulation of the sector.  Following this, an independent statutory commission of investigation will be established to identify, examine and report on the causes of systemic failures such as corporate strategy, governance and risk management in the Irish banking industry.It is important that we remind ourselves why we need to stabilise our banking system.  A major concern was the safeguarding of deposits, which was the money of every citizen who had money in the banks.  If we had not provided the guarantee, in many cases ordinary people would have lost their life savings.  We put the guarantee in place.  The next major concern was business; without business we cannot get out of this recession.  We need to get credit flowing to businesses and to SMEs in particular.  The nationalisation and recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the establishment of NAMA were put in place to get credit flowing again.  This is our ultimate aim and we are determined to see it through.  It is only then that full realisation of the Government's plan will be evident.In return for these measures the Minister for Finance is imposing specific lending targets on the AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Both banks must make €20 million available to Enterprise Ireland supported ventures for seed capital.  They will each set up a fund of up to €100 million for environmental, clean energy and innovation projects.  These are just some of the claw-back measures being imposed on the banks.  The credit review process has also been established for those who have had credit refused or withdrawn, whereby they can apply for an independent review of a bank's decision.  Our focus is mainly on getting credit flowing for business and only then will we see the real fruits of our stability measures.Those having difficulty with their mortgage repayments are also a very real concern.  A number of initiatives to support these people have been introduced.  The statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears for all lenders has been introduced.  The moratorium on legal proceedings has been extended from six to 12 months and we have refocused mortgage interest relief on those who bought homes at the peak of the market.  More than 15,000 families have been supported through the mortgage interest subsidy scheme.  We have increased the advisory services through the MABS.  The Irish Banking Federation has given assurances that where a satisfactory arrangement is reached and adhered to between a borrower and a financial institution its members will not take legal action against the borrower.  Thankfully, repossession rates in Ireland remain extremely low, but one repossession is one too many.  I highly commend any measures taken to help those in mortgage arrears.To counteract some of the doom and gloom that we increasingly hear, the ESRI and the Central Bank have predicted the economy will begin to grow in the second half of this year.  The ESRI predicts that in 2011 GNP will grow by 2.75% while the Central Bank states that it will grow by 2.8%.  Exports have increased by 16% from just over €6 billion to €6.99 billion since December 2009.  This could create 20,000 jobs next year and 45,000 the year after.  Ireland is the only economy in the euro area in which labour costs are falling and this makes us more competitive.  Huge export opportunities exist in the emerging economies such as Brazil, India, China and Russia all of which Ireland and the Government are looking to fully exploit.Consumer confidence is growing as is business confidence.  As many Members have stated, car sales have increased by 30% since this time last year.  In the past week I learned that car sales in Donegal have increased by more than 50%, with more cars sold this year than in all of last year, so certainly the indicators are very good.  Only last month, the leader writer with the Financial Times, Chris Cook, commented that Ireland is in pretty good shape.  Various other promising statements have been made in recent weeks also.  José Manuel González-Páramo of the ECB stated earlier this year that the Irish measures are very courageous and are going in the right direction.  The German Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Werner Hoyer, stated that there is a fundamental belief that the Irish are going to solve it.  The French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, stated that Ireland has set a high standard and the rest must follow.  The Wall Street Journal carried an article on the Irish economy stating that the Irish Government has repeatedly taken extraordinary steps to fix its financial problems.  Today, I read that the Exchequer returns for the end of April look fairly favourable also.I commend all of the steps being taken by the Minister for Finance despite constant criticism from all sides of the House.  While it will take a little time, by the end of this year we will have a bright future and I look forward to better times.

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	387	Despite what Deputy Blaney just stated about the positives he is putting forward, unfortunately the taxpayers do not see it in quite the same way.  They are still losing their houses, seeing no light at the end of this very long tunnel, and will bear the brunt of the mismanagement of the economy for many years.  It is indicative of the Government's opinion of the House and Irish people that we are debating a Bill to reform our derided financial regulatory institutions in May 2010, 20 months after the banks effectively collapsed, more than two years since the St. Patrick's Day massacre of the Anglo Irish Bank share price and several years since people became aware of the erratic lending polices of Irish Nationwide.Reform of the Central Bank and regulatory system that failed so badly in recent years is urgently required and should be addressed clinically in the best interest of the Irish taxpayer.  What kind of regulatory system allows banks to loan developers more than 100% of a purchase price?  This was, unfortunately, a common practice and many slightly bewildered borrowers availed of the opportunity because they believed in the system.  What system allows banks to become developers, authorises 100%, 40 year mortgages and does not recognise a property bubble despite the weight of economic history?The system failed badly and the plain people of Ireland are paying the price.  These are the people whose only experience of the Celtic tiger was being able to pay all their bills on social welfare or those who were panicked by the media and auctioneers into buying overvalued, poorly built and badly located housing.  They will pay for the recklessness of the few and the failings of those charged by the State with overseeing the BMDs — the banks of mass destruction.  The culpable and guilty get away with it.  Instead of real reform and the pursuit of those at fault, for everything they have, we have a media circus in which some former top bankers are questioned in front of cameras and a little early morning drama as bankers are brought off and questioned.  This is nothing more than window dressing.  Following 12 months of investigations into Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. FitzPatrick is not questioned until the week before it is announced that the citizens of the State will collectively forfeit more than €20 billion in tax revenue to pay for delinquent lending practices.The group myopia and sheer brass neck of those within the golden circles is breathtaking.  From Sean FitzPatrick stating that he could not "say sorry with any degree of sincerity" for running his bank into the ground to the then leader of the Fianna Fáil Party expressing surprise that people who had the temerity to question the Government's economic and financial policies "didn't commit suicide", the collective group think at work suggested we did not need regulation.While the previous Financial Regulator had no choice but to resign, it is my strong suspicion that he was implementing financial regulation to the levels with which the Government was happy, that is, with an extremely light touch.  If the banks had been forced to reduce lending, it would have dampened the property bubble, thus reducing the amount of tax the Government received from stamp duty.  The Financial Regulator and the Central Bank were certainly at fault and need to be reformed.  This reform must extend beyond that set out in the legislation before us.  The simple fact remains, however, that the architects of the crisis are still in place in the Government and upper echelons of the Civil Service.  The Taoiseach was Minister for Finance between 2004 and 2007, the years in which the economy was effectively destroyed.  Accountability and responsibility begin at the top with those privileged to serve people.  When they choose to spurn opportunities to accept the consequences of their actions, they demean their office.The Bill before the House does not go far enough in addressing the problems in our system.  Despite the abject failure of the bankers in almost every institution in the State, there is no effective mechanism for the regulator to object to unsuitable senior appointments.  Will it be another case of golfing buddies and those who sit on multiple boards once again filling the senior positions in the banks, thus condemning the system to fail again owing to a lack of appropriate and qualified oversight?  Even worse, the Minister for Finance will have control over appointments to the new Central Bank.  We can, therefore, be certain that solid Fianna Fáil supporters will be appointed to these boards.  What we need instead are independent experts beholden to no one and fully qualified to ask the bankers serious questions about unsustainable practices and irresponsible lending.  A board member should have no problem appearing before an Oireachtas committee similar to Senate appointments committees in the United States where the qualifications and thinking of the proposed appointees are challenged.Another glaring flaw in the Bill is the absence of a bank resolution mechanism in the event that a bank becomes insolvent at a later date.  If history has taught us anything, it is that everything moves in cycles and at some stage it is likely that another bank will overshoot its reserves in a quest for higher share values and greater bonuses.  If this occurs there should be a facility for the Financial Regulator to intervene in a potentially toxic bank before it is too late.While every Irish bank acted irresponsibly, the trail blazed by Anglo Irish Bank led to other banks following its lead.  Much like the BP oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, once the pipe burst the contagion spread across the entire sector and no amount of disaster relief could do anything more than contain the problem and leave a huge mess to be cleaned up.The economic commentator, David McWilliams, is correct when he states we have effectively abandoned capitalism when it comes to the banks to embrace instead a form of socialism for our banking sector.  The Government is so petrified by the all powerful bond market that it moves in lock step with what the compromised, tainted former masters of the universe tell it to do.It is the plain people of Ireland who will pay for all these bailouts with reduced services.  Fewer road repairs inevitably means more accidents.  Less funding for hospitals meaning longer waiting times for patients not lucky enough to have private health insurance.  Cutting language supports means we run the risk of creating our very own version of Paris's banlieues in places such as west Dublin or Galway.To use a poker analogy, the banking elite have been caught bluffing outrageously, yet they walk away from the table confident that the Government will force the citizens of the State to pay for their bad behaviour and cavalier risk taking.  Where is the justice in our system?  The United States of America, the home of capitalism, is a useful comparison.  In the United States, Bernie Madoff will spend the rest of his life behind bars, whereas our former bankers play golf while holidaying in sunny climes.  The United States has announced sweeping reforms and new regulations for its banking sector, whereas our bankers throw their toys out of the pram until they get their way with the Government on issues such as appointing insiders or pay levels which exceed Government regulations.  In the US, Goldman Sachs is hauled before a Senate hearing with a massive fine expected, whereas in Ireland, bankers with outstanding loans to their own companies which they are not maintaining continue to receive pensions from the same organisations.The 20 months it has taken the Government to produce some level of reform of the banking regulatory sector is indicative of the inertia which courses through the veins of this tired Administration.  The legislation emanating from the Government proceeds at a glacial pace, unless someone from the golden circle appears to be in peril.  The bank guarantee is one such example.  The Taoiseach was sold snake oil by the chief executives of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks and persuaded to guarantee the entire banking industry, even though it was known at that stage that Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide were in serious trouble and not systemically important.The legislative programme shows only 14 Bills due for publication for the entire summer session.  The Order Paper includes 39 Private Members Bills, including two of mine, which the Government shows no inclination to take.There is no question that our regulatory institutions are in need of serious reform.  Light touch or principles based regulation has been shown to be an abject failure.  The simple truth is that unfettered capitalism does not find a natural equilibrium and can and has gone badly wrong.  Developments in 2008 were not isolated incidents.Despite the best hopes of many who spend their spare time watching the film "Wall Street", unfettered capitalism does not work and must be kept in check by regulation.  It is the Government's responsibility, as the servants of the people, to develop a regulatory system which ensures that markets and financial institutions cannot damage the real economy.  While any reform of our obsolete financial regulatory system is to be welcomed, this legislation does not go far enough.  It is a conjurer's trick which does not give regulators enough power and oversight to prevent recent bad practice from occurring again.I speak as a representative of the people of Dublin South Central, many of whom have contacted me with real, everyday problems.  Some are at risk of losing their homes because they cannot pay their mortgages or put food on the table.  They are in a state of panic.  While it is disappointing that the legislation does not go far enough, it is not surprising from this Government. Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20870	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I move this motion because I believe sincerely that politics is on trial in this country at the moment.  These are not ordinary times by any stretch of the imagination.  In the past 18 months, 250,000 jobs have been lost.  Well over 25% of everything we spend is borrowed money.  Many young families bought houses at the peak of the market and they are now struggling just to survive.  We are seeing people's worlds being turned upside down.  People look on and they ask what role politics can play in dealing with this problem.  Sadly, many of them have lost faith in the idea that politics can become part of the solution to problems of this scale.  Instead, they see a self-absorbed system that does not seem to be in touch with the problems facing ordinary people.  That is a dangerous development for our political system.  If people do not see leadership coming from the political arena, it is very difficult to have the sort of transformational change this country needs.Many of our problems today have come as a result of a catastrophic fall in national income.  There are different ways in which we can deal with such a catastrophic fall.  One way is for people who are strong enough and privileged enough to circle the wagons and defend their rights and privileges.  The loss of 25% of our income will be taken from those who are weak and vulnerable, such as those who have lost their jobs, young people coming out of college, people sinking into negative equity and debt repossession, old and sick people who hope to get services in hospitals but find they do not exist.  That is quite a credible line.  Many people will look at what has happened in this country and the first instinct will be to defend their privilege and their ground.  However, if the strong do that, the weak in our community lose out.Let us be honest with ourselves.  Politicians are among the strong in our community.  We make the rules.  We make the rules about pensions for former Ministers and we make the rules about pay levels.  There are few groups as privileged as politicians in being able to defend our turf from being undermined in this time of crisis.  This debate is about whether politics will respond by leading by example, or whether it will defend and shelter those who are not willing to let go of their privileges.  That is what we have seen from the Government to date and it confirms the worst features of politics in the view of many, namely, that we are out of touch.The subject matter of this motion is germane to ordinary people.  They see a pension being paid to somebody who is still at work largely in the same job.  They see a pension paid to someone regardless of age.  They see it paid along with a salary that is among the highest in the public service.  That is why people react with fury, as we have seen in recent times.Members of the Opposition have said that this system is long past its sell-by date.  When a Bill on this subject was debated 18 months ago, Fine Gael advocated that all pensions to serving politicians would be brought to an end, yet the Government did not seize the nettle at that stage.  It has allowed this problem to fester and develop into great damage to politics.  Instead of debating how we can confront the enormous problems in our country, people hear about politicians holding out to defend privileges that have no bearing to people's ordinary lives and the struggles they face.This is a really testing time for many families, so politicians must square up to the challenge and show that not only do we understand the problems and have ideas as to how they will be resolved, but that we are willing to lead by example.  That is what people expect and they have a right to expect it.  Politicians are given an enormous privilege by people to come to this House and to try to provide a framework within which all our people can prosper.  We look back over the past few years and the catastrophic policy mistakes that have been made.  People in the Government will seek to diminish their role in these mistakes and say it came from overseas, or that it was the fault of the Financial Regulator or somebody else.   Let us be honest.  People do not see robust accountability anywhere within the political and public service system.  They do not see politicians, nor any other people in privileged positions, be they regulators or otherwise, take responsibility for doing their job.  People are furious because they do not see accountability and they do not see a system that is responding to the crisis they are facing.  We make it all the more difficult to build public confidence if some politicians hold out against this.The Government is currently trying to persuade public servants to enter into a pay agreement.  There is much to recommend in that agreement, but let us not fool around.  The Government has undermined the case for signing up because it has been perceived to be unfair in the way it has applied the rules to date.  Those rules were not administered in a fair way.  The lowest paid were asked to pay a disproportionate amount.  Senior public servants — 655 of them — were given a free pass, pretending that a bonus which they ought to have earned through exceptional achievement should be their automatic right.  This is bogus.  Judges were exempted from making the contribution that was asked of others.  People want to see fair play and the reason there is difficulty in selling this agreement is that they do not see fair play, nor do they see a strategy for economic recovery.  This motion highlights another example where unfairness is supported and protected by the Government.I have seen and heard the political and legal arguments that have been trotted out, but they are threadbare.  We have been told that a pension cannot be removed because this is a constitutional right of private property.  That is a bogus argument, because we have already decided to cut them by 25% and we have decided to abolish them after the next election.  A person who has ten years to serve in the Dáil after the next election effectively loses 85% of the pension, but if that were a fundamental property right, that 85% could not be removed.The property right is a bogus argument.  We have always known that property rights are circumscribed by the common good.  One has a right to property and the free enjoyment of property only in accordance with the common good.  Governments have a legitimate right to circumscribe that property right in the interests of the common good, once it is applied fairly.  The argument of constitutional protection for pensions is threadbare.  We also hear the argument concerning legitimate expectation — that in some way people entered the Dáil with the legitimate expectation that they would have these pensions.  If that is the case, they will be gone after the next election anyhow.  There is no legitimate expectation because these pensions are not part of an employment contract; they were created by a statute.  The Oireachtas itself created this right and can remove it.  That principle is well established.  This is not like a contract of employment.  These conditions are designed by the Oireachtas which can decide to change them in the interests of the public good.Nowhere is there a fairer process than in the Oireachtas for Deputy McDaid and others who are affected, because not only do they have a right to be heard but they can also vote on the issue if they wish.The argument that the Oireachtas cannot provide for the termination of these pensions is bogus.  It is the right and duty of the Oireachtas to make decisions that are in the common good.  The common good now demands that politicians should be willing to bear a reasonable burden.  It is not unreasonable to end a system whereby people who are still working have pensions.  It is particularly reasonable when those politicians are the very ones who are looked to to show example.  There is an overwhelming argument for the Oireachtas to handle itself properly and sweep away this anomaly, which is an irritant and is undermining our credibility as being able to provide leadership.I have heard Deputy McDaid talk about witch-hunts, as if this is a great conspiracy to hound down some individuals.  It just shows the extent to which some people in politics have become divorced from reality.  Ordinary young people coming out of colleges had a legitimate expectation — to use the words the Government used to defend pensions — to live, to work, to earn their livelihoods and to raise their families in this country.  However, 80% of the 250,000 jobs that have been lost in the past 18 months were held by young people under the age of 30.  A whole generation has been disenfranchised by the economic crisis we are enduring.  How can someone who is earning close to €100,000 at the top of the tree in the public service claim that asking them to give up a pension is a witch-hunt when others see their prospects being wiped away?  There must be proportionality, yet the Government seems to think this is discriminatory.  I do not think the notion that, if the Oireachtas removes pensions from those who have served in ministerial office is in some way discriminatory, stands up to scrutiny.  Of course, others who have retired from senior positions have pension rights, but they are not allowed to continue to work in the same jobs they had all their lives.  That is happening in politics, however.  People are continuing to work in politics and are seeking to draw a pension from a period in their lives when they were Ministers.Senator Joe O'Toole offered the defence that when this system was set up one had to keep people of experience in politics.  It was said that these were people who deserved to give of their ministerial and other experience to the House.  That may have been a justifiable cause back in the day when that measure was introduced.  At that time, by and large, people were amateurs and politics was a low-paid endeavour.  They all had other professions and came into ministerial office suspending their other work.  There was perhaps a case to say, "Let's keep them active in politics, rather than see them go back to those professions".  That is not the case now.  We are full-time politicians and are paid as much as a principal officer in the public service, which is a very senior post.  We are not part-time amateurs who spend our time in the Law Library or in the offices of solicitors or accountants and come here on the odd occasion to provide advice on legislation.  We are full-timers and should recognise that the world has changed.  We are being paid on a full-time basis and we cannot defend old privileges.This country is in great peril at present.  To some degree, there is a battle going on between the past and the future.  Many people's analysis of our problems stems from the extent to which they have been steeped in the past and the big mistakes that were made.  They are the sort of people who come up with phrases such as "This is a property right", "This is a legitimate expectation" or "This is disproportionate and discriminatory".  They have lost sight of what is happening out there in the real world where things are extremely severe.  Part of the reason it is so tough is because of the abject failure by this country's leadership in the political, banking, regulatory and public service areas.  They have failed us.  We cannot look to the logic of that failed system to come up with reasons we should retain privileges like pensions for former Ministers.  That basis is not good enough.  People look to politics to lead us into the future, not to find the defences of the past.My criticism of the Government is that it is steeped in the mistakes of the past.  Its view of banking is "Let's try and protect the flawed, bad lending of the past", instead of saying "Let's create a banking system that can lend for the future".  The thinking is, "Let's pull up the rope ladder behind us and protect those who are inside, let's not reform the bureaucracy, and let's stop recruiting new people to the public service".  That is the sort of thinking that turns our backs on young people who are the future of this economy.  People graduating from colleges have a right to expect an opportunity to work, even in the public service.  If they are enterprising enough, they have a right to expect banks to give them credit.We must decide to be on the side of the future, rather than opting for easy solutions that come from those whose analysis is steeped in the mistakes of the past.  All the analysis the Government has offered to justify why it will not introduce legislation to abolish these pensions once and for all is steeped in the sort of thinking we must abandon if we are to serve those who are in great peril.  We must correct our public finances and ask people in the public service to accept a complete change in their work practices.  That will happen.  We will have to tell such people that the work practices in the public service with which they have been familiar have changed.  We are going to see radical reform, including shared services, bodies closing down and a rationalisation of agencies.  When the public look in here, however, they hear people say, "The one thing we can't change are the pensions paid to former Ministers".  There is a huge gap between the sort of transformational reform this country needs to create a future and the sort of thinking that is underpinning the Government's defence of an indefensible system.At the end of this debate, I hope the House — including Deputy McDaid — will decide to abandon this system.  The leadership should say to ordinary people, "Yes, we are in a crisis.  We expect you to do extraordinary things for a better purpose in the long-term.  However, we are also willing to abandon privileges that we have had as part of a collective effort to address extraordinarily difficult times."

Legislation should be fair.  The Government is hiding behind legal argument in claiming to be bound by the advice of the Attorney General.  The least it can do is to publish that advice and acknowledge that there are two sides to this constitutional argument.  The Government is hiding behind the issue of property rights yet it introduced two separate Bills affecting public sector workers, who at the moment are being asked to vote on the Croke Park pay deal.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 introduced the pension levy and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 introduced the pay cut.  The same principles apply.  People had particular property rights but given the financial situation in which the country finds itself, they were put aside in the common good.It is not credible for the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance to come forward and state they cannot interfere with the property rights of Deputies in receipt of ministerial pensions.  I accept they have done service to the State, but it is an inconsistency that does not stand up.  What is required is leadership.  There is a complete lack of leadership and understanding what ordinary people outside this Chamber are experiencing.  People in the public sector are having difficulty paying their mortgages, child care costs and car loan repayments.  Across the spectrum, people are losing their jobs.  An additional 250,000 people have gone on the live register in the past two years alone.  Unlike the 1980s in this recession people are heavily in debt.  People with high mortgages — many of them 100% mortgages — are going overnight from having well paid jobs to being on social welfare.  They are in dire danger of losing their homes.  There is an agreement in place with the banks, but how long will that last?It is about fairness.  Deputy McDaid is in the House tonight.  Everyone should be sharing in the pain.  People who are retired are entitled to their pensions.  The ordinary person looking in is asking why people who are not retired — many of them below retirement pensionable age — are getting pensions.  I accept it is difficult for anyone to give up money.  However, it is about fairness and balance.  The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance have talked about it being unconstitutional.  I call on them to introduce the legislation and see if anyone tests whether it is constitutional.  Given that the Government has introduced two similar Bills to apply the pension levy and the public sector pay cut, which act on the same principles, why should it be any different for people in receipt of ministerial pensions while still in their jobs as Deputies and Senators?The Fine Gael and Labour Deputies voluntarily gave up their ministerial pensions on which I commend them.  Two elements are required.  The remaining former Ministers in Fianna Fáil need to take that leap.  They need to come forward in this Chamber or elsewhere and state they are relinquishing their ministerial pensions.  Furthermore we need to introduce legislation to show the people that the Government and this House mean business and that we will make the changes.We live in very difficult times.  We are in the middle of an economic crisis, highlighted by the difficulties in Greece.  Here government bond rates are at 5.65% today, an increase of 25% or 1.1 percentage points since the Greek crisis arose in the past week or ten days.  That will increase the cost of borrowing for the State.  People from across a broad spectrum, who are all making extreme sacrifices, are coming into our clinics every day, something on which we in this House need to reflect.  We should be leading.  The Taoiseach should appear before the House tonight to announce the introduction of this legislation.  The remaining former Ministers should reflect on the situation at hand.  Discussion of witch hunts and everything like that is only a sideshow.  The main show at hand at the moment is that Ireland is in the worst economic crisis since the foundation of the State.In the 1980s we had very high public debt but relatively low private debt.  However, we now have extremely high private debt.  I believe we have the highest per capita borrowing in the EU, which is frightening.  People are losing their jobs.  Those in the public sector have already taken a pension levy and pay cuts.  Those in the private sector are taking pay cuts and are losing their jobs.  We need fairness to be reflected and the pensions to be relinquished.  Legislation needs to be introduced to ensure that happens.Furthermore we need a proper strategic approach from Government in tackling the jobs crisis.  There are three elements: a fiscal crisis; a banking crisis; and a jobs crisis.  If the same effort and attention were given by the Government to the jobs crisis as has been given to the banking crisis at times, it would have paid considerably more dividend.  If we get credit flowing from the banks without having a jobs strategy in place, we will not come out of recession.  That is borne out by the ERSI and various eminent economists.  More than half of our general government deficit has arisen because of unemployment.We are here to represent people.  We can never forget that the electorate put us here.  There is a danger that the House can become a cocoon, totally divorced from what is happening in the real world.  That is what has happened to the Cabinet and in particular to the Taoiseach.  The Government now needs to step back and look at the issues at hand.  First, it must show leadership.  One of the key elements of leadership is fairness.  One of the key elements is the issue of ministerial pensions for existing Members of the Oireachtas.  I look forward to Deputy McDaid's speech tonight to hear his views on the matter.  We must take cognisance of what people are going through and show leadership.  Furthermore the Government needs to introduce legislation to ensure this happens.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The people are waking up to the inequality in our society.  Freedom of information legislation has done a lot to make people aware that former Ministers who are currently Members of the Oireachtas have enjoyed the benefits of two incomes.  That such system is in place for the abuse of public money is beyond belief.  Of course, we can also see a politician with the benefit of a State car claiming "turning up" money.It has taken the economic downturn to alert people to the fact we live in a two tier society.  It is incredible the Government repeatedly tells us that everyone must share the pain while rubbing people's nose in it by drawing a second salary that is worth more than many middle or low income families earn in a year.  It is certainly worth more than the benefits the 15,000 unemployed in Longford-Westmeath receive, and the 450,000 unemployed across the State.The only light at the end of the tunnel is the fact that the Government is divided on the outcome.  The leader of the Green Party, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has been outspoken on the issue, publicly supporting the elimination of these pensions.  It will be interesting to see how he and his party vote on this motion tomorrow.  Can he not support Fine Gael and retain a vestige of credibility?It is beyond belief that the Government should impose harsh cutbacks on the least well off in society while its members were secure in the knowledge they were being paid on the double.  The new awareness people are gaining and their instinctive begrudging of those on the gravy train is sowing the seeds of a revolution.The bankers and some developers who lived off the fat of the land are also guilty of untold greed that has brought the country to its knees.  They should be behind bars but they are not because they are supported by their cronies in this Government, the people who attended the Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway Races.  They are entitled to cream money off, leaving nothing for the hard working, low paid citizens of the State.  There is no NAMA for those young people who are unable to pay their mortgages.  They are, instead, hounded by the banks that virtually forced the loans on them.The members of the Judiciary are highly paid civil servants but are exempt from pension levies and salary cutbacks.  They have achieved this by hiding behind the Constitution and are part of the "I'm all right Jack" mentality that expects the most vulnerable to pay for their security.  I have heard it said that they are "entitled".  Why should those struggling to make ends meet see the Judiciary escape the pension levy, particularly as it would not noticeably affect their standard of living, while it is crippling for those on lower and middle incomes?The Government amendment to the motion, even by the standards we have come to expect from it, is laughable.  It is extraordinary spin that defends the Government's actions on the matter under discussion, bleating that we must take notice of its actions to deal with the economic crisis.  It wants us to recognise the budgetary measures taken by the Government.  It is waffle and more spin from the Government, something it has been good at for the last 12 years but now it is coming back to haunt them.When the amendment gets to the point, it notes that many sitting Members of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament have given up their ministerial pensions.  This does not make clear that outside pressure, particularly from Fine Gael, made politicians give up these pensions.It is interesting that the Taoiseach quotes the Constitution on these delicate matters.  It is not possible under the Constitution to abolish these pensions, he claims, or to impose cutbacks on the judiciary, or to introduce legislation to cease payment of ministerial pensions to sitting Members of the Oireachtas.  It reminds me of the proverb that the devil can quote scripture for his own ends.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	393	As one of those who was lucky enough to have a ministerial pension since 1997, when our banks almost collapsed in September 2008 and during the financial crisis that led to the introduction of the supplementary budget, I decided without any prompting that I could not justify continuing to receive a pension.  I also took a voluntary reduction in my salary of 5% without making a song and dance about it.  It was difficult to speak to those going through major trauma with mortgages and families while being in such a privileged position.  We are paid reasonably as politicians to do a good job and we are paid enough to make some sacrifices.  When I meet constituents now, they are all feeling the pain.  If we are to show leadership, if the country is to recover, we must all share the pain.  As political leaders, those who make the critical decisions that influence people's lives, we must be seen to share most of the pain and set a good example.The Financial Regulator has said that more than 28,000 households are in arrears with their mortgage payments.  The ESRI has forecast 270,000 families will face negative equity this year and when the one year moratorium on home repossessions comes to an end, there will be major problems.  If people feel a particularly privileged section of the community is somehow protected from these cutbacks and this hardship, they will react negatively.Personal debt in Ireland is among the highest in the world.  The Oireachtas Library research service has gathered information to demonstrate household debt amounts to €147 billion, a staggering amount for such a small country.  There has been a lot of focus on Greece lately but we have a higher budget deficit, over 14%.  We are in as difficult and precarious a position as Greece.  Unless we address this in a way that will require massive sacrifices, it is only a matter of time before our bonds will be considered junk bonds.  The focus on Greece could move to Portugal and Spain shortly but it could also move to Ireland.If we are going to ask people to make real sacrifices, we must make sacrifices now.  One element of that should be that those serving in this House and receiving one of the best parliamentary incomes in the world make the small sacrifice of giving up ministerial pensions while serving here.  We are expected to make some very small sacrifices.  Giving up our ministerial pensions while we still serve in the Oireachtas is a small enough sacrifice to make.

#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I propose to share my time with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, Deputy McDaid and perhaps another speaker.  I propose to take six minutes.Tonight's motion essentially revolves around an issue that has, to all intents and purposes, been settled by voluntary renunciation or gifting to the Exchequer in the short term, and by the abolition of all such payments to sitting ex-Ministers following the next election.  Leaving aside the very definite advice on the constitutionality of any legislation that would stop all such payments now, voluntary gifting of ministerial pensions, which in many cases involves substantial loss of income to some of those concerned, on all sides of these Houses and, in some cases, beyond, has a virtue that legislation does not have.  Credit is due to all those who, in the light of changed circumstances, have foregone payments which they or their predecessors received since the system was first introduced in 1938, although in earlier days the sums would have been relatively smaller.  In 1992, 2004 and 2009, there was a progressive tightening up of the scheme.  I give Deputy Deenihan credit for what he decided to do.The headline in The Irish Times last week, “Bertie Ahern and 15 others give up their ministerial pensions”, brought to my mind a faint echo of the most famous renunciation in history which took place in the French National Assembly on the night of 4 August 1789.  Against the background of great rural unrest, liberal noblemen renounced their feudal privileges.  Here in Ireland, old landed elites that were displaced along the road to independence learned, sometimes at considerable personal cost, that dogmatic insistence on legal entitlements could be very unwise and occasionally lethal.Constitutional legality and moral legitimacy are not always the same thing.  Democratic countries, republics, even Communist and post-Communist states, all egalitarian in intention at the outset, develop a political class as well as bureaucratic upper tiers and commercial elites that, in effect, can often devise their own rules and rewards.  One tendency all have in common is a subsequent difficulty in recognising themselves as others see them.  It is too simplistic to attribute such perceptions only to media influence.  Some bankers and developers have been accused, as recently as today, of failing to recognise how much has changed.  None of us should allow it to be said of us in this House that even in a parliamentary democracy we have learned nothing and have forgotten nothing.At the present time, not only our economic well-being and independence, but, to a certain extent, our democracy, are on trial.  There is rarely a shortage of radical alternatives.  Although politics must never become the reserve of those with the best access to private funding, a distinction must be made between those financial supports that are essential to do the job and payments that, effectively, are bonuses or extra rewards.  As was pointed out, this debate takes place against the backdrop of serious, ongoing, domestic economic difficulties which we are striving to master and which demands or has cost serious effort, sacrifice and hardship for very many people.  There is also international market turbulence which is an added potential danger to Ireland.  As most of us realise, we cannot allow ourselves, as Members of the Houses, to be cosseted and cocooned from what faces our fellow citizens.  We must show example by discarding systems of reward which, in today's circumstances, appear extravagant and not easily defensible.We also speak at a time when the Croke Park pay deal is in the balance.  Social partnership was always the alternative to the disastrous route that resulted from the Thatcher-Scargill confrontation across the water in the 1980s, a choice that could be ruinous to a small and vulnerable economy such as ours.  President-for-life Arthur Scargill's recent advice to public sector workers to fight on against an Irish trade union negotiated deal — which he came to tell us was an unmitigated disaster — is probably one of the better reasons for supporting it.To the outside world we must continue to demonstrate our determination to maintain our recovery strategy.  I am sure that after reflection all colleagues in these Houses will wish to join in showing the nation a common sense of purpose, at least as far as the underlying issue being debated tonight is concerned.  If there are any who cannot accept for themselves the validity of the case, they might at least defer to the general will inside and outside this House.

What we have witnessed in the last week or so is a personalised focus on the pension position of individuals.  It has been unedifying and has done little to advance any reasonable argument about fairness or leading by example.I accept, given the enormous upheaval in the economy over the past two years and the sacrifices all sectors of the community have made, there is a need to ensure that leadership is shown by members of Oireachtas.  Nonetheless, it is essential that the Dáil debates the matter in a rational manner.  There was little room for reason in the controversy surrounding ministerial pensions.  As we hurtled towards populist headlines, there was little thought for the personal circumstances that some — of an admittedly small group of individuals — may be enduring.In my supplementary budget speech just over a year ago, I said that in the current economic circumstances: "Everyone must give according to their means. . . But before we ask anyone else to give, we in this House and in this Government must examine our own costs.  We must lead by example."  That is precisely what we did.  The Government has taken a strong and clear line in reducing the costs of running our administrative and parliamentary system.Let us look, therefore, at what has been done in this area over the past 18 months.  In November 2008, the Government announced the decision of the voluntary surrender of 10% of their pay by Ministers and Ministers of State.  In February, 2009, the Government introduced a pension-related deduction — the pension levy — which aimed to reduce the public service pay bill by an estimated €1 billion in a full year.  While the average contribution is 7%, income over €60,000 was levied at 10.5%.  All Members of the Oireachtas, rightly, had their pay reduced by the maximum amount under the levy.  In April 2009, the Taoiseach announced that the number of Ministers of State was to be reduced from 20 to 15.  This reduction also led to a reduction in the cost of running ministerial offices.In the supplementary budget in April, I announced reductions in Oireachtas expenses; the abolition of the entitlement to further increments for Deputies, the abolition of some allowances relating to committee work and the halving of the allowance paid to Oireachtas committee Chairs.In budget 2010, I announced the Government's decision to cut public service pay.  Again, salaries of Members of the Oireachtas were cut according to their salary level.  These were permanent reductions which will be reflected in future pension entitlements.  Under this round of reductions, the salary of the Taoiseach was reduced by 20% which meant that when account is taken of the pension levy the Taoiseach's salary was cut by close to 30% in total.Ministers and Secretaries General of Departments all took a pay cut of 15% which produced an overall cut of close to 25% when taken with the pension levy.  That is in the absence of reference to the additional taxation measures contained in the supplementary budget of 2009.Looking at that record, any reasonable person would have to agree that the Government has made and continues to make a real and very substantial contribution to reducing administrative costs on pay and other expenditures.  This Government has taken more action than any previous Administration to reduce the cost of running our political system.  I can also say without any fear of contradiction that the range of actions Ireland has taken on pay and administrative costs generally is without precedent among our European partners.Turning to the issues raised in the motion and amendment before the Dáil this evening, anyone listening to much of the comment about ministerial pensions could be forgiven for thinking that the Government has done nothing to change the terms and conditions of ministerial pensions and that, on the contrary, the Government has somehow decided to exempt ministerial pensions from making any contribution at all to the budgetary adjustments required.  That is not the case.  The Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2009 provided that ministerial pensions paid to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament would be reduced by 25%.  These reductions were imposed immediately following the passage of the legislation.  More importantly, the Act provides that such pensions will not be paid to sitting Members after the next general election or the elections to the European Parliament.In considering that legislation, the Government looked carefully at the possibility of ending the payment of pensions to sitting Members of the Oireachtas with immediate effect.  That is called for in the motion before the House.  Strong advice was received from the Attorney General, which was reiterated this week, against this course of action.  His advice was that pensions were earned but deferred income to which the person concerned has a property entitlement.  In addition, the Attorney General advised that legislation to abolish in full the pension entitlements of a single group of workers who have clear rights to a properly earned pension would be discriminatory and give rise to legal and constitutional issues.  As I indicated yesterday, the advice was that this could amount to disproportionate discrimination.Why should it be considered disproportionate?  There has been no reduction in the PRSI State pension throughout this economic crisis and to date there has been no reduction in any public sector pensions other than pensions paid to Ministers.  To stand over, in constitutional terms, the abolition of one entitlement in a context where every other entitlement is preserved at full value is dubious.  That is the advice of the Attorney General and it is not an arcane or obscurantist legal argument; it is an argument grounded in the need to maintain a robust legal framework for the economic decisions we must take in the Oireachtas.The consistent advice from the Attorney General has been that it is open to this House to reduce the value of pensions for pensioners generally or particular classes but he questions strongly whether it is permissible for these Houses to unilaterally expropriate one group to the exclusion of all other groups by way of total abolition of pension entitlement.  However the Constitution is reworded and whatever referendum is conducted, it is very difficult to see how, in any comparative jurisprudence, the proposition of targeting a single earned pension for abolition while leaving every other pension alone can be legally or internationally sustainable.That is the advice we have received as a Government.  I have no doubt the Opposition has consulted with lawyers who may have given contrary advice but that is what we have received as a Government and we are bound to act on it.  It is responsible and considered advice which is not manufactured for any political purpose.  The Government clearly examined this possibility last year and sought advice again when the motion before the House was tabled this week.  It has received clear and consistent advice on this topic.  No responsible government can act against legal advice of this kind and a responsible government does not have the luxury of ignoring the law and riding rough-shod over people's rights, no matter how popular such action might appear to be in the short term.The Government did not decide to sit on its hands.  We could have indicated the legal obstacles were so great that nothing at all could be done but we took significant action within the law and the Constitution.  Although these pensions could not be removed, the Attorney General made clear that they could be reduced in a proportionate way after consultation with the relevant Members.  I consulted fully with all the pension holders affected last year and, in the light of the few comments, proposed the legislation to reduce the pensions of sitting members by 25%.  That was approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas at that stage.Numerous Fine Gael Deputies spoke in that debate and were very critical of the extent to which the Government had travelled already in this direction.  In the course of a very reflective debate, they objected strongly to the diminution of politics and the capacity of politics to attract people implicit in the measures being proposed by the Government at that stage.  The Government also proposed in the legislation to stop payment of these pensions to sitting former Ministers with effect from the next Dáil.  This was entirely in accordance with the legal advice.  Before the next election, any affected individual will have an opportunity to assess the new position and make a decision in the light of personal circumstances about any alternative pension arrangements to be made.Looking back at what the Government has actually done with ministerial pensions, I take this opportunity to say that I am very concerned about the nature and tone of the public debate we have witnessed on this issue.  I understand and accept that there is concern at a time when economic constraints are very severe but I hope I am not alone in thinking that much of the debate has been distasteful.  It has brought a new tone into our public life which I hope does not take root.  If it did, it is likely to have wider and very difficult consequences for our political and economic system.  In particular, there is a presumption that the political class exclusively is responsible for the current economic crisis and its resolution, and nobody else needs to make any contribution.  That idea should not be allowed take root.It is one thing to debate the rights and wrongs of policy about the economy, the budget, pensions, or any other issue of public importance, but it is another to single out individuals and pursue them until they are forced into a public announcement about giving up income to which they have a clear legal right, and which has already been reduced as part of a wider range of measures to deal with the budgetary crisis.  None of us has the right to treat others in this way.  As I said yesterday, I am not prepared to coerce people in the way some people have suggested.  I find it particularly distasteful when I think about the measures the Government has already taken to reduce pension costs, measures which were very widely accepted by Members of the Oireachtas.Why am I not prepared to engage in coercion?  Perhaps uniquely in this House, I am aware of the personal circumstances of some Members.  I accept many Members can freely and voluntarily yield their pensions and I welcome and applaud their decision to do so.  In all this, we must remember that a considerable number of former Ministers have already gifted or intend to gift their pensions to the Exchequer.  This is very commendable and I want to record the Government's gratitude for these significant and generous contributions.  It is also important to remind Dáil Éireann and the public that these gifts were being made privately and without any fanfare before the current controversy began.  Many individuals, including serving and former Ministers, wrote to me seeking no acknowledgement and issued no press statement on their pension entitlements.I make no apology for what the Government has done in this area.  The record I have set out shows clearly that we have moved decisively to deal with the economic and budgetary crisis, reduced the cost of running the Government and the Oireachtas and taken entirely reasonable and proportionate measures to reduce ministerial pensions paid to sitting Members.  I acknowledge the assistance given by the Fine Gael and Labour parties on the reform of Oireachtas expenses.  That was done through the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, whose proposals I approved.There is no need for the legislative measure proposed in the Private Members' motion.  We cannot proceed with such a measure.  The Oireachtas has already enacted reasonable and appropriate legislation to deal with the issue of ministerial pensions, which takes full account of the legal facts.  There is no need to propose further legislation to continue a debate which is intended to persuade the Government to coerce individuals to give up their pension rights, which have already been curtailed and which will be removed for sitting members in the next Dáil.  I commend the amendment to the motion to the House.
#JamesMcDaid	unknown-#JamesMcDaid-party	unknown-#JamesMcDaid-dob	unknown-#JamesMcDaid-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	398	A good friend of mine telephoned me at the end of a turbulent week last week and told me to give up the pension as there were only three of us left and the point had been made.  I was told I should not allow myself or my family to be dragged through the mire again.  Notwithstanding that advice, I later wondered if we had in politics come to the point where we should not rock the media boat.  If we have, it is a very sad reflection of what we have become, the prisoners of political correctness.The controversy last week posed the question of who exactly runs the country.  The answer is clearer now in that it is sections of the media.  As a consequence, as one week follows another, we as politicians are becoming more irrelevant.  The first caption on the "Six One" news last Tuesday, 27 April — I will not criticise it, as it was factual — was "Bowing To Pressure", as one by one my fellow colleagues from all sides of the House believed they needed to give up.  Later in the week, Joe Duffy reminded a caller, "Look, last Friday when we started this discussion there were 22, today there are only four".  As if Joe had pulled out his verbal pistol and shot us one by one.In issuing a statement last week, I understood that I would provoke considerable hatred and controversy.  I also understand that such controversy is felt by all Members of the House, in that the actions of individual politicians are frequently laid at the door of all politicians, even when there is no evidence to substantiate such vilification.  However, nothing I have stated regarding the remuneration of Members of the House is in any way at odds with the principles of parliamentary democracy.  Many on the Opposition benches also had strongly held principled views on this issue.  In fact, much of what I have stated goes to the heart of those principles and it is the duty of every Member of this House to uphold them, even when the tide of public opinion would have us do otherwise.I wish to remind the House of some of the history of the system of parliamentary democracy that we inherited from the British and that we take for granted today.  More than 150 years ago in 1838, six Members of the British Parliament, to which Irish MPs were elected and served, led by William Lovett of the London Working Men's Association, formed a committee and published the People's Charter.  This document became the basis for the Chartist movement, which ultimately led to the parliamentary reform that gives us the system of parliamentary democracy that we are familiar with today.  At the time of the publication of the charter, MPs in the House of Commons were not paid at all, which clearly discriminated in favour of wealthy landowners who were able to pursue active political careers without needing to worry about their livelihoods.  Accordingly, of the six demands included in the People's Charter, the fourth was that MPs be paid.  The precise wording of this demand was: "Payments of members, thus enabling an honest tradesman, working man, or other person, to serve a constituency, when taken from his business to attend to the interests of the Country".Much has changed since 1838 and no excuse should be offered for the abuse of the privileges afforded to elected politicians.  However, it is still the case that remuneration of public representatives must be set such that the wealthier Members of the House are not able to offer more generous representation to their constituents than Members from more modest backgrounds.  If this were the case, the House would undoubtedly be populated by the richest and most powerful members of our society, not citizens from every walk of Irish life, both rich and poor, which is the purpose for which it was intended.  It must count among its Members people like the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, who is a solicitor, the Tánaiste, Deputy Coughlan, a social worker, Deputy Kenny, a schoolteacher, Deputy Gilmore, a trade unionist, Deputy Ó Caoláin, a bank official, and Deputy Gormley, a language teacher.  It must count among its Members doctors, solicitors, accountants, farmers, engineers, community activists, tradesmen and tradeswomen, women who work in the home, men who work in the home, men and women who cannot find work and men and women of different creeds, colours and political persuasions.  In short, this House must represent every part of the Irish nation because if it does not, it can have no legitimacy or purpose.It is all but impossible to meet this challenge without somehow seeming conceited and arrogant, without provoking the anger of people who do not enjoy the same privileges as Members of this House, without insulting people who are weary of an economic crisis in which they played no part.  How can I, as a medical doctor who has earned a healthy salary all my life and enjoyed a Deputy's salary for more than 20 years, possibly claim that I am entitled to a top-up of €22,000 per year because I happened to hold the office of Minister in a previous Dáil?  The simple answer is that I cannot.  I am not deserving of a ministerial pension, nor do I need it, and if this debate can occur in a calm and rational way and it is the express wish of this House, I will happily forgo it.  However, this debate is not occurring in a calm and rational way.  It is being driven by a media-fuelled paranoia, where the sole aim is the sale of newspapers and advertising space, not the preservation of democratic principles.I knew that the reasoning behind my decision would attract vitriol from all quarters, as an angry people whipped into a frenzy by sections of the media were not going to listen to the views of any politician.  Angry people make bad decisions.  For example, go back to the beginning of Christianity when Pontius Pilate asked "Jesus or Barabus?".  Yes, Members of Dáil Éireann are well paid, but not because they work harder, are more qualified or are more deserving than other workers.  We are well paid because, believe it or not, we are elected to have legislative powers, powers that affect the lives of every citizen in the State, and because that power is sought by people who do not have the interests of the State at heart.  While reducing the income of Members of Dáil Éireann may provide some comfort to other workers who are experiencing economic hardship, I have tried to explain that changes to our remuneration on foot of media commentary can have consequences for the quality of our democracy in the long term.And so I ask, why just politicians?  In any legislation, one must provide that all public sector pensions must be revoked if that "retired" person has found other work within the public sector.  There are thousands of them across all disciplines, many of whom work within their own disciplines despite retirement.  Surely equality must prevail?  Otherwise, do the courts beckon?What are the principles of those who have created such rage, envy and hysteria?  Is it that nobody in receipt of a pension should continue to work?  Is it that nobody receiving a pension should be allowed to assist the State again with his or her expertise at a time of our greatest need?  Does this also mean that those holding public pensions cannot run for public office?  What happens if one was previously in the public service, retired and decided to go into politics?This brings me to the aforementioned certain sections of the media.  We in politics can all accept genuine criticisms.  In all of our professions, we have alcoholics, gamblers, corruption, infidelities and so forth.  There are no barrels with totally healthy apples.  Yet, in over 20 years, I have found that the great majority of people in this House are genuine people of integrity and principle.  The majority also come from modest backgrounds.  They have husbands, wives, partners, mothers and fathers, children, aunts and uncles, friends and neighbours.  The members of the Cabinet, of all Cabinets, are similar.  At times, they must make difficult, unpalatable decisions.  They arrive at these decisions in the best interest of our people in general, always in the knowledge that one cannot please all of them all of the time.We are not infallible and do make mistakes.  When we do, we should acknowledge them, but none of us is the ogre portrayed by certain sections of the print and audio media with banner headlines designed to ridicule and interviews and statements by politicians deliberately misinterpreted to fill print space, the innuendo deliberately just short of libel.  I do not have a broad sheet, a red top or a talk radio programme to counteract their misinterpretations as they falsely claim to represent the weakest members of society while wilfully undermining the very checks and balances that exist to protect the weak from the powerful and those of them who use slogans and headlines to advance their careers without regard for how this might affect our system of parliamentary democracy.These are the issues with which we must concern ourselves.  No Member of this House is immune from the reality of politics in which our lives are intrinsically linked to the vagaries of the ballot box, but there are certain times when we must disavow the ready appeal of populism and be prepared to place ourselves at odds with the people on whom we depend for our mandate.  This alone is my concern and the reason I sought, through the provocation of controversy, to have this matter debated in the House.Let us be clear on the issue.  What distinguishes us from the average worker is not what we do, but what we have the power to do, in that the 166 Members of this House and the Members of the Seanad are the only Irish citizens who have the power to legislate.  This power is of unparalleled importance, so much so that it is continually sought by people for whom there is no price they will not pay to render that power their own.  This is the threat to our democracy of which we must be constantly aware.  If we bow to the babble of populism at every turn, we will have failed in our duty to be so aware.  The will of the people is not expressed through so-called journalists, in opinion polls or on talk radio shows.  It is expressed through the secret ballot in free and fair elections.  We must place our trust in that system, which, if we protect it, will continue to serve us in the future.I wish to inform the House that — as some journalists and some people in Donegal are aware — I do not benefit personally from my pension.  It has been going to a worthy cause on a quarterly basis for quite some time.  I have with me my last six pension cheques which date from three or four months prior to the beginning of this controversy.  It should be noted that those who benefit from the money to which I refer do not have a vote.  I thank the House for allowing me to outline my position.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	401	For most people, a pension is something earned during one's working life which one then draws down in retirement.  One of the difficulties with the current debate is that ordinary people cannot understand how public representatives enjoy pensions when they have not even retired yet.  I do not believe that attacks are being made on pensions for politicians, per se.  Rather, members of the public are unhappy with the fact that those who are still serving politicians and whose salaries, when compared with those of ordinary workers, are significant are drawing down pensions.  People see such behaviour as inappropriate.This debate is taking place against the backdrop of horrendous economic difficulties.  In such circumstances, people are willing to play their part in getting the country back on an even keel but only if everyone contributes his or her fair share.  Burden-sharing must not only be fair, it must be seen to be fair.  In a recent newspaper article, the commentator David McWilliams referred to Ireland as a country divided into insiders and outsiders, namely, an inner circle of well-connected people and the rest.  He stated that insiders reap the profits when times are good and outsiders bear the brunt when times are bad.An important aspect of this debate revolves around the fact that the lowest paid public servants have endured a 5% reduction in pay and pensioners lost their Christmas bonus.  There are well over 400,000 people who are unemployed and a further 60,000 have emigrated in search of work.  We were all previously of the opinion that this pattern had come to an end.Every worker in the country is paying more tax and is aware that Fianna Fáil is busy planning the introduction of more charges, taxes and levies in order to pay for the economic ruin it has visited upon the country.  While the outsiders — the vast majority of people in Ireland — are feeling the pain of recession, it appears there is a golden circle of insiders, the members of which are jealously guarding their privileges.  Bank bosses complain about not being able to get by on a mere €500,000 per year, which is compensation for the service they believe they are doing the country.  Even though we bailed out the banks, they are of the view that they are doing us a favour and not the other way around.Mr. Fingleton, the former chief executive of Irish Nationwide Building Society, is holding on to his €1 million bonus for services rendered, namely, for losing more money in one year than the building society earned in profits during its entire existence.  Property tycoons retain their trophy houses, golf club memberships, private jets and perma-tans.  With the bankers and developers at the first two points, the toxic triangle is completed by Fianna Fáil politicians.It was interesting to listen to Deputy McDaid's robust cry from the heart in defence of privilege.  If we are all in this together, the burden of sacrifice must be seen to be borne equally.  Even though it can be painful in the context of people's personal circumstances, changes in expectations, reductions in income, etc. Deputies and Ministers who set out to be leaders must show leadership and must not allow the burden of leadership and sacrifice to fall on the shoulders of the least well paid members of the public service.The Minister's argument is that there is no legal remedy in respect of discontinuing these pensions.  We were all present when the various emergency measures to reduce public service salaries were taken.  The measures to which I refer were described as being in the interests of the public and as being necessary in the context of the economic emergency.  A degree of difference applies in respect of judges and former office holders who retain large perks.  The average industrial wage in this country is €35,000 or so.  If that is doubled, one arrives at a figure of €70,000.  It is inexplicable that people who are holding down well-paid jobs should also be paid pensions that are at, near or in excess of the amounts to which I refer.  It would be difficult to convince ordinary citizens that this is appropriate.A pension is part of a pay package.  If one signs up and contributes to one's pension, one has a right to it.  The concept of a pension is that it is designed to meet one's income needs when one is in retirement.  Members on all sides would defend that concept.  However, during the Celtic tiger years we lost the run of ourselves in more ways than one.  In light of our current circumstances, it offends people's sense of fair play and economic justice to see those who previously held office as Deputies, Ministers or European Commissioners and who are now earning large salaries in the private sector also drawing down huge State pensions.If someone becomes a Deputy at 30 years of age and holds his or her seat until he or she is 50, should arrangements be made in respect of his or her transition back into his or her former life?  Of course such arrangements should be made.  However, that is different from people drawing down pensions which are multiples of the average industrial wage and which are paid long before the normal retirement age.Such is the situation that has developed in Greece that the European Union, the ECB and the money markets are going to require that for a very long period Ireland should be subjected to tough fiscal discipline while the economy is brought back onto an even keel.  In that case, one must examine other areas in which the State has been over-generous and has over-provided, particularly to those who are not of pensionable age and who have other employments, salaries or emoluments.  If one seeks highly significant salary sacrifices from an ordinary garda, nurse or teacher or from an executive officer or clerical officer in the Civil Service, those who have the honour of being leaders by virtue of being one of the 166 Members of the Dáil should not be perceived to retain benefits that are unfair when compared with those of others within Irish society.  This is the net argument.

Sinn Féin fully supports legislation to end payments of ministerial pensions to representatives who are sitting in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, this issue is deeper and wider than it has been conveyed.  The pensions issue is merely the tip of the iceberg in a State in which who one knows still is more important than what one knows and can be of great financial benefit.  There are people in receipt of ministerial and Deputies' pensions who are serving on State boards at present, which is a matter on which I wish to reflect.  The issue of multiple pensions also has not been dealt with.  Sinn Féin firmly believes that pensions should be paid to retired Oireachtas Members who should be in receipt of a single adequate pension.Sinn Féin also contests that the wider issue of State pension provision must be dealt with more satisfactorily than has been the case to date.  This State still awards billions each year in private pension tax reliefs while continuing to allow tax-free lump sums to be withdrawn on receipt of the pension.  While some changes have been made, no one can deny that the State has lost billions in revenue because of its pensions arrangements for the wealthy in Irish society over the past few decades.  Sinn Féin also has an issue with the State's proposals to force people to invest in the private pension industry, which has performed dismally in recent years and may be likely to so do again.  However, these are issues for another day.Today, as I indicated, I wish to deal with the issue of State pensions for former Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The issue of ministerial and Deputies' pensions extends both to Members sitting in the Chamber tonight and to former politicians who have been appointed by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, as public interest directors in banks.  Their finances were set out recently and make for interesting reading.  I refer to the first and most notable of them, namely, the former Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes.  He receives €99,000 as a Government-appointed member of the board of Anglo Irish Bank and benefits from a combined ministerial and Deputy's pension of €99,470.  Former Labour Party leader and Tánaiste, Dick Spring, receives a ministerial pension of €77,000, as well as a Deputy's pension of €52,213, which is a combined total of almost €130,000.  This is in addition to his basic salary of €27,375 and €3,000 for every committee meeting he attends as public interest director at the partly State-owned AIB.  The former Minister for Agriculture and Food and Fianna Fáil Deputy, Joe Walsh, is paid €78,750 as a State-appointed non-executive director at Bank of Ireland and receives a ministerial and a Deputy's pension worth €127,000 in total.  In addition, the former European Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, receives a ministerial pension of €74,746 and a Deputy's pension of €52,000.  When added to his European Commission pension of €51,000, Mr. McCreevy's total pension package is worth €178,000 per year.  He also receives a step-down payment following his departure from Brussels that is worth a staggering €537,000 over the next three years.  The former Fianna Fáil MEP Eoin Ryan receives a ministerial pension of €5,909 and a Deputy's pension of €50,000.  This is in addition to the €131,000 salary he earns as the Government-appointed Irish representative on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.The outrageous point about this entire affair is that not one of those who came forward regarding their pension payments in recent weeks did so willingly, despite their attempts to salvage some kind of public relations image of which further examples have been seen this evening.  One should be in no mistake but that this State has been in recession for some years.  The bill for Oireachtas pensions amounts to approximately €12 million per annum.  There are Members of the Dáil who received hundreds of thousands of euro in salaries last year and who did not do a single thing to address their own heavy charge on the public finances while defending decisions to take money from the most vulnerable in our society.This issue goes to the heart of everything that is wrong in this society.  The crisis in the public finances did not arise in a vacuum.  Even during the decades of the alleged boom, sectors of society within this State were left abandoned.  In years of surplus, we still had a two-tier and wholly inadequate health service, as well an underfunded education system.  Sinn Féin still is the only party whose elected representatives take home only the average industrial wage and put the balance of their salaries and expenses into services for their constituents and campaigning work for their party.  Others in this Chamber were happy to pocket pay rises when the going was good and after things turned bad, they only acted when the public and the media shamed them into so doing.The heart of this recession does not lie with the social welfare pay bill, the spending in the health system or the minimum wage, which are issues that some voices from the Government side would try to impress on one.  It lies with Government failure to properly manage the economy.  When the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, now preach about all of us being obliged to tighten our belts, I wonder who they are trying to convince.  Is it the bankers and senior management in the private sector whose own personal excesses created wages bills for their businesses that now are clearly unsustainable?  Such calls were not directed at any such people but at those who lived last year on social welfare payments of €204 per week, before the Ministers saw fit to reduce the amount to €196 a week this year.  It is directed at those who are earning €8.65 per hour and who must learn to live on less because the Government and narrowly-focused big business leaders believe that the only way in which to build competitiveness is through slashing the wages bill and removing essential social supports, rather then through infrastructural development, universal broadband provision or a reduction in rents.The pensions issue placed a microscope on the very worst excesses of the men and women in this Chamber and their predecessors.  However, anyone can take a step back and see how broad is this problem.  It certainly is not confined to what Members have been addressing or what has been the focus of media attention recently.  There are still circles of people in this society, all of whom are interconnected because ultimately this is such a small place, which protect themselves no matter what.  They will emerge from this recession barely affected, as has been the case historically.  Occasionally, the media will raise an issue such as this one that brings to bear so much pressure on such circles that they are forced to take action to assuage public anger.  However, it is not enough and another head always grows on this monster.  People are disillusioned with politics in this State not because of this sole issue but because of the litany of incompetence and mé féinism that has pervaded the politics of this State over the decades.What is required is a new beginning to politics both in this State and across this island.  The old politics of cronyism, greed and partitionism must be discarded.  I am glad to support the motion tabled by Fine Gael this evening although it constitutes only one small step.  Accordingly, my final call in this debate is on the Minister of State to ensure that his Fianna Fáil colleagues accept the proposition put forward, accept the common sense and do not seek to hide behind a notion that they are not prepared to impose a new regime or to imply that it is in some way unconstitutional.  None of those aprons behind which voices from the Government side have sought to hide in recent days adequately covers their shame.  The Fine Gael motion before the House this evening, supported by the collective voices of the Opposition, is the essential step that must now be taken.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing my matter be raised on the Adjournment this evening.  I want to raise three points about the home help service in Ballyfermot and Inchicore, namely, the importance of the service to the local community, the effects of the proposed cuts on the elderly and the status of the employees, which is very unclear.  None of them know where they stand regarding their employment.  What will the forthcoming review of the service mean?  What will the cuts mean, especially for the elderly, and for the many people in home help services who care for the elderly?There has been major confusion among elderly people and the home help staff in Inchicore and Ballyfermot during the past few weeks.  There is continuing concern about the cuts in the service and the effect they will have on local communities.  A letter addressed to the clients and staff of the services was issued by the home help service on 26 March  stating that due to the cuts in funding imposed by the Health Service Executive, cuts would be made to the service on 6 April.  Naturally, that caused huge upset, confusion and concern.  Although the statement in this letter was later retracted, doubts remain over the service and its continued support through the HSE.I am concerned that the cuts to the service will mean a reduction in home help hours and services for elderly people who rely greatly on their home helps.  This service is invaluable for our elderly.  From a daily home-based task to providing simple companionship for a person who is on his or her own, home helps are a real lifeline to the many elderly in our community.  If their hours are cut, many vulnerable elderly people will be left alone and will be unable to do simple tasks for themselves such as washing, ironing or even making a cup of tea or taking their medication.  I know this from my experience of caring for my mother when she was very ill and the daily tasks I did to help her through her daily life.Workers in home help services are hard-working and work more than their allocated hours; on many occasions they return to check on many elderly people.  They often call to see the elderly people for whom they care in their free time to check that they are okay.  In many cases they have formed a real bond and this becomes a companionship.  Many lonely people find it a great help to have such company in the evening time.Home helps are not very well paid, as we all know, and they save the State money in the long run.  Hospitals in this city are overcrowded.  If home help hours are cut, many elderly people will have to leave their homes and communities and move to hospitals and nursing homes that are already overcrowded.  Is this really what we want?  With a little help, many elderly people can live a full life in the comfort of their own homes.  In this way they retain their independence and feel happy and secure in their familiar surroundings.More than 60 people are on the waiting list for a home help in Inchicore alone.  It does not make sense to anyone to cut this service, least of all for those people who are on the waiting list for a home help.  Home helps find themselves in a state of limbo.  On one hand, they are being told they work in a limited company, however, they recently had take a take a pay cut, and thus have had to pay for their gains under benchmarking, which indicates they are considered public sector workers.  If the service is funded by the HSE, why can the Minister of State  not confirm by whom home helps are employed?  Some people have been working in this service for 30 years and yet they do not have a contract or benefits.  An arrangement was signed by the HSE in 2007 but to date the employees have not received a contract.  They have heard that the service is to be privatised and understandably they are very concerned about this.I ask the Minister of State to clarify what will happen to the home help service in Inchicore and Ballyfermot and to its clients and staff.  We need to reassure the many elderly people living in Inchicore and Ballyfermot that they are not just a number but that they are cared for.  Not everyone can be a home help.  It takes a very special kind of person to be one, somebody who cares, understands and, above all, takes the time to sit and listen to the many elderly people in our communities on a daily basis.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I thank Deputy Byrne for raising this matter.  It provides me with an opportunity to update the House on Government policy on community services for older people.The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  Notwithstanding the significant overall economic pressures facing the country, we have continued to prioritise services for older people, as reflected in the additional funding of €10 million provided in the last budget to expand home care packages nationally.  These packages often contain a significant home-help component, at individual recipient level.In the HSE national service plan for 2010, approved by the Minister for Health and Children earlier this year, the HSE has undertaken to provide almost 12 million home help hours to 54,500 people, more than 5,000 home care packages to some 9,600 people, and 21,300 day care places, which we estimate cater for up to 80,000 people.  Between 2006 and 2010, an additional sum of more than €200 million was provided to the HSE to develop community based services for older people.Other important initiatives are also being undertaken at a strategic level.  Arising from an Evaluation of Home Care Packages, published by the Department of Health and Children in December last, the HSE established a task group to progress this year various improvements in home care provision, including the allocation of home help hours to clients.The Deputy will appreciate that all developments in the area of home care have to be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures.  The HSE has been asked to make a rigorous examination of how existing funding might be reconfigured or re-allocated to ensure maximum service provision is achieved.  This requires a stringent ongoing review of the application of the resources currently available.The HSE has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services.  It is therefore incumbent on the executive to review, as appropriate, the home help service in Inchicore-Ballyfermot in the context of overall service priorities for Dublin West or the wider region.  I understand that in 2009 the Inchicore-Ballyfermot Home Help Service received in the region of €2 million in funding.  As with most other organisations being funded by the HSE, this service was written to earlier this year and was requested to operate in a more efficient manner.  It is expected that after these efficiencies have been agreed, this home help service will provide in 2010 substantially the same level of service as heretofore.Unfortunately, due to the current industrial action, this is the most up-to-date information available to me.  I regret that I do not have any more information at present but if the Deputy wishes to raise this matter again once the current industrial action has ceased, I will have the matter re-examined.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I am glad the Minister has joined us because this is an important matter.  During a presentation made by the National Coalminers Group at a recent meeting of a joint committee two issues emerged.  One was that the occupational injuries benefit scheme is too restrictive a scheme for the miners; it does not address their needs because the list of prescribed illnesses is too tight.  For example, pneumoconiosus is acceptable but COPD — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — tinnitus and asthma are not.  As these are the main conditions suffered by the miners, the scheme is too restrictive for them.The other issue that emerged is the high variance of diagnosis between the experts.  A case study undertaken under Professor Fitzgerald at St. Vincent's Hospital diagnosed a person with disabilities of 80% whereas the Department of Social Protection's doctors or experts decided it was only 20%.  In today's money, that means a €750 per month loss to the miners.  In fact, one can say openly and clearly that the Department of Social Protection is discriminating against miners and is not capable of addressing their needs.The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources wants to wash its hands of this matter.  As a recent example, when I put down a Priority Question on the issue, the Ceann Comhairle's office ruled it out of order, stating the Minister had no responsibility in this matter.  The Minister has a serious responsibility because the licences are in his gift and, under the Mines and Quarries Act 1965, he has a duty of care to the people who work in quarries and mines to provide adequate ventilation and to protect them from overexposure to dust.That duty of care is not being exercised.  In fact, cowboys were allowed to operate the mines without due respect to the health and safety or general well-being of the miners.  The consequences have been dire.  The mortality rate of miners is much higher than that of the ordinary individual; they are dying at an alarming rate, with 50 deaths in the past year.What is the solution sought by the National Coalminers Group?  They want the establishment of a redress board, which would be of benefit not only to the miners but also to the State in that there would no admission of liability on the part of the State, it would be limited to a very limited group of approximately 350 claimants, including miners and their widows, it would be ring-fenced by terms of reference established by the State and a finite amount of compensation would be clearly identified for the 350 people.The most reasonable solution is to provide a lump sum to the miners because an increase in social welfare is no good to a dying man whereas a lump sum can at least improve his general well-being and economic situation.  That is what we ask of the Minister today.

It is time the Government established a redress board to provide compensation for the National Coalminers Group and acknowledge the contribution the miners have made to this country.  In my area of Arigna, which covers counties Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo, the survivors and widows have been forgotten.  I ask the Minister for Social Protection, with the Departments of Health and Children and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to come up with a package to acknowledge and recognise what these people have done.  They have been forgotten for far too long.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, to work with the various Departments to come up with some form of redress or compensation.

I thank the Deputies for raising the issue.  I am aware that the National Coalminers Group was in Leinster House today seeking to advance its campaign for a scheme of compensation in respect of the illnesses miners have acquired as a result of working in coalmines.  In this regard, I was pleased to facilitate my colleague, Deputy Aylward, in arranging for an official of my Department, together with officials from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of Health and Children, to meet earlier today with a delegation from the group to hear their concerns at first hand.As the Deputy will be aware, the primary role of my Department in regard to this issue relates to the provisions of the occupational injuries scheme and specifically to the disablement pension payable under that scheme.  The occupational injuries scheme is a compensation payment for loss of faculty arising out of or in the course of insurable employment.  The legislation governing the occupational injuries scheme provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where those persons have contracted that disease in the course of their employment.Employment under a contract of service as a miner is insurable for occupational injuries benefit under the Social Welfare Acts.  Miners who are unable to work due to an accident arising from their employment may be entitled to occupational injury benefit for the first 26 weeks of their claims.  If their incapacity extends beyond that period, they may receive illness benefit or invalidity pension, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions for these payments.Miners may be entitled to disablement benefit if they suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation that they contracted at work.  Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement, which is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with a person of the same age and gender.  Miners who contracted the prescribed disease pneumoconiosis are entitled to disablement benefit.  While I appreciate the position in which the miners concerned now find themselves, I am obliged to reiterate that a compensation package specifically for former miners would be outside the remit of the occupational injuries benefit scheme of my Department.The issue debated here has been the subject of several parliamentary inquiries from a number of Deputies and has been aired most recently at the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  In the course of that meeting and again at the meeting held with the group earlier today, it was argued that the list of prescribed diseases under the occupational injuries scheme should be extended, and reference was made in particular to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, in this regard.  My Department has considered whether COPD should be added to the list of prescribed diseases but has been advised that COPD is a common clinical condition and one of the leading causes of death after heart disease, cancer and stroke.  It is not a condition that is specifically linked to a particular occupation and it is not possible to establish a causal link between coal mining, or any other occupation, and the experience of COPD.   Smoking is by far the most common cause of COPD.

The Deputy will find reputable people with wildly differing views.My Department has been advised that no EU state, other than the UK, includes COPD in their schemes equivalent to the occupational injuries benefit scheme.  The position in the UK is that their equivalent of our occupational injuries benefit may be paid to coal miners who have worked underground for at least 20 years and who are diagnosed as having definite pneumoconiosis, with considerable lung function loss.  The effect of prescribing COPD or chronic bronchitis and emphysema, CBE, was not to confer entitlement to people who did not already qualify for the UK equivalent of occupational injuries benefit but, rather, to enable a higher rate of payment to be made to some sufferers in certain circumstances.In this country, the position is that where miners develop pneumoconiosis as a result of their occupation, then occupational injuries benefit is awarded.  Persons claiming occupational injuries benefit in cases of pneumoconiosis are referred to a consultant respiratory physician in the first instance for an examination and report.  This examination consists of a clinical assessment and pulmonary function testing.  The latter is a standardised test that will establish the extent of lung malfunction irrespective of the specific medical condition giving rise to that malfunction.  Disablement benefit is awarded on the basis of the consultant's objective report, including the pulmonary function test results.  If COPD is present in some of these cases, the disablement award will reflect this.  Given this background, it was concluded that it would not be appropriate to specify COPD for the purposes of occupational injuries benefit.Concerns were also expressed at perceived inconsistencies in the nature of the medical assessments undertaken of the medical conditions affecting the miners under the occupational injuries scheme.  I will ensure they are brought to the attention of the medical advisors in my Department.I also undertake to obtain a report of today's meeting.  As a Minister I have sympathy for anybody suffering from an occupational disease or injury, where this can be established.  The reality is however that one cannot allow a situation to develop whereby, for example, people with the same condition as a result of smoking, could also make a claim of occupational injury.  Therein lies the challenge.  I will seek a detailed report of today's meeting.  This is not a simple issue but I will treat it with the utmost seriousness.  I must stress that the situation is as outlined this evening and will remain so.  I will undertake to obtain a full report of what was said at today's meeting to see if anything therein might make a difference.

Our countryside is full of household rubbish.  We have all witnessed an increase in the indiscriminate dumping of rubbish along our roadsides.  As I speak tonight, there are people loading up their cars and vans with refuse sacks full of rubbish and intent on driving out to quiet country roads to throw them and other rubbish into the ditches.  I have witnessed this being done at the back of my own house.  Televisions, kitchen units, shelves, bottles, old waste paper, clothing, baskets, paper and so on are being dumped.  Not only is this dumping of rubbish ugly but it gathers rats and other vermin, which then become a problem.  Perishable items and food are also being dumped.The recession, the high costs of rubbish collection and the imposition of recycling charges are all cited as reasons for the increase in dumping.  Fáilte Ireland claims that the litter problem poses a serious threat to the credibility of our clean, green image as a tourist destination .  The Irish Business Against Litter Association last week published a new survey which identified several key routes, including main access routes to our airports and seaports, which are blighted with large amounts of litter.  The survey described the road into Dublin Airport as “an appalling sight” and claimed that the amount of casual litter on the M1 from Dublin Port is a complete eye sore.  This is also happening in my own constituency.  The N18, northbound and southbound, from Shannon Airport also came up for mention and was described as “heavily littered”.  It was pointed out to me in recent days that people are driving along the N18 and when they find a quiet spot, are pulling in and throwing bags of rubbish over the embankment.  This is particularly prevalent on a number of roads parallel to the N18 in the Newmarket-on-Fergus area.Many voluntary groups and tidy towns committees are doing Trojan work in our towns and villages battling against the scourge of litter.  Many people take great pride in keeping their communities clean and are to be complimented on this.  There has been a marked improvement in our urban areas.  It is the main roads in and out of our urban areas that are a big problem now.  The indiscriminate dumping of litter at Ballyalla Lake, a scenic area outside the capital town of Ennis, has become a big problem in recent times.  This is an area where the people of Ennis go with their children to have a picnic or for a walk.  A very successful Facebook campaign has been set up to highlight the problem and a Clean up Day has been organised for next Sunday.  I wish the organises well in that regard.Voluntary effort alone is not enough to deal with this litter crisis.  There is a huge cost involved in waste enforcement.  For example, the N18 dual carriageway-motorway from Ennis to Limerick was highlighted as a black spot for litter.  There is huge cost involved in removing this litter owing to safety issues and the necessity to have traffic management arrangements in place before local authority staff can do their job.  Clare County Council say that this can cost up to €1,000 per day.  The allocation received this year by Clare County Council under the national roads maintenance programme has been significantly cut this year, down by €157,987 as compared to 2009.The big problem facing many local authorities in terms of waste enforcement is that when a person dumps plastic bags of rubbish on private property, it is the owner of that property who, under section 5 of the Waste Management Acts, 1996-2008, is defined as the "holder".  For example, where rubbish is dumped on a farmer's land, he or she is deemed to be "in possession" of this rubbish. Under current law, if the local authority is informed of illegal dumping of this nature, it will not remove the rubbish leaving the onus on the landowner to do so.  This section must be amended to take the responsibility away from the person whose land or property has been littered.  I appeal to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to act on this matter.  I am disappointed the Minister is not here tonight.  However, it is hoped the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, will have some good news in regard to the dumping of litter which I am sure is also happening in her homeland of Kildare.Educating people to take pride in a cleaner environment is key to stamping out this practice.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, recently announced that €1.5 million will be provided over the next three years to support cleaning of key scenic, rural and visitor areas during the peak tourist season from May to September.  While this is very important, keeping our areas clear of rubbish should be an all-year activity.  I appeal tonight to the Minister to amend the necessary legislation to assist local authorities in their efforts to stamp out this increased level of illegal dumping in our counties.  It is destroying our countryside and is causing severe problems.  It is unsightly and is putting tourists off.  I hope that the Government, in conjunction with the local authorities, will put in place an active campaign to stamp out this increasing problem.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.I thank Deputy Breen for raising this important issue.  The Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009, rather than the Waste Management Acts, provide the statutory framework for combating litter.  Under the Litter Pollution Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering must come from local authorities.  The role of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is to provide the legislative framework within which local authorities can perform this task.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean up actions in relation to litter, taking account of local circumstances and priorities.  Furthermore, while legislative responsibility for the clean up of litter on our streets lies with the local authorities, primary responsibility for keeping our country free of litter must ultimately lie with each citizen of the State.Maximum penalties attaching to littering offences are substantial.  In addition to an on-the-spot fine of €150, the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 introduced conviction on indictment for litter offences, with a maximum fine of €130,000 and a maximum fine for summary conviction of €3,000.  The 2003 Act also gives local authorities the power to make by-laws in respect of a range of specific litter issues.  However, it is recognised that legislative measures alone will not solve the problem and that a multifaceted approach is required, involving all elements of Irish society and incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education.  The Minister recently announced the provision of €1.5 million over a three year period specifically to assist local authorities in keeping key tourist areas free of litter during the peak summer season.  This is merely the start of a campaign in which the Department will engage with the Environmental Protection Agency, local authorities, the National Roads Authority and the public.The Minister is also continuing to provide local authorities with funding to assist in raising awareness of the environmental and economic consequences of littering and graffiti.  A total of €1 million has been allocated to local authorities under the anti-litter and anti-graffiti awareness grant scheme 2010.  The Department also provides significant funding to several anti-litter initiatives currently in operation, including, National Spring Clean, the Green Schools Programme, Irish Business Against Litter, IBAL Litter League, Tidy Towns and Protection of the Uplands and Rural Environments, PURE, project.Much progress has been made in dealing with litter pollution.  The 2009 National Litter Pollution Monitoring System Report, to be published by the Department shortly, will show a continuing improvement in litter levels across the country.  The recent Irish Business Against Litter results also point to a steady improvement in litter levels in recent years, with 65% of towns surveyed in 2009 deemed to be "clean to European norms", as compared to 14% of towns in 2002.  However, there is no room for complacency.  The Government will continue to ensure that targeted, energetic anti-litter responses are developed as required.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	417	There is an ongoing issue at St. Eunan's College.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coghlan, is very well aware of it and her predecessor, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, met the previous principal a couple of years ago.  The matter is very much on the Government's table and I want to put on the record that as a result of Opposition pressure the Government is standing up with open ears.  However, while listening is an important aspect of any process, delivery is the most important.St. Eunan's College has capacity for 500 students but 900 boys study there with an additional seven rented prefabricated classrooms.  There is an obvious question mark over this rental, in terms of taxpayers' interest in value for money.  A total of 900 boys study at the college, 115 of whom will sit their leaving certificate examinations in June.  The number of boys enrolled for next September is 180 and there is a capacity issue, as the declarations of interest that a further 180 boys will enroll in September 2011 puts much pressure on a college that already finds it difficult to pass health and safety aspects, never mind accommodating the need that exists.The college is in a demographic area designated as 1.1, an area of rapid expansion.  The 2006 census showed the population of the wider Letterkenny area increased in size by 89%.  The project is at planning stage 2(a), which was submitted to the Department of Education and Skills at the beginning of April.  Questions relating to the overall cost of the project are with McGinley, Doherty & Deery Architects.While the prefabs ease the pressure for academic needs, they do not meet the practical learning, extra-curricular, sanitary and health and safety needs.  The school has insufficient science labs, toilets and canteen areas and the stairs and corridors are too narrow for 900 boys and a large staff.  The role of the Minister and the Government is facilitation and in this instance, this means allowing students learn and teachers teach.  Teachers cannot teach in the current environment and students are being held back.In November 2009, the then Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, stated that in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department it would not be possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project.  The school and its community understand that a process involving various stages of planning permission, tendering and construction will take time.  We do not expect the school to be built by September but we need an indicative timeframe from the Minister on when it will be built.  Will it take two or three years?  The school, the board of management, the teachers and the principal are owed that information to make their management decisions and preparations.We have to be careful because an announcement on further prefabs has been made.  This cannot be used as a short-term measure.  The only reason the school has to get these prefabs is because of health and safety concerns.  They should not be used as a filibuster in the short term.  We need to consider the medium to long term.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I will take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Coghlan.  I thank Deputy Joe McHugh for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position on St. Eunan's College, Letterkenny, County Donegal.At the outset I want to say that modernising facilities in our existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.The allocation of funding for school buildings in 2010 is a little under €579 million.  This represents a significant investment in the schools building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the Government's commitment to investing in school infrastructure and it will permit the continuation of the Department's programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools.All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings and site capacity leading to an appropriate accommodation solution.As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.The brief for the project at St. Eunan's College is the provision of a new school of 7,444 sq. m on the existing site to cater for a long term projected enrolment of 900 pupils.  Accommodation to be provided will include 29 general classrooms, a full suite of specialist subject rooms including home economics, construction studies, technical graphics, four science laboratories, art and craft rooms, a music and drama area, computer rooms, ancillary accommodation and a PE facility of 798 sq. m.The project has been assigned a priority band rating of 1.1 under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  As the Deputy stated, the project is currently at stage 2(a), which is developed sketch scheme.  The stage 2(a) submission, which was received in March of this year, has been examined by the Department and detailed technical comments issued to the board of management and its design team on the 30 April.  A revised stage 2(a) submission has been requested by the Department to address the issues raised.The progression of all large-scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget.  The project to provide a new school for St. Eunan's College will continue to be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme for 2011 and subsequent years.  In the meantime, the Department has recently issued approval for the rental of four 49 sq. m prefabs to alleviate the immediate accommodation needs of the school.  The school is now seeking quotes for this accommodation.I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the current position regarding the school building project for St. Eunan's College.

Decisions on the successful Smarter Travel Areas applications will be made in June.  The category of "Other Projects" includes the following:€7 million for the Dublin Portobello to Fairview cycle route,€2.8 million for the mapping of the route of the National Cycle Network and initial works on a first segment Dublin to Galway,€2 million for a walking and cycling route at Adamstown,€1.1 million for the Galway Fisheries Field walking and cycling route,€500,000 for the Carrigaline walking and cycling network,€500,000 for Workplace Travel Planning initiatives, which the National Transport Authority is carrying out on behalf of the Department,€400,000 for Bike Week in June 13 to 20,€200,000 for the Tralee to Fenit walking and cycling route, and€194,000 for the Passage West to Rochestown cycle route.Much of the expenditure at this early stage in the Smarter Travel Programme is targeted at changing culture, behaviour and the way we look at travel and mobility.  My immediate focus is on supporting a range of pilot and demonstration projects to show people what works, developing a cycling and walking culture, and working with partners particularly Local Authorities and other agencies.

The contract, which is to run to 2023, makes provision for the operation of 4 bases, of which Waterford is one, on a full time day and night basis.  This is the final outcome of a process and does not reflect a change of mind.The actual choice of helicopter is a matter for the private operator. I expect that one will be new and others will have been in service from 2007.This investment is a major advancement for search and rescue in Ireland at a time of serious budgetary constraints. The new contract will represent a stepped improvement in the capacity, range, speed and capability of Ireland's SAR service.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	422	I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 62 and 82 together.EU Transport Ministers have met twice in extraordinary meetings of the Council to discuss the recent air travel crisis caused by the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud.The second extraordinary Council meeting was held yesterday in Brussels and the issue of financial aid for the industry was discussed. Commissioner Kallas recently published his preliminary estimate of the financial impact of the crisis on the European economy which was in the order of €2.5bn.  The International Air Transport Association has estimated that the crisis cost airlines more than €1.7bn globally in lost revenue.During yesterday's discussions, Commissioner Kallas confirmed that Member States could implement measures in favour of the industry that do not constitute state aid and that Member States would be allowed to provide financial aid to airlines provided that, where such support takes the form of State Aid, it is granted on the basis of uniform criteria established at European level, so as not to distort the market.I have already indicated publicly that Ireland is not in a position to provide financial aid to the industry because of the state of the public finances.  My priority, therefore, is to ensure that effective criteria for the grant of such aid are developed so as to ensure that any aid that may be granted by other Member States does not distort the internal market.With regard to the Government Taskforce on Emergency Planning, my Department activated the Taskforce on the afternoon of the 15th April as the scale and implications of the eruptions became apparent over the earlier course of that day.I am satisfied with the means by which the Task Force performed its duties and particularly the effective way in which it co-ordinated the response by all agencies to the unfolding events. It also played a crucial role in ensuring that up-to-date information was available to the Government, the public and the media at all times.

I expect this report to be completed by late Summer 2010.  A list of projects can be found in NRA Programme Status 2010 appended to the NRA 2009 Annual Report or on its website.

Iarnród Éireann's InterCity journey times are a function of the line-speed, the maximum speed that the rolling stock is capable of, the number of intermediate station stops enroute and the number of temporary or permanent speed restrictions at locations on the line of route.Transport 21 does not provide for the development of high-speed rail services on the intercity network. As work is undertaken on a successor to Transport 21 the feasibility of various projects that were not included in Transport 21, including the development of high-speed intercity services, will be considered, taking account of the commitment in the Renewed Programme for Government to conduct a feasibility study for high speed rail services on the Dublin-Belfast corridor.

The application of special speed limits through the making of special speed limit bye-laws is a matter for local authorities.  In setting a special speed limit, a local authority must assess various factors with the primary focus being on road safety.  It is, quite appropriately, a matter for the local authority to assess the various local factors at play in setting a special speed limit.Work on the comprehensive review and updating of the Traffic Signs Manual is continuing.  I understand that the content of the Manual is expected to be finalised during the second quarter of this year.  Amendments to the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations and the Road Traffic (Signs) Regulations will then be required to underpin new provisions in the Manual.

The current funding environment is very difficult and it will not be possible to progress all the projects in Transport 21 in accordance with the ambitious timescale envisioned at its launch.Despite this, I am seeking to progress planning of the Western Rail Corridor Phases 2 and 3, to ensure that Iarnród Eireann will be in a position to move speedily to construction at the earliest possible date once financial circumstances permit.  The section of the line from Claremorris to Collooney is currently being preserved under the Clár Programme and Iarnród Eireann will look again at its reopening when Phases 2 and 3 are completed.

The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.The priorities for the national roads investment programme, after the completion of the major inter-urban network in 2010, will be the Atlantic Road Corridor and the improvement of other key strategic routes.The position in relation to the Leinster Orbital Route remains unchanged.  Neither Transport 21 nor the current National Development Plan provided any funding for the construction of this project.With regard to Public Private Partnerships, the NRA has raised over €2 billion to date in private sector funding for nine toll-based PPP projects and has been authorised to raise a further €1 billion in private investment through unitary payment-based (i.e. non-tolled) PPPs. Procurement is currently underway on three new PPP projects: the N17/N18 Gort-Tuam, the N11 Arklow/Rathnew (including N7 Newlands Cross Junction Upgrade), and the M11 Gorey to Enniscorthy/N25 New Ross Bypass.  Proposals are being advanced for further PPPs on the Cork/Limerick element of the Atlantic Road Corridor.In line with the undertaking in the Renewed Programme for Government, I have already asked the National Roads Authority (NRA) to review the completion dates and appropriate road design standards of roads projects at the design, or earlier, stage of development, in the light of the economic circumstances, falling road usage and climate change.   I expect this report to be completed by late Summer 2010.In relation to regional and local roads, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  The carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.From 1st September 2009, the National Roads Authority was tasked to undertake the administration of the Regional and Local Roads Investment Programme on behalf of my Department.  The National Roads Authority recommends grant allocations for regional and local roads, which are subject to final approval by me.In the current economic climate, the priority is to protect the existing network, particularly the massive €6 billion Exchequer investment in it since 1997.  Increased grant assistance is being provided in 2010 for the maintenance and rehabilitation of road pavements and particularly to address the impact of the severe weather late last year and earlier in the year, with a corresponding reduction in grant allocations for major new road schemes and for major realignment schemes.A comprehensive study into the condition of pavements on regional and local roads was carried out in 1996 and a second national study was completed in 2005.A detailed assessment of the condition of regional roads will be undertaken in 2010.  The outcome of this will influence funding decisions in future years.

The redesign, which will commence in July 2010 and proceed on a phased basis at two to three month intervals,  will deliver real and tangible benefits to the vast majority of bus users.  These benefits include:improved traffic flow in the city centre;a doubling of the number of services with a frequency of 10 minutes or better;60% of customers will be served by high frequency services as opposed to 23% at present;a reduced layover of buses in the city centre resulting in improved traffic flows and an enhanced city centre environment;increased interchange opportunities with DART, heavy and light rail; andmore cross city services.The redesigned network will be supported by complimentary measures such as Integrated Ticketing and Real Time Passenger Information.These measures will result in the provision of high quality and efficient public bus service and reflect the commitment of the company to deliver better services at better value to the customer and taxpayer.

A progressive approach is being adopted to allow customers to familiarise themselves with using the new system and to permit transport operators to undertake the necessary testing with the integration of the technologies involved. The project is now firmly in the implementation phase and extensive testing of elements of the system is already underway.Subject to successful completion of the testing that is currently underway, Dublin Bus and Luas annual pass-holders will be migrated to integrated smart cards from late Summer.  This will be followed in the Autumn by similar testing for ePurse (pay-as-you-go) users of Dublin Bus and Luas services. The pay-as-you-go system will be fully launched when this function is sufficiently robust. When this system goes live, it will facilitate cashless travel on services of participating operators.The integrated smart card will subsequently be rolled out to cover services provided by private operators, Irish Rail (DART and commuter rail) and Bus Éireann following completion of the necessary development, testing and commissioning of their systems. Testing and roll-out for these service providers will commence in early 2011.The overall capital budget for the integrated ticketing project is €55.4 million. This expenditure encompasses project management, design and development costs and operator contributions for the development of the single smart card. The operating costs will be borne by the transport operators and will not be met by the Exchequer.In a project involving numerous organisations, and where there are many business and technical complexities, there are and will continue to be difficulties that will pose challenges to all participants in delivering on the agreed programme. This has also been the experience internationally. The experience to date is that the Project Board, which is responsible for the successful delivery of the integrated ticketing system, is working well and in a manner that allows them to meet these challenges as they arise.

For local and regional roads, the default speed limit is set at 80 kilometres per hour.  This can only be changed on a permanent basis by county and city councils through the making of special speed limit bye-laws.  Section 9 of the 2004 Act sets out the range of special speed limits that may be applied by local authorities through bye-laws.  Following the metrication of speed limits in 2005, guidance issued to Local Authorities from the then Minister on the setting of these special speed limits. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide advice and guidance to Local Authorities in relation to the making of special speed limit bye-laws by county and city councils. These Guidelines set out principles to guide local authorities in setting speed limits with the intention of contributing to the establishment of uniform and standard application of appropriate speed limits on a country-wide basis. Revised Guidelines issued to Local Authorities in December 2008.The legislation underpinning both the default speed limits and the range of special speed limits is kept under review by my Department on an ongoing basis.The Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 sets out two related actions (a) to prepare and publish technical/engineering guidance for the setting of speed limits generally and (b) for local authorities to audit and report on the appropriateness and consistency of speed limits every two years. Work on these actions is now in hand within my Department.

The National Transport Authority is at an advanced stage in the preparation of new licensing guidelines required under the 2009 Act.  I expect the new licensing regime, including a substantial penalty regime for unlicensed services, to be in place during 2010.The Department referred the investigation of three unlicensed operators to the Gardaí in recent years.  An operator was prosecuted in 2006 and the Gardaí recently brought a prosecution against another operator. The matter was decided before Galway District Court on 28 April 2010.  The operation of one other unlicensed operator is still with the Gardaí.In accordance with the requirements of the Road Transport Act 1932, my Department considered an application for an express Dublin to Galway bus service from Citylink.  A licence for such a service was recently granted having regard to the public interest.In March 2008, while on route to represent the Government for St. Patrick's Day in Australia. I had a meeting with Irish City Link Comfort Delgro Limited who own the "Citylink" network in Ireland.

It is also working on eliminating unnecessary duplication of services, creating even headways to improve reliability and reduce the potential for "bunching" of services.Dublin Bus has commenced the roll out of its Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) System and full implementation on the Dublin Bus fleet is expected to be completed towards the end of 2010.  The information from the AVL System will be used on the Real Time Passenger Information units which are being procured and managed by Dublin City Council.Prior to installation of on street signage this year Dublin Bus will commence provision of Real Time Passenger Information on the Internet and on mobile phones.In the case of Bus Éireann the Deloitte report concluded that the scope for cost savings is limited as the current network design and schedules are largely efficient.  In line with the recommendations of the report Bus Éireann is engaged with Pobal, the HSE, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Department of Education and my Department in co-ordinating the better integration of various services provided by Bus Éireann, the Rural Transport programme and the HSE.  Pilot projects currently underway will be evaluated with a view to mainstreaming across the country. Bus Éireann has also expanded the use of double deck buses and coaches and have undertaken a "Use the Bus" type marketing campaign to increase passenger carryings.It is a matter for the bus companies themselves in conjunction with the National Transport Authority to decide on the level of buses maintained in their fleets.

The duties of the three Government appointed directors derive from the Companies Acts and, as such, the directors are obliged to pursue the best interests of the company. Subject to that duty, the three Government appointed directors are requested to seek to ensure that all decisions of the company that have significant implications for wider Government, aviation or regional development policies are considered at board level. In any such decisions they are directed to seek to reconcile commercial and public policy objectives.

A return to previous inappropriate forms of regulation that did not best meet the needs of taxi users and the wider industry is not an option.

I note that falling passenger numbers caused by the recession led to DAA's  Gross Profit reducing by 10% on the previous year. DAA's Group Profit excluding exceptional items in 2009 was €38m as compared to €78m in 2008.Despite the 2009 results, I welcome the continuing efforts by the company to achieve efficiencies in the current difficult market conditions. The success of the company's cost recovery programme reflects well on the contribution that employees can make to DAA's financial performance and to enhancing its ability to operate the airports more efficiently in the future.In line with normal shareholder contacts, I will be meeting with the board and management of the company in the coming weeks to discuss strategic issues and the company's plans for the future.  In this regard I note the DAA Chairman's statement in the 2009 Annual Report as follows: "However, for an airport operator with a strategic vision, it is essential to recognise that the current recession, which has had a significant impact on the passenger numbers, will end. The long-term traffic pattern for air traffic shows that in the wake of every economic or geopolitical shock, there is a subsequent return to significant growth."

While the flight cancellations and delays which occurred during the recent volcanic ash crisis were the result of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the airlines, the Regulation is quite clear that the airlines nonetheless have an obligation to provide certain types of care and assistance as set out in the Regulation.The Regulation has direct application in Member States and the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) has been designated as the National Enforcement Body for the Regulation in the State.  The CAR is the competent body to enforce the provisions of the Regulation arising from cancellations due to depart from Ireland; for travellers whose cancelled flights were due to depart from other Member States, the relevant national enforcement body will be the body designated by that Member State.Passengers must apply to their airline in the first instance to claim their entitlements.  If airlines do not comply with the law and passengers fail to receive their entitlements, the relevant national enforcement body can then take enforcement action. The list of all EU national enforcement bodies is available on the CAR's website www.aviationregulation.ie along with all other relevant information on the provisions of the Regulation.  The CAR was represented on the Government Task Force on the crisis and was very proactive in informing the public of their rights under this legislation.I have no plans to develop an air passenger fund.  The existing EU Regulation provides comprehensive consumer protection for air passengers.

The company is implementing a wide-ranging cost recovery plan to ensure its financial viability.  In this context, I understand the company is considering the suspension of services on the Waterford-Rosslare line.This line, on which one train operates each way daily, has experienced low patronage for many years with approximately 25 passengers each way per day. I understand that revenue covers only 2% of operating costs and each passenger is being subvented by the State at a cost of nearly €80,000 per annum to travel by rail.  Iarnród Éireann has examined an alternative strategy of increasing the service to three rail trips per day.  However, even with an average load factor of 42% amounting to approximately 250 journeys each way, the route would still lose €1.9m per annum.Decisions in regard to services such as those on the Waterford-Rosslare route and their links with other railway routes and services are a matter for larnród Éireann having regard to the resources available to it.I understand that larnród Éireann has surveyed customers on the route in terms of origin and destination and is examining possible alternative services, which could be provided to customers on the route. I also understand that it is exploring with interested parties the possibility of establishing a heritage railway on the route, which would be of benefit to tourism in the area.

The contract, which is to run until 2023 makes provision for the operation of the 4 existing bases, on a full time day and night basis.This investment is a major advancement for search and rescue in Ireland at a time of serious budgetary constraints. The new contract will represent a stepped improvement in the capacity, range, speed and capability of Ireland's SAR service.In short the new helicopters are equipped to fly to the scene of a mission faster, find the vessels or persons in the water more efficiently using better search, surveillance and tracking tools, winch them to safety more quickly, provide better medical facilities onboard and return them to safety in the shortest possible time.

I am prepared to introduce any appropriate measures which will bring about an improvement in this situation.Actions 72, 73 and 74 of the Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 relate to the introduction of a Graduated Driver Licensing System (GDLS), and the Strategy outlines a range of measures to be considered in relation to the GDLS.  The aim of a GDLS is to improve driver learning and reduce accidents involving learner drivers.The Road Safety Authority (RSA) undertook a consultation process on a GDLS in 2009, which contained a number of possible measures. The RSA has considered the responses from the public and interested bodies and has recently submitted its recommendations to my Department. Those recommendations are being considered carefully within my Department at present.Issues relating to Garda enforcement of traffic regulations are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

While the Framework does not specifically cover volcanoes and earthquakes it is designed to be sufficiently flexible to enable an appropriate response to all emergency situations.Emergency planning in this country is developed on the ‘lead department' principle. This means that each department is responsible for planning for emergencies that fall within its area of responsibility and for activating its emergency plans and procedures when so required. These plans and procedures include arrangements for keeping the public informed and up-to-date.In relation to the volcanic eruptions, my Department activated the Government Taskforce on Emergency Planning on the afternoon of the 15th April as the scale and implications of the eruptions became apparent over the earlier course of that day.The role of the Taskforce was to review all the latest information regarding the volcanic ash cloud and provide advice to the Government on the most appropriate measures to be taken. The Taskforce also ensured that all actions were taken by the appropriate authorities in a co-ordinated way and that up-to-date information and advice was provided to the media and to the public in a timely manner.While the Taskforce stepped down on Tuesday 27th April 2010, the various Departments and agencies will continue to monitor the situation in the coming months.

Currently there are nine operators operating from six ports to the United Kingdom and France with an average of sixty return sailings per day and a total passenger capacity of 20,669 passengers.It is estimated an additional 62,000 passengers were carried through Irish ports when air travel services were suspended for six days in the aftermath of the recent volcanic eruption in Iceland. This resulted in a 300% increase in the demand for ferry passenger services over normal demand at this time of the year.The Irish Maritime Development Office are currently undertaking a modelling exercise which will provide further information of the total potential available passenger capacity at any point in the year should such an event re-occur.The Dublin Port Study carried out by my Department under the NDP was published in August 2009. It provides the most recent analysis of future traffic and capacity projections at our commercial seaports.The study highlighted the need to develop significant additional port capacity by 2025-2030. Such is the nature of the expected future demand, the capacity required will necessitate the provision of significant developments, such as that envisaged at Dublin or Bremore, in addition to other projects around the State.Drogheda Port Company, together with its private sector partners, continue to progress their plans to construct a new deepwater port in the Bremore area. However, a planning application has yet to be made.A review of the 2005 Ports Policy Statement will commence later this year. This will provide an opportunity for all stakeholders to comment on the medium to long-term capacity challenges faced by the sector.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I am informed by the Office of the Attorney General that the modus operandi as to representation of the public interest at the Moriarty Tribunal is that there is no standing counsel appointed to represent the public interest at the public hearings of the Tribunal.  Rather, the position is that, as and when a public interest issue arises, and when the Tribunal, having identified particular points of law in the public interest, seeks to be addressed on public interest issues, the Tribunal writes to the Attorney General of the day seeking argument or submissions to the Tribunal on the issue at hand.  This procedure has been adopted in order to keep legal costs to a minimum.  It should be pointed out, of course, that the Tribunal itself has a public interest function and must at all times act in the public interest.When the need arises for the Tribunal to address a public interest issue, counsel for the public interest is appointed for the purpose by the Attorney General and makes such arguments and submissions as are needed. Such counsel will be different from counsel representing the Office's client Government Departments and will, of course, be representing the public interest and free to make arguments on its behalf, including, if appropriate, arguments different from those (if any) being made by counsel acting for client Departments.Senior Counsel (and junior counsel where necessary) appointed by the Attorney General at the invitation of the Tribunal to address and / or prepare written submissions to the Tribunal since its inception were Mr Frank Clarke SC and Ms Emily Egan BL from 1998 to 2004/5 and Mr Michael McGrath SC and Mr Brian Kennedy BL 2005 to date.Within the Attorney General's Office, the arrangements in place have always been that a Tribunal public interest issue, when one arises, is handled by an Advisory Counsel different from the Advisory Counsel assigned to representation of client Government Departments and there is strict demarcation between them.  However, the Tribunal interacts directly only with counsel for the public interest and the (separate) solicitor appointed for that purpose in the Chief State Solicitor's Office.I would add for the Deputy's information that oral submissions made by counsel for the public interest at an early public hearing of the Tribunal indicated that it was appropriate for the public interest to be involved in the Tribunal:(a) where an issue relating to the Constitution might be raised, and the Attorney General considered it appropriate that the public interest be separately represented;(b) where a dispute might arise about the terms of reference of the Tribunal, or the words of the resolutions giving effect to the establishment of the Tribunal; or(c) where there might be a dispute relating to the powers of the Tribunal, or the interpretation of the relevant legislation under which it operates.In making these submissions, counsel for the public interest made clear that it was the Attorney General's view that it was not appropriate for the public interest to be involved in the facts into which the Tribunal has to inquire itself.

The Department operates a forum for this purpose through the IFSC Clearing House Group, which first met in October 1993, and through a series of specialised Working Groups in the areas of Banking & Treasury, Insurance, Funds and Pensions. There is also a specialist Task Force on Asset Management.The IFSC Clearing House Group (CHG) identifies and considers issues of major concern to the long-term development of the international financial services industry in Ireland, including the strategic development of new business areas and opportunities, the progress of relevant legislation, both domestic and European, consideration of regulatory issues, the provision of relevant industry skills and the appropriate marketing of the industry.Membership of the Clearing House Group includes senior public sector and industry representatives together with the Chairs of the respective Working Groups and Task Force and is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach. The other Working Groups and Task Force are chaired by industry representatives. The duration of the membership of the CHG and the other Working Groups and Task Force is approximately three years.Industry members of the Clearing House Group since 2002 have been appointed by an agreed nominating process which is coordinated between my Department and Financial Services Ireland (FSI), which is a sector organisation within IBEC.  The industry members are nominated by FSI through this process which aims to ensure that all sectors of the international financial services industry are represented.The Chair of the Dublin International Insurance and Management Association (DIMA) and the Chief Executive of the Irish Stock Exchange are also members of the Group.  My Department does not have a role in the nominating of industry nominees to the CHG.In addition, the Chairpersons of the other IFSC Working Groups and Task Force all serve as members of the Clearing House Group for the duration of their tenure as Chairs of the particular Groups.Among the various initiatives undertaken by the CHG was the publication of the strategy document " Building on Success", which was launched by the then Taoiseach in September 2006. This strategy covers the areas of regulation, legislation, marketing, education and innovation.In February 2009, the CHG facilitated an Industry Workshop in Dublin Castle with the intention of considering the main issues affecting the industry and the ideas which emerged from the workshop are being considered and worked through the various Government Departments and State Agencies under the guidance of the CHG.Names and Sectors of those who are/were, at different times, members of the IFSC Clearing House Group, since 2002.

The other parts of NSAI moved from the site in March 2008.Maintenance (security, power, rates etc) costs are recouped from the NSAI to Enterprise Ireland in respect of the National Metrology Laboratory. In 2010, these are expected to be of the order of €140,000 (approx).   This estimate is included in the figure of €1m mentioned in my previous reply.

The claimant appealed this decision to the Labour Court.  On 23 October 2008, the Labour Court issued its decision upholding the decision of the rights commissioner.Both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are independent statutory bodes which act independently in the carrying out of their functions. Section 13 of the Industrial Relations Act 1969 provides for the appointment and functions of rights commissioners and I have no plans to make any amendments to the Act in this regard.Responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement machinery, including the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court, free of charge to assist this process, which, in line with the general principles of industrial relations in Ireland, is voluntary in nature.

In addition, services imports from that country for 2008, the last year for which data is available, were valued at €75 million.I understand that a preferential customs status applies for certain goods traded between the EU and Israel but that goods exported from illegal Israeli settlements cannot benefit from these preferential rates. However, it is the Revenue Commissioner's Customs Service that is the competent Irish Authority to implement rules of origin controls on imports of goods into Ireland and to apply the appropriate tariff duties. My Department has no function in regard to these matters.

For strategic skills and labour shortages it is Government policy to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand.  The various schemes that give effect to such policies were introduced under the Employment Permits Act, 2006.  The new schemes constituted a major overhaul of previous arrangements and put the employment permits system on a statutory footing.A particular focus in developing these schemes was on increasing the rights and protections afforded to migrant workers and the means to ensure redress in the event of exploitative practices. The Act's provisions gave immigrants greater freedom, autonomy and control over their own employment choices by enabling workers for the first time to apply and re-apply for their own permit and allowing workers to change their employer after a period of a year and move to another employment in order to take advantage of better conditions or career options.  Last year, my Department issued almost 1,500 employment permits in respect of employees changing to new employers.The Employment Permits Act 2006 provides for regular review of Ireland's economic migration policies and my Department keeps these policies under review on an on-going basis.My Department condemn any practices by employers that may result in non-compliance with employment rights entitlements or any other mistreatment of employees including those on employment permits.  Ireland's Employment Rights Legislation establishes the minimum statutory rights applicable to all people working in Ireland whether they are Irish citizens or otherwise.  I would urge all whose employment rights are being breached by an employer or those who know of such exploitation, to contact the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).

In a redundancy situation, the job or position must, in fact, actually cease to exist, for example, due to the closure, liquidation or rationalisation of the employer's business. However, in a dismissal situation, the job position does not automatically cease to exist and may be occupied by another employee or person carrying out the duties.An employee, who has been constructively dismissed, can seek redress by making a claim to the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1997 to 2001.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm that my Department received a redundancy lump sum claim from the employee concerned on 19 April, 2010.  The claim is awaiting processing.In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from September 2009.In instances such as this, where the employer does not formally wind the company up but goes into informal insolvency and is unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Department seeks from the employer evidence of inability to pay the entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.  If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.I should point out that the impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the level of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department.  This has impacted significantly on the capacity to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge on the Redundancy side is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the both Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments.Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  The number of claims processed and paid by the Redundancy Payments Section in 2009 amounted to 50,664, an increase of 70% over 2008.  In the first quarter of 2010, my Department processed 21,122 claims — an increase of over 151% on the previous first quarter in 2009.  Claims processed in the month of March 2010 was the highest ever achieved in the Section with 8,168 claims processed in the month.  In the year to date, inroads have being made on the backlog of claims on hand, which reduced from 41,168 at the end January 2010 to 37,054 at the end of March 2010.Responsibility for the payment of redundancy and insolvency payments is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection.  The intention is to transfer by Government order, the payment functions arising under the Redundancy Payment and Insolvency Payment schemes.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.

Matters relating to the Employment Equality Acts fall within the area of responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.More generally in the context of employment rights legislation, I should point out that the upper age limit of 66 years for bringing claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-2007 was removed in the Equality Act 2004.  The effect of this is that a person, aged over 66 when dismissed, may take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts unless he/she has already reached the “
normal retiring age” for that particular employment, if one exists.Additionally, the upper age limit of 66 years for receipt of statutory redundancy payments was removed by the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act, 2007.

In line with the National Spatial Strategy, the agency is concentrating its efforts on the hub town of Kilkenny and the county town of Carlow.  In addition to marketing these areas abroad for new inward investment, IDA continues to work with its existing client base to encourage them to transform their operations into higher value activities and to continue their commitment to Ireland.Enterprise Ireland is keenly focused on supporting enterprises in Carlow and Kilkenny with the ultimate goal of export growth and subsequently sustainable employment.  The agency, in recognising the significant changes in the current economy both in Ireland and globally, has prepared a new recovery strategy to identify the actions that will be undertaken to help clients in 2010. The agency has refocused its efforts on strengthening and sustaining companies of strategic importance through a range of initiatives focused on the needs of its client base.The Carlow and Kilkenny County Enterprise Boards continue to  provide support for small businesses in the start-up and expansion phases, through the provision of direct grant aid to businesses and project promoters  and through the provision of important business supports such as mentoring and training. Business growth, job creation and job retention are inherent considerations in the activities of the Boards.The State agencies and the Boards will continue to work together and with other stakeholders in relation to industrial development in Carlow and Kilkenny.  Should any further co-ordination be required, the relevant County Development Boards would be the bodies that are best placed to undertake such a role. With the advent of regional structures such as the County Development Boards, the practice of establishing task forces has been largely discontinued.Responsibility for FÁS has been transferred to the Department of Education and Skills.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm that my Department received a redundancy lump sum claim from the employee concerned on 27 January, 2010.In this instance, the employee took a case directly to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and was successful in obtaining a determination to redundancy entitlement and, on this basis, has now applied to my Department for payment of that entitlement.  The Department must discharge its obligation to protect, to the greatest possible extent, payments made from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and minimise the impact on that Fund.  In this regard, and to give the employer an opportunity to meet his obligation to make the redundancy payments to the employees as required in the first instance, my Department wrote to the employer in mid-April 2010 requesting payment of the redundancy entitlements.  The letter outlines that if the employer is not in a position to pay the redundancy entitlements, documentary evidence of this (as outlined) should be submitted as well as acknowledgement of the debt owing to the SIF.  At the time of writing to the employer, my Department wrote also to the employees affected requesting completion of a form verifying that payment of redundancy entitlements has not been made by the employer following the EAT determination.My Department will review and follow up on this case after a reasonable period of time of 3 to 4 weeks has elapsed following the issue of the letters to the employer and the employees with a view to securing payment of the redundancy entitlements for the employees at the earliest possible date.I should point out that the impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the level of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department.

The day to day responsibility for the supervision of financial institutions is a matter for the Financial Regulator who is statutorily independent in the exercise of his regulatory functions.As the Deputy will be aware, the company referred to in his question was placed in administration under the supervision of the High Court in order to help put its business on a sound commercial and financial footing and safeguard the interests of all policyholders.The recent announcement by the Financial Regulator on the further re-opening of UK private motor insurance business is a welcome development in terms of its contribution to the longer-term viability of the company.  The confirmation provided by the Government to the UK authorities that no policyholders including those in the UK — would be put at risk by the administration and if it was necessary the Minister for Finance would provide funds to support the administration through the insurance compensation fund helped facilitate this positive outcome.Any proposals for the re-opening of other business lines in the UK are a matter for the administrators and need to be approved by the Financial Regulator in consultation with the UK Financial Services Authority.Finally, in relation to the Administrator's restructuring plan, my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has activated a coordinated emergency response with the relevant State job creation and training agencies.

It is recognised also that public procurement can be an important source of business for SMEs.It goes without saying that the NPS must adhere to the National and EU procurement Directives.  However, before undertaking any major procurement project or entering a new procurement category, the NPS will undertake an examination of the market.  The market review will establish the most effective approach to take.Although the NPS views aggregation of requirements across the public sector as a significant contributor to delivering better value, the aggregation of demand is not suitable for all markets and categories.  The NPS will make use of the optimum strategy for the particular market, and, where it is deemed appropriate and practical, the NPS will use framework agreements, or divide requirements into lots, when tendering for goods and services.It is hoped that the standardisation of tender documents across the public service will make it easier for SMEs to meet the requirements of public bodies.The NPS will support SMEs through its education and guidance strategies, assisting SMEs to understand what is required of them under the tendering procedures.It will ensure also that the selection and award criteria do not unduly disadvantage SMEs, by using proportionate and appropriate selection and award criteria.The NPS will support the procurement of quality goods and services in line with Government policy on sustainability, and will support innovation wherever possible.The NPS is in the process of contracting for a new eTenders solution, which will encourage contracting authorities to advertise lower value contracts on the website, which it is hoped will provide further opportunities for SMEs.

If someone is charged with this offence and it is tried as an indictable offence, the maximum penalty is a fine and/or 14 years imprisonment.The Deputy might wish to note that in the case of financial institutions which use debt collection firms, the Financial Regulator has imposed requirements, under its Consumer Protection Code, that offer protection to consumers.   The Code obliges the regulated entities that it covers to ensure that any outsourced activity complies with the requirements of the Code.   This means that outsourced activity should uphold principles in the Code such as the requirement for institutions:Not to exert undue pressure or undue influence on a customer;To act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of customers and to act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of its customers; andTo prohibit personal visits or oral communications excepts in specified circumstances.The Deputy may also wish to note that the Financial Regulator has provided extensive information to assist consumers at risk of not being able to meet loan repayments. In relation to mortgages the statutory Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears, along with the commitments given by the banks aligned to the IBF, will provide significant respite for individuals and households that encounter financial difficulties.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) also provides useful independent advice and guidance in these circumstances.

He now receives considerably less for undertaking a more onerous role.The Bank of Ireland also indicated their intention to allow Mr. Boucher to retire at the age of 55.  This was in line with practice in case of  previous CEO's in the Bank. The calculation of the actuarial costs of the related pension benefits was a matter for the relevant pension funds actuaries and trustees, not for me as Minister.My guiding objective in agreeing to Mr Boucher's package was that there would be a substantial reduction in remuneration relative to Mr Boucher's predecessor, reflecting my concern and public concern at remuneration levels and practices in the sector.  I was also anxious to ensure that Bank of Ireland could source without undue delay a new CEO. Given the very unstable position of the banking sector at the time, it was not appropriate that any bank should continue with vacant leadership positions for any length of time.As the Deputy is aware, Mr Boucher has issued a statement saying that he was sensitive to the current comment and debate about his pension arrangements and that he had decided to waive his option to retire on pension at age 55.

However, such appointments would be very rare.However, a number of such appointments have recently been made in the context of Section 32 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008. This section provides that, in order to promote the public interest, a covered institution shall, at the direction of the Minister, take all reasonable steps to appoint at least one but no more than two non-executive directors to its board from a panel approved by the Minister.The following former office-holders were appointed, from a panel approved by the Minister, to the Boards by the covered institutions and received the following fees from those institutions:NameBankFee paid in 2009€Joe WalshBank of Ireland80,000Dick SpringAllied Irish Banks26,000Ray MacSharryILP69,000Benefits, including travel costs are a matter for the board on which the director serves.Alan Dukes' annual fee as Non executive director of Anglo-Irish Bank is €73,600.

While I have approved a fee of €250,000 for the role of Chairman, Mr Dukes has elected to receive a reduced fee of €150,000 on his appointment to that role, with the amount waived being more or less equivalent to his Dáil and Ministerial pension.Mr Dukes has not been paid any expenses to date and is not entitled to any other benefits.

A Young Trained Farmer is someone who is under 35 years of age on the date of execution of the deed of transfer and has attained one of the necessary qualifications and, where required, is the holder of the appropriate certificate(s) awarded by the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) in respect of Teagasc approved training courses.Qualifications for applying for relief from Stamp Duty in respect of transfers to Young Trained Farmers are set out in Schedules 2, 2A and 2B of the Stamp Duty Consolidation Act 1999. These lists include qualifications awarded by third-level institutions, not only the "level six" courses mentioned by the Deputy.  If the individual holds one of these qualifications (and the appropriate FETAC certificate, where required) and is under 35 years of age s/he would be defined as a Young Trained Farmer and would therefore qualify for an exemption from Stamp Duty.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I have received the correspondence which deals with a number of matters in relation to the application of VAT to services provided by public bodies including local authorities.I would like to point out in regard to deferring the implementation date of applying VAT on services provided by public bodies, that the European Court of Justice ruled, in the case C-544/07 against Ireland on 16 July 2009, that Ireland should amend its VAT legislation to provide that State and public bodies are in general subject to VAT.   This case goes back to 2004 when infringement proceedings were taken by the European Commission against Ireland.  Given the time that has passed since the Court's Judgement, and since the commencement of the case, it is imperative that the VAT implementation takes place as soon as possible.1 July 2010 was chosen as the date of implementation of VAT in this regard in order to allow time to process the relevant legislation and for State and public bodies, including local authorities, to prepare for the change to their administrative systems.  Indeed, since the Judgement issued the European Commission have corresponded with us on a number of occasions seeking updates on our progress as regards its implementation and we have informed them of the recent enactment of the Finance Act 2010.  Consequently, in the circumstances any deferral of the implementation date is not at this stage realistically feasible.Under the EU VAT Directive, treating local authorities and State bodies as not-for-profit organisations is not possible.  The Directive provides distinct and separate regulation for not-for-profit bodies and State bodies, including local authorities.  It is not possible to exempt from VAT any activity of a State body, including a local authority, or indeed any other business, simply because it is not making a profit.The Revenue Commissioners are proceeding with implementing the new regime and liaising where possible with local authorities to ensure transition to the new VAT arrangements.  While it is accepted that there may be initial teething problems, it is expected, as in the case of all tax legislation, that the State and public bodies comply with the new VAT rules from 1 July 2010.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	496	I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 to 133, inclusive, together.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information is not maintained in a manner that would enable replies to be provided to these questions in the level of detail sought by the Deputy.The Revenue Commissioners maintain sectoral audit records on the basis of an internationally recognised 4 digit NACE Code system. NACE code classifications in tax records are compiled by reference to the primary area of economic activity reported by individual and corporate taxpayers on their own behalf. While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level. This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided as follows.There is a very broad range of codes which might encompass the activities comprehended by the questions. Accordingly, the Commissioners have identified the following codes to be the most relevant to the Deputy's questions:7511 — General (overall) public service activities;7512 — Regulation of the activities of agencies that provide health care, education, cultural services and other social services, excluding social security.8511 — Hospital activities8514 — Other human health activities.The first two codes cover many Government Departments as well as other Government Agencies.Furthermore, the Commissioners have advised me that they have attempted to exclude obvious private sector bodies which are also included in those NACE Codes because of the activities they are engaged in. On that basis, the following information may be helpful:Category2007200820092010 (to March)Total Number of Audits362694Number yielding282174Tax*€3,601,000€1,696,000€99,000€576,000Interest€406,000€140,000€6,000€91,000Penalties€246,000€82,000€17,000€168,000Total Yield€4,253,000€1,918,000€122,000€835,000Number Nil yielding852—*A breakdown on a tax head basis is not available without conducting an extensive investigation of the individual audit records of the cases.Recoveries in relation to unprompted voluntary disclosures are not categorised separately and are therefore included with the overall audit results.Settlements under Section 985B, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 are not recorded separately.Where material issues, giving rise to tax undercharges, arise in the course of an audit, tax, Revenue will pursue payments for interest and penalties. Where it is clear that a taxpayer has broadly done their best to ensure that the tax returns for the various taxes are accurate, adjustments are not made for small inaccuracies.Revenue also informs me that, as well as audits, they carry out a range of assurance checks to supplement general audit activity.  All such interventions are initiated with the intention of assuring Revenue, without recourse to a resource intensive audit or enforcement activity, that the customer is broadly compliant for the taxes and duties which are the subject of the intervention. Over 350,000 such checks were carried out in 2009 and would have included public bodies. Due to the volume of these assurance checks, they are not recorded by sector.I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in accordance with their risk-based approach, cases are selected for intervention based on the presence of various risk indicators and other information available, with the aid of their computerised risk analysis system, REAP. The type of intervention to be undertaken is, in any particular case, the one considered to be the most appropriate to target the specific risk identified. In many cases this may lead to a single tax head, multi tax head or single-issue audit rather than a comprehensive audit.As well as targeting individual cases on a risk basis, Revenue is continuing its policy of targeting evasion on a sectoral basis. Generally, audits or enquiries are initially carried out on a limited number of cases within a sector. On this basis, specific features or practices are examined to determine if tax evasion is evident. The results are extrapolated to the sector as a whole, and a decision taken as to the merits of extending the project.I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a multi-faceted programme in managing compliance risks and are dealing in a determined way with tax evasion.

The air travel tax was one of a number of Budgetary measures introduced recently that was necessary in the context of an overall response to the fiscal challenges we face.  I have stated before that the impact of the tax on passenger numbers is being overstated.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I have no plans to offset the cost of the carbon tax on public transport vehicles.The carbon tax does not differentiate between private and public transport per se, however, the impact on public transport will be far less than on private transport by virtue of the fact that the higher cost of fuel is dispersed amongst more people, for example, using a bus compared to an individual in a car. Consequently, the carbon tax will be proportionately less for users of public transport which should be an incentive for its use. In addition, the carbon tax provides an incentive for both private motorists and providers of public transport to invest in fuel efficient cars and buses when they are making future purchasing decisions.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I announced in Budget 2010 that a carbon tax at a rate of €15 per tonne was being introduced on fossil fuels. The tax was applied to petrol and auto-diesel with effect from midnight, 9 December 2009; and was applied from 1 May 2010 to kerosene, marked gas oil (also known as ‘green diesel' or ‘agricultural diesel'), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas. The application of the tax to coal and commercial peat is subject to a Commencement Order. The Budget announcements on the carbon tax have now been enacted into legislation through the Finance Act 2010.The new carbon charge is based on the emissions that arise from the fuel used. Consequently the carbon tax charge in respect of marked gas oil and auto-diesel (which are almost identical fuels) is around the same i.e. 4.1 cents and 3.9 cents per litre respectively (excluding VAT). The carbon tax charge is marginally higher for marked gas oil because it is a slightly denser fuel with slightly higher emissions than auto-diesel.While the percentage increase in the price of marked gas oil arising from the introduction of the carbon tax is higher than in the case of auto-diesel, this is a function primarily of the fact that marked gas oil has a lower base price due to the considerably lower level of excise duty on that product compared to auto-diesel.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	508	On 16 July 2009 the European Court of Justice ruled in case C-544/07 against Ireland, that Ireland should amend its VAT legislation to provide that services provided by State and public bodies, including local authorities, are in general subject to VAT.  The Finance Act 2010 provided that such services will become taxable from 1 July 2010.With regard to the definition of not-for-profit activity under VAT legislation, under the EU VAT Directive, treating local authorities and State bodies as not-for-profit organisations is not possible.  The Directive provides distinct and separate regulation for not-for-profit bodies and State bodies, including local authorities.  It is not possible to exempt from VAT any activity of a State body, including a local authority, or indeed any other business, simply because it is not making a profit.Nonetheless, provision was made in the Finance Act that VAT on the supply of sports and community-type facilities by public bodies will come into effect not on 1 July but by Ministerial order.  This will allow for a more complete examination of the issues, including an analysis of how the new rules might best be implemented.  In practical terms this means that, for the present, the supply by local authorities of football pitches, swimming pools, halls etc to local clubs and societies will not be subject to VAT.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	509	In a falling property market, a person who inherits a property on a particular date which has a certain value may not be able to subsequently realise that value on the open market.  The opposite is true in a rising property market — properties may sell for amounts in excess of their probate value. In these situations, the person inheriting the property benefits from a rising property market and the tax system never sought to secure this benefit which arose from the rising property market.  It follows, therefore, that the tax system cannot seek to address the problems created by a falling property market.I do not agree with the Deputy's description that the values given to the properties when applying for probate were "unrealistic" — the values would have been based on similar properties changing hands for those prices at that time. If the valuations now appear to be out of kilter with prevailing prices, this reflects the passage of time since probate and market conditions, rather than the use of "unrealistic values".It should also be noted that Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT), which includes gift tax and inheritance tax, is charged on the amount of a gift/inheritance above a tax- free threshold.  The thresholds are broken into three Groups, A, B and C, based on the relationship between the disponer (the person making the gift or inheritance) and the donee or successor. For the years in question, 2006 and 2007 the tax-free thresholds are as set as follows:Group A
Son/DaughterGroup B
Parent/Brother/Sister/ Niece/Nephew/GrandchildGroup C
Relationship other thanA or B€€€2006478,15547,81523,9082007496,82449,68224,841CAT is paid on the asset amount in excess of the threshold.  The tax rate for 2006 and 2007 was 20% in comparison with the current rate of 25%. In addition, the tax-free thresholds in 2006 and 2007 were more generous than the current levels which are: Group A €414,799; Group B €41,481; Group C €20,740.If a child had inherited a property worth €500,000 from a parent in 2007, her/his CAT liability (assuming no other prior gifts or inheritances from parents) was €635.20, 20% of the amount above the then Group A threshold (€500,000 minus €496,824 equals €3,176; CAT due at 20% equals €635.20).  A person receiving a similar inheritance today would have a CAT liability of €21,300 (i.e. €500,000 — €414,799 = €85,201 @ 25%) — this is €20,664.80 higher than the €635.20 due in respect of a €500,000 inheritance in 2006/07.Even taking account of property values over the 2006 — 07 period, the Group A thresholds were higher for those years than average house values.  Also, where two or more children jointly inherit a property, each one is entitled to the full tax-free threshold.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that taxpayers in difficulty should communicate with their local Revenue office to see what accommodation might be made within the present legislative framework.  On its website, Revenue has published the steps it is able to take to assist taxpayers in the present economic circumstances.  The CAT Consolidation Act makes provision for payment of tax by instalment and for postponement, remission or compounding of tax in cases of hardship.  The Deputy may also be aware that beneficiaries who have inherited the property in which they reside can qualify for dwelling house relief from CAT.I do not propose to change the position that the CAT liability is determined by the value of inherited or gifted property on the valuation date.  However, in common with all taxation matters, it will be considered in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill.

The Finance Act 2010 provided that the services of public bodies, including local authorities, would become subject to VAT from 1 July 2010.The shared ownership scheme, as a financial service, would be exempt from VAT.In relation to whether the sale of affordable housing operated by local authorities should become subject to VAT, I would point out that the ECJ Judgement, and the EU VAT Directive, provide that services supplied by State bodies in the case of their regulatory capacity as a public authority would remain outside the scope of VAT to the extent that their treatment as non-taxable would not lead to a distortion of competition.  The supply of affordable housing would be considered a regulatory function of local authorities in this regard, however, the extent to which those services are in competition with private developers is currently being considered.I would also like to draw to your attention that where a service is made subject to VAT, the provider of the service is entitled to claim VAT on inputs in the provision of that service, where the VAT on inputs arise after the date the service is made subject to VAT.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	511	Stamp Duty on cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes has existed for many years and when electronic means of money transfer such as credit cards, debit cards and ATM cards were introduced, it was gradually extended to those products. The Stamp Duty on the various bank cards subject to a stamp duty charge is a charge payable by banks. The relevant legislation provides that a bank is entitled to charge the amount of the Stamp Duty to the relevant account-holder.The Stamp Duty on credit cards, debit cards and ATM cards arises irrespective of the personal circumstances of an individual.  If a Stamp Duty exemption was introduced for one group of people, such as senior citizens, there would be demands for similar treatment for others.  I have no plans at this time to introduce exemptions from Stamp Duty for any category of individual.

However, I am satisfied that the proposed location for the National Children's Hospital is the correct one, having regard to the full range of expert advice available.A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Task Force was established in February 2006 following the presentation of the report Children’s Health First-International best practice in tertiary paediatric services: implications for the strategic organisation of tertiary paediatric services in Ireland
 to advise on the optimum location of the proposed new paediatric hospital. The Task Group also included representation from the Office of Public Works.The Task Group considered submissions from a number of hospitals in the greater Dublin area, from private hospitals and other stakeholders and engaged in extensive consultations with the three existing paediatric hospitals, the maternity hospitals and external experts.The Task Group commissioned RKW to prepare a High Level Framework Brief which includes a detailed  assessment of the capacity of the Mater Hospital site to accommodate the space requirements of the National Children's Hospital.. The Brief indicates that all requirements can be accommodated on the site and still allow expansion beyond the year 2021.I note the points made to the Deputy regarding the case for locating the hospital on a site close to the M50 motorway, with links to the rest of the country.  However, a key conclusion of the expert advice provided was that the new facility should be located on the site of an adult acute hospital in order to have  appropriate links with related services.The location of the new children's hospital was selected prior to the decision on the precise route of the Metro North line.   However, the subsequent decision to proceed with the Metro North project and to locate a Metro stop at the Mater campus with an entrance / exit to Eccles Street will assist with access to the new children's hospital.I am pleased to note that planning of the new hospital is proceeding on schedule, and that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the HSE are making very good progress in their work to bring this important project to fruition. The Hospital is on target to open by the end of 2014.

Directives 1999/2/EC and 1999/3/EC were transposed into Irish legislation by European Communities (Foodstuffs Treated with Ionising Radiation) Regulations 2000, Statutory Instrument No. 297 of 2000.Currently only one food category (dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings) is listed and has EU authorisation under Directive 1999/3/EC with a further 29 foods available under Member States authorisations. All of these food products are only permissible on the market provided they have been irradiated by EU approved facilities and comply with the labelling requirements for irradiated foods as set out in the relevant EU and national legislation. The main labelling requirements for any irradiated food or food containing an irradiated ingredient is that the label must carry the word "irradiated" in a prominent position either as part of the main label or next to the ingredient that has been irradiated.Routine checks on food that may have been irradiated are carried out by the Health Service Executive under Service Contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI). In addition, the FSAI may also carry out sampling and analysis of specific food types where there are grounds to believe that certain foods may have been irradiated but not labelled appropriately. Analysis of 294 such food samples in 2009 identified 4 foods that had been irradiated but were not carrying the required labelling.

The aim is not only to ensure that potential risks are highlighted, but equally to support minimisation of risk through promoting compliance with the recommendations for use and monitoring requirements.Leaflets must comply with Directive 2001/83/EC in terms of content and order of information.  In addition, the package leaflet must be clear and understandable, enabling users to act appropriately, when necessary with the help of healthcare professionals.  This ensures that the layout is consistent for all medicines across Europe, allowing patients to access information in a standardised format.  The package leaflet is reviewed by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) during the assessment process to ensure compliance with the legislative requirements.The IMB has highlighted the risk of suicide and suicidal thoughts associated with use of antidepressants on a number of occasions, most recently in Drug Safety Newsletter in September 2008. The authorised package leaflet for this class of medicinal products contains information on what the patient should do if he/she experiences thoughts of suicide or worsening of depression.

The removal of organs from the body at post mortem is a necessary part of the examination of the body and the diagnosis of cause of death. The retention of organs may be necessary in certain circumstances to make an accurate diagnosis of the cause of death. In line with these reports,  no hospital post-mortem examination should be carried out and no tissue retained for any purpose whatsoever, without consent or authorisation.An independent audit of all retained organs in the State was carried out by Ms Michaela Willis, on foot of one of Dr Madden's recommendations, and this report was published in 2009. Ms Willis's report demonstrated that significant improvements have been made in post mortem practice in Ireland in recent years. Her report identified many examples of best and excellent practice and it provides a strong base for a process of continuous improvement in post mortem practice in Ireland.

Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.On 22nd February 2010, I announced a total of €411,408,500 for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads in 2010.  From this allocation, Kildare County Council is being provided with €12,922,893.In deciding on allocations for 2010 my priority was to protect the existing network along with the massive investment in it over the last number of years and to carefully target resources to address, on a priority basis, the most urgently required repairs resulting from the extensive damage caused by the severe weather earlier in the year.My Department received an application from Kildare County Council in November 2008 for 100% funding of the Athy Southern Distributor Road at an estimated cost of €42 million.  In order to increase the monies available for the maintenance and rehabilitation of road pavements, arising from the severe weather as mentioned earlier, it has been necessary to reduce the grant allocations for major new road schemes and for major realignment schemes.  As a result of this, no funding is being provided for this project in 2010.

These groups are working towards maximising coverage in their operational areas having regard to local public transport service needs and the availability of resources. My Department's RTP funding is provided entirely from the Exchequer and does not involve any EU funding.  €11 million has been provided for the RTP in 2010.On rural transport generally, it is important that existing resources in this area are utilised as cost-effectively as possible. In that context a number of initiatives are currently underway exploring the potential for improved synergies between existing transport providers. These include pilot transport projects in the North East and North West, an exercise to map all transport services in County Louth and a cross-border pilot rural community transport project under the auspices of the British/Irish Council. The outcome of these initiatives will feed into the process for developing rural transport policy into the future.

However, this is an issue that I raised with Secretary Chertoff at the time and later with his successor Janet Napolitano. Both were receptive to the opening of discussions on cargo preclearance from Ireland, once we had fully established passenger preclearance. Preclearance in Dublin Airport is due to commence later this year with the opening of Terminal 2.When passenger preclearance is fully established at both Dublin and Shannon Airports I will pursue the issue with the U.S. Authorities again about cargo preclearance.

I understand that the DAA believe that the downward trend is expected to be less severe for the rest of the year subject to some uncertainty arising from unforeseen closures relating to the volcanic ash emergency.As to Government policy relating to the operation of the State Airports, I have deferred until 2011 any decision relating to the separation of Cork and Shannon airports under the State Airports Act, 2004. In the case of the regional airports I expect that a forthcoming Value for Money review of regional airports will assist me in evaluating the appropriate scale of a regional airports programme in the future bearing in mind my aviation policy objectives, improved surface transport links and the need to address the difficulties with our public finances.I have not issued any recent policy directions to the State or regional airports as regards their operation.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	569	I am committed to the continued development of the bus sector, as provided by both public and private sector operators.I established the National Transport Authority (NTA) in December 2009, under the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  The NTA is tasked with the development of all public transport services.With regard to the publicly supported bus services, the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 sets out a framework for the introduction of competition in the market for subvented bus services.  The NTA is empowered under the Act to invite private operators to tender for new services requiring subvention, introducing competition and increasing efficiencies in the subsidised bus market.With regard to private bus operators, the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 reforms the bus licensing regime, replacing the 1932 Road Transport Act.  The new licensing regime, to be administered by the NTA, provides a level playing field for all bus market participants, both public and private and will foster a competitive market which best serves the needs of bus users.In addition to the NTA's role in the development of bus services, the Government adopted a sustainable transport policy for Ireland in February 2009, set out in the Smarter Travel Plan 2009-2020.  This strategy includes a number of specific actions to improve bus services, including improved frequency, reliability and accessibility of bus services.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	570	The Government's plans for air transport are to facilitate the growth of competitive air links, in order to promote the development of Irish business and tourism; to ensure the sustainable development of the State and regional airports; to ensure that Irish aviation safety and security policies and practices meet the highest international standards and to provide for effective air navigation services.My Department's immediate objective is to assist airports and airlines to respond to the downturn in the sector, while maintaining the highest possible levels of connectivity between Ireland and key markets.   In a global market, which is fully liberalised within the EU, the scope for measures to provide direct support to airports and carriers is very limited.  The focus must therefore be on managing through a severe downturn and being well positioned for an upturn when economic circumstances improve.Looking to the future, the challenge will be to ensure that Irish aviation is well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery when it comes.  To that end, the Government will continue to support the development of an innovative-friendly, pro-competition regulatory framework for aviation.  The continued roll-out of DAA's investment programme, most notably the opening of T2 later this year, and introduction of US preclearance facilities will greatly enhance the experience of customers using Irish airports and will provide airlines with opportunities to develop and grow new services.  My Department is currently engaged in measures to enhance our bilateral aviation relations with emerging markets such as India and China in support of the Government's Asia strategy.

I made the announcement for 2010 on 22nd February this year.Earlier this year, I requested local authorities to provide details of exceptional road related costs associated with the November 2009 flooding and the prolonged severe weather, which fall outside the normal financial provision for winter maintenance.I took account of the information received when deciding on allocations for 2010.  My priority is to protect the massive investment of €6 billion in the regional and local roads network since 1997.I decided to defer the planned rehabilitation works on regional and local roads in 2010, in order to provide greater flexibility to local authorities and requested that they carefully target resources to address, on a priority basis, the most urgently required repairs resulting from the extensive damage caused by the prolonged severe weather.I have also received representations from a number of local authorities and public representatives seeking an increase in the funding for regional and local roads in their particular areas.  However, all regional and local road grants have now been fully allocated and there are no further funds available from which additional allocations could be made.The Exchequer grants are a supplement to expenditure by the local authorities.

However, I and my Government colleagues are very conscious of the difficulties which are being faced at this time by the retail sector in particular.Against that background, I have legislated to prohibit upward only rent reviews in leases entered into on or after 28 February of this year (section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009) and I believe that the commencement of that section will have a persuasive effect in relation to current lease arrangements.Action has also been taken to address concerns which have been raised about the ability of tenants to obtain reliable and comprehensive information in the context of the rent review process and a Working Group has been established with the following terms of reference:"To consider the operation of the current system for determining the rent payable on foot of a rent review clause, with particular emphasis on the arbitration process and the adequacy of the information available to all parties and, if necessary, to make such recommendations for change as may seem appropriate."  It is envisaged that the Group will report by 30 June, 2010.Every opportunity is also being taken to stress the need for landlords to take a flexible approach to rent review negotiations which arise in the context of current leases.   It has been emphasised repeatedly that there is nothing to stop the parties to existing business leases from varying the terms of their contract and from agreeing to reduce the applicable rent, having regard to their individual circumstances and the realities of the market.

It also includes provisions on a common policy on the temporary entry of persons, the harmonisation of external border controls, and cross-border police and judicial co-operation.Ireland has successfully applied to take part in the police and judicial co-operation aspects of the agreement.  These provisions will come into effect only after a range of technical and legislative measures have been put in place.  The necessary measures are currently being progressed.Ireland has not, however, applied to participate in the Schengen arrangements to the extent that they deal with the abolition of border checks.  This decision has been taken to maintain the common travel area with the United Kingdom which remains an important priority for the Irish Government.  The common travel area could not, for all intents and purposes, continue to operate if Ireland were to remove border checks with the Schengen States while the United Kingdom did not.  To do so would result in a situation where the land border with Northern Ireland would become the effective border between the Schengen zone and the United Kingdom and as a consequence, would inevitably require, the imposition of border controls on the island of Ireland.I am sure the Deputy would agree that, while there may in theory be benefits in terms of tourism, for Ireland to participate in the border aspects of the Schengen Agreement there are also clear negative implications for such a decision if taken on a unilateral basis.

On 28 May 2009 she requested further permission stating that she had applied for a Green Card Permit, this person was informed that she should return to be registered when that permit was issued.  She failed to return to be registered or to inform the Immigration Officers of her activities in the State.  She has remained in the State without permission since 28 May 2009.The person referred to by the Deputy has been afforded the opportunity to find employment in the State since November 2008.

Following consideration by a Visa Officer, it was refused on the 30 March 2010, for the following reasons:1. Finances. The evidence of finances provided was deemed insufficient in that neither the applicant nor the reference submitted 6 months bank statements.2. Insufficient documentation. There was insufficient documentation submitted in support of the application in that the applicant did not set out the reasons for the proposed visit to Ireland.  Further the applicant did not submit a letter of undertaking.3. Obligations to return to home country. The applicant did not show satisfactory obligations to return to the home country — some examples of obligations being social, economic or professional ties.It is open to the person concerned to appeal the decision of the Visa Officer within two months of the date of refusal, in this case before the 30 May 2010.

The Courts Service Board established a Steering Committee to plan for and provide information on sentencing. The Committee, under the chair of Mrs. Susan Denham of the Supreme Court, comprises a judge from the High, Circuit and District Courts and a university lecturer with expertise in sentencing law.This project, known as the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS), involves the provision of a computerised information system on sentences and other penalties imposed for criminal offences.  The system will enable a judge, by entering relevant criteria, to access information about the range of sentences and penalties imposed for various types of offences in previous cases. This will assist any judge when considering the sentence to be imposed in an individual case.The system has been piloted in several court jurisdictions, including Dublin, Cork and Limerick Circuit Criminal Courts; the Dublin District Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal. The outcomes will be reviewed and assessed by judges prior to the final evaluation and establishment of a web-based system.

The current rate of gratuity payable is €2.35 daily, which equates to a weekly total of €16.45.In accordance with the Prison Rules, 2007, additional gratuity may be paid to prisoners engaged in authorised structured activities. This additional gratuity is typically paid in the form of vouchers which can be used to purchase goods in the prison tuck shop. The levels of additional gratuity paid in respect of different types of structured activities are set by the senior Governor in each institution.Prisoners do not receive a Christmas bonus, but the Irish Prison Service did operate a Prisoner Hardship Fund over recent years, from which each custodial institution was allocated a specific budget in December of each year. The purpose of the Hardship Fund scheme was to provide a fund from which Governors could make modest payments to prisoners and their families in need of assistance. The award criteria to be applied and the amounts to be awarded to individual prisoners were at the discretion of the senior Governor in each institution. The practice of allocating Hardship Fund budgets to custodial institutions, each December, will be discontinued in 2010, as payments to prisoners or their families on hardship grounds, at any time of the year, are eligible for funding from a newly established Prisoner Assist Programme Fund. The purpose of the new Prisoner Assist Programme Fund is to provide a facility for Governors to identify, prioritise and fund projects for the benefit of prisoners, in a more planned and co-ordinated way.

Once a final order is made by the Court, the ownership of the property becomes vested in the Minister for Finance.While the Bureau regularly targets certain properties under both the Proceeds of Crime and taxation legislation, there are statutory limitations on the disclosure of such information in the course of investigations and any subsequent court proceedings.It is therefore the policy of the Bureau not to disclose information on specific properties until investigations are completed and the Courts have made a final determination.

Gardaí are contacted once suspected drug seizures are made and issues of investigation and prosecution fall within their remit.Figures relating to Mountjoy Prison and St. Patrick's Institution are set out as follows.Prison/Place of DetentionNumber of suspected Drug Seizures in 2009Number of suspected Drug Seizures in 2010 (until 18 April)Mountjoy Prison (male)547240St. Patrick’s Institution9235The Irish Prison Service continues to work to implement its Drug Policy & Strategy, entitled "Keeping Drugs Out of Prison", which was launched in May 2006.  Working to fulfil the commitments contained in the policy and strategy involves the implementation of stringent measures to prevent drugs from getting into prisons while, at the same time, continuing to invest in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population as well as meeting prisoners treatment and rehabilitative needs.Drug users present with multiple and complex problems.  The evidence would indicate that a multi-disciplinary approach is needed to effectively care for this group and that maintenance of a personalised therapeutic relationship yields the best outcomes.  Prisoners have access to a range of medical and rehabilitative services such as psychosocial services and work and training options which assist in addressing their substance misuse issues.The Irish Prison Service has committed significant investment in recent years in responding to addiction issues in the prison system.  The most significant new development was the awarding of a contract for addiction counselling services to Merchants Quay Ireland. The Addiction Counselling Service is, in conjunction with other developments, now delivering nearly 1000 hours per week of prisoner access to addiction counselling across the prison system.

The penalties for such an offence, on summary conviction, include a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. It is Irish Prison Service policy to report and hand over seizures of mobile phones to the Gardaí.Cell and area searches for contraband such as mobile phones take place in all prisons on a daily basis.  These include random, targeted and intelligence led searches.  These searches have been particularly effective and local intelligence indicates that the availability of mobile phones has decreased across the prison system.  Details of mobile seizures are set out in the table below.  For clarity it is important to note that not all of the phones were confiscated directly from prisoners but were instead retrieved at entry point or before they get to the prisoner population.  This is as a direct consequence of newly introduced enhanced security measures including airport style scanners and x-ray machines, which are in operation at the entrances of all the relevant closed prisons.Details of mobile seizures for 2009 and figures to 18 April 2010 are set out in the table.Prison/ Place of Detention20092010 (up to 18 April)Mountjoy904312Saint Patrick’s Institution12115Total1,025327

Ms. Owen continues to be a member of the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime while Messrs Andrews and O'Kennedy are members of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The information sought by the Deputy in respect of payments made to the three former Ministers cannot be easily extracted from voluminous records; to do so would require the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of resources.

She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I.

The Operation specifically targets offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1996 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, which include the sale and consumption of alcohol by underage persons. Almost 615,000 offences have been detected since the commencement of Operation Encounter.All members of An Garda Síochána proactively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour.  Areas subject to such behaviour have been identified as hot-spots by local Garda management, and additional foot and mobile patrols are directed at these areas during times when these offences are more likely to occur.  All such incidents detected by members on patrol or reported to An Garda Síochána are dealt with immediately and the suspected offenders are dealt with in accordance with the law.

However, I can advise of the position generally. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are that the applicant must:be of full age;be of good character;have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years;intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation;have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State;In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include:periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State;periods granted for the purposes of study;periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.It is open to the person concerned to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation with the Citizenship Division of my Department if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements.

The Government continues to stress at such meetings the great importance attached by Ireland to human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, and to urge the Chinese authorities to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Most recently, a detailed discussion on human rights issues took place at political consultations between Ireland and China in Beijing on 8 April last.Human rights issues also continue to be a constant and important point of dialogue with the Chinese authorities for the European Union, through the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue. This broad-ranging dialogue has allowed the EU to engage with China on issues such as freedom of expression, the death penalty, the independence of the judiciary, prison conditions, freedom of religion and minority rights. The last session of the Dialogue took place on 20 November last, also in Beijing. A date for the next session has not yet been set.The Government remains deeply concerned about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China and questions in this regard — including specific cases — are raised with the Chinese authorities both within the context of our own discussions with them and through the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue.  We have taken very seriously allegations which have been made in the past claiming that live organs have been harvested from Falun Gong practitioners in detention. Extensive enquiries on this issue were made by my Department within the EU and UN frameworks in 2006/7, as well as through our Embassy in Beijing and with a variety of human rights organisations. Enquiries were also addressed to the Chinese authorities. At that time, we failed to identify sufficient reliable and independent evidence to substantiate the allegations, but the matter has been kept under review.The most recent allegations to which the Deputy refers relate to the alleged execution of prisoners, including Falun Gong practitioners, Tibetans, Christians and Uighurs and the harvesting of their organs for sale.  These are allegations of the most serious kind and I have instructed officials in my Department to try to establish whether or not they can be substantiated.

The text of the relevant sections of his reply to Parliamentary Question 17451/10 is attached below, for ease of reference:"The Schengen Convention is an agreement among European States which provides for the abolition of systematic border controls between participating States and a common Schengen visa which allows tourist access to the area. The agreement also provides for the development of enhanced cooperation in relation to law enforcement matters and judicial cooperation.Ireland has successfully applied to take part in certain elements of the Schengen agreement, including police cooperation, mutual assistance in criminal matters, extradition and drugs cooperation. These provisions will come into effect only after a range of technical and legislative measures have been put in place and successfully evaluated by the Council. Ireland has not, however, applied to participate in the Schengen arrangements to the extent that they deal with the abolition of border checks or common visa provisions. This decision has been taken to maintain the Common Travel Area (CTA) with the United Kingdom.  As the Deputy will be aware, the UK elected not to participate in the borders aspects of Schengen.The operation of the CTA facilitates nationals of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Irish nationals moving around freely between the two States. The CTA could not continue to operate if Ireland were to remove border checks with Schengen States generally while the United Kingdom did not do so. To do so would result in a situation where the land border with Northern Ireland would become the border between the Schengen area and the United Kingdom.Given the importance of maintaining the Common Travel Area, I cannot envisage a situation where Ireland would change its position unilaterally in relation to participation in the Schengen borders arrangements. The focus for the foreseeable future is in maximising the effectiveness of the Common Travel Area through mutual co-operation. Ireland and the UK maintain a close and ongoing working relationship in this regard and a number of matters are kept under review, including security, information exchange, visas and operational co-operation."
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	620	Cooperation with development Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) is a key element in the Government's aid programme, which is managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs. The overarching goal of the aid programme is to contribute to the reduction and eventual eradication of global poverty and hunger. In this effort, we attach great importance to the role Irish NGOs are playing internationally in promoting good governance, transparency and accountability. It is clearly essential that the organisations involved must themselves operate at all times to the highest standards.The International Community for Relief of Starvation and Suffering (ICROSS) was founded in Kenya in 1978 by a number of doctors from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. ICROSS Ireland was established in 1979 as a funding centre for ICROSS Kenya. There has been considerable media coverage in recent weeks of allegations about the operation of the charity ICROSS Kenya.Since 2000, Irish Aid has provided a total of €453,788 to ICROSS Ireland for four health care and HIV and AIDS projects in Kenya, implemented by ICROSS Kenya. The breakdown of the funding provided is as follows:2000 — €69,836; 2002 — €20,000; 2004 — €137,988; 2005 — €225,964Following allegations of mismanagement within ICROSS in Kenya in 2006, Irish Aid carried out an investigation and sought additional detailed financial statements from ICROSS Ireland. As is normal practice during such investigations, Irish Aid suspended funding to ICROSS Ireland. A team from the Irish Aid Evaluation and Audit unit examined the financial statements in detail and travelled to Kenya in 2007 to carry out an audit and governance review.The Evaluation and Audit unit were unable to establish assurance and verification of appropriate spending for the amount of €97,000 from the total allocations from Irish Aid to the charity. As a result, Irish Aid requested and received from ICROSS Ireland a full reimbursement of this amount. No further funding has been provided to ICROSS, which has not implemented a set of recommendations made by Irish Aid to improve governance and financial oversight at the charity.I want to assure the Deputy that any allegation of the misuse of public funds is taken very seriously by Irish Aid. All allegations are fully investigated and appropriate actions taken to ensure that funds are either fully accounted for or recovered as necessary. Irish Aid has a code of practice for dealing with suspected fraud in partner organisations which is acted upon immediately.The Irish development NGOs have a very strong and well-earned reputation internationally for their professionalism and their effectiveness. The situation at ICROSS is extremely disappointing, but I want to emphasise that it is not reflective of the operation of Irish NGOs more generally.

This Taskforce is in the process of becoming the RAPID Area Implementation Team for Rathkeale.My Department is making €250,000 available to Rathkeale from Dormant Accounts funding to be used on small infrastructural products over the next two years. I am also pleased that Limerick County Council has appointed a co-ordinator with responsibility for RAPID in Rathkeale.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	630	As the Deputy will be aware, my predecessor, Minister Éamon Ó Cuív, T. D., announced in December 2009 that he was initiating a comprehensive review of the funding and structure of community-based, State-funded organisations in the Gaeltacht. The aim of the review is to provide for realigned and restructured State-funded groups with a role in language planning, community development, enterprise development and social inclusion.The realignment will cover community organisations funded by my Department and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  It is intended that the various Gaeltacht areas, including the areas covered by the community development projects referred to by the Deputy, will be served by a principal community-based organisation. This will facilitate a more co-ordinated and cohesive delivery of services to Gaeltacht communities. There will be particular emphasis on language planning initiatives at community level, in line with proposals contained in the Draft 20-year Strategy for the Irish language, which is currently being reviewed by the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.Consultation with the existing State-funded groups will take place during 2010, prior to any change being implemented.Both of the projects referred to by the Deputy have been offered temporary contracts of funding under the new Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) until such time as the review of State-funded community organisations in Gaeltacht areas is completed.  Officials from my Department have been in contact with — and also recently met — representatives of the groups concerned regarding proposals submitted by them for an alternative LCDP integration model, which included the non-Gaeltacht areas. However, these proposals do not meet my Department's requirements for either the Gaeltacht or the non-Gaeltacht areas.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	631	I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions 19, 32 and 46 of 1 April 2010.As I indicated in that reply, the draft 20-Year Strategy for Irish has been published and referred to the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  I look forward to the opportunity to receive the outcome of the Committee's deliberations in due course.  Once I have received the Committee's views, I hope to bring the draft Strategy to Government for approval as soon as possible thereafter.The initial phase of the Strategy will focus on putting in place practical implementation and co-ordination arrangements, including the effective alignment of resources with strategic goals and arrangements for ongoing monitoring and evaluation. In that context, proposals of the nature referred to by the Deputy would not be considered a priority at this time.

Records of past employments of new recruits are not captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling the information requested by the Deputy.  Accordingly, the specific information requested is not available.Retired public servants are, however, engaged by my Department from time to time for specific tasks or projects.  Such engagements are normally remunerated on a fee basis (provision exists for fees to be abated, where appropriate, by reference to pension payments) but in some cases, indeed, retired public servants have provided their services without any additional remuneration.

An interdepartmental committee is being established with the following terms of reference:—  "To advise the Minister for Social Protection the legislation required to provide for legal recognition of the acquired gender of transsexuals. In particular to propose heads of a bill to provide for:—the establishment of a process for legal recognition of the acquired gender of persons suffering from Gender Identity Disorder who have made the transition from one gender to another;the establishment of a gender recognition register;the granting of entitlement to marry in the legally recognised reassigned gender; andany other provisions as may be deemed necessary consequent on the main provisions of the Bill."The committee is made up of representatives of various Departments and Offices of State and will have its first meeting on Thursday, 6 May 2010. It is envisaged that the committee, as part of its deliberations, may invite submissions from interested groups, experts in the field and the public. I would expect that the committee will make its recommendations within a period of about 6 months. It is not possible at this early stage to say when the resulting proposals will be included in the legislative programme, or indeed, when a bill will be introduced. I would, however, assure the Deputy that the matter will be treated as a priority by the Department when the deliberations of the committee are finalised.

Fuel allowance is paid for 32 weeks from end-September to end-April each year. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full. The current rate of fuel allowance is €20 per week (€23.90 in smokeless areas).The main conditions are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, must satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or with other qualified people.People in receipt of short-term social welfare payments such as jobseeker's benefit, ‘short-term' jobseeker's allowance (i.e. less than 13 weeks), illness benefit or occupational injuries benefit are not eligible to receive a fuel allowance. Subject to qualifying conditions, there are special arrangements in place to pay the smokeless fuel allowance (€3.90 per week) to people who live in one of the designated urban smokeless fuel areas and who have been receiving one of these social welfare payment types for 13 weeks or more.Individuals who are in receipt of long-term jobseeker's allowance (15 months or more) are eligible to apply for a standard fuel allowance.Any changes to the fuel allowance scheme, such as allowing eligibility to people on short-term social welfare schemes, would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available for improvements in social welfare generally.

Applications under the scheme are income tested to determine the household's capacity to meet the costs of restoring their home to a habitable condition and to ensure that available assistance is prioritised for those who are most vulnerable.All household income is considered when determining entitlement to payment and detailed guidelines have been provided to the HSE in that regard. These guidelines also contain a list of the type of goods/appliances that are generally covered by the scheme and what replacement value should typically be attributable to each item. This list is not exhaustive and is intended as a guide only. The income test and guidelines simplify the assessment process and to allow for the speedy processing of applications.The level of payment available under the aid scheme to any qualified individual depends on the severity of the damage to that person's home and the extent of the loss experienced as well as household income and general family circumstances. The Community Welfare Service has full discretion to make payments at a higher level than a strict application of the income test would warrant in any individual case where it considers it appropriate to do so.In conclusion, I would point out that the scheme has two objectives. Firstly, it provided financial and other assistance, without an income test, in the immediate aftermath of last November's flooding. Secondly, it provides income tested financial support for the replacement of essential household items and home repairs in cases not covered by insurance. I am satisfied that the scheme has met both of these objectives, bearing in mind that the scheme provides hardship alleviation as opposed to full compensation. Nobody has been refused support for the replacement of essential household items or for the repair of their home in cases not covered by insurance.  In total, only six claims have been refused, none of which was because of household income, and there is no question of refusing to make a payment in any case where hardship still exists.

The State pension (transition) is paid to people at age 65 for one year provided they cease working.  This is defined as not earning less than €38 per week.  The State pension (contributory) is paid to people who are 66 years or over who meet the qualifying contributions for the pension.  There is no restriction on them working while receiving this pension. The State pension (non-contributory) is a means based pension payable to those over 66 years.  It features an employment earnings disregard incentive of €200 per week for those who wish to earn extra income.In the context of an ageing population, with projections suggesting that there will be less than two people of working age to every person aged 65 or over in the middle of century (compared to almost six people of working age today), more emphasis will be placed upon retaining older workers in the labour force.  Over the next 10 years, the number of people over the age of 65 is expected to increase by almost 60 per cent, while, by 2050, it is expected to have trebled, from some 450,000 to 1.5 million.  Therefore, as announced as part of the National Pensions Framework, the state pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the removal of the State Pension (Transition), thereby standardising State pension age at 66.  State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.The increase in retirement age will assist in dealing with the future sustainability of the pensions system and also recognises that people are living longer and healthier lives.  A technical implementation group chaired by my Department has been established to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the necessary reforms into operation.

The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.The income limits for 2010 are €563.60 for a couple with one child and €410.10 for a lone parent with one child. The limit is increased by €29.80 for each additional child.The rationale for the different income limits for lone parents and couples is that a two adult household needs greater financial resources to meet its needs than a lone parent household.

As an exceptional measure for the year of introduction, the liability date for the charge was fixed at 31 July 2009.  The Act provides that the liability date for 2010 and future years is 31 March.Payment does not fall due until two months after the liability date and there is a further one month's grace period before penalties for late payment commence.  A person liable for the charge in 2010 thus has until 30 June 2010 to meet that liability without incurring any additional charge.

There are no plans to abolish the clawback arrangements under the existing affordable housing schemes.However, it should be noted that where a person is selling an affordable home and the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid legislation provides for the amount of the clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result.

In accordance with the provisions of the Housing (New House Grant etc.) Regulations 1990 (Amendment) Regulations 2002 a grant could only be paid where, inter alia, a contract to purchase or to build a house was entered into on or before 14 November, 2002 and where an application had been received in my Department on or before 4 December, 2002.In the case of a couple who were refused a grant on the basis that a contract to purchase had not been entered into by the prescribed date, legal proceedings were issued against the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Finance, seeking payment of the grant. On 19 October, 2009, the matter came before the High Court and the decision of my Department to refuse the grant was upheld.

A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Clare County Council, in response to my Department's request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time, as the total value of contracts and schemes proposed by local authorities exceeded the level of resources likely to be available in the period.The scope and format of the Programme for 2010 to 2012 is designed better to reflect ongoing environmental and economic priorities, to maximise the return on public funds being invested in the sector and to ensure that the Programme is realistic in its level of ambition.   The total value of contracts underway and those proposed for commencement during the period of the Programme in County Clare is €38.2 million.The contracts and schemes that were not included in the Programme on this occasion were those which did not feature highly on public health grounds or other environmental compliance requirements (for example, those relating to European Court of Justice proceedings,  or those which were required in the context of the River Basin Management Plans, Shellfish Pollution Reduction Programmes, EPA reports etc) and projects that were proposed purely for capacity expansion and which in the case of water supply can be deferred, in many cases, in favour of accelerated water conservation measures.One of a number of new measures in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 is an annual review process, under which the Programme will be reviewed and updated annually to reflect any emerging priority projects. This is intended to deal with investment requirements arising for example from the clarification of appropriate treatment for certain agglomerations from the licensing and certification process for wastewater discharges being implemented by the EPA, or from the ongoing monitoring of drinking water standards which may highlight risks which need to be addressed.

Under the Planning Acts, the making, reviewing and varying of a development plan or local area plan is a reserved function of the elected members of the planning authority for the area.Under section 10(8) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 there is no presumption in law that any land zoned in a particular development plan (including a development plan that has been varied) will remain so zoned in any subsequent development plan.  Section 13(1) of the Act provides that a planning authority may make a variation to a development plan which is in force and this could, inter alia, include changes to zoning objectives.The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009, which is progressing through the Oireachtas, proposes inter alia that an evidence-based core strategy is included in development plans which must provide information on how the plan is consistent with the National Spatial Strategy, regional planning guidelines and statutory planning guidelines, including in relation to the quantum, location and phasing of lands zoned for development.Specific data on the quantum of de-zoned or re-zoned land are not collected or retained by my Department.  However, my Department compiles an annual update from planning authorities on the total amount of zoned residential lands in their functional areas as well as the estimated yields from such lands. These housing land availability figures are published in the Department's Housing Statistics Bulletin which is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.In addition, my Department published new national population projections in January 2009 to inform the review process for the Regional Planning Guidelines, including regional population targets for the years 2010, 2016 and 2022 which take account of the changed economic climate and the likely impact on demographic trends, of reduced in-migration, rising unemployment and a more constrained financial situation.  In October 2009, specific Gateway and Hub population targets which were derived from the January 2009 national and regional population targets were also issued.It is a matter for each Regional Authority, together with the constituent City and County Councils, to determine population targets for county towns, other smaller towns, villages and rural areas, within their respective regional targets, which will in turn inform the demand for housing over the period and the requirements for development land, taking account of such matters as available vacant housing units within their area.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	683	Budget 2007 announced proposals for new motor tax and vehicle registration (VRT) systems to reward low CO2 emitting cars and penalise high CO2 emitting cars.  A public consultation process was held from December 2006 to March 2007 and 1 July 2008 was chosen as the starting date for both the new motor tax and VRT systems.The aim of the new system was to influence the purchasing decisions of consumers in the future.  From 1 July 2008, anybody buying a new or pre-owned imported car would have been aware of both the motor tax and VRT rates which would apply based on CO2 emissions.  Cars purchased prior to that date were purchased in the knowledge that the basis of assessment for both motor tax and VRT was engine capacity (c.c.) and not CO2 emissions.Retrospection prior to 2008 would not be practical as no authenticated CO2 data exist in respect of most of the existing fleet.  The CO2 values on the Revenue and National Vehicle Driver File systems, in respect of new cars only, have not been collected as the basis for a fiscal charge and have not been authenticated to any degree.  It would be unsound to apply charges on the basis of such data.The above-mentioned public consultation process made it clear that the new CO2-based system would apply from a specified date and that cars registered before that date would continue to be taxed in future years under the existing motor tax system related to engine size.

The Council will need an opportunity to consider the implications of the report and decide on the appropriate course of action to follow.Irish Water Safety was reconstituted under the Irish Water Safety (Establishment) Order 2006.  Article 6(4) provides that ‘the Council shall consist of not more than thirteen members appointed by the Minister of whom five shall be representatives of local water safety interests.' This provision allows for volunteers to be elected by the officers of the area committee for nomination to the Board.There are 30 Water Safety Area Committees under the auspices of Irish Water Safety. These Committees organise a programme of events, courses and water safety promotional activities each year. The Committees are made up of volunteers and operate under the guidance of IWS. There is no reason why any volunteer cannot participate fully in the organisation subject to its rules of membership. My Department will raise the matter of St Joseph's Pool with IWS and I will provide a follow-up reply as soon as possible to the Deputy.

During this period it is proposed to send approximately 1,600 samples for laboratory analysis.Last year's annual survey returned 21 positive findings from over 1,500 samples taken  in 14 locations, namely in counties, Galway, Dublin, Cork, Mayo, Limerick, Wicklow and Donegal.  Our annual survey results for the past two years for this harmful bacterium were discussed in spring 2010 at the EU Standing Committee on Plant Health in Brussels.

During the course of the inspection discrepancies were found with parcel number D3332905 and D3330911 and the area found eligible for Single Payment Scheme was 44.70ha. These discrepancies included inadequate deductions made for Forestry. As there is an over declaration of over 50%, no payment can be made under the Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Area Compensatory Allowance Scheme for the year in question.Following an appeal, it was decided to overturn the penalty decision and amend the claimed area in question to Forestry. The total area now declared for 2006 Single Payment/ Disadvantaged Area Scheme is 44.69ha.The file is now fully processed and the outstanding payment will issue in due course.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	700	My Department has appointed two former Government office holders to positions in the organisations listed as follows:
Irish Horse Board Co-operative Society
Joe Walsh was appointed by the Minister for Agriculture Fisheries and Food to the Board of the Irish Horse Board Co-operative society on 28th September 2005.  He was appointed Chairperson on joining the Board and retired as Chairperson of the Board on 14th July 2009.  Mr. Walsh remains a Director of the Irish Horse Board Co-operative Society.No salary, director's fees, remuneration or Chairperson's fees were paid to Joe Walsh, neither was a car provided.  Vouched expenses were claimed by him in respect of attending meetings.  These included mileage at civil service rates during the period since 28th September 2005.  The total expenses amounted to €3,214.62.
AgriVision 2015 Committee
Alan Dukes was appointed by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the AgriVision 2015 Committee during 2004.  He was appointed Chairperson on joining the Committee.  Mr. Dukes received a total of €22,000 for his services, which involved chairing all meetings and drafting the AgriVision 2015 Report.Before An Bord Iascaigh Mhara came within the aegis of my Department, the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources made the following appointments to that Board:Mr. Robert Molloy was appointed as a Board member to for the period 14th June 2007 to 13th June 2010.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	701	The application from the person named is being dealt with in one of my Department's local offices in Kerry.  For some time recently, the processing of REPS payments has been delayed in these offices because two vacant supervisory posts remained unfilled in line with the Government's moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the civil service. My Department has now put arrangements in place to resolve the situation. This will enable the processing of claims to proceed and payments to issue without further delay.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	702	The person named submitted an application under the 2005 National Reserve under Categories B and D.Category B catered for farmers, who made an investment between the 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 — 2002.  Investments included the purchase or long-term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.Category D catered for farmers who inherited or purchased land and who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but did not received any direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  In addition specific criteria in relation to off-farm and farm income limit had to be met also.With regard to Category B the application submitted by the person named was in respect of the purchase of land, the leasing of land and other investments.  The application under this category was deemed ineligible, as all documentary evidence required to finalise this category was not submitted despite various requests for the relevant information.With regard to Category D the person named was deemed ineligible under this category as his off farm income exceeded the upper limit of €20,000.A formal letter outlining my Department's decision on the National Reserve issued to the person named on 17 July 2006 and there is no record of an appeal having been submitted by him.  An official from my Department will liaise directly with the person named to establish if there are particular extenuating circumstances pertaining to this case.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	703	There have been many calls on my Department for assistance in recent times, not only in respect of the recognised difficulties in the dairy and sheep sectors, which I addressed through the Dairy Hardship Scheme, the Dairy Efficiency Scheme, the Upland Sheep Payment and the Grassland Sheep Scheme, but also in response to difficulties brought about by adverse weather conditions.  Two issues, which were considered especially worthy of attention, were the fodder losses resulting from the widespread flooding which occurred late last year and the losses experienced in the potatoes and vegetables sector, as a result of the very severe frost in January 2010.Mindful of the hardship and distress caused by the widespread flooding, on 27 November 2009, I announced the introduction of the Fodder Aid Scheme, targeted directly at those farmers who suffered damage to fodder in the affected areas. While I was very anxious that the funding reach the affected farmers as quickly as possible in order that farmers could purchase the feed to feed their animals, it was essential that farmers demonstrate that their fodder was damaged and to what extent. To this end, therefore, it was necessary that each claim be verified by an on-the-spot inspection. I had initially set the closing date for receipt of applications as 11 December 2009, but subsequently extended it by one week. Immediately applications began to be received by my Department, the necessary inspections were begun, following which the successful applications were processed for payment.I am pleased to say that payments commenced issuing on 18 December 2009 and, to date, have issued to 256 applicants nationally, of which, payments have been made to 107 Galway herd-owners.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	704	Payment will issue to the person named within ten working days.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	705	On examination of the application from the person named, my officials concluded that the holding concerned in the application had been artificially created for the purpose of drawing down or maximising benefits under REPS. This decision was conveyed to the person named in a letter dated 3 March 2009.  It is open to the person named to appeal this decision to the Agriculture Appeals Office.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	706	An amended application from the person named is currently being examined in my Department.   The applicant will be informed of the outcome once this examination is complete.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	707	The above named person registered nineteen calves for this scheme in 2009.It is a condition of the Suckler Welfare Scheme that for herds of more than ten animals that a graduated weaning practice be implemented. The animals must be weaned in at least two separate groups with each group being removed at a minimal interval of at least five days.To date payment has not issued to this applicant as sixteen of the calves have been weaned on the same date. Two animals remain to be weaned. One further animal was sold without any of the measures having been carried out and so has been rejected for payment and a penalty may be applied to the payment for the remaining animals.When the information relating to the two animals still to be weaned has been received, the application will be reviewed by my Department and if the conditions of the Scheme were adhered to, by the person named, payment will issue in respect of the remaining animals subject to any penalty that may be applied for the early disposal of one of the animals.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	708	The person concerned is an applicant under the Farm Improvement Scheme. Applications under this Scheme have been processed by my Department up to the level of funding provided for the Scheme in the 2006 Partnership agreement, Towards 2016. As the funding made available for the Scheme has been allocated to the eligible applications received up to 21 October 2007, there are no plans to re-commence processing of the applications received between 22-31 October 2007.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	709	I am satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken to address the objections of the person named in the allocation of shares and that the matter has been fully investigated by my Department. The Scheme that approves the person named for one of the shares is proceeding.  I believe that no useful purpose would be served by another meeting on the matter and I understand that the person named has engaged solicitors instructing them to take legal proceedings on his behalf.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	710	The agreement concluded with pig processors in December 2008 involved making available a facility of up to €180 million from the public finances to assist processors in funding the recall and destruction of certain pork products from the market.To date, a total of €87.5m has been paid to qualifying applicants under the Pigmeat Recall Scheme.  Of this, €41.5m has been paid to 9 primary processors and €46m to 111 secondary processors. In addition to Pig meat payments, €154,000 has been paid to Beef processors for contaminated products under the associated Beef Disposal scheme.  Payments are still continuing and it is not possible to provide a final list of all beneficiaries, or the total sums involved. However, a list of the applicants who have received payment to date is being supplied separately to the Deputy.  No payments have been made to retailers under the Scheme.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	711	My Department has adjudicated that the Sworn Affidavit received from the person named with regard the Single Payment Scheme 2009 confirms proof of postage to the Department of the appropriate Single Payment Scheme application form before the 15th May 2009 i.e. the deadline for receipt of applications. The appropriate payment will now be made to the person named.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	712	The six designated Fishery Harbour Centres, including Killybegs Fishery Harbour Centre, are managed via a statutory fund, known as the Fishery Harbour Centres' Fund, which the Comptroller & Auditor General audits on an annual basis. The most recent audited accounts available are for the year ended 31/12/2006 and show the total income for Killybegs Fishery Harbour Centre for that year to be €1,604,411.Killybegs Fishery Harbour Centre provides a service to the fishing industry, including fish processing and ancillary services and is always open to new and increased business from the fishing industry as well as other commercial activity which is compatible with the needs of the fishing industry.  My Department is conscious of the potential for further growth at Killybegs Fishery Harbour Centre and will take every opportunity to implement the recommendations of both the Killybegs Fishery Harbour Centre Marketing Strategy and the Business Plans for the Development of the Fishery Harbour Centres which were commissioned by my Department.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	713	The harbour at Killybegs is designated as a Fishery Harbour Centre under the Fishery Harbour Centres Acts 1968 (as amended) and is managed and operated by my Department in accordance with these Acts. These Acts provide for the establishment and operation of the Fishery Harbour Centres to promote, develop and carry on sea fishing, fish processing, fishing related activities and matters connected with the fishing industry as well as any other purpose, including the provision, improvement and development of leisure or amenity facilities or for facilitating or promoting the social or economic development of the area in which the Fishery Harbour Centre is located. The 1968 Act was amended in 1998 to broaden how properties owned by the State could be used.My Department has overall responsibility for the development of infrastructure at the Fishery Harbour Centres and for the leasing of property within the harbours. The Harbours are managed via a statutory fund, known as the Fishery Harbour Centres' Fund, which the Comptroller & Auditor General audits on an annual basis.Killybegs Fishery Harbour Centre provides a service to the fishing industry, including fish processing and ancillary services and is always open to new and increased business from the fishing industry as well as other commercial activity which is compatible with the needs of the fishing industry.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	714	Ensuring that foods marketed in Ireland are safe and compliance with relevant food safety legislation is the responsibility of the individual food businesses. Enforcing the legislation is the responsibility of the Food Safety authority of Ireland (FSAI), which delegates that activity to various official agencies under service contracts.In accordance with its service contract with the FSAI, my Department currently supervises some 154 large throughput meat establishments, including nine poultry slaughtering establishments. It is responsible for the provision of ante and post mortem inspection checks, inspections of structural and operational hygiene standards, and controls on residues. The Department also checks imports of poultry from third countries through Border Inspection Posts.From a food safety perspective, hygiene at each stage of the food chain is critically important. In relation to poultry meat , the FSAI has issued guidelines to retailers and consumers on hygienic handling, use by dates and other hygiene aspects, and my Department has issued guidelines to importers and distributors on labelling and use by dates, particularly in gas flushed packs.   My Department will continue to work in close collaboration with the FSAI, to ensure that poultry and other meats comply with the relevant food safety and hygiene regulations.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	715	It is clear from on-going communication between officials of my Department and representatives of relevant stakeholders including Local Authority Veterinary Inspectors, Animal Welfare Organisations and the Horse Industry that horse welfare problems continue to be reported including a risk of abandonment of horses. My officials are continuing to engage with the relevant stakeholders in an effort to keep the issue under review and to respond to current issues relating to horse welfare problems as appropriate.Further meetings are being arranged with Local Authorities who have extensive powers under the Control of Horses Act 1996, to underline how the ongoing effective implementation of this Act by Local Authorities can assist with reducing potential horse welfare problems developing particularly with regard to those horses that are being abandoned. My Department provides annual funding in the region of €2m to Local Authorities to assist in their work in implementing the Control of Horses Act.Through the auspices of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council and particularly its Early Warning Intervention System, Department officials are continuing to work in close cooperation with the ISPCA to address and intervene in potential horse welfare situations before they become critical.  Mindful of the valuable work being done by the welfare organisations and as a contribution towards the cost of their activities, I provided funding of €1.185 million in December 2009 to assist them in their work in 2010. I also urged those welfare organisations that have the capacity to deal with larger animals to consider placing greater resources in promoting horse welfare.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	717	I understand that the relevant payments have now been made to the person in question.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	718	My Department does not have detailed records in all cases of the previous employment history outside the civil service of staff members and therefore details of pension entitlements of staff currently employed in my Department as a result of previous employment in the public sector are not available.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	719	As part of the National Disability Strategy the Sectoral Plan of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the Disability Act, 2005 was published in 2006.  It contained, in particular, a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the participation of people with disabilities in the workplace.In line with the requirement under the Disability Act, 2005 to produce a progress report to the Oireachtas, and a commitment under Towards 2016, a review of the operation of the Sectoral Plan was completed in November, 2009 following consultations with the Department's Consultative Forum on disabilities and other stakeholders. The progress report was laid before the  Oireachtas in February, 2010.  A copy of the Progress Report may be downloaded from this Department's website (www.entemp.ie).  The review indicates that substantial progress has been made on advancing key goals of the Sectoral Plan in regard to employment, training, activation, research, and access to buildings and services.Under the Sectoral Plan the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has led on the advancement of an outline for a Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities in discussions with other Government Departments and stakeholder representatives on the Department's Consultative Forum. The aim of this strategy is to address the diversity of circumstances, needs and abilities of people with disabilities, and to enhance the operation and effectiveness of the range of FÁS supports and services for facilitating increased participation of the cohort in the labour market. The strategy is being further advanced in discussions in a Cross Sectoral Group comprising relevant Government Departments and state agencies.In regard to placements in employment the review indicates that 5,210 people with a disability were placed in employment over the period 2006-2008 — the Sectoral Plan contains an employment target of 7,000 over the period 2006-2010.  Information subsequently available for 2009 indicate that a further 1,497 people with a disability were placed in employment, representing total  placements of 6,707 over the period 2006 –2009.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	720	I propose to take Questions Nos. 373 and 410 together.The Pension Related Deduction (PRD) is a compulsory deduction from salaries of personnel funded by the Oireachtas that have access to a pension scheme. The deductions are made on a week one basis, i.e. each fortnightly payment is regarded in isolation and deductions are made if the amount of pay exceeds the fortnightly exemption levels.  At the end of the financial year, a balancing  exercise is done on a cumulative basis for each person taking into account all their income that attracted the PRD.  Where a person has not exceeded the thresholds, a refund will issue and where a person has underpaid PRD the balance will have to be recovered.The fact that many education personnel work in part-time and substitute capacities in various education sectors has increased the complexity of the year end balancing procedure. In addition, any persons who have had arrears payments which relate to the 2009 financial year have to have adjustments made to take into account the fact that income can be charged at different PRD levels.A system to deal with the reconciliation of PRD payments taking cognisance of the complexities referenced is being developed at present.  Once this development is completed and implemented on the payrolls arrangements will be made to issue refunds, where appropriate, to teachers and special needs assistants at the earliest opportunity.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	721	I understand that the matter in question relates to the Millennium Jobs Club, which is funded by FÁS  and operated by the Moyross Development Company Limited. The primary objective of the Jobs Clubs is to provide training to assist participants who are ready for work to develop skills they can use to find a job. FÁS makes funding available to Jobs Clubs on a nationwide basis in order to cover their running costs. However, the day-to-day operation of each Club is the responsibility of its Jobs Club Leader under the supervision of the Board of Management. At FÁS' request, the Millennium Jobs Club has now ceased the practice referred to and all Jobs Clubs have been made aware of this matter in order that it will not happen again.

It recently wrote to the Board of Management with details of the outcome of this meeting which will see the school remaining on the site in the immediate term. The long term plan for the school will involve the acquisition of a suitable site. My Department will be progressing this issue in the context of its School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	724	Under the terms of my Department's School Transport Scheme, a pupil with special needs will be eligible for school transport if s/he is attending the nearest recognised mainstream school, special class, special school or unit that is, or can be resourced to meet the child's special educational needs under Department of Education and Skills criteria. The purpose of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Needs is to provide a reasonable level of transport service for children with a diagnosed disability and/or special educational need, who, because of the nature of their disability, may not be in a position to avail of a school bus service which would be time-tabled to pick up other children along the route of service. The position is that at the time of enrolment in the unit in question, there was a nearer recognised unit that could have accommodated the pupil referred to in the details supplied by the Deputy. On this basis, the pupil in question is not eligible for a transport service or transport grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	725	I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 2.2 rating, reflecting the fact that the deficit in mainstream accommodation represents a significant proportion of the schools overall needs. Information in respect of the current school building programme, along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website. The Forward Planning Section of my Department has identified 43 priority areas throughout the country where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level in the medium term. Factors considered included population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. The area to which the Deputy refers has not been included on this list.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. At that point, options to meet the schools needs will be considered further. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the  Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	728	I have responded to the letter referred to by the Deputy on behalf of the Justice for Magdalenes Group. In my  response I confirmed that I was aware of the campaign being pursued by the Justice for Magdalenes Group and advised that the position in relation to my Department had been explained both in correspondence with the Group and at the meeting between my officials and representatives of the Group. I noted that the former residents' stories comprise a range of diverse and difficult circumstances from times very much different to those experienced today and that I appreciate the difficulties encountered by these women.I referred to the provision in section 1(3) of the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002 which provides that an applicant who was resident in an institution and was transferred from that institution to another place of residence which carried on the business of a laundry and who suffered abuse while resident in that laundry shall be deemed, at the time of the abuse to have been resident in that institution.  This provision was included on the basis that the State was still responsible for the welfare and protection of  children who were transferred to a laundry from a State regulated institution. I advised that my Department does not hold information on the number of applications made to the Residential Institutions Redress Board where applicants were transferred from scheduled institutions to laundries. I explained that my Department would provide as much assistance as possible particularly in making information available subject to resource and privacy constraints.In this context the records held by my Department relate to children who were admitted to Industrial and Reformatory Schools via the Courts. My Department does not generally hold any records in relation to children who may have been otherwise placed in the Industrial and Reformatory schools, e.g. voluntary placements, Health Authority referrals, etc. nor indeed would my Department hold any records in respect of former residents of the remaining scheduled institutions. Consequently, any records which my Department holds could not be relied upon to accurately quantify the numbers involved.My Department has reviewed the records available in an attempt to identify the incidence of residents being referred to laundries from industrial and reformatory schools. This review identified 261 references of referrals. Of these 3 referrals were to Magdalene laundries (one each to Galway, Limerick and Donnybrook); 95 were to convent laundries, 102 to school laundries and 61 to other laundries. The number of laundries involved is unclear as some locations are listed as school, convent and other laundries.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	729	The Deputy is aware that a new annual school transport charge, which replaced the term charges, was introduced for the 2009/10 school year. The revised charges have been confined to eligible post-primary children and primary and post primary children availing of concessionary transport. Charges continue to be waived in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical card. Eligible children attending primary schools and children with special needs still travel free. This new method of payment assists Bus Éireann in planning an efficient and cost-effective school transport service well in advance of a school year based on the level of demand for seats. It also provides comfort to parents in the knowledge that on payment of the charge, a seat is guaranteed for the school year in question. As previously advised, my Department, in conjunction with Bus Éireann, is reviewing aspects of the current arrangements in the light of experiences this year.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	730	In 2004, agreement to amalgamate was reached by the two primary schools in the area referred to by the Deputy. Due to accommodation concerns the amalgamation did not progress at that time. A technical inspection was carried out on the existing school buildings to determine which would be suitable to accommodate the amalgamated school. The report following this inspection concluded that neither of the locations would be suitable. The progression of this building project and the acquisition of a site required to facilitate the amalgamation, will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	732	It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected. Equality legislation, which also outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The legislation provides that any school that has this objective may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.The position is that the vast majority of primary schools are, and will continue to be, Catholic in ethos. It is also the case that such schools have  historically welcomed pupils from all backgrounds and still do. However, more recently, other models of patronage have emerged which have widened the range of choice available to parents. The rapid pace of social and demographic change in Ireland is now reflected in a radically altered and more diverse society from which our school communities are drawn and as the school system further evolves, we will be seeking to ensure that all our schools reflect and represent the communities in which they are based.

Students  attending St. Patrick's College Drumcondra and Mary Immaculate College Limerick are awarded an honours level 8 Bachelor of Education degree at the end of three years.  Students attending the other three Colleges of Education are  awarded a Bachelor of Education degree at ordinary level (level 7) at the end  of three years, but suitably qualified students who wish to read for an honours  degree (level 8) may register for a fourth year of study. This additional year  may be undertaken at any time after completion of the Bachelor of Education  degree, and students may hold teaching posts while continuing their studies.Persons who successfully complete the Bachelor of Education are eligible to  apply for registration with the Teaching Council and, once registered, will be  deemed qualified to teach in the country's primary schools. No further course  of study is required for recognition as a primary teacher.Four of the Colleges of Education also offer an 18-month post graduate primary  teacher education course for holders of suitable university degrees.  Graduates  from St. Patrick's College and Mary Immaculate College are awarded a Graduate  Diploma in Education (Primary Teaching) and graduates from Froebel College and Coláiste Mhuire, MIE are awarded a Higher Diploma in Education (Primary).  The post graduate course was introduced as a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers. It was first provided in the 1995/96 academic year and has been repeated almost each year since then.  The latest course commenced in February 2010 with a total approved intake of 200 students.Persons who successfully complete the Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary Teaching)/ Higher Diploma in Education (Primary) are eligible to apply for registration with the Teaching Council and, once registered, will be deemed  qualified to teach in the country's primary schools.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	735	I propose to take Questions Nos. 388 to 391, inclusive, together.The Deputy will be aware that the current difficult economic circumstances have  necessitated tough choices to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In these circumstances, from September 2010, as  announced in the Budget, all new applicants who are in receipt of the Back to  Education Allowance (BTEA), and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC  courses, will be ineligible for student maintenance grants. The cost of the  student services charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be  met for eligible students by the Exchequer on their behalf.  It was decided to  discontinue the practice of allowing students to hold both the BTEA or VTOS  allowance and a student maintenance grant simultaneously as this represents a  duplication of income support payments.Students currently in receipt of the BTEA or VTOS allowances and the  maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the  duration of their current course provided they continue to meet the terms and  conditions of the relevant grant schemes. Students progressing to a new course  with effect from 2010/11 will no longer be eligible for student maintenance  grants but can apply for assistance towards the cost of the student services  charge and any fees payable.Although BTEA students progressing to a new course or new applicants who are in receipt of the BTEA will no longer be able to hold the maintenance portion of the student grant in addition to the BTEA, they may still submit a student grant application to establish entitlement to payment of the student service charge or tuition fees.Students who qualify for maintenance grants will continue to receive substantial grant funding, together with full support for payment of the student service charge. Those on particularly low incomes will also continue to receive a "top-up" in the special rate of maintenance grant.Under the student grant schemes a mature candidate, if approved, is  automatically provided with the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance which,  this year, ranges from €810 to €6,355 depending on individual circumstances.  The entitlement to the non-adjacent rate applies regardless of how far the  college is from the mature candidates residence and whether or not the  candidate is dependent on or independent of his/her parent(s) or guardian(s).Students should apply to their assessing authority to have their eligibility  assessed. The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the  first instance, for the relevant assessing authority, i.e. the applicant's  local authority or VEC. An applicant may appeal the decision to the relevant  local authority or VEC.Where the assessing authority decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may  appeal this decision to my Department by submitting an appeal form outlining  clearly the grounds for the appeal.The NDP funded Third Level Access Measure is also supporting the participation of mature students in higher education, in particular those from  socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The Student Assistance Fund is  available in all recurrently funded higher education institutions. The objective of the fund is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Mature students who have additional needs arising due to a disability or learning difficulty can make an application to the Fund for Students with Disabilities. Applications for support can be made via the access or disability service in the institution. The access offices themselves will also continue to provide support and advice to mature students to enable them to continue with their studies.

The impact of the moratorium is  therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion.   I am conscious that the impact of the moratorium on middle management posts has applied unevenly in schools depending on the level of retirements. My  Department is going to look at how some limited alleviation of the position  might be applied for the coming school year for schools that have been acutely  affected by the moratorium.   In this regard my Department is in discussions with the Department of Finance  regarding the detail of such alleviation measures and schools will be advised  of the outcome in due course.   It is a matter for school authorities to re-organise and prioritise, as best as possible, the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the context of implementing the moratorium.

The staffing schedule for the coming school year was recently published by my  Department. The additional posts in the renewed Programme for Government  enabled some improvement to be made to the staffing schedule.   The staffing schedule includes an appeals mechanism for schools who are  dissatisfied with their staffing allocation. The appeals criteria are outlined in the published staffing schedule which is available on my Department's website. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.

Foremost of these is the number of retirements among serving principals of which non-compulsory retirements is the biggest factor.  While the number of non-compulsory retirements in respect of the next ten years is not known, the recent retirement trends of principal teachers may be indicative.Retirement figures for principal teachers for the past three years are:YearPrimaryPost-Primary2007167542008173562009321100This is based on Department held data with a pro-rata adjustment to include VEC schools.The number of new schools and school closures will also impact on the demand for new principals.  The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried  out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years.  This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social & Family Affairs with reference to recent schools' enrolment data. The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 identified locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas.Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out detailed analysis and reports for each of these locations in order to identify the school accommodation  requirements for each area up to and including the school year 2014/2015.  When the required reports have been completed for the initial areas Forward Planning  Section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country.  Overall primary and post primary accommodation requirements will be analysed as part of this process.

Comhartha air seo an chaoi inar aithníodh líon suntasach Gaelscoileanna nua le blianta beaga anuas — 17 ar fad ó 2005 i leith.B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé le fios ag an Teachta go bhfuil an Coimisiún um Chóiríocht Scoileanna ag athbhreithniú faoi láthair na nósanna imeachta do bhunscoileanna a bhunú.

In general, students who previously pursued a course of study are not eligible for grant assistance or free tuition fees in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant or tuition fees were paid previously.The main objective of this policy is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining one undergraduate degree and in progressing, where appropriate, to a postgraduate course of study.  Subject to the conditions of the individual schemes, free tuition and grants are available where students are progressing to a course at a higher level.The decision on eligibility for student grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority — i.e. the Local Authority or VEC.  These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the assessing authority, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in her/his case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.No appeal has been received by my Department to date from the candidate referred to by the Deputy.Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved full/part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level colleges and universities in the State and any other EU Member State. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	748	The key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department at individual school level for any school year is the pupil enrolment at the previous 30 September.  The enrolment is applied to a staffing schedule which issues annually from my Department.According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to, the school's enrolment on 30th September 2009 was 62 pupils.  In accordance with the 2010/2011 staffing schedule (Circular 0021/2010), which is available on my Department's website, the mainstream staffing in the school for the coming school year will be Principal and 2 mainstream class teachers.The school in question is a Junior School and is included in Band 1 of the urban strand of the School Support Programme (SSP) under DEIS for staffing purposes for which the class size guidelines are 20:1 in junior classes (junior infants through to second class).  The staffing allocation under DEIS is a top-up allocation based on the number of pupils enrolled for whom no additional supports have already been granted i.e. Traveller pupils.  The enrolment of this school for consideration under the DEIS top-up allocation is 57 pupils and does not warrant the retention of the DEIS teaching post for the 2010/2011 school year.Having regard to the number of pupils enrolled at the school, I am satisfied that the level of teaching resources provided represents an adequate response for a Primary DEIS Band 1 junior school.

A new school is planned to replace the College's existing building and the project is one of eight new schools which were approved for inclusion in the 3rd Bundle of schools to be procured via Public Private Partnership.  The Department of Education & Science operates the Design Build Finance and Maintain (DBFO) model as the preferred option for PPP projects.  This provides  that the maintenance of the buildings over the 25 year period of the contract becomes the responsibility of the PPP Operator and ancillary staff currently employed by the school will be given the option, under EU legislation, of transferring their employment to the PPP Company.In early 2009, during the initial stakeholders' consultation in the College the ancillary staff currently employed by the VEC were informed that they will be offered the option to transfer their employment to the successful PPP Operator in due course.  Following representations from the person mentioned in the Deputy's question and his union representative the options open to the ancillary staff who may wish to transfer are being explored further.

Over €1 billion is being spent in supporting special educational provision this year.My Department is very supportive of the special needs assistants (SNA) scheme.  It has been a key factor in both ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes.I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the current review of SNAs is intended to ensure that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts are properly met and that there is a consistent application of policy in relation to the allocation of special needs supports across the country.  I am on record in the House refuting claims that my Department had given a target to the NCSE for reducing the number of SNAs.  This is not the case. The terms and criteria for the SNA scheme have not changed and the NCSE continues to allocate additional posts where the criteria are met.At the same time, it has to be recognised that children with special educational needs progress and develop over time.  Children also leave school for a number of reasons.  It is good practice for supports to be varied and adjusted in line with such progress and development and for posts to be withdrawn where pupils have left the school.Accordingly, the current review is not incompatible with either of the Articles referenced by the Deputy.

In some schools, the programme is compulsory for all students.In those that offer it as an option, circumstances may arise where it is necessary to limit the number of students who can avail of it. In such cases, it is the board of management that decides the number of places available to students.  In cases where restrictions apply, schools should have clear procedures regarding how places are allocated to students.There is no inherent reason TY should not be made available as an option to students intending to pursue the Leaving Certificate Applied or Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	756	In Ireland, the 1998 Education Act provides the legal framework for the delivery of education to children.Under the Education Act, 1998 the day to day management of schools is a matter for the Board of Management. Specifically, Section 15(1) of the Act provides that "It shall be the duty of a board to manage the school on behalf of the patron and for the benefit of the students and their parents and to provide or cause to be provided an appropriate education for each student at the school for which that Board has responsibility".Under Section 20 of the Act, Boards of Management must establish procedures for informing the parents of children in the school of matters relating to the operation and performance of the school. The Act provides that parental concerns should be determined in the school concerned and appealed to its Board of Management.Where parents raise a concern with schools, I support the approach whereby schools keep parents informed throughout the decision making process; and inform parents of both its decision as well as the reasons for its decision.  Parents are mindful that issues relating to a member of staff have to be dealt with by the school management in the context of an employer/employee  relationship.Under Section 29 of the Act, specific provision was made for parental right to appeal decisions taken by a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board to expel, or suspend a pupil for a period greater than 20 days, or refuses to enrol a student. Parents can appeal such decision either to the relevant Vocational Educational Committee, in the first instance for VEC schools, or to the Secretary General of my Department.The intention that lies behind this distinction in the legislation is clear.  Suspension,  expulsion, or refusal to enrol students are very serious decisions that can have a major impact on the education of the individual pupils concerned. The legislation provides for the appeals to the Secretary General of my Department to be heard by an independent committee. Committees are comprised of a serving School Inspector and two other persons nominated from a panel appointed by the Minister. The committee members comprise persons with previous experience and expertise in the educational field. In making a determination on a Section 29 appeal, the committee will provide evidence of the material it considered and reasons for its decision.A recent High Court judgment on one Section 29 determination by an appeal committee has altered the scope of the determinations by these committees. Clarity on this High Court judgment is being sought through the Supreme Court, which is due to hear the appeal over the coming days. This clarity will assist with drafting of regulations and legislation in this area in the future, as well as informing the implementation of the commitment in the Programme for Government to ‘examine how best school governance systems can evolve to better include parents and students in decision-making in schools and develop a new regulatory framework for school enrolment'.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	757	The Education Act 1998  provides the broad framework for our education system and sets out the main roles, rights and responsibilities of the various parties to our education system.  An extensive range of supports and guidance material, including Department Circulars, is in place to assist and guide schools in carrying out their day to day activities.The Education Act 1998 provides the Minister with the power to make regulations relating to a range of issues concerning the provision of education by schools.  Rather than engage in an exercise to review the act itself, the incremental use of those regulatory powers where appropriate to replace and supplement existing rules and circulars is favoured.

On his appointment to the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) the payment of his teacher's pension ceased. The person concerned is in receipt of a gross salary of €79,238.At the recruitment stage, once the Department becomes aware that an officer is in receipt of a public service pension, arrangements are put in place  in order that the pension is abated for the duration of their employment with this Department. Officers who join the Department with previous public service can opt to preserve their benefits until pension age or if they so wish, they can  opt to transfer their service, if appropriate for inclusion in the civil service pension schemes.

My Department's Teacher Allocation Section is currently focused on the initial work for the allocation of staffing for the coming school year and I do not propose to divert them from this work at this key time in the allocation process.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	760	My Department provides funds for over thirty projects in Local Drugs Task Force areas, including the project specifically referred to by the Deputy.  The projects are mainly administered by the three VECs in Dublin City, Dublin County and in Dún Laoghaire.In the context of the budget for 2010 and the difficult fiscal climate, it was decided that funding for these projects was to be reduced from €3,643,000 in 2009 to €2,461,000 in 2010. While the overall Departmental reduction in the 2010 allocation is 32%, it was a matter for the VECs to prioritise funding for individual projects within the allocation provided.  In that context, it is understood that the project at the school in question will cease operation at the end of the current school year.It is important to note that the school in question is included in DEIS, the Department's action plan for educational inclusion which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The supports for schools include:additional capitation funding based on levels of disadvantage;additional funding for school books;access to the School Meals Programme;access to Home School Community Liaison with one Full time HSCL Coordinator appointed to this school;access to the School Completion Programme — in the region of €327,000 was allocated to the SCP project, which includes this school and two primary schools. SCP Projects must devise a collaborative programme of in-school, after-school and holiday-time interventions that will prevent early school leaving and support young people with characteristics and behaviour that are indicative of real risk. Each project employs a local Coordinator to run the project at local level;enhanced guidance counselling provision;access to planning supports;provision for a school library and librarian support in post primary schools with most disadvantage;access to the Junior Certificate School Programme and Leaving Certificate Applied;access to a range of professional development supports.
