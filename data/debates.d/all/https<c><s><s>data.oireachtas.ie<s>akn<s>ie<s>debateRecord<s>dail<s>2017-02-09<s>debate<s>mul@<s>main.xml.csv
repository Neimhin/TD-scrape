#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	0	I welcome the opportunity to address the issues raised in the harrowing "RTÉ Investigates" programme, "Living on the List". People all over Ireland watching the programme found it hard to bear the pain and anxiety etched on the faces of the men, women and especially children who very bravely told their stories, and the shattering impact on those who love and care for them. I was genuine and truthful about my feelings on watching the programme. I will not defend the indefensible or excuse the inexcusable. Offering my honest response should not, however, be portrayed as being the only response I have offered. Today, I want to outline to the House the actions that were and are being taken, both before and after the programme, to address the long waiting lists that so traumatically affect patients. When I became Minister for Health I was aware that I would receive increased funding for waiting list initiatives in the budget. However, I did not want to wait until then as the numbers were growing and the trajectory being forecast by my Department and the Health Service Executive was frightening. Something had to be done, even with limited additional resources and a short timeframe, to try to make a difference and I knew where I wanted to start. I unapologetically targeted resources at specialties with particularly long waiting lists, such as scoliosis and orthopaedics, through the winter initiative, and treating those patients waiting the longest by requesting the HSE to put in place an action plan to halve the number of patients waiting for 18 months or more for inpatient or day case procedures. Through this action plan, more than 11,500 patients came off the inpatient day case waiting list between August and December 2016, reducing the number of patients waiting more than 18 months for treatment by more than 50%. While there are obviously still too many people waiting, the priority in 2016 was to reduce the number of long-waiting patients and the HSE, through its efforts, made considerable strides in this regard. Public hospitals showed they could deliver on sharing capacity and working together across hospital groups and the country. For example, 24 orthopaedic cases from Tullamore hospital were undertaken in Kilkenny hospital, 150 orthopaedic cases received treatment in Cappagh hospital on behalf of St. James's, Tullamore, Beaumont, Tallaght and Crumlin hospitals, and 34 adolescent scoliosis cases took place in the Mater hospital on behalf of Tallaght hospital. Also in 2016, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, undertook an endoscopy waiting list initiative to arrange for the provision of endoscopy procedures to patients waiting for longer than 12 months. By the end of December, more than 5,500 people had come off the waiting list and the NTPF had managed to clear more than 99% of those waiting longest on the list. I want to do more in 2017 and we will do more. This is a priority for me, the Government and the people of this country. The NTPF allocation for 2017 will utilise capacity in the private acute hospital sector to provide treatment for our longest waiting patients on the inpatient-day case waiting list. The HSE will also submit an action plan to improve waiting lists in the public acute hospital sector for inpatients and day cases, as well as outpatients. Starting with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, in budget 2017 an allocation of €20 million was made to the fund and an additional allocation of €55 million has been made for 2018. In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF to dedicate €5 million to a day case waiting list initiative, with the aim of ensuring that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a day case procedure by 30 June 2017. It is expected that in excess of 2,000 patients will receive treatment through this process, commencing in March. The main areas of focus will be on lists with large numbers of long-waiting patients, namely, ear, nose and throat or ENT, ophthalmology, general surgery, dental, urology and vascular surgery. The HSE will also submit a waiting list action plan for 2017 by the end of this month. The plan will concentrate on reducing the length of time patients wait for an inpatient, day case or outpatient appointment, with the aim of having no patient waiting longer than 15 months by the end of October. While I consider this is still much too long, it would mark a significant reduction in waiting times, with the aim of reducing waiting lists further. To ensure the best outcome for patients who are waiting, the HSE and NTPF will and must work together to utilise capacity in the public and private sectors. The plan will also be supported by the NTPF's proposal for a further €10 million of funding for patient treatment in 2017. In addition, I have requested that the HSE produce an action plan for scoliosis, which will be a targeted initiative prioritising scoliosis patients, and to focus on gynaecology, an issue discussed in the House many times, and cardiology. Before I address other issues raised by the documentary broadcast on Monday night, I am sure we all agree that it was particularly difficult to watch the plight of Megan, Kira and Darragh who are waiting for scoliosis treatment. I was humbled by their courage and that of their parents. I am keenly aware of their burden and I stress my commitment to addressing the service problems they face. Additional funding has been provided in recent years to develop paediatric orthopaedic services, including scoliosis services. I made available €2 million under the winter initiative in 2016 and more than 50 additional patients - children and teenagers - have been treated under this initiative to date. As a result, while we have made some progress, there is much more to do to provide the level of service needed. On Tuesday, I met the chief executive officers of the children’s hospital group and Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital in Crumlin to discuss immediate action they can take to reduce wailing lists for children and adolescents with scoliosis. Although the new theatre in Crumlin was commissioned in 2016, it is only now being opened due to challenges with recruiting nurses. The hospital has undertaken an aggressive recruitment drive to attract new theatre nurses and I commend it on doing so. As a result of this drive, four new nurses will be in place by April and a further 16 international nurses have been offered posts and have commenced the registration process in Ireland.The recruitment of these nurses means that the new theatre will provide the additional capacity for scoliosis procedures from April, as the nurses take up post. In addition, an orthopaedic surgeon post in Crumlin hospital will be filled in June, which will provide further capacity in that hospital and theatre this summer. As a result, Crumlin hospital expects to undertake 194 spinal procedures by the end of 2017, which is considerably more than last year, and this is expected to achieve significant reductions in waiting lists for scoliosis procedures and, most importantly, waiting times. Furthermore, bearing in mind the serious long-term health consequences for children with scoliosis, a specific action plan on scoliosis will be submitted to me by the end of the month. This plan will take on board the concerns of the advocacy groups in respect of scoliosis. My absolute commitment to families with children with scoliosis and to those with scoliosis is that this will be an absolute priority in 2017. As Deputies will know, I have asked the NTPF to audit the practices in the hospitals highlighted by the individual cases featured in the programme on RTE. This means going in and auditing how waiting lists were addressed in each of the hospitals referred to in the programme. I wish to clarify an issue about NTPF data and waiting lists that was raised in the documentary. Since its establishment and in line with international protocols, NTPF published waiting list data has consistently excluded patients classified as pre-admit and planned procedure. Contrary to some political charges, this was not a decision made by me but one that has been in place since 2002. However, the NTPF is undertaking a project in conjunction with Trinity College Dublin to examine updated international best practice around waiting list data publication models. I will adopt its findings in full. Deputy Louise O'Reilly has made a good suggestion on integrated waiting lists and I will meet her next week about it. There is a lot of merit in what she says. She has been pursuing this with me for some time, which I acknowledge. Before I conclude, I acknowledge that waiting list figures for January were published yesterday and, obviously, I am disappointed to see the figures go up, but I cannot be surprised. I knew the figures would increase because they tend to increase every January with the pressures on our emergency departments and as the action plan for the last year comes to an end. Due to the ongoing demands on our emergency departments and in order for the measures in train and those planned for the coming months to start having an impact, I am aware that it will take some time this year for our waiting list figures to start to go down. However, we will ensure that every patient in the country is waiting a shorter time for a hospital procedure or appointment by the end of this year. I believe that we can do better for our patients. I do not believe that the challenges facing our health service will be solved purely by resources alone. Yes, resources are an issue, but if it was all about resources we would not have had any problems in the health service during Celtic Tiger Ireland. This is not just about resources. It is about how money is spent, how budgets are implemented and how hospitals are managed. These are all factors. We are reinvesting in our health service after some extremely difficult years but we have to be careful and must underpin this increased funding with new and tougher accountability rules. I want to see the performance and accountability framework deliver for patients and taxpayers. It is designed to do both. I want to be clear: we have some really excellent managers in our health service. I meet them and I know them as do other Deputies. However, there is definitely room to do more. I reject any assertion that we are already doing all that we can and that there is no room for improvement in terms of how the health service is managed. I think we all recognise as well that we face a complex and multidimensional challenge. We are living longer and healthier than ever before, which is something to be celebrated. However, it also means that there are more demands on our health service. Every year, our acute health system delivers more than 3.2 million outpatient attendances in our hospitals, 94,000 patients have elective inpatient procedures and 1 million have a planned day case procedure, and the demand continues to rise. This is down to the hard work of front-line staff throughout our health service. We all know that, if we want to break the vicious cycle, we need to take the fundamental reforms, to have our ten-year plan, to address bed capacity and recruitment and to not play party politics with our health service.

I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue because the "Living On The List" programme by RTÉ's "Prime Time Investigates" was a devastating critique of what is happening daily in people's lives throughout the country. The sad reality is that it is nothing new. In that context, in the area of scoliosis, on 16 November last, using pseudonyms, I read into the record of the House during a Topical Issue debate that was taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, an outline of the cases of some of the people who appeared in the programme, which was devastating to watch last Monday night. However, we should not be surprised because what has been happening over the past six years was always going to result in waiting lists escalating, people waiting inordinate periods of time, and more and more people depending on a public hospital system that had a shrinking capacity. Not only did it have a shrinking capacity but there was increased demand on it. The only safety valve that was available was the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, which was scrapped in 2011. Therefore, we were always going to arrive at this position. We on this side of the House have consistently highlighted that capacity was a major problem, but nothing was done. The Fine Gael Minister for Health, James Reilly, who is the deputy leader of Fine Gael, stated at the time that it was not all about beds and capacity. He is right, but we subsequently found out that our hospitals are running at 100% on a continual basis. There is no room to deal with winter flu and bug problems or infectious disease problems, etc. There is no room in our hospital systems. The Minister for Health knows that as did his predecessor and his predecessor before him. The only avenue available to address the issues of scoliosis and many other elective surgeries that are urgently needed was through the NTPF, which was shelved. By the Minister's own admission, that was a mistake and he reintroduced it. We now have a situation where the management in the HSE has been blamed consistently over recent weeks. I have no difficulty with HSE management being held to account. It should be held to account.

The Minister is a bit like a nasty jockey on a very tired horse that is trying to get him up to the line and using the whip too much. The bottom line is that the HSE simply has not got adequate resources in certain areas to deal with these waiting lists and there is consistent spin in the past week that it is all the HSE's fault. The bottom line is that the previous two Ministers for Health were from the Minister's own party. They were James Reilly, who was removed and sent to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and Deputy Varadkar, who was removed and slipped off into the Department of Social Protection. The bottom line is that Fine Gael's policies have absolutely failed and for a number of reasons. First, Fine Gael said that it would commit to universal health insurance. For the first three of the last six years, Fine Gael spoke about universal health insurance and tearing up the HSE and getting rid of it. The only thing that happened was the then Minister, James Reilly, sacked the HSE board. The reason I am saying this is that we are shattered from talking about reform. We are talking about it endlessly but we are not talking about delivery of services to patients. Patients are consistently waiting inordinate periods for outpatient and inpatient appointments, procedures and diagnostics. We now find that 633,000 people are waiting, which is a shameful indictment. The bottom line is that the vast majority rests with the policies that the Government has not been pursuing over the past number of years, that is, trying to expand capacity in the key areas where there was an inordinate waiting list as opposed to flexing the muscles and threatening the HSE with abolition and not doing it and threatening that managers would be sacked but not doing so. Does the Minister have confidence in the management? The first thing I have to ask is if the Minister has confidence in Mr. O'Brien because he is the top manager. If he is to be honest with himself, the Minister will have to start by looking at the top if he does not have confidence in management. Let us get real, let us focus on patients and let us stop this undermining of the organisation that is charged with the responsibility of delivering health care.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	5	At this stage, the stones on the road know that we have many problems in our health service but what is needed is action. We are beyond the periodic outrage that we show in the House following an RTÉ programme or whatever local case some Deputy raises and we need to focus on tangible solutions. As far as I am concerned, our health service is focused exclusively on budgets by non-clinical personnel. That is wrong. As Deputy Kelleher noted, it is not focused on patients but on budgets. There are layers of management. I do not want to be critical of individuals who are setting out to do their jobs as best they can but the reality is that the level of autonomy and management that needs to be given to clinicians has not being given so far. Yes, we have decimated the numbers of personnel through the recruitment ban during the years of the crash.We have taken thousands of beds out of the system and we need to focus on this. The €20 million allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund for this year is insufficient. I appeal to the Minister to contact the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before the day is out. There should be an emergency Cabinet meeting if necessary because many hundreds of millions must be allocated to the fund if we are to truly begin to deal with the problem. We also need to focus heavily on capacity. How many times do we need to hear Fergal Hickey on the national airwaves saying, in his expert opinion, that extra acute beds are needed? Many Deputies have pointed out ad nauseam that we need to relax the means test on the carer's allowance so that we can capitalise on the goodwill of people to care for elderly people at home and give them the dignity to remain at home. This needs to be backed with a freer availability of medical cards, housing adaptation grants and other supports. There needs to be more clinical autonomy in order that GPs can deal with things like mild trauma by having instantaneous access to diagnostics, meaning acute beds are not taken up by people waiting for CT scans, MRIs and so on. We need to focus on retaining and attracting staff. Despite the individual best intentions of those involved in management and administration in the health service, it is dysfunctional and does not work to the extent we need. We need to strip out layers of management. I spoke to a group of nurses this morning and they told me conditions are worse than 25 years ago. That is unacceptable. We need less debate, less outrage and less manufactured shock and horror from RTE programmes and the stories we hear in our clinics. Tangible action needs to be taken.  The message I give to the Government today is that €20 million for the NTPF will not cut the mustard. It will need €100 million, and maybe more, to eat into the problem while stripping out layers of management and retaining and attracting more staff. I have no difficulty with managers who do their best but we cannot run our health service like a business. It is not a business but a service that costs money to run. It should be non-profitable but this is difficult to achieve. When there was a matron and a county surgeon the janitor, the consultant, the nurse, the GP and the patient shivered in their boots when they walked along the corridor. The buck stopped with them but nobody knows where the buck stops any more.

RTE could do a follow-on series on therapies for children and the elderly, relating to which there is a raft of issues but there does not seem to be any urgency to tackle these problems. There has been constant news of people waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency units. I have been in accident and emergency units with relatives on three occasions in recent months and a series of "Prime Time" programmes is coming down the tracks on this issue too. What is happening there is totally unacceptable. I hope the Minister is being fully briefed about the crisis because it is going to be highlighted in many television programmes. Deputies have been inundated with complaints from constituents about the chronic waiting lists, and about staff in accident and emergency units being run off their feet trying to cope. On one occasion people were taken from beds and put in chairs. I have heard of people on stretchers in ambulances not being allowed out of the ambulance because there was nowhere to put them. This was in the past four or five weeks and not 50 or 60 years ago or in wartime Vietnam. There is a massive crisis in the health service. Waiting lists are one issue but there is a crisis across the whole spectrum.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	7	Táim buíoch as an deis labhartha ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo. On Tuesday I raised with the Taoiseach the scandal of tens of thousands of patients being omitted from official waiting list numbers, as published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund and highlighted by the "RTE Investigates" programme on Monday night. The bravery of families in these situations is heroic and their anguish is millteanach dona. I want to raise the case of Jade Doran from Letterkenny. She is a 19-year old student studying law. She has had ENT problems for years and is going deaf in both ears. She has been seen by a consultant and been advised that she needs hearing aids. She is now on a waiting list but has received no indication of a timeframe and no follow-up appointment. Jade also has a problem with her knee and has Osgood-Schlatter disease. She has been on a waiting list for orthopaedics for four years. She is studying and all of this is affecting her studies, with the uncertainty making the situation even worse. It is patients like Jade and her family who are affected by the scandal of the waiting list crisis and it is for people like Jade that solutions must be found. That is why I put Sinn Féin's proposals directly to the Taoiseach for a single, integrated hospital waiting management scheme. Teachta O'Reilly sent this to the Minister last September but he did not even bother meeting her. I commend the proposition to the Minister again. I ask him to consider, as he said he would, introducing a system that serves patients like Jade.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	8	I would like to refresh the Minister's memory by going back to August 2016 and another Fine Gael five-point plan, a five-point plan to tackle waiting lists. One might have thought the Minister would have learned his lesson as regards five-point plans but apparently not. One of the points in the plan was to make sure waiting lists were accurate and that there would be a clinical validation of waiting lists. After this week's revelations, nothing could be clearer than the fact that the waiting lists, as presented to us, are far from accurate. Was hiding these 49,000 people on waiting lists part of the Minister's clinical validation? Was the change in the classification used by the NTPF early this year part of this clinical validation? Can the Minister share with us the reason the protocol used by the NTPF from 2014 to 2017 was abruptly changed earlier this year, with no fanfare and no launch but a radical departure in how the to-come-in, TCI, patients are defined? I sincerely hope this change was not prompted by panic at the realisation that the waiting list figures reflected very badly on this Minister and his plans, five-point or whatever, to reduce waiting times. The NTPF issued a statement after the "RTE Investigates" programme to the effect that, "in line with international best practices published waiting list data excludes patients classified as pre-admit and preplanned procedures". The preplanned procedures in this case are the TCIs. What is disturbing about this statement is that the protocol used by the NTPF, dated 2014 and in use up until a few weeks ago, provided for the publication of the TCI figures. International best practice does not change overnight and it certainly does not change to suit the agenda of a Government running scared from its own abysmal failures. I am deeply disturbed about this. As the protocol dated 2014 has disappeared from the NTPF website, was it discredited? What international best practice caused the change? I sincerely hope this change in protocol was not decided on simply to put off awkward questions. It seems to me that this protocol, and the reference to international best practice, magically appeared just as the figures waiting for treatment magically disappeared. This is not good enough and the Minister has to explain this fundamental shift in policy. Was it directed by his office? Was it directed by the HSE? Did the NTPF take it upon themselves? That is some classy validation process the Minister has going on there and we saw its effects on Monday night. Rather than focusing on taking people off the lists who the Minister thinks should not be on them, he should ensure that the body into which he is pumping millions is transparent in its data collection and conforms to international best practice. Indeed, the Taoiseach made an important point on Tuesday during Leaders' Questions, when he said:The list system is nothing new. It has been in place since 2002 and the counting of the list has always been the same. It is nothing new under this or any previous Minister in the 15 years since it was established.What he did not say is that there has been a fundamental change in what is published. This makes the scandal worse. The Government is still recording the figures. It is just being very creative with those it publishes so as to make its five-point plan look like it is working. Let us look at the reality behind the smokescreen. When we strip away the smoke and mirrors, we see that the numbers waiting longer than 18 months for inpatient day cases trebled from 459 on 31 December 2015 to 1,738 on 30 December 2016. Every one of these figures is a real person. The Minister has said he is ashamed they have been left waiting, and he should be. However, he should be more ashamed at his public congratulations of the HSE, which he was very quick to throw under a bus when it suited him. He should be ashamed at the manner in which the figures were manipulated. Yet Fianna Fáil retains its enthusiasm to pump vital public funds into this body, which has proven itself incapable of being honest with the data. Are we really back to a situation like that of the banks, investing public funds into something that is so out of touch with international best practice? Deputy Billy Kelleher said the advent of new politics means things have to be done differently. However, it does not mean we pretend we have forgotten what Fianna Fáil did in government. We cannot forget that Fianna Fáil is very much a major part of the NTPF's past. It does not stop there. There have been initiatives before the Government's five-point plan. In 1993, under Deputy Brendan Howlin, the coalition Government established the waiting list initiative. In 2002, the NTPF was established. In 2011, then Deputy James Reilly oversaw the establishment of the special delivery unit, supposedly to reduce waiting times. What do all these have in common? Each one failed, as the Government's five-point plan has failed. We need to get to the nub of the issue that perpetuates the waiting list and trolley crisis, namely, capacity, or the lack thereof, in our public system. Over a decade of pouring hundreds of millions of euro into the NTPF is proof that it does not address the underlying causes of the long waits for public patients in the first place. This week's revelations show that the waiting time for public patients, as articulated by the NTPF, have not been accurate. The Minister would be better off investing public funds in a new system, the digital solutions that are required to modernise our health service, than relying on the NTPF which has demonstrated that it cannot count or publish the figures accurately. Investment in developing capacity in the public health system would be much more beneficial in the long run. Sinn Féin has proposed a new system of integrated hospital waiting list management, whereby people can move from one hospital to another to reduce waiting times. I very much look forward to meeting the Minister and considering our Comhliosta plan. However, I have to say it is regrettable that I have written to the Minister three times since August to ask for a meeting to discuss it. Now, following all the hoopla, we will have the meeting and it is to be welcomed. The Minister does not seem to be very interested in solutions. He seems to be very interested in spin, which is very regrettable.

He is fooling nobody. In real life, what lies behind those figures are the people who come into our advice clinics day in, day out, people such as Oliver, a young lad in Lusk, who has been waiting for an appointment with a gastrointestinal specialist in Crumlin. He has missed 50 days of school. He will never get those days back. It is not just what we saw on RTE. Every person on the programme represents another 10, 20, 30, 40 or 1,000 people who wait every day in pain and parents who watch their children in agony, slipping behind because they are in too much pain to go to school. I have heard the Minister's promises and I am not convinced. Most important, the children, their families and the people we saw on Monday night need more than tea and sympathy. They need more than promises and fine words. They need action. As I have said many times, it is counterintuitive to imagine pumping money into the private sector will, somehow, magically improve the public sector. It will not. Our nurses will go on strike during the coming weeks. They work in the public sector. However, their colleagues are transferring into the private sector. They are following the Minister's money into the private sector. It is wrong. We need to invest in the public sector and support our nurses.

Having seen the programme on RTE, we saw the real-life situation for so many people who are on waiting lists. There is a need for an independent review to determine whether any deception in the compilation of waiting lists has taken place, or if there has been a deliberate attempt to mislead people regarding the official figures. The Minister must commission an independent review of how waiting lists are being compiled and audit the accuracy of the data being presented. An internal NTPF process is not good enough. For 14 years, the public and successive Governments, it appears, have had the wrong figures. People have lost faith in the accuracy of the figures and whether they can trust the health system when it reports how many people are awaiting procedures. The practices the "RTE Investigates" programme uncovered, with people being placed on waiting lists at the wrong date and written to to confirm their ongoing need for a procedure shows how confidence in the waiting list system is at rock bottom for patients and the public. The "Living on the List" programme is a watershed moment for our health system and we must restore confidence in how figures are compiled. The only way to do it is with an independent review. This is separate from the actions needed to expand capacity in our health service and permanently reduce waiting lists. New hospitals are part of it. On Tuesday evening, the Minister announced that the NTPF will audit practices in individual hospitals and that it will carry out a review of international best practice on waiting list data publication models. The Minister specifically said the NTPF, at the Minister's request, will audit the practices in each of the hospitals highlighted by the individual cases featured in the programme and will report to the Minister. The NTPF has informed the Minister that the way it classifies its waiting list has been the same since its inception in 2002 and follows international best practice. However, it has already commenced a review of international best practice on waiting list data publication models. It would be better if the Minister brought in an international expert to examine how the NTPF, the HSE and individual hospitals are compiling their figures and the systems in place for managing waiting lists. People are concerned that there is a lack of accountability in our health system and an independent review that would probe all aspects of the system is needed. What "Living on the List" uncovered on Monday was traumatic and very upsetting. Anyone who saw the programme would have found it very upsetting for the individuals whom we saw struggling with pain every day, particularly the children. I was especially affected by the children who were curled up in pain on the couch at home unable to go to school. We should not tolerate it. In a country as well-off as ours, nobody should have to live with the uncertainty of knowing when they will be treated, and everything should be done to address the distress caused to families across Ireland. The revelation of secret pre-admit and preplanned waiting lists have added further to the uncertainty as to what is happening in our hospitals and how many people are waiting to be treated. That is why we reiterate the need for an independent review of how waiting lists are compiled. It is about confidence, independence and ensuring the people can trust the information that will come from the independent review. Continually outsourcing problems to the private health service through the NTPF should not be used to let the HSE, the Department and the Minister off the hook. Increased funding for the NTPF alone may provide some short-term reduction in waiting lists, but it will not address the capacity problems in our hospitals nor will it improve the processes. While the extra €20 million extra allocated this year, rising to €55 million in 2018, will provide some relief, it is not a proper solution to the capacity issues in our health service.Figures I have seen regarding the NTPF suggest that it is not cost-effective because, effectively, one is paying for treatment that should be done in a public hospital. We would be in favour of a single-tier public hospital system which treats people fairly. The fact that a person can get a cataract procedure done privately in several weeks but would be obliged to wait months if he or she goes public needs to be addressed. I accept that the Committee on the Future of Healthcare is getting on with its work but there is a need for a long-term strategy where people will be treated on the basis of need, not on the basis of the money in their pockets and where they will not have to wait months - even years - for treatment simply because they do not have the money to avail of private health care. That is a situation over which none of us can stand. We need to get to the bottom of this and implement a long-term financial plan. I wish the Committee on the Future of Healthcare well and hope it will give us solid proposals to which we can all sign up. That is the only way we are going to get a long-term solution to the kind of problems to which we are continually returning with the health service. I welcome the fact that the HSE will present an action plan for scoliosis to the Minister by the end of February. I also welcome his announcement that the new theatre in Crumlin hospital will open in April and that an orthopaedic post there will be filled by June. The cases that got to me on the recent "RTE Investigates" programme were of the young girls waiting for operations. The young girl from Limerick, particularly after seeing the X-ray of the curvature of her spine, should have had her operation, as should the other young girl with a pin in her back. We must ensure this does not happen to the many other children who are on that list. The delay until June in respect of filling the orthopaedic post is long, particularly when one considers that this extra facility was provided a year ago. If one concrete action comes out of the RTE programme, it is that we should set a six-month deadline and fast-track treatment for the 200 and more children on the scoliosis waiting list. If we could do that, it would at least give the public some confidence we can solve these problems. Alongside this, the emerging news of the €1 billion extra cost in respect of the national children's hospital must be explained. This adds further to the mounting financial crisis emerging in the health service. This is an issue which the Labour Party has highlighted in the past week. I am concerned that the costs coming down the line in the health service will distract from the need to help sick people. Resources must be better targeted. The contract for the children's hospital has been awarded at a cost of over 50% of the expected bill and an extra €200 million is going to be required to kit out the facility. It was reported on Tuesday that the €750 million of expected savings over the next several years from generic biological drugs will not materialise because brand name drugs continue to be prescribed. The HSE faces a bill for over €350 million in respect of the issue relating to consultants' contracts. On Sunday, it was revealed that transport could not be guaranteed for children awaiting liver and heart transplants. As Deputy O'Reilly said earlier, pay talks are set to get under way soon, not just for nurses but also for GPs and consultants. Adding up all these figures shows that there are serious financial storms ahead for our health service which the Minister must address. He needs to explain why, in the space of two years, the projected cost of the children's hospital has increased by almost €350 million to €1 billion. This will have serious effects on other capital projects, including the national maternity hospital and new emergency departments. The new emergency department in Limerick is due to open in May. However, we have been told that recruitment, kitting out and deep cleaning may cause delays. From the reply to a parliamentary question I submitted, I understand that an additional €1.4 million was allocated to facilitate the opening of the new emergency department this year. I tabled a further question regarding how much it would actually cost to open the emergency department in Limerick in May. However, that question was referred to the HSE and I have not yet received a reply to it. My concern is that the €1.4 million may not be enough to open the new emergency department in May. That department most certainly needs to be opened. There is no funding for the national maternity strategy, which involves maternity hospitals in Dublin, Limerick and Cork. Answers are needed in respect of when the Minister knew about the increased costs for the children's hospital and what planning has been done to address that matter. It is incredible that the Department and the HSE are accepting cost increases of over 50% when the rate of inflation is practically zero. I hope the Committee on the Future of Healthcare will offer real solutions because we certainly need them.

I want to differentiate between the personal and political. Sometimes we have to do that in this game. This is not a perennial problem. Rather, it is a systematic problem with our health service. Unfortunately, our health service is quite sick. The reason for this is neglect. The reason the health service has been neglected is because, in the past eight years, the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil parties have made political choices that have resulted in the health service being in a state of constant crisis. It does not have to be like this. The "RTE Investigates" programme broadcast on Monday night was horrendous. It was an embarrassment to be a Member of this Parliament watching people suffer needlessly. While the programme is imprinted on our minds, it will be largely forgotten. What will not be forgotten is the reality of what people have to face. Statistics relating to the health service make for difficult reading for the Minister and for any Member who wants a decent society. In January, at the height of the problem, 612 people were on hospital trolleys. Yesterday, over 500 people were on hospital trolleys. According to the European health consumer index, Ireland has the longest waiting times for CT scans and minor operations and is the worst of 36 countries for ease of access to health care. Since 2008, due to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, 1,600 beds were lost in the health service. Health staff are overworked, underpaid and constantly battling with staff shortages, while morale has hit rock bottom. Patients wait years for surgery, as was seen on the recent RTE programme. This is absolutely unacceptable in 21st century Ireland. It is the same for waiting times for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy. The list goes on. This is because of the two-tier health system. The NTPF just sells public patients to the private sector. It does not go any way in trying to address the fundamental issues in our health service. There is obviously something wrong. The Minister stated €14.5 billion is spent annually on the health service, a significant amount of money. According to the OECD, Ireland spends the third most on health services in the OECD. Why can we not get it right? The onus is on the Minister's party to address these issues. I am not blaming the Minister but it is up to him to address these issues.Ultimately, what we want to see is a universal health care system that is not a two-tier system in which a person with money can jump the queue. In a civilised society, which we all live in, it should not be the case. It should be universal, funded through central taxation, where people on the point of care should get access to health care not because of the depth of their pockets. Waiting times are an absolute scandal in this country. I am asking the Minister to put his reputation on the line and say, like previous Ministers, the trolley crisis and waiting times are absolutely unacceptable and to give a commitment that if the same thing happens this time next year, he will resign.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	14	Yesterday we saw new information released on the latest position regarding hospital waiting lists in this country. If the figures from the three lists are added up, there are currently 623,442 persons on waiting lists in our health service, which is one in eight of the population. On the Government's target of having everybody on those lists seen to within 18 months, the European health consumer index said, "Even if and when that target is reached, it will still be the worst waiting time situation in Europe." It surveyed 35 countries and Ireland is in 35th position and bottom of the league table for waiting times in Europe. What is to be done? The National Association of General Practitioners said that in recent years, under both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil-led Governments, €980 million has been taken out of primary health care. That is almost €1 billion taken out by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael-led Governments. Those cuts must be reversed. It is common sense that if there is a good strong primary health care system, there will be fewer waiting lists for the hospitals. One of the consultants interviewed on the "Prime Time" programme made very sharp points about the strict, fixed budgets hospitals are operating under. Apart from the human side of it, it is a completely false economy because if someone cannot be seen when they are in need of some surgery, they will be seen down the line when they are in need of more serious and more expensive surgery. That is leaving aside all the check-ups, appointments and administration that has to be done with longer lists. We need more front-line staff and better wages and working conditions. Who is fighting for that? The nurses are fighting for it. That is why their industrial action will begin on 7 March. Anyone who is seriously concerned about improving the health service and sorting out the issues of recruitment and retention will give their full support to our nurses as they enter that dispute. John McManus of The Irish Times said recently, "Irish health spending is very close to the European average but, unlike most of our peers, one-third of it is channelled through the private healthcare system." Referring to perverse incentives within the system he said, "The worse the public system, the more profitable the private system." That is the scandal of the two-tier health system in this country. One third of all acute hospitals and one sixth of all acute hospital beds are now fully private. How many of these beds are empty? We do not know because the private hospitals will not give the information. They say it is commercially sensitive. We know a significant number of those beds lie empty at most times. What does the National Treatment Purchase Fund do? It penalises the public health service by diverting funds away from our public system. It subsidises and bails out the private hospital for having excess capacity and beds within its structures. This is a nonsense and it needs to change. The private hospitals in this country should be taken into public ownership with compensation only on the basis of proven need and integrated into a fully fledged Irish national health service. There have been 1,600 beds taken out of the public system, as Deputy Gino Kenny explained. That would bring 2,100 beds back in by compensating for the beds that have been cut out of the system by both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil-led Governments since 2007. My key messages are that we need better recruitment, better retention and to support the nurses in their industrial action in March. We need the nationalisation of the private hospitals, to integrate them into the public health system and finance and resource a proper Irish national health service. The time is long gone. That is what we need.

It was not necessary to view the RTE programme last week to be aware that we have an ongoing critical crisis in our health service. Every single public representative in the Dáil knows there is a crisis but the nation was shocked by the sheer, naked pain of the people and children on the lists. It really shocked the nation. The people who rely on our public services are paying the price for decades of underfunding, mismanagement, the role of vested interests and Government inaction. I am a member of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and sitting on that committee and reading the reports is an eye-opener. The dysfunctional nature of our health service is beyond belief. We do not have anything we can even remotely refer to as our health services. What we have is a jumble of public and private health care alongside a plethora of NGOs, charities, religious institutions and voluntary groups providing services that should be part of a national health service. Health services of the sort developed in Ireland, as in other countries, as charitable institutions serving the poor. In the 18th and 19th centuries, unlike other countries in Europe, we never fully replaced these with a State health service. We just grafted on some State services. We did not have a Minister for Health until 1947, 25 years after the foundation of the State. A White Paper in the 1940s outlined plans for an NHS and a social welfare system following on from the Beveridge report in the UK. It was abandoned due to opposition from the Catholic Church, medical professions and the Department of Finance. Until we face up to this legacy and confront the vested interests, whether they are religious bodies, elements of the medical profession, big pharma or others who provide health care for profit, we will continue with a dysfunctional health care system that is unfit for purpose. Patching up a broken system is very much a waste of time and money. We have seen that over the last period when we responded to crises by trying to put more money in and trying to deal with the issue. I find it very difficult politically to support the National Treatment Purchase Fund. We have a situation where private patients are using public beds and public patients are going into private hospitals either here or in England and Europe. It is just crazy and cannot go on. As a Deputy in Dublin South-Central, I am often approached by parents from around the country regarding problems with the orthopaedic surgery at Crumlin children's hospital and especially waiting lists for scoliosis surgery. The longer children wait for treatment, the more serious the problem becomes, the more extensive is the surgery required and the higher the cost. It is quite incredible that a new and much-needed orthopaedic theatre was built in Crumlin in 2015 as a result of a massive campaign in the area. The former Minister, former Deputy James Reilly, was like a bee around honey on this campaign in 2009 and 2010. It was built in 2015 but has still not been opened due to a lack of necessary staff. It is absolutely crazy. I have submitted loads of parliamentary questions about this in recent years. I have been in contact with a young woman in Galway who has been on the orthopaedic list for scoliosis since June 2014. I contacted her yesterday again and asked if she was still on it and she is. I despair when I hear Fianna Fáil's mea culpa about all this, saying it is terrible and they are all at fault.We heard then that Crumlin hospital was to clear the backlog of children awaiting scoliosis surgery by February, which involved 70 operations. We had major problems then in 2009 and also in the more recent period.

The stories behind those who bravely participated in the programme put a human face on the obscene figures that we all know about and that I and like-minded representatives have raised in this Chamber since the day we were elected here. In fairness to the Minister, it has not only been an issue with this Government but with successive Governments, and what we have had from each of them is reaction after reaction, a blaming and a distancing, and failed initiative after initiative. We had the special delivery unit, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, co-location and so on. The stark reality is that Government policy after Government policy has made the health service a sick service. The reason the NTPF was introduced in 2004 was because of the massive waiting list. It was to be a short-term measure and in the meantime we were to recruit and put back in the staff that were taken out. That did not happen. All of the initiatives the Minister has introduced and all of the reactions have the common theme of putting funds into the private system. The end result is what was so graphically described in the programme the other night. I have repeatedly mentioned University Hospital Galway, which the Minister could not find the time to visit. To use the words of its clinical director, the hospital, and not just its accident and emergency department, is not fit for purpose. He has specifically given the Minister a submission stating that not only the accident and emergency department but the hospital is not fit for purpose. We had the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar in October 2012. We still do not know if the recommendations of the report into her death have been implemented. Many courageous doctors and consultants have spoken out, among them Dr. Fergal Hickey, Dr. O'Rourke, Dr. McCabe and many other doctors in Galway, pointing out, number one, the crisis and, number two, the solutions. This and previous Governments have not listened. There are now three ongoing investigations in the hospital in Galway. An operation was carried out on a ward, another review is being carried out following the death of a person in their 80s on a trolley, and another one relates to inappropriate surgery that was carried out. At the very least three, and possibly four, investigations are taking place in that hospital that is creaking at the seams and serving 1 million people - this is not a parochial issue - from Donegal to Clare. That is the crisis that the "RTE Investigates" programme put images on the other night. The Minister said in June 2016 that universal health care is a direction and journey, but we have come to the end of the journey. This is the end of the journey. Let us today recognise that universal health care is a basic human right. We should all be ashamed if that does not happen in the lifetime of this Government.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	20	I have submitted 12 written parliamentary questions since 11 October regarding issues such as assessment of needs, respite care, residential care etc. On each occasion the Minister concerned has informed me that, "The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives." I have read that statement from the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I suppose when one repeats that mantra over and over, the words become sentiments and the sentiments must be true. When a Wexford mother of two autistic boys wonders why her 12 year old son can get an assessment of need but his 16 year old brother cannot because he was born before a certain date, I am sure she would be delighted that the Government is committed to providing services and supports to people with disabilities. After the Minister kicks the question on to the HSE and it informs me that 1,035 out the 3,318 assessments of needs reported completed in 2015 were completed within the timeframes set out in the Disability Act 2005, I wonder whether the 69% of children who did not have their assessments carried out on time view this abject failure as the Government being committed to providing services and supports to people with disabilities. As for the 31% of children who had their assessments carried out on time, and after the State and the HSE recognised that there is a requirement for them, I wonder whether they are disappointed when they realise the HSE, in most cases, is not equipped to provide any or most of the recommendations arising from the assessment, or whether they think the Government is committed to providing these services and supports for people with disabilities. I do not think the parents of 60 service users in Wexford on the disability services residential care waiting list are happy. Last Saturday a woman came up to me in a supermarket as she wanted to alert me to something. She had brought her son who has suicidal ideation to the child and adolescent mental health services in Wexford, in Slaney House. She was told that the clinical nurse phoned the mental health services to ask if they could be allowed to help the child. They were told "No" because they are not allowed deal with emergencies and the child psychiatrist was away. They had no choice but to send the child to the general hospital. This was on the Monday and the child was there until Friday, screaming for help. The mother said the staff were brilliant but dealing with an incredibly difficult situation. The child was having an episode. Eventually a child psychiatrist came down from Dublin on the Friday. Come Friday week in the south of Wexford, no child or adolescent who presents with a mental health emergency will receive any health care services for the next two weeks because the child psychiatrist is going on holidays. The HSE has known about it for a long time and it still has not provided for putting anyone in place. This woman was not crying about her child. She said this is going to happen to others. The service is not in place.

The Deputy is a young Minister and I understand he is trying to do his best but the fact is the system we have is not working. The HSE, as a body, is supposed to be helping our sick and vulnerable people who are in trouble, but it is not working out for many people. As I have stated here many times, as has my brother, Michael, it is not acceptable that people have to wait two years to have a cataract operation. The Sligo model is working in other parts of the country but why can it not be applied to Cork and Kerry? I dealt with one poor man could not bear to go blind and he had to sell his car to get the operation done privately. That is the truth. It is not good enough that young teenagers have to wait four to five years for orthodontic treatment. The hospital in Kenmare which is relatively new is only half open. It has only one respite bed for all of its catchment area. Wards are closed in Tralee general hospital. That is why we have waiting lists, queues and people on trolleys. I told the Minister about a recent case involving Cork University Hospital. As of today, there are people waiting three, four and five weeks to have open heart surgery in that hospital because there is not bed available for them after they have their operation. That is not acceptable. Deer Lodge in Killarney, which is a mental health facility, was built and opened in June 2015 but it is still not fully open. People are going private to get treatment. It is not good enough for people with medical problems who need attention to have to wait two or three years to meet a consultant. That is widespread and it must be sorted out. We have heard of ambulance reconfiguration, which means there will be fewer ambulances. A would-be patient in Rathmore on New Year's day had to wait 50 minutes for an ambulance to come from Kenmare when it should have come from Millstreet. Many facilities are being closed, including the Mary of the Angels facility. Also, the Lantern Lodge was closed because it was considered to be too costly to give the people attending it a meal That is what is happening. We have a shortage of nurses and those who are in our hospitals are overworked. We cannot pay our rural GPs to ensure they stay in rural areas. A total of €900 million has been allocated to the HSE this year and we are almost two months into the year and I do not see any improvement anywhere. Most working class people are paying 48% and 52% tax to pay for the cost of these services but the services are not being delivered. I have attended many HSE South/South West hospital group meetings but I have not got a straight answer to my questions from the officials. They have always been evasive when I have asked them a question.I am very sorry; my time is up. I have no faith in the current system. It must be broken up and something new put in place.

Countless constituents have come to me in similar situations: elderly people waiting up to two years to have cataracts removed, children suffering from increasing pain as a result of not having scoliosis treatment and cancer patients being given appointments that are later cancelled at short notice. The 2016 Euro Health Consumer Index, EHCI, has ranked Ireland as the country with the worst waiting times in a comprehensive study of 35 countries. This is totally unacceptable. I agree that our health service is not underfunded but badly managed. We have been told that €900 million more has gone into the health system this year compared with last year, yet we do not see any results. This view was confirmed by the EHCI study, which found that Ireland was also the fifth worst country for efficiency, or "bang for the buck". Accountability at all levels is required. The Irish health system has been late to introduce technology, which has inhibited the ability to properly track an individual's interaction with the health service. The top place in the EHCI study is held by the Netherlands, ahead of Switzerland and then Norway. Uniform procedures for data gathering are needed. The improved management of waiting lists requires an understanding of the relationship between the demand for a service and the rate of supply. This understanding requires the development of information systems which can not only record the numbers of patients waiting for admission, but also enable demand and supply for particular services to be monitored. We fail to take care of the little things, such as paying highly-prized nursing staff a fair salary and providing even simple things such as parking. Too many nurses spend their days performing routine tasks such as form-filling rather than clinical activity involving patients. Following changes to consultants' contracts, the only way many medical posts can be filled is by allowing doctors to work privately. This gives us doctors who work part-time in the public system and do not have any great commitment to it. We have too few beds and too many rolling closures of operating theatres. Operating lists do not start on time, they are inefficient and they finish at 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. In the private sector, they continue until the work is done. We need a tough Minister to effect change and one or two people in charge of the health system at the top. I do not buy the constant call for more resources; we need to make the present system work better. We need accountability from management, which faces no real sanctions for underperformance. The system has been badly hurt by the cutbacks of the 1980s, 1990s and from 2009 to 2014 and has not fully recovered. We have fewer hospital beds than in 1980, while the population has grown by one third and the older population by twice that. We have too few hospital beds; we need more. We do not need capacity reviews to tell us this, though they might tell us where the extra beds should be. We also need more doctors, particularly specialists – perhaps up to 2,800 extra. There are new layers of management and there is less engagement with general practitioners than before. The system is not listening to GPs enough. There is unstable employment for nurses. There have been up to three nursing pay cuts since 2009, coupled with an increase in their working hours of six hours each month. I have no doubt but that the Minister has an incredibly difficult task but I truly believe the system is not working. Action is required immediately, not down the road. We should consider the state of our hospitals. Many hospitals, such as Bantry General Hospital, are well able to carry out brilliant procedures but their accident and emergency services were closed overnight. People such as me, community people, were told at the time that we were scaremongering. We were not scaremongering. We now have the evidence of all these cutbacks.

I compliment those who produced it but I did not need the "RTE Investigates" programme - none of us did - to know what is going on. The Minister has been in the job for long enough now to know what is going on. We have just celebrated the centenary of the 1916 Rising in 2016 and all that has happened in Ireland but what do we have? We have 632,185 people on waiting lists at the end of January. That is some legacy. That is some commemoration of the men who set up this country. The HSE was set up by my colleagues to my right, the Fianna Fáil Party, of which I was a member at the time. I was told by the former Taoisigh Brian Cowen and Bertie Ahern, Senator James Reilly and others that it would be disbanded. It must be disbanded. It must be tackled and dispersed and go back to some sense of normality. It is cannibalising itself. There are many good people in the HSE - nurses, front-line staff, doctors and other people - doing great work but it is dysfunctional in the extreme. It must be got rid of. The Minister should not let HSE officials and their speak capture him. The Minister has in his pocket a letter I gave him yesterday about a 51-month waiting list for urology. It relates to a blind man who does huge charity work and who is concerned for his life. It is scandalous and the list goes on. We have such cases all over the country. There is a €7 million overrun in an empty hospital in Tipperary. It renders the television programme "Yes Minister" insignificant. There will not be a single bed in this empty hospital. The Minister has visited it. He saw it and was shocked by the condition of it and how good a hospital it was. The system is dysfunctional. The children's hospital is going ahead in spite of the pleas from the sick children, some of whom we saw the other night on television, who cannot get to the hospital because of traffic. Helicopters cannot be landed there. We found out this week that its cost will overrun by €400 million or €500 million. Mr. Tony O'Brien has stated he has no money to build it but yet the Government continues with the fallacy and the scandal of going ahead with the site. The lunatics are running the asylum. Will the Minister please cancel the project first of all, build the hospital where it can be accessed, build it where patients can be treated and co-locate it with an adult hospital? It is a scandal he can stop. We will talk about this here in ten years' time. It will not be finished, it will be half built and it will not be accessible. We cannot get staff to go into it because they cannot get parking spaces. It is madness. I have a contract, which the Minister has in his pocket too, with a private GP service that wishes to and can offer services. The Minister visited the place, for which I thank him. They got it after 12 months of negotiations. They were handed it last Friday evening. It is a two-week contract, that is, for 14 days. The people who drew up and issued that contract should be sacked on the spot. To put that much time into it - the Minister's time as well - and zero officials. The ink would not be dry on the contract papers before they had to close it again. This is what is going on. I heard people here criticise the church. When the church ran the hospitals, when we had the matrons, the hospitals were clean and run properly. Now what do we have? We have a legacy of strikes, demands and more money and we have utter chaos, so I will not listen to anyone lecture the people who ran it. The hospitals were run-----

Ba chóir go mbeadh bainisteoirí an chórais ag deimhniú nach bhfuil aon othar ag fulaingt, ach a mhalairt atá fíor mar go bhfuil an córas beag beann ar fhualaingt an othair. Monday's "RTE Investigates" served as a harsh reminder of what we have known for so long: our health system is broken and remains broken. The problem is that not only the present Government but consecutive Governments continue to be reactive to problems by responding in a short-term way to the latest serious inadequacy, acting like a fire-fighting service endeavouring and struggling at times to put out the latest fire. What we need and what the people are crying out for is a more strategic approach that tackles effectively and permanently, for once and for all, huge inadequacies, gross managerial inefficiencies and glaring inequalities in access to services. The Government must work to strengthen the public health system to ensure it is sustainable into the future. This requires a radical new approach. Funding for primary and community care must be increased in order that acute hospital beds are kept for those with the most serious clinical needs. We need to increase rapidly the number of general practitioners, public health nurses and advanced nurse practitioners. I acknowledge this will require incentivisation as otherwise, many gifted nurses and doctors will continue to vote with their feet and turn to other counties for better job opportunities that incorporate a much better quality of work life. For too long they have been told they are doing a heroic job but at this stage, medical practitioners practising on the daily front line want more than our words. They want and deserve a managerial solution and the greatest tribute and meaningful gratitude one can pay the stakeholders is to deliver for them and for the patients real, competent, visionary management and to overhaul the system. All the best international evidence tells us that a universal health care system is the most cost-effective model and it is that which we should move towards. Yes, delivering a proper, fair and efficient service may mean less or no tax reductions, at least in the short term, but that honest conversation must take place. If done fairly, taxpayers will recognise the need to prioritise improving such essential services over gimmicky tax breaks which are often born as meaningless pre-election promises. The public has a role in this regard, and one such role is to recognise cynical pre-election auction politics for what it is. It is the enemy of effectively overhauling and delivering a wide range of public services desperately needed in this country.We need absolute transparency and accountability in our health system. To begin with, fundamentally, the people deserve to know the truth. We need to be provided with an honest and accurate picture of the state of our public health services. There must be detailed analysis and breakdowns of current and future expenditure and information, justifying how funding decisions are made. Individuals who fail to deliver must be held accountable. That is what happens in a normal business but I challenge the Minister to name one person who has ever been held truly accountable for this ongoing saga, which tragically has real victims. Only in the past week Dr. Fergal Hickey warned us that up to 350 patients will die as a result of capacity constraints in intensive care units in our hospitals. Is é bun agus barr an scéil na nach féidir linn brath ar an gcóras seo againne chun freastal orainn. Access to health care should not be a paid extra for some. Health is not an entitlement. It is a basic and fundamental right.

It was a shocking and shaming programme but it was excellently done and represents the best in public sector broadcasting in exposing the major shortcomings in a public service that is so fundamental to people's lives. The fact that as a society we are prepared to stand by while children in particular but adults also in significant numbers are left in agonising pain on waiting lists is a shocking reflection on our value system which needs to change urgently in respect of a commitment to public services. Of course, the point that Deputy Catherine Martin made is central to this. The Government cannot have good quality public services and tax cuts. The idea of undertaking to abolish the universal social charge and give back €5 billion of tax funding at a time when our health service is in tatters, when we have a major housing crisis, utterly inadequate child care and so many of our public services are bereft of funding is nonsense. People cannot have it both ways. We need to be honest with the public and tell it that it is not possible to have tax cuts in the context of the shortcomings in our public services. That was very clear in last year's election. For the first time that I can remember in an election people on the doorsteps were saying sort out the health service, deal with the housing crisis and do not talk about tax cuts or €10 or €20 back a week when we have such glaring problems in our society. Government needs to take that message on board. We need to stop, as a Parliament, talking about the prospect of tax cuts because we cannot afford them for the foreseeable future until we get our services right. As long as our services are starved of funding we do not have a proper society. It inevitably leads to people living in the kind of shocking conditions that we saw last Monday night on that programme. There are several areas where urgent action needs to be taken in respect of health. How come waiting lists cannot be managed competently? We saw examples of several of the people referred to in the programme whose names had slipped off the list. We come across this constantly in our constituencies when people who thought they were on a nine-month waiting list were not called for treatment and discovered they were not on the list. There is significant incompetence in the management of the waiting lists. Heads have to roll for that. If we cannot get basic administration of waiting lists that must be dealt with then somebody must be held accountable for that failure. There are many other areas that need to be dealt with. The budget allocation is going into a black hole, it is not tied to clear deliverable outputs and there is no measurement of activity. The fact that the HSE has a totally dysfunctional organisational structure did not happen by chance because if something cannot be measured it does not matter. We cannot measure activity, performance or output from the HSE because of the totally erratic and dysfunctional manner in which it is organised. We need to move away from the utterly dysfunctional two-tier system and introduce fundamental reform and a universal health system. I hope that when the all-party committee makes its recommendations, the entire Dáil will support them.

The nation was rightly shocked. It put the human face of pain and suffering on the figures. The public have been misled. The term "alternative facts" comes to mind. The public is entitled to, must be told and know the truth. The long waiting lists are the result of cuts to services by successive governments. For example, 2,000 beds have been taken out of the system, there is overcrowding in accident and emergency departments, posts are not filled and there is a moratorium on posts. I have been raising these issues for some time. I recently raised the issue of the urology waiting list at University Hospital Waterford. A letter received by one of my constituents puts the case very plainly:We are writing to inform you that you have been placed on ... waiting list. We will forward you an appointment in due course. You have been prioritised as: URGENT. You should expect to be seen within 48+ months. If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact us.The constituent must wait more than four years. The reply from the HSE and the Minister, which I received only yesterday, confirms that there is a major problem at University Hospital Waterford. It states, "The clinical risk for the Urology Services is on the Corporate Risk Register and is rated high risk." The management at the hospital has applied for additional resources, two consultant urologists, support staff and funding to provide a proper service to the hospital. Those resources have not been provided. Will the Minister provide those resources not just for University Hospital Waterford but for all those from the south east, including Tipperary, using the services at the hospital?

He arrives in an ambulance totally dishevelled and in serious pain. His family accompany him. When they go into the accident and emergency department, the doctor in despair asks why they let this man fall into this condition, why he has arrived like this and why they did not look after him in their home. The doctor did not realise that the patient was coming from a HSE hospital where he had been abused. He died in appalling circumstances. The family brought it to the attention of the HSE. An inquiry was set up. The inquiry does not include any doctor, medical information or specialist. The family rejects that. I get involved and a second inquiry into the man's death is set up. The doctor walks away from the inquiry which collapses. There is now a third inquiry into the death of this man which is held up for legal reasons. The HSE is hiding and not facing its accountability in this Oireachtas, through the Minister or the public. It is a shame what is happening in this country. The waiting lists are a shame. It is a shame that a year ago Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital was short 55 nurses and three anaesthetists. There were six people in the intensive care units and another six lined up outside, waiting to get in there. Only one made it inside that door. I am trying to find out what happened to the rest of those patients. There is a crisis in intensive care beds in this country. I only know these things because of the Freedom of Information Act 2014. The HSE is not accountable to me as a Member of the Oireachtas, to anybody in this House or to the public and is hiding its accountability from the Minister. I welcome the Minister's commitment that heads will roll.It is not accountable to the public and it is hiding its accountability from the Minister. I welcome the Minister's commitment that heads will roll. Heads must roll in this dysfunctional and appalling organisation, which from top to bottom is full of bureaucracy and lacking in accountability. I am ashamed that I have to stand up and say these things here. I support the Government, the budgets and the Minister. I believe he is the person to deal with the terminal crisis in the health service. The head of the HSE must roll and should roll now. Each of the three separate waiting lists is populated by people who are in pain and are suffering because they have been waiting for longer than they should be waiting for. What the hell are we going to do about it? The HSE claims that having multiple lists is standard international practice, but it is not the practice in England or in other countries. We should have one short list that is dealt with. We should not have the longest list in Europe. We should ensure we have the shortest list. I support the Minister in his intention to do that.

Like my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harris, I felt ashamed. It is simply not acceptable that so many people are going through such an ordeal. The revelations exposed in the programme with regard to waiting lists are extraordinary. It is time for those who are supposed to be accountable to answer for the shortcomings in our health system for once and for all. Time and again, I have come up against a brick wall in my dealings with the HSE as I have tried to get someone to be accountable and to explain the reasons for the decisions that are made. This has got to stop. The HSE must be held accountable for its decisions. It must operate in an open and transparent manner. I do not believe the operations of the HSE are accountable, open or transparent.

If I had run my previous business in this manner, I would have had no customers and the business would ultimately have failed. As public representatives, we are fully accountable to our constituents. It is time for the HSE to be made fully accountable for its actions. We have been told by the HSE time and again that more funds are needed. Even though there has never before been a time when so much taxpayers' money has been invested in the health service, we are told on an almost weekly basis that more funding is needed. It is certainly not the case that more reports are needed. We have had report after report. Action must be taken on the ground. Better work practices are also needed. Most importantly, the HSE must realise that health care is a 24/7 issue and is not confined to the days from Monday to Friday. I reiterate that we do not need more reports. Everybody knows what are the issues. Action is needed to resolve those issues. We are constantly told that there were 3,500 more nurses in the system ten years ago. We have never had a higher budget for the health services than we have today. I will put this in context. In the budget for this year, we allocated over €14 billion in taxpayers' money to the health service. This is the highest amount ever budgeted. Why, in that context, do we have 3,500 fewer nurses than we had ten years ago? Can the HSE provide a clear and concise explanation for that? I believe we must have a open and transparent health service that is accountable for the decisions it makes and operates at its most efficient. We do not need more reports. We need action to be taken on the ground.

They do a good job and many people get a good service from this country's health sector. This is something that goes unsaid too often. To be honest, I am not surprised that issues and problems have developed. The country was bankrupt. There is always a lag or a delay in such circumstances. This is what happens after a country has had no money for a decade. The constant reductions in services caused lists to build up in the way that was depicted on Monday night. We are spending enough money on this country's public and private health sector. Over €14 billion is provided from the State Exchequer each year. A further €9 billion comes from private resources. This is more than most other countries in Europe spend on their health sectors. However, we are not getting the value for money or the throughput that is required to prevent long waiting lists. The real issue here is lethargy. Nobody is prepared to change. Nobody in the health services, particularly in the public sector, is prepared to give an inch. We have had debates about the drug orkambi. Drug companies do not give an inch. I cannot explain why they charge this country a multiple of what they charge in other jurisdictions, but I can say that this eats into budgets in areas of the health service where this money would be better spent. Similarly, the staff and the unions do not give an inch. If there is a bad practice in an institution or a hospital, it is not given up. A reforming structure is not put in place to ensure staff are prepared to work better hours and show better flexibility. Nobody gives an inch in the Irish health sector. The continuation of the hospital groups is vital for the future of the health sector, particularly the public health services. The hospital groups should be removed from the HSE and placed on a proper statutory footing. There should be full accountability within the hospital groups. Deputies and county councillors should be on the boards of the hospital groups because elected representatives can be held accountable by their constituents. We cannot establish the hospital groups without correctly integrating the other community services that are administered by the HSE. That is the future. Everybody has to give. People in this House have to give. The services that are required cannot be in every hospital. I compliment Wexford General Hospital on giving up services so that they could be reconstituted in the appropriate way with a proper throughput of patients, thereby allowing administrators, doctors and nurses to use their specialist expertise in the relevant areas. That is the future. We all have to give. If we do not give, we should stop coming in here and complaining.

I ask the Minister to end the practice of referring health questions to the HSE for response. While I accept that the HSE might need to be consulted, I emphasise that parliamentary accountability in respect of the health service needs to be returned to this Parliament. I do not think it has been here since Mary Harney was Minister, or perhaps before that. The Department of Health needs to act like a Government Department by giving Members of this Parliament answers on health issues that affect the people who elected us to represent them. It is not good enough that this is not happening at present. There needs to be a change in this regard. I would like to make a point about elected members of local authorities. I was a member of the regional health forum in the southern area, which is, in effect, a body that provides expensive responses to written Dáil questions. The answers we ultimately get from the forum are the same as the answers we get to parliamentary questions, except that it costs a great deal of money to hold meetings of the forum. We do not get an opportunity to scrutinise or ask questions at the forum. Anyone who attempts to do so is seen as some sort of pariah or pain in the arse. That is just not good enough. The people deserve far better than that. It needs to change. There are certain things that can be done now and other things that will take a longer period of time. I welcome the move towards an all-party approach to the future of health care. Some people laughed at me when I said on the public record in advance of last year's general election that this was needed. Some people said it would never happen, but thanks be to God it is happening. It is long overdue. We should put aside party differences, where possible. We need to focus on the national interest when lives are at stake. Even though we have all known for a long time that what we saw on the television on Monday night has been happening, it is simply not good enough that it is continuing to happen in this day and age. This is not about expenditure. Thankfully, we are now in a position to spend more money. That is a good sign. It is a sign that the Government and the people have got things right in recent years. We have not got things right in health. We need to admit that we have got things terribly wrong in health. If we want to move forward with the confidence of the people, we need to acknowledge where we have made mistakes. We have got things right on the economy, but we have got things horribly wrong with regard to hospital waiting lists. There is too much duplication of services. We do not have economies of scale throughout the health service. That is not a popular thing to say in here. Most people will never say it in here because they are afraid they will lose X, Y or Z from their own neck of the woods.We need to be realistic and put in place a system that is responsive. Anything would be better than the system that is there now, which is simply not working. We need to go through the rank and file of people in the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Department of Health to see who is surplus to requirements as I fear many of them are. I am not talking about those on the front lines but further up in the management positions, as far too many people are surplus to requirements, delivering very little but being paid a lot.

In an "RTE Investigates" programme this week, we saw children crying, women in undescribable pain and men talking about taking their own lives. People were and are angry, frustrated and upset and rightly so. Nobody who saw the programme would not have been deeply affected by what could be seen and heard. We saw very real and visible examples of the physical and emotional pain being suffered by people and we also saw the effects on their families and friends who had to watch as this happened. We learned about the dishonesty in the waiting list process but the HSE is owned and funded by the same people on those waiting lists who are not getting the simple truth. They are being lied to about the lists; it is a lie of omission and a fear about telling the truth when there is a duty to do so. We learned there are two secret waiting lists that the public is not to know about and it took the "RTE Investigates" programme to discover them. How do we ever hope to resolve the dysfunctional health care system if we cannot get basic truths about numbers? Confidence in the system has gone because time and again, our health system has proven to be dysfunctional and dishonest. There are a record 545,000 patients on the waiting lists for the end of the month and that does not include the planned procedure list of 60,930. Adding the published to the unpublished list, there are more than 630,000 people on the list or one in seven of the population is on a waiting list somewhere in the health care system. There are almost 100,000 people waiting for over a year for basic care. We have record waiting lists, secret waiting lists and record numbers on trolleys. We were told this week that insufficient funds are available to "fully proceed", as the HSE has stated, with the children's hospital. We have the worst record of 36 countries for access to health care. We have theatres ready for operations that cannot perform them because the HSE will not hire a theatre nurse or pay for implements. We are losing millions of euro to save pennies. There is more to this. As Senator Joan Freeman ably pointed out in the Seanad on Tuesday, there has not even been mention of those children on the mental health waiting lists. In a two-tier health system, mental health is in the basement. Children often wait over a year or sometimes two years just to be assessed at the most formative time of their lives. In one case in Wexford, a three-year-old waited 18 months to be seen by a psychologist, only to be told after that time that the HSE does not cover mental distress arising from bereavement involving a family member as, effectively, there is no box to tick. The long waiting lists in mental health for children are just as critical as those for physical health and should not be forgotten. The people are relying on the Minister to intervene and take steps. I urge him to do so.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	47	The "RTE Investigates" programme revealed deep suffering among men, women and children as people struggle with daily life while waiting on never-ending waiting lists. Each Deputy in the House, from all parties and none, deals week in and week out with constituents on waiting lists for treatment of hips, knees, eyes and endless other routine operations. The difference a new knee or hip can make to people in their older years is life-changing; when the pain is gone, people can start to live their lives again. Being on a waiting list that seems never-ending is both frustrating and soul destroying and the new revelations that thousands of patients waiting for procedures were not included in the official list by the HSE adds insult to injury. The latest figures I have for University Hospital Waterford are shocking. Currently, there are more than 6,000 people waiting for orthopaedic procedures involving either knee or hip treatment. These operations are normally extremely successful, as the Minister knows, and they can change a person's life from living with pain to being pain-free again. The list with the next highest number of people concerns ophthalmology, with in excess of 6,000 people also on that list. We know those operations are also very successful and improve greatly an older person's quality of life. We need and deserve a clear and complete picture of the real state of waiting lists. It is easy to look at figures but it is the real-life pain and suffering of patients on which we must focus. The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, was sidelined in 2012 by the then health Minister, Senator James Reilly. It was not the solution for everything but while it was in operation between 2002 and 2011, it dramatically reduced waiting lists to between three and six months for the vast majority of people on the list. Contrary to the comments of the Sinn Féin spokesperson on health, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, 33,000 public patients were facilitated in 2010, and from 2002 to 2011, 200,000 public patients were treated. It is a myth that only private patients were treated with that fund. It has come to my attention in the past couple of months that there are delays in processing nursing registrations, which is exacerbating the crisis in our hospitals. I have been contacted by nurses coming home from England, with one getting a job in University Hospital Waterford's accident and emergency department last December. It is taking up to 90 days for the registration to come through, which makes an existing problem worse. In reply to a parliamentary question I have determined there are still 1,300 people in that system. There are issues with paperwork but if the process could be speeded up, it would bring nurses in much more quickly.

We must certainly examine why some hospitals perform much better than others with the same resources. The second and key solution to the matter is accountability. It is always somebody else's fault. As politicians we blame the Minister, the HSE blames a lack of resources, commitments will be given, targets will be set and yet nobody is held to account when the targets are not met. Next week there will be another "RTE Investigates" issue, with another emergency debate and shifting of resources. Around we go in circles. Until we get to the stage where the people responsible for delivering services are held to account, we are at nothing. The Minister knows I sit on the committee examining the future of health care and we are doing much good work. If we are to solve the problem, we must start at the bottom rung of the ladder, which is primary health care. If we do not invest in primary health care, we will not keep those who do not need to be in hospital out of hospital. We must treat as many people as possible in the community as that will automatically free resources in the hospital services. It is quite simple if we think about it and we invest in it. As was alluded to earlier by many speakers, the treatment purchase fund is being reinstated but the Minister should seek further funding for it in order to deal immediately with the 500,000 people and get the waiting list down to a manageable level. The Minister would have the full support of this House in seeking to at least double that fund this year.

To say last Monday night's programme was heartbreaking is to put it incredibly mildly. As a mother with three kids, I could not imagine what it would be like to be one of those parents having a child in a similar position. Sometimes in our consideration of the issues we must also examine where the HSE might have got things right. Professor Colette Cowan in University Hospital Limerick was one director of nursing who achieved her waiting list targets but I regret that this was not acknowledged in the programme the other night. Sometimes when we see problems we should also speak to the people who are delivering on the ground to see how they achieved it. I spoke to Professor Cowan over the past few days and asked her how she achieved the targets. She did it by in-sourcing, that is, with various surgeries done in the different hospitals within her grouping. She also outsourced to Cappagh hospital to get some orthopaedic procedures done.Regrettably, the hospital could not deliver what she had outsourced because it did not have the equipment necessary to perform hip and knee replacements. These are the positives. She also made suggestions relating to theatre assistants. We all know there is a shortage of theatre nurses. If theatre assistants were available, it could help matters. Staff need not be theatre nurses to do the work. People can be trained up to support the surgeons. Another suggestion related to recruitment of staff when they finish their studies and qualify. We could go to the young newly-qualified people and offer them contracts for three years and then agree to give them a break in the contract to allow them to travel, see the world and gain more experience. These are valuable suggestions that come from simply talking and listening. It has to be a mix and match involving the NTPF. Between using the fund and in-sourcing, we could have a really good combination. The most important thing is not to have another conversation about this. The lists have grown again during the month of January. We need to be able to say in 2018 that we have delivered and that the waiting lists have gone down due to a combination involving the NTPF. If the Government has to front-load funding to begin the work immediately, it should do so. Earlier, Deputy Kelleher said that if the Government needs to go back and seek extra funding and front-load it to get people off the lists and bring the latter down to a manageable level, then that is what the Government should do. No one should be in pain. No mother should have to see her child cry in pain. No mother should have to see her child denied the opportunity to attend education because the child is in pain. We cannot expect the teaching staff to be supporting the child in pain. All the while, we have to look at resources. When people are going on annual leave, maternity leave, force majure leave or whatever, their positions should be covered in the HSE. Responsibility and accountability for the managing of rosters is necessary. When someone steps out, someone else should be in a position to step in to ensure a free flowing service is available at all times to the patient, who expects the service. An appointment should not be cancelled - or a place on the list lost - simply because there is no one available to deliver the service. If someone is on annual leave, he or she should have the leave booked and it needs to be noted. Patients' needs should be catered for at all times.

The problems pertaining to the waiting times experienced by those seeking medical or surgical attention are issues we have all been aware of for a long number of years. However, no matter how bad we had thought the situation was before, we now know that the figures presented to us were grossly understated in an attempt to conceal the true scale of the crisis within the system. The NTPF is the body responsible for collecting, collating and validating information on persons waiting for public hospital treatment. The fund has deliberately excluded tens of thousands of people languishing on waiting lists. "RTÉ Investigates: Living On The List" uncovered evidence of at least two other significant waiting lists which are not published by the NTPF. This was a scandalous revelation. The deliberate concealment of figures is testament to a health service in perpetual crisis. It is time for the Government to realise that its so-called strategy to deal with this crisis is not working. What more will it take for the step-change that is so desperately needed to come about within our health service? I dread to think. Sinn Féin has consistently raised concerns regarding waiting times. We have offered an alternative to the current failed system. The proposed Comhliosta system would constitute a new single integrated hospital waiting list management system whereby people can move from one hospital to another to reduce waiting times. It would involve the introduction of a new information technology system based on the one in use in the Portuguese national health service. The system would generate new maximum waiting times by transferring those on the list from hospitals that are struggling to meet demand to those in a better position to perform the procedure in a more timely fashion. The NTPF lacks transparency and is not accountable. The Comhliosta system would offer a practical solution to address the current mess. The crux of all the serious issues within our health system is the lack of capacity within the health system to meet demand. Lack of capacity means those in our society who need urgent medical care and attention are left to suffer needlessly while Governments dither and facilitate tax breaks for the better off. An unnecessary tax break is of no use to anyone languishing in pain who has to wait day in and day out for medical or surgical attention. I concur absolutely with the arguments presented in that regard by Deputy Shortall earlier. It is time the Government realised what really matters.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	53	I take this opportunity to raise the case of a little girl from Wicklow, a constituency that I share with the Minister. Pearl Tamara O'Neill is a two-year old child who is seriously ill. Pearl has had acute breathing problems since birth. She is still waiting to have a windpipe tube removed. Last month, Pearl's parents were delighted to receive an appointment for the procedure, which was to take place in Children's University Hospital, Temple Street. The appointment was cancelled. Pearl was given another date and that was followed by a further cancellation. In other words, two cancellations were made within the space of two weeks. The hospital staff did not ring Pearl's parents to inform them of the cancellations on both occasions, despite having told them that they would ring in advance of the appointment to confirm bed availability. Instead, Pearl's parents were told of the cancellations when they made the telephone calls. The cancellation was due to there being no beds available. This is the case of a two-year-old child, a helpless little girl who is vitally in need of what I understand to be a simple procedure. In her condition, infections are highly likely since it is easy for something to get into her airway. She is under constant supervision by her parents in case of an emergency blockage. She is only recently out of hospital, having contracted pneumonia some weeks ago. Yet, like many children throughout the State, she has been left to wait and suffer. Of course, we know from the Minister's statement that Pearl is not even on a waiting list because she has an appointment. According to the Minister, if a patient has an appointment date, whether it is one week away or three months away, the patient is not waiting. I am not sure how he can come to that conclusion. Perhaps it is a case of alternative facts. Meanwhile, Pearl is left struggling to breathe, eat and vocalise. Following her appearance on the "Six One News" programme, she has received a new appointment for next Sunday. I hope that will materialise, but it is appalling that a patient has to go on national television or the national news to try to get an appointment. The Minister said there should be no sugar-coating of these issues. The pain being endured by many thousands of children like Pearl amounts to an absolute disgrace. Parents are languishing while they wait on appointment dates, only to be told at the last minute that the appointments are cancelled because of a lack of beds. This is a shame. We cannot endure any sugar-coating of the facts. We need this pain and misery to end for thousands of children and their families throughout the State.

A lack of capacity is what we are talking about here all of the time. We saw the power of the media the other night, which has brought us all to this place today and we need to get this situation sorted out. Last year at Sligo University Hospital, 220 operations were cancelled on more than one occasion. There were multiple cancellations and this is happening all over the country, with people who are waiting on procedures being pushed back again and again. There are empty beds in Sligo hospital. There is a ward available with the beds already in it. What we need is the staff to run that ward. Will the Minister commit to providing staff for Sligo University Hospital? Yesterday, there were 18 people on trolleys in the accident and emergency department and seven people on trolleys in wards awaiting admission. We have a crisis and that is just one hospital. Sligo University Hospital is providing an excellent service. The staff are doing a tremendous job but there are simply not enough front-line staff there. Will the Minister commit to ensuring that before the end of the year additional staff will be employed to open that empty ward?

I have one very specific question for the Minister. This time last year I raised with the then Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, the plight of children and young adults with scoliosis awaiting surgery. I was informed at the time that the new orthopaedic theatre at Crumlin hospital would open in April of last year. The current Minister is presiding over the same scenario and the same suffering for those who endure scoliosis. He is now saying that this theatre will open in April of this year. I want a concrete assurance from the Minister today that the theatre will be open and functional in April. I also want him to give an assurance to all of those children and young people, including Pearl, who suffer in this way that they will have their surgery soon and without any further delay. I want him to assure them that they will not be left suffering on a list. Living on the list is a misnomer - existing on the list is the experience for so many children and their families.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	73	I will try to be succinct with my answers. In response to Deputy Fitzmaurice, I reserve the right to try to put more funding into the NTPF. I am currently considering that but am waiting to see the HSE's proposals in its action plan for waiting lists for 2017. As the Deputy knows, we have already put €20 million into the NTPF for this year. This is the first year in a long number of years that we have had a dedicated waiting list initiative through the NTPF. I will revert to the House and keep Deputies up to date on that. However, I am not going to allow everybody in positions of responsibility around the system to reduce this to an issue of funding because we have seen the health budget increase by almost €900 million in the past 12 months. Funding is part of it but what we do with that funding and how we deliver the results on the ground, in the hospitals and the health service is another aspect. The figures were published yesterday by the NTPF. I will give the House an assurance that they will be published until such time as the important work that the NTPF is doing with Trinity College Dublin to work out the best way of ensuring that we publish clear, transparent and validated waiting lists is complete. I expect that body of work to be completed this year. In response to Deputy Martin Kenny, I agree that there is an issue with capacity. A bed review is under way. We have not built a new hospital in this country since 1998 and we should not be surprised that we have a situation where people cannot access hospital beds. If we had not built a new school since 1998, we would not be surprised that there were not enough school places. We need to build more hospitals and to increase the bed capacity in our existing hospitals. I will have a clear, crystallised ask in terms of additional bed capacity in time for the Government's mid-term capital review, which will take place this year. Deputy Martin Kenny also made the very important point that we cannot have extra beds without extra staff. The most recent figures, which I saw last week, show that we have 104 beds closed within our hospitals because of inadequate staffing levels. I have put proposals in place to hire an additional 1,000 nurses this year. I am sensitive to the fact that the Lansdowne Road oversight group will be meeting the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, this afternoon. We have put forward a range of proposals to try to address nurse recruitment and retention issues. We are committed to holding further talks with the INMO and SIPTU on this matter in the coming days in order to avert industrial action. I would be happy to brief the House on those proposals once the talks have concluded. In response to Deputy McDonald, I am very clear regarding my accountability. I have seen past Ministers for Health shrug their shoulders and say that they are not responsible. I am very clear on what I am responsible for in terms of this House, my Cabinet duties and the law of the land under the legislation relating to health. I am responsible for health policy and for funding the health service. I am also very clear on what the HSE is responsible and accountable for and that is the operational piece. So, my asking the HSE to be accountable and to live up to its obligations is not in any way to take away from my responsibilities or accountability. I want to be very clear on that. The theatre in Crumlin will be operational in April of this year. We will see 194 scoliosis procedures carried out for children at Crumlin hospital this year, a significant increase on last year. I will come back to the House on this when I publish the action plan for scoliosis and I would welcome a debate at that stage. I expect to receive the plan by the end of the month. I am also looking at the outsourcing of some of the teenagers who are awaiting scoliosis procedures. I think there are 45 such patients in Crumlin at present. That is under way.

Regardless of whether they are from Limerick, Cork, Waterford or anywhere else, I hope people were listening carefully - the figure is 11,604. Recently Deputy Noel Grealish made a suggestion in this House, because of the absolute emergency in Galway, that the Minister would look at the possibility of opening an accident and emergency unit for more minor cases that might be turning up at University Hospital Galway. That is very important. While I do not blame the Minister for Health for this, the Taoiseach closed down the accident and emergency department in Roscommon which was handling thousands of patients each year.

I have repeatedly raised with the Minister the issue in Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH.

He has been a passionate advocate for a greater role for our level 2 and level 3 hospitals to take the pressure off our level 4 hospitals and the point he made is very good. It is policy and we need to look at what more we could do. As the Deputy knows, I visited Roscommon. There is huge potential, and not just in terms of the endoscopy unit which we opened there, to take scope procedures from some of the larger hospitals and drive the traffic of patient flow into that hospital. We also have a stroke rehabilitation unit underway and plans for the hospice there. I agree that the future for our smaller hospitals is extraordinarily important. We are going to look at the opening hours of local injury units and the minor assessment units. If they can be open for longer to alleviate the pressure on our accident and emergency departments, that would seem to me to be a sensible idea. Merlin Park University Hospital-----

The Deputy can decide to impugn my name or my integrity - good luck to him with that - but as long as I am the Minister for Health, I am not going to be a spokesperson for the HSE and I am not going to be a bureaucratic spokesperson.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	110	The Deputy asked me about three points and I am answering the three points. I am not going to defend the indefensible. When I see something that is appalling and unacceptable, I will call it out as such. I will tell Deputies what I, as Minister, will do to mitigate it and I will also tell Deputies what I expect from the people who receive €14.1 billion of taxpayers' money to fix the situation. Reference was made to policy. I do not run Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. My policy is not in respect of endoscopies and theatres, but I will get the Deputy a full response from management with regard to Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. If the Deputy is saying that he believes more can be done in Navan to tackle waiting lists and carry out additional procedures, I will examine the position. On the emergency department in Navan, in the nine months I have been the Minister for Health I have had no contact from the HSE on proposals to change any services at that hospital. I am extraordinarily concerned about what has happened at CUMH. Deputy Moynihan and other Deputies from Cork brought the matter to my attention. I visited CUMH and met the consultants, clinicians and management there. I cannot understand how we have a situation where women in Cork face waiting lists that are almost double the length of those that obtain in Dublin hospitals. We had a financial crisis across all of the health service in all of the country, yet we have a situation in Cork where women are expected to face much longer waiting lists. That can only come back to how we are actually managing the resources in that hospital. The Deputy has correctly said that in recent weeks we have seen a new group clinical director for maternity services, an appointment that has been very much welcomed by many clinicians there. In my letter to the director general of the HSE, I have made it very clear that I expect to see the gynaecological services in CUMH prioritised as part of the HSE waiting list action plan for 2017. I expect to have a follow-up meeting with clinicians and with Cork Oireachtas Members in the coming weeks. Deputy Moynihan also raised the issue of cataract services. Under the NTPF, €5 million will be targeted at day-case procedures with a priority on operations and procedures such as the cataract procedures. I hope a number of the Deputy's constituents and people right around the country should start to be called for those appointments from March 2017. I agree absolutely with Deputy Moynihan who asked if we can learn from other parts of the country. This is the point about accountability - it is not that heads must roll or that everybody is appalling, it is about saying that we must find really good examples and demand that good practice everywhere. There are very good examples and the Deputy mentioned what is being done in Sligo. I would like to see a pooling of waiting lists and resources so that if a person needs to see a consultant today the entire hospital group works to try and get that person to see whichever consultant is appropriate, as quickly as possible. We are going to look at rolling out the pooling of waiting lists in 2017.

Last Tuesday, a woman in her 80s rang me in tears. She spoke about wanting to end it all. She was under pressure because her medical card had been rescinded. I definitely want to know why it was rescinded. It was very hard to listen to an 80-year old woman crying because she wanted to end her life. The Minister is aware of my background in the area of mental health and so on. It is bad enough having our hometown known as the suicide capital of the world and having a suicide row in the graveyard. I need answers on that. My second point is around the Midleton ambulance in east Cork. It has been rumoured that the HSE is going to pull that service. The service is extremely vital to us. When it was removed two years ago, we had two high-profile deaths involving young people. We do not want to see this service removed, regardless of what the cutbacks are. I would like answers on both of these points.

A young girl - a healthy young woman - was out for a meal with her friends. She collapsed with excruciating pain in her head and was admitted to Sligo University Hospital at 8 p.m. Nothing happened until 8 o'clock the following morning. I do not know what happened there, quite honestly, but I ask that the Minister would investigate on behalf of her father, mother and sister as to what took place there. The young girl had to be transferred to Beaumont Hospital in Dublin, but sadly, not in time. On behalf of the parents, I ask the Minister please to investigate this situation so they can at least get some peace of mind as to what happened.
#TomNeville	unknown-#TomNeville-party	unknown-#TomNeville-dob	unknown-#TomNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	113	Since the PPARS debacle some years ago, there seems to have been a shying away from any attempt to upgrade IT systems within the health service. Delay is no longer acceptable, however, and the challenge must be met head on. We live in an IT age, with cloud computing and so on. Ten or 12 years after PPARS, however, we still have a paper-based system. Any large organisation in the private sector has an enterprise resource planning, ERP, system, usually running on a SAP or Oracle platform, with data accessible from user iPads and integrated such that a person in one office can access information from another office. Introducing something similar in our hospitals would free up a lot of resources, which is vital given that the crisis we are facing is largely to do with the management of resources. Are there plans to put an integrated IT system in place across the health service? We need to examine the logistical models. In regard to waiting list times, will short-term targets, of three, six, nine and 12 months, be set? Will the Minister also give an update on the emergency department and the 93-bed unit at University Hospital Limerick?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	114	I acknowledge Deputy Buckley's track record in pursuing mental health issues and being a strong advocate in this area. If he sends me details of the first matter he raised, I will have it examined. I am not aware of the issue he raised in regard to the ambulance service but will have it checked out by my officials and revert back to the Deputy. We need to expand our ambulance fleet significantly, both the number of vehicles and the number of staff. Additional funding has been allocated to the National Ambulance Service this year to advance that objective. I will get back to the Deputy on both those issues. I am not familiar with the case Deputy Scanlon outlined but I join him in extending my sympathy to the family concerned on what seems to have been a very tragic incident. The investigative function in such matters does not lie with me but if the Deputy wishes to write to me on the matter, I will make sure it is looked into and that somebody reverts to him with an outline of the situation. Deputy Neville highlighted a very important issue which I expect, from following the work of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare, is likely to be very much at the core of our priorities. The need to invest in ICT within the health service is undeniable. The Deputy is right that in the past, as a result of projects that went wrong, many people shied away from taking the necessary steps. We cannot run a health service with large paper files filling room after room. There is an ambitious programme of work already under way by the e-health section of the HSE. The staff are a very dynamic and innovative group of people with whom I have had a lot of contact. The new e-referral system allows GPs to refer patients for hospital appointments electronically. The GP can see while the patient is in the room that the appointment is in the system and there is no need for the collection of letters of referral. We also have introduced an e-prescribing system in some hospitals. This year, every citizen will be assigned an individual health identifier which will be recognised by the HSE's computer system. These are the building blocks. Since December, Cork University Maternity Hospital is the first hospital in the country to have electronic records for every baby born there, which will stay with them throughout their lives. It seems appropriate that this initiative should commence in the maternity service, the plan being to roll it out to Kerry, the Rotunda and Holles Street this year. Deputy Neville also asked about targets. I have outlined the targets we are setting, namely, that by the end of June, nobody will wait longer than 18 months for a day case procedure and, by the end of October, no person will wait longer than 15 months for an outpatient appointment, impatient procedure or day case procedure. I realise these are still lengthy waiting times, but we have to start somewhere. Given the appalling situation facing children with scoliosis, I have asked the HSE to produce an action plan on scoliosis, which I will have by the end of this month. In addition, the director general has committed that by the end of this year, no child will wait longer than four months for a paediatric scoliosis procedure. It is an ambitious and bold target considering where we are, but it sends a strong message that we will ensure the provision of scoliosis procedures and treatments for children in this country is in line with what is done in other jurisdictions, including in the NHS. On the issues relating to University Hospital Limerick, I will arrange for an update to be sent to the Deputy.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	115	This time last year, during the course of the election campaign, it was obvious people wanted to improve their lot and that of their families from an income and taxation perspective but not at the expense of the provision of health services, especially for children. It was against this backdrop that we negotiated an agreement with the Government and insisted on the restoration of the National Treatment Purchase Fund to the levels it was at in the past, which helped to address major logjams that had arisen previously. I implore the Minister to pour whatever resources he can into that sector to deal with the crisis we are facing. The Minister mentioned that no hospital has been built since 1998. In fact, the Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore, was opened in 2007 at a cost of €150 million. We are very proud of that facility which represented the realisation of the process that was put in place many years earlier to share services among the Midland Regional Hospitals at Mullingar, Tullamore and Portlaoise. However, like many other hospitals throughout the country, theatres in Mullingar sit vacant during the months of January and February because of the pressures on emergency beds and, ultimately, because of the failure to meet capacity that has arisen out of the problems in attracting specialist nurses and other nursing staff.

Sarah-Ann Mitchell, who is 11 years old, was diagnosed with scoliosis in July and still does not have an appointment. I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister on 20 December on behalf of her mother, Karen, which was batted off to the HSE on 17 January. There has been no reply. Sarah-Ann's consultant says her spinal curvature has increased by 10% to 60% since July because of the delay. She is suffering greatly.

Will the Minister agree to meet Karen in order that she can find out what is going on and when Sarah-Ann will receive treatment? The orthodontic clinic at Loughlinstown hospital is no longer making referrals to St. James's Hospital because the list at the latter is so long. What does the Minister propose to do about this? It is bad enough for patients to be on a long list but even worse if one cannot get on the list.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	123	Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the case of scoliosis sufferer Sarah-Ann Mitchell. There are many children enduring the same suffering, including my daughter who has a curve in her spine of 45°. As is too often the case, my daughter's problem was not identified early enough, until she was 16. At that stage, a back brace was not an option because her growth was coming to an end. When I was a child, the public health nurses who went into every school in the State, as they still do to carry out vaccinations, also checked for scoliosis. That no longer happens even though it is a simple procedure which takes less than two minutes. Early identification of scoliosis would alleviate the suffering children are having to endure and, in some cases, prevent the need for surgery later on. Will the Minister ensure that process is rolled out across the State? We do not need an action plan or to wait until the end of the month. It can be done in the morning.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	124	In response to Deputy Cowen, I am not partisan or petty on this, in that the NTPF was set up by the Fianna Fáil Party in government and the Fianna Fáil Party sought the reinstatement of it. While there have been differing views in my party, I am of the view that it is a useful and effective vehicle, at least in the short term. While people want to have ideological discussions about public versus private, we are increasing significantly the budget in the public health service. However, the capacity is not there in the morning and those waiting at home, including those on the "RTE Investigates" programme, want procedures done as soon as possible. We want them done as soon as possible. The NTPF is a useful and important vehicle in that regard. The point about investment also was not a partisan one about the Governments in which Deputy Cowen's party participated. Collectively, we have failed to plan for demographics in the way in which we have done good work on school places. The Department of Education and Skills now knows the number of children next year needing a school place and the number of teachers and classrooms that will be needed. We have not undertaken that level of demographic analysis of the health service and that is what needs to be done. That is why the ten-year plan is important. On nursing, I reiterate what I have said in this House, which is the issue of recruitment and retention of nurses is a key building block if we want to break what I have described as the vicious cycle of overcrowding on hospital waiting lists, bed capacity, recruitment and retention and a GP contract. We have engaged with the INMO and SIPTU on proposals to address recruitment and retention. That includes a fully-funded workforce plan for 2017, giving directors of nursing more power to fill vacancies and trying to improve some of the recruitment campaigns. I do not want to get into all of the detail because the INMO and SIPTU are still, I hope, willing to engage in further discussions with health service management.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	126	We cannot usurp the Public Service Pay Commission process. That process is due to report in a matter of weeks and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has set out the process for addressing issues of pay and allowances. I believe issues of allowances and pay will need to be looked at if we are serious about recruitment and retention in the future and I believe the public sector pay commission is the vehicle to do it. The INMO was at the public sector pay commission on Tuesday. My Department was at the public sector pay commission making these points. We are willing to do everything and anything we can to assist with the recruitment and retention issue in nursing. We cannot get into the pay and allowances space because there is a process in that regard and, as the House will be aware, there are public servants right across both the public service and the health service where there could be a contagion effect in respect of some allowances. In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, I would be happy to arrange to meet Karen and Sarah-Ann with him. That would be no problem at all. I accept the issue of theatre nurses has been the reason. I told Deputy McDonald it has been the reason the theatre in Crumlin, which was meant to be the principal vehicle for getting more of these operations done, has been closed. When I met the CEO of Crumlin and the director of nursing this week, they confirmed four nurses will start in April, which will enable the additional capacity. A further 16 nurses from an international campaign are going through the recruitment process and another orthopaedic consultant is due to come on stream by June. That will provide the additional capacity. As for the orthodontic services in Loughlinstown, I will have a look at them and revert directly to the Deputy. At present, we have the HSE's operational plans for each of the hospitals giving the hospitals their budget for the coming year. I will check it and revert to the Deputy. Deputy Brady told us of his own experience, which I appreciate him sharing with the House. The issue of school screening has been raised with me by a number of the advocacy groups. It is one of the issues I have asked be considered by the health service in the context of the action plan. I am not asking anyone to wait forever for an action plan. By the end of this month of February, we will have a plan to deal with scoliosis that will see a dramatic reduction in waiting lists and waiting times this year. It seems a logical suggestion but I believe it was changed on clinical grounds. It sounds like there is merit in it. It is being considered in the context of the action plan. I will engage with the advocacy groups on that too.

On 12 December 2016, management and the clinical director gave the Minister a submission on the hospital in Galway. They pointed out two specific matters, the first of which was that the hospital itself is not fit for purpose. They asked the Minister for the approval to proceed urgently with an options appraisal on infrastructure, in plain English, a new hospital. Second, they asked for immediate investment in the current emergency department because that is not fit for purpose. It is dangerous, according to an independent report. The final part of my question relates to the ambulance service in Galway, which is in Merlin Park in appalling temporary accommodation that I say is not safe. It is one question with three parts - a new hospital, accident and emergency and the ambulance service.

The first relates to the bed capacity review. Can the Minister share the terms of reference with the House? Second, since there has been much talk here today about capacity, whatever the Minister proposed to the INMO was rejected by its executive. That was made fairly clear and put in stark terms. Since we all are agreed, as we rarely can be, that capacity is the key and nurses are the key to being able to generate that capacity along with their colleagues and allied health professionals and other workers, what new proposal can the Minister present to the INMO executive that it has not rejected already? With regard to the points I raised on the NTPF protocol that was written in 2014, it had been available on the website and then was withdrawn fairly hastily, on the basis of what clinical evidence was that done and why? Clearly, what happened led directly to the programme we all saw on Monday. The Minister might explain that.

That is the way it stands. The Minister is here to answer various questions, not about his role in terms of the Department but for the HSE. The House passed €14 billion worth of a budget and yet the body or agency getting that funding is totally chaotic. It is dysfunctional. I want to know whether the Minister has scrutinised the management of the HSE and how he will make it answerable to this House. Are there too many managers and not enough staff on the front line? Is the Minister funding a top-heavy organisation and should it be reformed? As for the waiting lists and that question, how can anyone stand over a child in that bracket, with autism as well, having the operation cancelled on two occasions?

I did not take up time. There are three parts to it. The Minister got a submission for a new hospital and immediate investment in accident and emergency and I asked about the ambulance service. The Minister should address the question on the submission.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	145	If the Deputy will bear with me a moment, I will address the three parts. The hospital group has made a submission on Merlin Park. There is merit in the suggestion that more can be done in Merlin Park. We are about to have a mid-term capital review this year and I have asked that the HSE consider it in that context. That is the situation in that regard. In respect of University Hospital Galway, the second piece on the emergency department, ED, as the Deputy will be aware, the design phase has been approved for the emergency department and funding has been made available for that piece.Once the design phase is approved, that then moves forward in the context of the capital plan. In regard to third piece, which is the ambulance service, I do not have the information for the Deputy but I will come back to her directly. In response to Deputy Louise O'Reilly, I would be happy to share with her the information I have on the bed capacity review. The review will assess the following: first, current capacity and levels of unmet demand; second, trends in better utilisation of existing capacity and scope for further gains; third, drivers of future demand, including demographics, which is a big part of this, and epidemiological trends, innovations and technological advances; and, fourth, further capacity requirements based on a preferred model of care. As the Deputy knows, the committee of which she is a member and which aims to produce the ten-year plan on the future of the health service, is a very important part of that. If we are making a shift to primary care, we need to examine what impact that will have on bed capacity. I know the committee is making an input in that regard. This will be a substantial body of work. This idea that we can just pluck a figure, say it is the number of beds we need and not be cognisant of the model of care or of primary care would not be a sound way to do this. However, we will have a crystallised ask for the mid-term capital review in terms of how many additional beds we believe we need in the Irish health service. With regard to nursing, I am very reluctant to say anything that is unhelpful to the process that is ongoing.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	150	The INMO executive council met yesterday. I am deeply disappointed that it rejected the proposals, although I respect the right of its members to do as they wish. What is really important is they have now provided three weeks and six days before a work-to-rule takes place across the Irish health service, a work-to-rule that I believe, and the INMO has conceded, would be detrimental to Irish patients. We need to use those three weeks and six days to try to resolve this dispute. As was prearranged, the INMO is today attending the Lansdowne Road oversight group and I await the input and instruction from that group. We know the structure of that group in terms of unions and management. I hope it will suggest further discussion and dialogue, which is essential. I understand significant progress was made on a number of elements and I know there were one or two elements in particular on which the INMO did not feel adequate progress was made. I want to use this time. We will only resolve any dispute by sitting around a table and trying to sort it out. What nobody needs in the Irish health service is industrial action. In regard to the NTPF, to be clear, no matter how many times it is asserted, I did not ask the NTPF to change anything in regard to protocols, its website or anything else. The NTPF has confirmed to me again, as recently as during this debate, that there has been no change in the way the preplanned and pre-admit lists are reported in the new protocol and the NTPF has not, since its establishment, under six Ministers for Health and five Governments since 2002, published the pre-admit lists. They were published yesterday and I have given a commitment in the House today that they will now be published each and every month until that body of work with Trinity is finished.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	153	I will. With regard to accountability, I appreciate the point Deputy McGuinness makes. I am clear on what I am accountable for but there are other people accountable for other elements of the health service. When I ask for them to be held to account and for them to redouble their efforts, I do not mean it to excuse me of my responsibilities. When I talk about accountability, I am talking about trying to identify the fact there is good practice and really good stuff happening in parts of the health service. However, if we do not look at the system and who is doing well, we cannot replicate that good practice. We have seen it in Beaumont Hospital and in the RCSI group, and Deputy Rabbitte pointed out the good practice in regard to some midwifery services in Limerick. We have a performance and accountability framework. It is a document that every manager in the health services signs, and it is agreed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE and the Department of Health. It states that managers must be held to account on four scores, one of which is financial. Deputy McGuinness and I would have talked about this a lot at the Committee of Public Accounts and the system is getting quite good at holding people to account on the financial side. However, the other three pieces are what matter to the people in the "RTE Investigates" programmes, and involve things like timely access, quality and the safety of the service. I have written to the director general of the service to say I want to know how each manager measures up against that balanced scorecard in regard to those four things, not just the financial piece. Yes, I believe the HSE needs to be reformed. What I do not think needs to happen, and I hope the House would agree on this, is that another Minister for Health would just tweak the structures. In due course, hopefully in quite a while, we will have another election and perhaps a different Government. Deputy Billy Kelleher might one day be Minister for Health and might decide to change the system, and Deputy Louise O'Reilly might then be Minister, and she might decide to change it again. We need to have a cross-party plan for ten years in order that the structure does not keep changing no matter who else changes. I hope and expect that the Committee on the Future of Healthcare will give us that structure and I am committing to the House that we will then implement that structure. Let us then try to legislate for accountability and for governance, and let us try to address the piece that has been brought up time and again about the accountability of health service managers and executives to public representatives on behalf of their constituents and communities. I will look into the points raised by the Deputy in regard to St. Luke's and the correspondence he has given me in regard to Galway.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	155	I want to ask about the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise. The extra resources provided for maternity services have proved beneficial and the results are there to be seen. A letter was circulated to hospital staff and the local media recently highlighting the fact that when the hospital gets resources, services can be improved. However, I want to highlight the fact there were 433 cancellations of surgery last year at Portlaoise hospital. I am told by staff that the bed capacity is supposed to be at 80% to 85%, as is good international practice, but it is at 110% in Portlaoise because 10% to 15% of patients are on trolleys and chairs. According to a reply I received from the Minister, one quarter of staff wages are going to agency staff and temporary locums despite the fact they make up less than 15% of staff, which shows they are more expensive. There are huge problems with recruitment because there is no certainty and there is no plan for the future of the hospital. Working conditions are bad due to the pressure caused by shortage of staff. Will the Minister commit to quickly publishing the plan on the future of the hospital? Will he increase bed capacity? Will he employ the permanent staff who are needed to remove the bottlenecks in Portlaoise hospital?

I welcome that we have had these statements. This open, honest and frank question-and-answer session is the way we should do business a lot more often in the House. It is a very good way to do business and I commend the Minister on facilitating this. I would say to those who took the opportunity this morning to take cheap political shots at the Minister that at least Deputy Harris had the courage to be a Minister when the people elected him to the House in the same way everybody else in this Chamber was elected. He stood up and was counted when it mattered, which should be borne in mind by those who are very quick to criticise and throw this around like a political football. On the matter of the written responses we seek, and in light of my contribution during the statements, will the Minister try to deliver change in this area for the purposes of accountability? An issue raised on numerous occasions by my colleague in Kerry, Councillor Bobby O'Connell, is that of the "do not attends". This is costing the health service millions of euro every year and there is also the issue of keeping other people further down the waiting lists. What initiative is being taken to try to address this? Is there an optimum amount the Minister could additionally spend in the context of the overall capacity that is available in 2017? How short of that amount is the Minister? Is he making efforts with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to try to bridge the gap?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	157	On Deputy O'Dowd's point, I want to be very clear that I have confidence in the director general of the HSE to do his job. However, I do not have blind confidence in anybody and I am not going to start writing blank cheques for anybody. Everybody in every role in the health service, from the person working on the front line to the person managing a hospital, big or small, needs to be responsible and accountable and we all need to redouble our efforts in this regard. I have confidence in the director general and the work he is doing but I am not offering a statement of blind confidence in anybody in any management position within the health service. What I have done is to invoke the performance and accountability framework, a new framework brought in by this new Government to put in place a firmer and clearer system of accountability.I have outlined the four criteria and I will not outline them again. The managers sign up to be measured against them. It says where managers do not deliver on them, and they can be examined first by their group CEO and then by a national director, improvement plans must be put in place. Where improvement plans are not acted on, the person can be removed from the post. I do not want to reach the point where we are removing people from their posts. I want to reach the point where we are improving the health service. The director general will come back to me as a result of my letter to him on 5 January, in which I asked that the performance and accountability framework be analysed against each manager. I would be happy to brief Deputies on the outcome of the process. I was pleased to visit Portlaoise hospital recently and meet Oireachtas Members and members of Laois County Council. No decision has been made to withdraw services from Portlaoise hospital. I was also very clear when I visited Portlaoise, and I hope it was heard across party lines, that the HSE has a view on a plan for Portlaoise. While it is an important view, it is not the full picture.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	161	While I want to provide certainty to Portlaoise hospital, I want to ensure we have all the pieces of the jigsaw before I do so. We hope to increase the number of nurses working in the health service by more than 1,000 this year and I expect Portlaoise will benefit from it. Regarding where we need to invest in more beds, I will be led by the bed capacity review. I thank Deputy Griffin for his comments. This is the way the Dáil should work. It is much more interactive, when we get a chance. I do not try to be partisan in this role. It would be a futile exercise. Over the years, as we have seen on every RTE programme or news clip, while the Minister, Government and party may change, the problems remain. This has been a tough week for me trying to ensure we put a comprehensive response in place, and it has been a tough week for the people waiting on these lists. Those are the people we all care about. I have no intention of giving up on my responsibilities. I intend to redouble my efforts, and I need everybody else to redouble theirs. The Deputy's point on written responses is something I will look up. Regarding Councillor Bobby O'Connell's request regarding "did not attends", from memory there were approximately 450,000 "did not attends" for outpatient appointments in the health service last year. It is a significant cost to the health service. To try to improve it, we are bringing in an SMS reminder system. We have it in place at a number of our hospitals, whereby patients are receiving a text message a couple of days before and on the day before their appointments. I want to examine modifying the text to inform patients of the cost of missing the appointment to drive home the point that if a person misses a hospital appointment, it has a knock-on effect on so many others. On the question of whether we require more funding, I did not want to do what past Ministers for Health have done the first time a crisis arose, namely, ask for more money. The Government has provided €14.1 billion to the health service. It is the largest ever health budget. We may require more funding from within the budget to be allocated to the waiting list issue or the NTPF. However, sometimes too many more important issues are let off the hook if I immediately run to try to find the chequebook in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

Is it still talking about disbanding the HSE? Is it talking about establishing hospital trusts? While we criticise the HSE, we, and everybody else, are unsure as to the Government's stated policy on the HSE, whether it is to be reformed or abolished, and how we underpin our health services. While we criticise management, there is an obligation on the Minister to outline the strategy clearly. Will the Minister wait for the ten-year plan or what is his view? We do not know, and everybody in the HSE does not know.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	163	I refer to two specific waiting lists in University Hospital Waterford. As the Minister knows, 6,000 people are awaiting orthopaedic operations, be it hip or knee. These are very successful operations and greatly improve people's quality of life. Most of the operations are done in Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital. Patients go into hospital on a Monday and are discharged on Thursday. They are very effective. The ophthalmology waiting list is also in excess of 6,000. Under the NTPF, can we specifically target extremely long waiting lists, given that 4,000 of these 12,000 people have been on the waiting list longer than 18 months? Specific targeting of these two extremely long waiting lists would be very much appreciated.

The Minister has visited Cashel hospital, where €22.5 million was spent, after which it closed. There was an overrun of €7 million and I have referred the matter to the Committee of Public Accounts. Will the Minister insist that step-down patients be allowed into the hospital and that beds will be put in? It is state-of-the-art. If we are going to waste this kind of money on a building that is being used just for a very few minor injuries, as the Minister saw, and offices for management, it is unacceptable. The Minister said he had spoken to them a week ago. We need it to be opened and we need beds and services for step-down patients to relieve the chronic conditions in South Tipperary General Hospital, which is one of the worst hospitals in the country, according to the nurses, for trolleys, people on chairs and ambulances backed up. It is breaking point for the front-line staff there and the management. We need to make the HSE managers agree to it.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	166	I am confused that Deputy Billy Kelleher is confused as to what the Government's policy is. It has been the same since the Government came to office. We are going to try to do what we have never done before regarding the health service, namely, agree on a cross-party basis what the structure of the health service should be. We all agree it should not be exactly as the HSE is. We all agree it has dysfunctional elements and we all agree it must be improved. Putting the hospital groups on a statutory footing and giving them autonomy makes a lot of sense. This is what I would like to see underpinned in legislation. However, this is a minority Government, and to pass any legislation on HSE structures will require support. This is why it is over to this Oireachtas, including my party, to refuse to play party politics with the structures. I am not suggesting the Deputy is. When the report is published in April, I hope to see the structures every party wants. Then let us put them into law in the House as quickly as possible. Deputy Mary Butler was right to highlight the two issues of orthopaedics and ophthalmology in University Hospital Waterford. She has, on a number of occasions, made me aware of the length of these waiting lists. We will have a target that no patient will wait longer than 15 months for any procedure, including those, by the end of October. Let me see if any more can be done about it in the context of the HSE waiting plan. I agree with Deputy Mattie McGrath on Cashel. We do not need fiefdoms in our health service. The idea that Clonmel is under pressure while Cashel is not doing enough is unacceptable. The Deputy mentioned money being spent. None of that happened on my watch. On my watch, additional services will be provided in Cashel.

In response to Monday’s programme, we have had much empathy and eloquent words from the Minister for Health. I do not doubt his sincerity. However, we need decisive action that will make a tangible difference to the people affected. The latest hospital waiting lists for January are staggering. Over 632,000 people are on a waiting list of some form or another, almost 13% of our population. More than one in eight people are now on a waiting list. This is indeed truly shocking, extraordinary and frightening. Nurses and midwives have decided to engage in industrial action because they have lost faith in the ability of the Government and the Health Service Executive, HSE, to deal with the acute nursing shortages across our health service. It is clear nurses and midwives do not want to engage in industrial action. It is not what they are about. They want to be at work providing the best service they can for the patients they serve. It has been evident for quite some time that nurses and midwives are deeply frustrated with the environment in which they have to work. They say it is unsafe for themselves, for the patients they serve and for other health professionals. The kernel of this dispute lies in staffing, recruitment and retention. In truth, it has been brewing for quite some time. I acknowledge there have been efforts by the Government and the HSE to recruit more nurses and midwives. However, it has met with little success. A shortage of nurses and midwives hurts. It is not victimless. The shortage of nurses means operations get cancelled. Last year, 37,000 operations were cancelled, up over 50% from the previous year. The shortage of nurses means that acute beds cannot be filled. Even today, over 100 acute beds in our hospital system cannot be filled while, at the same time, people are lying on hospital trolleys. The shortage of nurses means, in essence, that patients are not being served in the way they should. The goodwill of nurses and midwives has helped to keep the system chugging along. They have had enough, however, and who can blame them? What is the Government’s plan to deal with imminent industrial action by nurses and midwives? What reassurance can the Tánaiste give patients across the country that the situation will not get worse? They are frightened by what has been revealed about the current state of our health service, especially around waiting lists, hospital trolleys and so forth. Now, they learn of this industrial action which has the potential to make matters worse. It is happening because nurses have simply had enough. We need a reassurance from the Tánaiste as to what the Government will do to prevent this industrial action, which is less than four weeks away.

Undoubtedly, people would suffer if we were at that point. It is certainly something the Government and every Member wants to avoid. We do not want to be in that place. I shared the deep disappointment of both the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, when they heard the outcome of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, executive committee meeting the other night. Significant efforts were made to resolve this issue by all sides, namely, the HSE, the Department and the INMO. Unfortunately, we still have a situation where the announcement was put forward and the INMO rejected the proposals. Every effort was made to reach agreement. The Minister, the HSE and the INMO recognise the challenge of recruiting and retaining nurses in the public health system. It is no consolation to patients and those who use the health services that this is an international problem. However, the truth is that almost every public health service in the world is having the same difficulty in attracting nurses. It is an enormous challenge but one we are determined to meet. The initiatives put forward at the discussions included a commitment to substantially increase the nurse and midwifery force in 2017 with 1,208 additional funded posts coming on stream, offering all graduate nurses and midwives full-time contracts, a career break scheme, 130 additional undergraduate places in 2017 and improved educational opportunities and career pathways. Obviously, it was felt this was not enough. The next step is that there is a meeting this afternoon of the Lansdowne Road agreement oversight group. I encourage everybody involved to make every effort to come to an agreement on the issues which I have outlined. It is clear people have to engage seriously on this. There is time as the threatened action is several weeks away. I encourage everyone to get involved in these talks. The HSE and the Department remain open to detailed discussion to resolve the dispute to ensure we do not arrive at a point where, as the Deputy said rightly, patients would suffer.

I do not believe the Lansdowne Road agreement oversight group is going to be the forum for resolving this issue. The Tánaiste outlined what was in the document put forward by the HSE and the Government but it was rejected. I did not say the industrial action is not victimless. I said the shortage of nurses and midwives is not victimless. That is what is at the root cause of this dispute. Until the Government recognises that, then we are not on the way to resolving this issue. The Minister said 1,200 nurses will be recruited over the course of the year.Nobody believes that will actually be delivered and that is the problem. The nurses and midwives have heard it all before. There has been a litany of broken promises from three successive Fine Gael Ministers for Health in the past number of years on ending the scandal of people lying on trolleys, cutting hospital waiting lists and bringing in universal health insurance. We are not seeing progress on these issues and nurses are frustrated. The decision to take industrial action is borne out of that frustration. They see no other way of resolving the issue. There has to be meaningful engagement and a genuine commitment on the part of the Government now to deal with the underlying reasons for this industrial dispute.

Every effort will be made to come to an agreement on these important issues. When we are focusing on the problems in the health service, we tend not to really pay tribute to the extraordinary work that is done for so many patients and the extraordinary successes we have seen in the health service. It is worth making that point because huge efforts are made by doctors and nurses and people get excellent treatment. Clearly, the issue of recruiting and retaining is extremely difficult. There have been open recruitment periods and recruitment remains open and continuous. Every effort is being made to attract new staff. It is worth noting that since December 2013, numbers of staff in the area have increased by 1,657. We have had that increase. The extra €1 billion that has gone into the health service for a range of issues is having an impact but there is more work to be done. As the Minister said, it is also about changing the GP contracts so more people can get better service in the community and it is also about looking at the bed capacity review. No new hospitals have been built since 1988 and we need to change that.

I welcome that. It is long overdue. The protected disclosures that are the subject of the commission outline an alleged orchestrated campaign by some in senior Garda management positions to undermine Sergeant Maurice McCabe. Those allegations include the distribution of text messages to attack his reputation, the opening of intelligence files on him, the monitoring of his activities, the briefing of elements of the media and selected politicians alleging criminal wrongdoing by Sergeant McCabe. These are incredibly serious issues. They go to the very core of our policing and justice systems. What is alleged is a comprehensive campaign of character assassination, a calculated campaign to destroy the standing of a serving member of An Garda Síochána and a cynical campaign that sought out allies among the compliant sections of the mainstream media and politicians. This is, to borrow the phrase, a truly terrible vista. The idea of the forces of law and order turning on an officer of the law, a man who has done the State some service and a citizen prepared to step forward and speak out is an outrage. It is an outrage that begs the most fundamental questions about the fair administration of justice and the authorities entrusted with upholding the law. Sergeant McCabe's offence, it seems, was to blow the whistle on Garda malpractice in penalty points. Is this what happens when someone stands up to wrongdoing? Is this how someone is treated when they stand up and raise concerns regarding practices within the upper echelons of An Garda Síochána? It seems the actions of some in senior Garda management are perhaps summed up best by the words of the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan. Their actions are disgusting. Yesterday, an Teachta Brendan Howlin put allegations on the record of this House. I will not repeat them but they are incredibly serious. Suffice to say they allege a vile and, quite frankly, evil attempt by An Garda Síochána at the very top to ruin a man's character and standing. We in Sinn Féin have previously called for Garda Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan to step aside, without prejudice, for the duration of the commission of investigation's work. That is a basic requirement for public confidence and vital for the battered morale of serving members of An Garda Síochána.  My questions are straightforward. Does the Tánaiste have confidence in the Garda Commissioner? Will she do the right thing and ask her to step aside from her duties, without prejudice, for the duration of the Charleton commission's investigation? 
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	184	We are about to have a debate in the House on the terms of reference of the commission of investigation. When these allegations were brought to my attention, particularly through the protected disclosures, I asked Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill to conduct an investigation into how these very serious allegations and serious protected disclosures should be dealt with. I received his report some weeks ago. I went to Government last week and followed his recommendations in their entirely in terms of pursuing a commission of investigation which the Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Peter Charleton, has agreed to chair. I thank both of them for the work they have done. These are very serious allegations made about An Garda Síochána, on which we all depend and which is central to our democracy. Its effective functioning is central to our democracy. Both I and the Government are fully committed to ensuring that is the situation. I will make a number of points on what the Deputy has said about a particular person and the context. There is a general constitutional obligation to protect the good names and reputations of persons who may be the subject of untested allegations. That constitutional protection applies to everybody involved in this situation, not only the two people the Deputy mentioned but everybody - those who make the protected disclosures and those against whom the allegations are made. That is the first point. That is how we do things in this country. We follow our constitutional obligations to protect the good names and reputations of people who may be the subject of untested allegations. That applies to all individuals in the House. The Deputy will recall that in advance of the referring and publishing of Mr. Justice O'Neill's conclusions and recommendations, I refused to discuss the nature of the allegations being made because of the rules around protected disclosure. We will have the chance to debate all of this but what is at issue here is a series of allegations that have not yet been tested and which, I have to repeat again, are wholly denied by the people against whom they are made. I do not believe there is a reason for anyone to step aside in that context. If everybody against whom allegations are made was expected to step aside, we would have a very extraordinary situation. People are entitled to fair procedures, justice and the proper way of doing things. We are not dealing with circumstances where a prima facie case of wrongdoing has been established against anyone. Mr. Justice O'Neill, the very person who had the opportunity to speak to everyone and to examine the whole situation, has said he cannot make any findings on the very allegations the Deputy speaks about. He, as a judge, having considered it, does not feel he can do it and that a commission of investigation is necessary. In the case of the Garda Commissioner, I have consistently stated there has been no finding of any wrongdoing against her. In those circumstances, she is entitled to our full support and confidence. That remains the position.

What I have said and what Mr. Justice O'Neill set out is the rationale for a commission of investigation that is largely, if not exclusively, focused on the actions and activities of the former Garda Commissioner and the current Garda Commissioner.As a matter of good procedure in the pursuance of protecting everybody's rights, including Sergeant McCabe's and the other whistleblower, it is preferable that the person at the heart of this matter would step aside without prejudice. That is a matter of basic common sense but the Tánaiste resiles from that. That is a very great shame. Will the Tánaiste confirm for the House, as we know of the allegations of contact between An Garda Síochána up to the very top with the media and politicians, if she is aware of contact between An Garda Síochána and any other State agency in relation to Sergeant Maurice McCabe?

What I have said is that I believe the interests of justice in this country are better served by the process that I have outlined.

The question I want to ask has been prompted by two developments. The first is the actions and words of President Trump in regard to refugees, the ban on refugees coming from Syria and on other refugees from Muslim-majority countries, and also by the world reaction to his words. With very few exceptions, the reaction has been one of anger and condemnation because we are all very concerned with this attack on the rights of refugees to flee war and oppression. It goes against the principles of the American Declaration of Independence. It also reneges on international obligations. Ireland also protested and various Ministers were vocal in stating it was wrong to treat people on the basis of their religion or nationality and that we have to stand by refugees and asylum seekers. We were saying all the right things but the words do not stand up when we consider the particular ways in which we are treating refugees, asylum seekers and migrants in this country. We are also part of some very questionable EU agreements. For example, the EU-Turkey agreement continues to come in for criticism, yet at the same time the EU is considering one with Libya on refugees. That goes against what the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights said, namely, that sending people back to Libya or to countries that have not signed the Geneva Convention should always be avoided. We have low rates of acceptance of asylum seekers. It is less than half the European average. We have been slow in taking in the Syrian refugees and there are delays with family reunification. While there has been movement on direct provision, the current figure is 4,300. I want to highlight the matter of the serious shortcomings and the issues that continue for young people who are growing up in the asylum system in Ireland. If those issues continue to be unaddressed, then our protest against President Trump's actions continues to be hypocritical. The migrant integration strategy, which the Tánaiste has just launched, is welcome as a step in the right direction, and the Tánaiste said that this is the first step. However, our immigration system is not addressing a wide range of situations in which children and young people find themselves. There is also a need to consider the position of these young people, irrespective of their parents' status. There is also need to consider the position of those who are in State care if their status has not been resolved by the time they reach the age of 18. There is a need for clarity, consistency and for the provision of information and knowledge that is easily acceptable. I would draw the Tánaiste's attention, if she has not seen it already, to a report from the Immigrant Council of Ireland in December 2016. It was based on case studies involving a number of these young people. It was also based on conversations and engagements with professionals who work with them. The report is very clear on the issues and on the detailed recommendations on how the system needs to be reformed. It is a piece of work that still waits to be done and I ask that this would be treated with urgency.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	198	I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for raising those matters. Clearly, the whole international refugee crisis is one of the biggest challenges of our time, with 65 million people on the move across the world and huge numbers having arrived in Europe having crossed the Mediterranean and having used other routes. It is one of the biggest crises that the EU has faced in terms of its response. Regarding President Trump, I would have a huge concern about a blanket ban on refugees. I met the Syrian Support Group in Ireland yesterday and to hear the individual stories about what those families have been through and their relatives who still remain in Aleppo and other parts of Syria and who are spread around the world at this point is absolutely heart-breaking. We all have to reach out as much as we possibly can. In that regard, Ireland's commitment was a proactive one within the European Union. We were not under any obligation to take refugees, although I think everybody would agree that it was the right thing to do. We have approximately 80 Syrians arriving every few weeks in Ireland. When I meet those families, the first thing the vast majority of them ask is when their children can start school. They have the same wishes and hopes that every other family in this country would have. We have been very fortunate in this country that we have not seen extreme views expressed and that communities are supportive of those who arrive on our shores. Approximately 95,000 people have been naturalised in recent years and we have had quite a number of asylum seekers arrive here. Many improvements have been made in regard to direct provision but I accept that there is ongoing work to be done. We have a new International Protection Act which simplifies the procedure for those coming through. The status of those who are arriving now is dealt with within six to ten weeks and then we have to deal with the issues around housing and education and so on. There are particular issues in regard to children and my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, has been intent on ensuing any unaccompanied minors who we bring into this country get comprehensive services. I examined this issue in detail some years ago and there have been great improvements, as the Deputy will know, within the HSE in terms of the way that unaccompanied minors are now dealt with, where they live with foster families instead of in hostels. That is quite a dramatic change from the way these young children were being dealt with. I take the point that the Deputy made. We launched the new migrant integration strategy two days ago, which was welcomed by all of the groups working in this area. That has been well received but we have to make sure it is implemented. I certainly will examine the details of the Immigrant Council of Ireland's report in regard to young people. We want to offer these young people and newly arrived immigrants, refugees and migrants the very best services we can offer both at a national level and a local level. Much will depend on local services responding appropriately and reaching out to these families in order that they get the health and education services they need and the English language training. That is happening for these new arrivals.

Some of them have been in this country for seven, eight and more years. Many of them have no memory of their country of origin. They consider them to be Irish. A young person's immigration status will define and determine his or her life. It will determine their access to education, social services, employment and housing. I draw the Minister's attention to the Young People at Risk, YPAR, organisation in Dublin Central. The Minister, Deputy Zappone, launched its two-day conference recently in the Gresham Hotel. Those foreign national young people were speaking of their situation as it is now. They have come through primary and secondary level but they cannot access third level. They cannot go to work. Even those of them who can access the small amount of funding that is needed for a post-leaving certificate course, on having acquired a skill on having completed that course, they cannot use it because they cannot work. These young people want to contribute to Ireland in the same way as Irish migrants throughout the years have contributed to other countries where they lived. There is need to consider introducing an amnesty here in the same way that we are seeking one for the undocumented Irish in the United States. These young people refer to themselves as "ghosts". Their plea from the conference was that they do not want pity, they want regularisation.

The reality is that those numbers have dramatically decreased since the report was launched. There are very few people left in the system who have been here longer than the five-year mark, for example, except those who are taking judicial reviews. Therefore, the vast majority of these situations have been dealt with, and the new people arriving will now have their statuses dealt with in a far faster way, so we will not have the issue of people being here for long periods without their applications being processed and final decisions made. That is very important. The situation has changed. I put the figures into the public arena at a conference last week. The changes to the length of time people are spending in direct provision are very dramatic. Regarding the point the Deputy made about these young people, what is important is that they get their applications cleared quickly. Once they are refugees, of course they can work. They are not ghosts. They can be part of ordinary society. However, there are transitional points. We need to support the organisations working with these people and we are increasing the support we are giving to those organisations.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	201	Here we are again talking about practices within An Garda Síochána. We have had the O'Higgins report and the O'Neill report and earlier this week the Tánaiste announced a new commission of investigation, all of which were essentially designed with the same remit, that is, to investigate the practices of An Garda Síochána which underpinned the appalling treatment of whistleblowers in the force. Surely, this underlines the point that there is something fundamentally wrong at the most senior level of An Garda Síochána. The same commission was announced by the Tánaiste with zero recourse to the Dáil in advance regarding the terms of reference, and we will have a debate on the matter this afternoon. That was unfortunate. The minority Government of 59 members, underpinned by Fianna Fáil, does not represent parliamentary democracy, and the mandate of the entire Dáil must be remembered. It feels like a throwback to the majoritarianism and arrogance that developed in the last Dáil. I welcome the debate this afternoon, which comes after the fact. There seems to have been a kind of attitude that things can be managed. This has spectacularly backfired. Two weeks ago, John Mooney had a Sunday Times piece dealing with a report which the Tánaiste had been aware of since last year yet which had not found its way into the public domain. The report concerned serious mishandling of funds in Templemore Garda training college. In any other week, the story would have run and run, but the Tánaiste got lucky with the news cycle. The report is indicative of the malaise in the force. The Commissioner's statement last night that she was surprised by the revelations made yesterday astonished me and, I am sure, others because these allegations had been circulating at political and media levels for some months. If the Commissioner genuinely did not know about them, there is a very serious failure in the intelligence gathering capabilities of her office, and indeed the force, and a serious problem with internal communication. Given the tittle-tattle that the last Commissioner seemed to know about Mick Wallace's minor motoring offence, for example, it is very hard to believe that the current Commissioner is oblivious to the most serious and scurrilous allegations about her and Sergeant McCabe that were circulating. Given that it appears RTE correspondents were made privy to the intricate details of the O'Higgins report before it ever saw the light of day, the Commissioner might ask if RTE is getting more information than she is. It is very hard to believe the Commissioner's statement last night, and it begs the question what else we can believe. We in the Social Democrats see no option but for the Commissioner to step aside while the commission undertakes its work, given her central role in disciplinary procedures in the force. Does the Tánaiste accept that the establishment of a third inquiry into the force is indicative of serious problems at the most senior level of management? Does she accept that the force is undermined? Does she find it credible that the Commissioner did not know about the allegations that were circulating? Will she publish the report about Templemore college?

That was in the public arena, and questions were answered on it in the justice committee well before it was. Detailed information was put on the record about the audit and the actions that were being taken internally to deal with what had been uncovered by the audit of the college. That is the reality of the situation. However, what was put in the public arena is unacceptable in practice and governance terms, and that must be changed. My understanding at this point is that procedures have been changed. They were far too informal, but action has been taken internally to address that. I am very happy to come into the House to talk about this at some point and put all the information I have on the floor of the Dáil. Regarding the various issues that have arisen with An Garda Síochána, I have never denied that ongoing change, modernisation and reform is necessary as far as the Garda is concerned. That is the job of management and the job of Government in so far as I and the Government can set the parameters that will help that reform and that change. That is what I have done in establishing the independent Policing Authority, which is a sea change in the way the oversight of An Garda Síochána is done in this country. It is extremely important that we now have the independent Policing Authority dealing with a whole range of issues. I did refer the question of whistleblowing and how it was dealt with in An Garda Síochána to the independent Policing Authority many months ago. I have received the report from the authority about that. It suggested a number of improvements, and they have been dealt with. I will not take up the time of the House in putting on the record the other changes that have been made within An Garda Síochána regarding whistleblowing, but it is important to say that the manner in which whistleblowing is dealt with is an area that every organisation must examine. Any time I have had discussions with An Garda Síochána, my questions have concerned the examination of how well whistleblowers were being dealt with and the procedures that were in place. I have always been looking for improvements in this regard, and that work goes on. As far as the Commissioner's position is concerned, I make the point that regarding Judge O'Neill's inquiry, the various parties co-operated fully with the O'Neill review, and I have no doubt but that they will do the very same when it comes to the commission of investigation. This is a commission with strong powers, and everybody has said they will co-operate with it. I will not repeat what the Deputy said about the Garda Commissioner's statement, but the Garda Commissioner made a statement last night outlining her view and her response. I have no reason to believe that is not the truth of her situation. We must take the statement she made last night. I will not question it the way the Deputy has. It is a very serious charge to make against anyone that he or she would, by innuendo - this is what is being suggested - try to obstruct the work of a commission of investigation in any way. It is extremely unfair to make such a charge when there is no evidence whatsoever to support it. Let us remind ourselves that a commission of investigation has very extensive legal powers, should there be any obstruction of its work.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	203	I do not believe I was making allegations. A very extensive piece of secondary legislation was produced in 2007, namely, the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations. The Commissioner is central to these regulations and to any disciplinary process against rank and file members of the Garda, such as Superintendent David Taylor, for example, who finds himself at the centre of the process overseen by the Commissioner. He has been suspended for almost two years. An investigation into the matter was initiated by the Commissioner and conducted by her own husband. The Commissioner is a subject to investigation in this inquiry.It is very difficult to see how the force is not undermined by the Commissioner's staying in situ in respect of the disciplinary aspect of this case while the commission of investigation is under way. I ask without prejudice how the Tánaiste can think it is appropriate to be subject to an inquiry and perform the disciplinary procedure. I encourage the Tánaiste to reconsider encouraging the Commissioner to step aside for the duration of the inquiry.

Allegations have been made in the recent past in this House which on detailed examination by appropriate parties were found not to be correct. That happened very recently. We owe it to people to follow the correct procedures to have the right standards, the right approach when we are dealing with an issue such as this. It is an obligation. All of us would want to have our good names and reputations protected. We would not want people rushing to judgment and by taking certain actions we could be undermining that. That is why I am making the point that these are not circumstances where there is prima facie evidence of wrongdoing. These allegations are seriously contested by those against whom they are made. The judge who has examined this for us, Mr. Justice O'Neill, has spoken to all the main players involved and examined the protected disclosures, which nobody else in this House has had the opportunity to see because they are protected. He has said that the way to deal with this is to have a full commission of inquiry. The Commissioner and indeed the other parties have made clear that they will co-operate fully. We should await the outcome of the commission of inquiry.

I had expected it would be published in this session but it appears that will not be the case. Problem gambling is leading to the break-up of relationships, mounting debts and the loss of family homes in many cases. The nature of gambling has changed. All anyone has to do now is get on the phone to bet on whatever, wherever. Young people in particular are extremely vulnerable because of the lack of protection. The current legislation is archaic. When will we see the gambling control Bill published and brought forward in order that we can put in place a proper regulatory framework to protect people from addictive gambling?

This is a priority area for him. He recently met stakeholders to examine what action can be taken. We are considering the current programme to see if there are particular areas of pressing concern, intended to be dealt with in the gambling control Bill, which could be dealt with sooner in 2017 by separate legislative measures. I will ask the Minister of State to liaise with the Deputy and let him know the particular issues he is examining because they are quite serious and he believes there is a range of initiatives which can be taken forward before the gambling control Bill is ready.

It is clear that contrary to the assurances by Theresa May to An Taoiseach, the future of the Good Friday Agreement is not in fact sacrosanct. The Brexiteers from the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP, all supported the Conservatives in voting against protection for the Good Friday Agreement. Two weeks ago, my leader, Deputy Adams, warned that the agreement would be destroyed if the North is dragged out of the European Union-----

The Minister of State has been considering some elements of the Bill. I am not in a position to say precisely whether changes will be introduced. Several points have been made about some elements of the Bill which it was felt would be unduly punitive, particularly for small enterprises. She is examining that. I agree that, given the principles behind the Bill and the general approach it is taking, it is important that we see it on the Statute Book as soon as possible.

Such a review is necessary because outside interests like vulture funds are putting pressure on family farms by buying land in local areas at prices that local people cannot afford. It was announced last week that a vulture fund from Helsinki is buying up land in this country worth €110 million with the blessing of the European Investment Bank. Will the Government undertake this review in the interests of helping and saving family farms, or is it going to allow the land of Ireland to be up for sale, just as it has done with buildings and properties around the country?

Young farmers who have applied to start green certificate courses at the Teagasc training centre in my home town of Ballymote later this year have been told that those courses have been cancelled and that there will be no such courses in 2018. I understand that nationally, there are 600 young farmers waiting to do these courses. At a time when the Brexit juggernaut is thundering down the road towards us, we need to bear in mind that agriculture is one of the industries that will be most affected by Brexit. It has never been more important to train young farmers to try to keep alive an industry that employs over 200,000 people in this country.

The Tánaiste is aware that almost nobody wants to see the return of any kind of hard border in the future, but this is what Britain is opting for, in effect.

I am already persuaded from discussion which I have had and commentary I have listened to that there may be some improvements that can be made to put beyond doubt that certain matters will come within the remit of the proposed commission. I intend to reflect on what is said today and make any amendments to the proposed draft order in the light of those discussions. There is a particular procedure that Deputies will be aware of when an order must be made before the House with regard to a commission of investigation. There is Cabinet approval and so on. I must emphasise, as Mr. Justice O'Neill indicated, that it is imperative that certain allegations be examined. We should stick as closely as possible to the terms of reference he proposed, not least because otherwise, we could delay finding out the truth about these important matters. Mr. Justice O'Neill does not know if the allegations he says should be inquired into are true; I do not know if they are true and nor does any Member of this House. We have to remember that the truth or otherwise of allegations is not determined by their seriousness or their frequency but by the facts. Establishing those facts, without fear or favour, is what I and the Government are determined should happen. I am very grateful that Mr. Justice Charleton of the Supreme Court has agreed to act as the commission with all its powers. It is of the utmost importance that allegations of wrongdoing by members of An Garda Síochána are fully addressed and there is no doubt that in the past this did not happen as it should have. It is very important that in addressing one injustice we do not create others. Just as failing to address allegations of wrongdoing or victimising those who have the courage to come forward and identify wrongdoing is unacceptable, so too is damaging, without evidence or fairness, the good names of people. I remind the House that we have seen in the recent past commissions of investigation establishing that people who have made allegations have been found to be correct in the face of denials and obstruction, while on the other hand, persons investigated had behaved completely properly. They had to live for a long time under the shadow of allegations that were found not to be well based and, in some cases, their careers were ruined with great personal cost. That is the reality behind charges that can be made in this House. We have a solemn duty to act with scrupulous fairness and in the public interest when allegations of wrongdoing are made. That is why when I received disclosures from two members of An Garda Síochána last October I asked Mr. Justice O'Neill to review the allegations and recommend what further action may be taken. I stated this in the House and his full report will of course be made available to the commission of investigation. I have set out in the statement of reasons before the House the conclusions and recommendations contained in his report and Mr. Justice O'Neill's recommended terms of reference. The priority, as I stated, must be to give full effect to his recommendations. I recognise, of course, that other Members of this House may have views about what should be included in those terms of reference and I will listen to those views this afternoon. As I did earlier, I want to address directly suggestions that the Garda Commissioner should stand aside. It is easy to come into this House to make allegations - even where they are described as not being allegations - against someone who is not here to defend himself or herself. I must speak out in favour of fairness. Some people appear to believe that the making of serious allegations against someone, which have not been tested in any way, is a sufficient basis on which to expect someone to step aside. Allegations are not convictions. There has been no finding of wrongdoing against the Garda Commissioner and I believe in those circumstances she is entitled to our full confidence. It is a matter of fact too that Mr. Justice O'Neill did not recommend that she or anyone else should stand aside. Just as it would be outrageous for some sort of smear campaign to have taken place against whistleblowers, it would be completely wrong for anyone else to be targeted in such a fashion. Whereas allegations of wrongdoing must be taken very seriously, the need to protect the public is of great importance too. As everybody has said, An Garda Síochána plays a vital role in that regard. The Garda has been confronting many challenges head on, not least in tackling the activities of gangland criminals. We should all be mindful of the dangers of disrupting the leadership of that organisation at a time of great risk to communities and for no established cause. Actions have consequences and it is fanciful to imagine that a temporary Garda Commissioner could be in the interests of An Garda Síochána and, consequently, the community. In short, asking the Garda Commissioner to stand aside in the particular circumstances that have arisen would be neither fair nor in the public interest. I am conscious that in recent years An Garda Síochána has been hit by a series of controversies. It was against that background that I moved to introduce a range of significant reforms, including the establishment of the Policing Authority. I received cross-party support for that. I indicated, in speaking in the House recently on the justice committee report on governance and accountability, that I will introduce legislation to enhance the powers of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC. I met Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring some weeks ago and agreed that we should do a ten-year review of the GSOC legislation and strengthen its powers. GSOC is also setting up a protected disclosures unit to deal with protected disclosures. We must ensure the various mechanisms that we set up for oversight of An Garda Síochána have all the relevant powers and that they work. It is in the interests of everybody, including whistleblowers and members of An Garda Síochána and other organisations, that they all have the very best mechanisms for whistleblowers to make their case and that such mechanisms work. We often talk of drawing a line under bad episodes in the work of An Garda Síochána. I do not accept that and it is not about drawing lines under anything. Instead, it is about rooting out bad practices and I am committed to that. It is about putting in place strong, durable and sustainable policies and procedures to prevent a recurrence. We have taken initiatives here, as has the justice committee, and we have made various changes in legislation in recent years. That is the path we are on. Nevertheless, we have received very serious protected disclosures and I responded to them immediately. I asked Mr. Justice O'Neill, a very distinguished judge, to examine them and he has reverted with terms of reference that I have accepted. I have said I will listen to the debate this afternoon and I am open to amending the terms of reference. I must go to Cabinet in that regard. Reform must be the watch word of An Garda Síochána as reform never stops.In the meantime we have to deal with the issues that arise, not by making political charge or counter-charge in the House or by pretending to act as a commission of investigation - the House is not such a body - but by putting procedures in place to ensure allegations are fully and fairly investigated. This is exactly what I am doing by stating before the House that the Government has agreed to a commission of investigation and by asking the House to support the development and work of that investigation to ensure the work can be done in a timely way with appropriate terms of reference. I look forward to hearing what colleagues have to say about the proposed terms of reference. I will take serious note of the points made by colleagues today.

I have never seen the content of those protected disclosures but I know from what is in the public domain that in general they allege that a campaign was launched at senior levels in An Garda Síochána to discredit a whistleblower. When Mr. Justice O'Neill was nominated by the Government to investigate the matter in October of last year, we supported his nomination. We hoped his investigation would produce a conclusive report. We have not had an opportunity to see the complete report of Mr. Justice O'Neill. In fact, all we have seen is what is in the public domain, that is to say, the conclusions and recommendations and the terms of reference he proposed. We are told that the reason the remainder of the report is being redacted is because it affects the rights of other individuals. I take the Government at its word when it says as much. I assume there is nothing in the remaining part of Mr. Justice O'Neill's report - a report that has been seen by no one here - that suggests wrongdoing or makes negative comments about any of the principal actors involved in the issue. The issue in the past 48 hours has become focused on the personalities and individuals involved. In one corner we have the superintendent and the sergeant. In the other corner we have the Commissioner and the former Commissioner. Members are perfectly entitled to affiliate themselves with either corner and to advocate on behalf of either corner. However, I will not be doing that. I believe the most important thing is to stand in the middle and try to establish the truth. The only way the truth can be established, unfortunately, is through the establishment of a commission of investigation. Mr. Justice O'Neill tried to establish the truth and was unable to do so. A commission of investigation has now been recommended by Mr. Justice O'Neill. It is imperative for the House to agree to this and to establish such a commission of investigation promptly. The main issue is a net issue. Is it true that there was a campaign seeking to discredit the sergeant at senior levels of An Garda Síochána? Was that encouraged and promoted by the current Commissioner or the former Commissioner? If there is a finding to that effect against any senior member of An Garda Síochána, the position of that senior member would be untenable. I note the repeated calls for the Garda Commissioner to stand aside. We have not joined those calls. Other Members are perfectly entitled to make those calls. We believe that such a call should only be as a consequence of what was in a commission of investigation report. We believe the commission of investigation should be established first and that the truth should be established. After that, let individuals call for whatever consequence they believe to be appropriate. When allegations are made against an individual and the individual in question denies those allegations, that individual has an entitlement to the constitutional right to his good name. We do not hear much about that right, but it is a right that has meaning. It is not an anachronistic right. This means that an individual who denies allegations is entitled to defend himself against those allegations. Let us suppose I stand up in the House and make an allegation against a Member and it turns out that the Member denies those allegations. I believe it would be most unfair if, as a result of my making those allegations, the Member would be forced to stand aside. It would also have a more detrimental consequence in terms of the establishment of commissions of investigation. If it were the case that once a commission of investigation is established, the subject of that investigation were compelled to stand aside, then we would never have commissions of investigation because the mere establishment would have a significant consequential effect. I wish to highlight a point relating to the superintendent who made the protected disclosure. He has a grievance. His grievance is legitimate in that an allegation was made against him that was altogether separate from the issues we are discussing. He denied those allegations. He should not have been suspended from his post in An Garda Síochána. He was entitled to his good name and to defend himself. I want to get on to the subject matter of the terms of reference of the inquiry. I wish to advocate for two changes that the Minister and the Government should adopt. The first arises in the context of paragraph 1[b] of the terms of reference. The paragraph states: "The allegation of Superintendent Taylor in his Protected Disclosure, that he was directed to draw journalists’ attention to an allegation of criminal misconduct made against Sgt McCabe and that this was the root cause of his agenda, namely revenge against the Gardaí." We support the investigation of that particular issue. However, we believe it is not broad enough. The allegation that the sergeant was involved in criminal misconduct should be investigated in its generality. Under paragraph 1[b], an allegation can only be investigated if it is the subject matter of a communication by the superintendent to members of the media. We believe it should be broader. We are suggesting to the Government that at the end of paragraph 1[b], the following should be added: “Also, to investigate what knowledge former Commissioner Callinan and/or Commissioner O’Sullivan had concerning this allegation of criminal misconduct made against Sergeant McCabe and whether they acted upon same in a manner intended to discredit Sergeant McCabe." We maintain this is necessary because if it is the case that this allegation of criminal misconduct by the sergeant was being used by An Garda Síochána to discredit him, then the matter must be investigated. Unfortunately, the terms in paragraph 1[b], as drafted, simply limit it to communications between Superintendent Taylor and members of the media. It may be the case that members of An Garda Síochána at senior level used the allegation of criminal wrongdoing on the part of the sergeant to discredit him elsewhere. The inclusion of that paragraph will include coverage for the point raised by Deputy McDonald earlier in her questions today. She asked whether there was any other communication between An Garda Síochána and any other State agencies. That would be covered by the amendment. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. The second amendment I am proposing relates to paragraph 1[h]. It refers to the meeting that took place between the former Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, and Deputy John McGuinness. This is in the public domain and is being investigated because Deputy McGuinness openly referred to it on the floor of the House. Let us suppose it is the case that the former Commissioner was prepared to contact Deputy McGuinness to communicate what Deputy McGuinness alleges was said. Then there is also a strong possibility that the former Commissioner would have contacted members of the Government. For that reason, we believe paragraph 1[d] should be amended such that after the words “broadcasting personnel” the Minister should include “and/or members of the government”. If that text is included, it would cover this issue of concern. Presumably, the reason the former Commissioner contacted Deputy McGuinness was because of the position of Deputy McGuinness as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. Similarly, there must be a concern that if the people in question were prepared to contact a member or the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, then they may also have sought to contact members of the Government. It is important to establish confidence in An Garda Síochána in the public mind. The force plays too important a role in the country for there to be any question mark over senior figures in An Garda Síochána. The commission of investigation is merited and that it will be in the public interest to find out, once and for all, where the truth lies. I am not an investigator. No one else in the House is an investigator. However, what we can do is establish investigations to help us to find the truth. Let us find the truth and let the consequences fall wherever they may. Mr. Justice O'Neill's inquiry was established in October.Not only did Fianna Fáil welcome it, we said that it should be extended to include complaints made by other whistleblowers, namely, Garda Harrison and Garda Keogh. Prior to receiving the documentation we got from the Tánaiste yesterday, I was intending to say that the complaints of both officers must be included in the terms of reference of the commission of investigation we are about to establish. However, I am aware, from the Government's statement yesterday, that Mr. Justice O'Neill stated in his report that the commission of investigation should deal solely with the issues concerning the Garda Commissioner and the former Commissioner. I am prepared to abide by that, in the context of its importance and relevance. However, I would argue that we need to establish a proper forum at which the complaints of Garda Harrison and Garda Keogh can be properly, adequately and thoroughly investigated.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	253	Sinn Féin welcomes the terms of reference which have been published. Like the previous speaker, we have also suggested an amendment to those terms. I will read out our amendment, which is based on the same reasoning as that behind Fianna Fáil's proposed amendments. Our amendment would have sought to insert a new section [j], which states, "To investigate contacts between members of An Garda Síochána and members of the Government, members of the Oireachtas and other State agencies relevant to the matters set out in [a] and [b] above." Again, we submitted that amendment for pretty much the same reasons as Deputy O'Callaghan has outlined with regard to his proposed amendments. It is fair to say that if the former Garda Commissioner was willing to contact one Member of this Oireachtas, then there is a possibility that other Members were contacted, including members of the then Government. If that is the case, the matter should come under the terms of reference of the commission of investigation. We also believe that it would be appropriate for the commission of investigation's terms of reference to include the question of whether members of An Garda Síochána at senior level initiated any contact with other agencies apart from the agency referred to by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality this morning, namely GSOC. We would encourage the Minister to make such a change to the terms of reference.  It has been a long road to get to where we are today. We have had many controversies involving senior management within An Garda Síochána. We had the penalty points debacle, the Cooke report, the Guerin report, the Fennelly commission and the report from Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill. On foot of the latter report into the allegations made by Superintendent David Taylor, we received two items of correspondence from the Department of Justice and Equality yesterday. The rationale for the commission of investigation was outlined in one item of correspondence. It reads as follows:Mr Justice O’Neill examined the allegations, put them to those against whom they were made and sought the latter’s responses. He also sought the observations of the persons making the disclosures and those against whom the allegations were made on a number of matters, including the form that any investigation into these matters should take.In light of his inquiries, Mr Justice O’Neill concluded, while he was not in a position to make any determination on the truth or falsity of the allegations, that a Commission of Investigation under the 2004 Act should be established to investigate these and other relevant matters.Mr. Justice O'Neill then went on to suggest terms of reference for the commission of investigation and we note that the terms of reference published by the Government yesterday are the exact terms suggested by him. I am glad the Tánaiste is willing to look at the possibility of adding to those terms of reference. She has already heard suggestions from Fianna Fáil - she is hearing them now from my party - on how the terms of reference should be expanded to give the commission of investigation every possible opportunity to investigate all of the allegations fully. As the Tánaiste stated, allegations are not convictions. However, we do not want to find ourselves in a situation where, at the end of commission of investigation process, there are unanswered questions. We have seen that happen with previous commissions of investigation. It is important that the concerns highlighted by me and Deputy O'Callaghan are taken on board and I encourage the Tánaiste to do so. Sinn Féin is one of the parties asking that the Garda Commissioner step aside while this commission of investigation undertakes its work. That is not to cast any aspersions on the Commissioner. We believe that it is in the interests of transparency and public confidence that the Commissioner would take the decision to step aside. The allegations that are being investigated are truly shocking, particularly the reference to the accusation that Superintendent David Taylor was directed to draw journalists' attention to an allegation of criminal misconduct made against Sergeant McCabe and that this was the root of his motivation for whistleblowing. In light of the fact that the allegations are made directly against the Commissioner and given that there is an issue with public confidence in the force at senior level - not just as a result of Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill's scoping exercise but also on foot of all the previous reports and commissions of investigation - it is important that the Commissioner step aside. Again, I take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner to make that move. As I said, that is not to say that there is any truth in the allegations that have been made against her but it is important to allow the commission of investigation to do its work. Serious allegations have been made against the most senior member of the force and for that member to continue in situ while she is being investigated would send out the wrong signals. That is why we have asked her to step aside. I urge the Minister to take on board the recommendation that Sinn Féin has submitted through our amendment. It is important to give the commission of investigation every possible opportunity to investigate all of these matters fully. I would encourage the Minister to take our amendment on board.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	254	I have sent to the Tánaiste a proposed amendment to the published terms of reference. I hope it will be accepted as I believe it covers concerns that Deputy O'Callaghan and I have raised in public discourse since the draft terms were circulated. Specifically, I do not believe it is sufficient to establish whether allegations of criminal misconduct against Sergeant McCabe were circulated to the media. We must also seek to establish whether such allegations were known to be false, if they were circulated. This may appear to be a technical point but it is one that I hope the Tánaiste will take on board. I have served in this House for some time and it has been my privilege to do so. I served on both Government and Opposition benches. I also served as Leas-Cheann Comhairle and worked to uphold the rules and norms of this House. I know, perhaps better than many, the responsibility that comes with membership of this House. I do not wear that privilege lightly and nor have I ever sought to abuse it. The contribution I made in this House yesterday was not about party politics. I did not say anything that sought to undermine another Deputy, nor did I apportion responsibility for the matters at hand to any political party or individual.I could point to examples where serving Members of this House have used parliamentary privilege to do exactly that. What I did yesterday was not in that vein. The only place in which we as Members of this House have absolute privilege in what we say is this Chamber, so we should speak in this place with respect for the responsibility that this brings. Yesterday morning, I received information that I believed to be of significant public importance. The word "hearsay" has since been bandied about aplenty, but this was not idle chat or pub gossip. I received information which I believe to be credible and which is absolutely germane to a matter about which the Government, in its own careful deliberation, has determined to establish a commission of investigation, thereby acknowledging the significance and importance of these matters. I spoke frankly in this Chamber yesterday, and I repeated the information that had been disclosed to me. I will make myself available to Mr. Justice Charleton to do so again if he feels that I can be of any assistance in his work. I can also inform the House that my source for the information I put on the record yesterday has given consent for their name to be provided also to Mr. Justice Charleton, and has made clear to me their willingness to provide Mr. Justice Charleton with all of the information at their disposal. More insidious than the allegation that I was involved in circulating gossip was the notion, tabled by Deputy O’Callaghan and others, that what I said was damaging to Sergeant Maurice McCabe. I have spoken to Maurice McCabe today. He confirmed to me that he is of course aware, in specific detail, of all the allegations made against him. He has been aware of them, and he and his family have tried to live with them, for a number of years. I am glad to be able to inform the House that he has expressed gratitude for my intervention yesterday, and in no way regards it as having been damaging in any way to him. The nature of the allegations, as one journalist made clear on radio this morning, have not been a secret. Deputy John McGuinness has previously referred to them as "vile" allegations, but today he thinks I am wrong to have spoken openly about them. The allegations have been circulated around the media, around political circles and around Sergeant McCabe’s colleagues for some time. The role of the media, as we are so often told, is to speak truth to power. It has been alleged that the media allowed themselves to be used by those with power to denigrate those without. This will be a matter for the commission to determine. If the commission of investigation makes such a finding, I hope it will give the media cause to reflect upon their own actions as much as they have on mine. I said yesterday that I cannot think of another walk of life where, if allegations of this nature had been made against a person in a position of power, he or she would not be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of a full investigation. Today we debate the establishment of a commission of investigation. We are told that it may take nine months to report and the media narrative has taken hold that a Garda Commissioner could not step aside for that length of time. This point was also made today by the Tánaiste herself. I believe that view is wrong. Prior to her appointment on a permanent basis, Commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan served as acting Commissioner for eight months. The idea, therefore, that someone else could act into her role for nine months is not all that far-fetched. The Garda Commissioner heads a policing service charged with protecting the security of the State, preventing crime and vindicating the human rights of each individual. Yet, at the same time and while still discharging these important, constitutional and onerous responsibilities, Commissioner O’Sullivan now faces a statutory investigation. In the course of this inquiry, the Commissioner’s mobile phones and her phone records for a two-year period are to be examined, as are all Garda electronic and paper files, to see if she or the former Commissioner are implicated in any way in this affair. Nóirín O’Sullivan as Garda Commissioner is the custodian of the very records that Mr. Justice Charleton will examine to see if they disclose wrongdoing by, among others, the Commissioner herself. I believe, honestly and objectively, that this places her in an untenable position. I reiterate that I have long experience in pursuing truth, particularly in the justice sector. My experience in helping whistleblowers in this sector dates back as far as the establishment of the Morris tribunal, and I repeat that I do not lightly raise issues of the significance that I raised yesterday. We must not forget that at the centre of this commission of inquiry are two protected disclosures and questions around what the former and current Commissioners of An Garda Síochána knew and did. The truth of all of these matters, as others have said, will be determined by an independent commission of investigation. In the interim, all Members of the Oireachtas, both Government and Opposition, have responsibility to ensure the integrity of An Garda Síochána is protected in all our interests. It remains my view that the reputation of the An Garda Síochána would best be protected if the current Garda Commissioner stood aside until the finalisation of the work of the commission of inquiry. As others have said, the allegations that Commissioner O’Sullivan faces are grave. She steadfastly rejects them, as she is perfectly entitled to do. She may be proven innocent of any wrongdoing, but the opposite is also possible. While Superintendent Taylor stands under investigation, he is suspended from duty, a point well made by Deputy O'Callaghan in his contribution. I believe it is reasonable to apply the same standard to the Garda Commissioner.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	255	There has been much focus on the rights of the Commissioner and why she should not have to step aside while this investigation takes place. Due process and in the interests of justice were terms used by the Minister earlier today. The reason for the decision to not ask the Commissioner to stand aside is that it would open up the whole appalling vista of the second Garda Commissioner in a row being put in the dock, effectively, for corruption. Clearly, corruption goes right to the top in An Garda Síochána. I would have thought that the Garda Commissioner remaining in her place would have a potential chilling effect on others who might want to testify to the commission of investigation. I do not believe this is just about seeking another head to roll. A head was rolled already with the previous Garda Commissioner. Nor is it about putting a shiny new head onto a diseased body, because there is definitely something rotten in the state of the Garda. As long as we have a Garda force that primarily and ultimately defends the status quo and the establishment, it will never be truly democratic and accountable. The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, was set up in the recent years supposedly to tackle these issues. GSOC testified to the Committee on Justice and Equality last summer that it was taking 14 months on average to pursue any investigation against individual gardaí because of stalling by various members of An Garda Síochána. GSOC has said that it happens not infrequently. It happens quite frequently. What are GSOC's powers? Its findings can be rejected and the sanctions it recommends can be overturned and overruled. One of the key aspects exposed in the terms of reference for the commission of investigation is the role of the media and the very close links and connections the media have with the Garda.Essentially, what we are seeing is the media, as a propaganda arm of the Garda, having a role in manufacturing consent in society. One of the terms of reference relates to the allegation that the Commissioner might have orchestrated the leaking to RTE of information before the publication of the O'Higgins report to downgrade the reputation of Sergeant McCabe. There are crime journalists virtually embedded in An Garda Síochána. They live off leaks and try to call their work journalism. Crime journalists such as Paul Reynolds and Paul Williams just spend their day reporting exactly what is passed over to them by the Garda. Let us not forget the media's faithful reporting during the anti-water-charges campaign, for example. It was reported that there were bomb threats against a Minister and that a bullet was sent to a Minister of State in the post. This proved to be utterly fake news concerning an individual who had mental health issues, and it had nothing to do with the water charges issue. There was a claim that 300 gardaí had been assaulted during anti-water-charges protests when, in fact, the figure covered incidents for an entire year and had nothing to do with those protests. The media coverage of the protest in Jobstown is another case in point. The Taoiseach used the word "kidnap" in respect of the events and the media subsequently started to use that term. The charge against protesters then turned out to be one of false imprisonment rather than a breach of public order. It was a much more serious charge. The Garda has been used to protect and defend the status quo in the interest of the 1%, as the Occupy movement calls those concerned. This is evidenced particularly at times in history when consciousness is awoken and when struggle takes place. It was very evident during the Shell to Sea campaign, and there was a concerted campaign in this regard against the anti-water charges movement. The anti-water charges movement was one of the biggest social and protest movements in this country in a generation. There are currently protests within the Garda itself. Threats are being issued by the Government and the hierarchy of the Garda against gardaí who are seeking a right to organise, strike and gain access to the Labour Court and State machinery to advance their claims regarding work conditions and pay. They have won in the case in question. It says it all that gardaí are legally barred from striking. Surely it would increase accountability if gardaí began to use the State machinery and began to see themselves more as part of the workforce and the community. There is a concerted campaign to ensure they do not. It is a little ironic, therefore, if individual Commissioners are being defended while threatening gardaí about their right to strike. It is essential that this matter be fully investigated. Obviously, the Commissioner has to step aside. That would be the norm. It seems the Minister is more interested in how it would look for An Garda Síochána to have a Commissioner step aside than in fully and properly investigating these events. A person can be investigated without any guilt attaching to them. That is the norm and it would be made clear at every turn. One is innocent until proven guilty. The Commissioner stepping aside could not be taken to indicate otherwise. The issue of the commission of investigation has drawn attention to an especially dangerous and incestuous relationship between the media and considerable elements within the Garda. It is very dangerous for the rest of society and can have significant repercussions. Ultimately, what we need is a police force that is democratic and accountable. GSOC is clearly not enough. In communities, there should be committees of people which interact with the Garda, comment and have an influence on the location of resources and on how the Garda interacts with the community, local workforce, etc. That is very far from being the case here.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	265	We proposed three amendments to the terms of reference. One of them, which was similar to that proposed by Deputy O'Callaghan of Fianna Fáil, concerned investigating information that might have come within the Minister's remit. The second concerned the need to include the other whistleblowers. Central to what this commission of investigation is about is ascertaining how the former and present Commissioners treated whistleblowers. That is at the core of it. Restricting the period the commission is to investigate to that period up to the end of May 2014, the month in which the present Commissioner took charge, will not result in the full story. It just does not stack up. What has gone on since the current Commissioner took office is so similar to what occurred before May 2014. When the Commissioner and Minister were changed in 2014, there was so much talk about things being done differently. That did not happen. The current Commissioner, who sat at the right hand of the former Commissioner when he called whistleblowers "disgusting", has behaved just like he did in respect of the whistleblowers. It was May 2014 when Nick Keogh made his first allegation. In that year alone, he faced five internal investigations. There was not one before that but five at that time. As soon as Keith Harrison put his head above the parapet, he got barraged from all angles by the hierarchy of the force, which had not changed its spots. When the Minister appointed Commissioner O'Sullivan to the job, did she honestly believe she would get something different from what existed beforehand? Did she honestly believe this would bring about culture change? It did not have a prayer. It was more of the same. It does not stack up that the Minister will not include the period to which I am referring. The Commissioner said on RTE radio a couple of weeks ago, "I have absolutely no knowledge nor was I privy to any campaign to undermine any individual in An Garda Síochána." The Minister can say until the cows come home that the Commissioner is innocent until proven guilty, but I can tell the Minister that I know for a fact that the statement is not true, and the Commissioner knows it is not true. I would be very surprised if the Minister did not know it also. I am convinced she does. It is stated Mr. Justice O'Neill has considered in his report the cases of the other whistleblowers. Mr. Justice O'Neill does not see a reason to include the confidential reports. Will the Minister tell me how much information Mr. Justice O'Neill got to make that decision? What was he given? What did the Minister give him? What did anybody give him? Did he get the protected disclosures? I would like to know the basis of his decision.Maybe the Tánaiste will tell me that she has just told me that. When Keith Harrison's solicitor contacted the Tánaiste last October and asked to be included in the process, she made no secret of the fact that they would not be part of it. That was in October 2016. For Mr. Justice O'Neill to tell us now that he sees good reason why they should not be part of it, that is hardly rocket science. I do not have enough time to go into the other issues. Sadly the O'Higgins report and how she dealt with that and how she was prepared to send counsel in to give false evidence in order to damage Sergeant McCabe should have seen the end of her last summer. However, the Government decided to support her and keep her standing with the support of Fianna Fáil. It was disingenuous of them to do so and the Tánaiste knows it.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	266	These are very serious allegations of an orchestrated and co-ordinated campaign to malign and undermine the reputation of Maurice McCabe to deter people from listening to his legitimate complaints of wrongdoing in An Garda Síochána. They used the vilest allegations to do so. These claims are being levelled against the former Commissioner and the present Commissioner. The Tánaiste has been at pains to say, "Well, there weren't any findings. They're only allegations. They're not convictions." That is true up to a point. However, Mr. Justice O'Neill looked at the evidence, such as it was, and decided that even within that limited information there was enough to establish a commission of investigation. That is not something that happens lightly or happens every other day of the week. His reason for doing so was that the allegations in the two protected disclosures are not isolated allegations. They come on top of the allegations made by John Barrett, the civilian head of human resources in the Garda Síochána, and the evidence that emerged in the course of the O'Higgins inquiry where counsel for the Commissioner stated that he was ordered to impugn the reputation of Maurice McCabe and to say that he acted with malice, and not just that but that there were two officers there who would verify that he admitted that was his motivation. Either Nóirín O'Sullivan was privy to that or not. If she did not know about it, why did she not do something about it once she became aware of that fact? For those reasons alone, the Commissioner's position has been untenable for an incredibly long time. It is particularly the case now, given that she is at the helm of an organisation that will control the evidence Mr. Justice Charleton will require to conduct his investigations. In all cases of natural justice in any employment I have been in, if a person is accused of gross misconduct they stand aside pending the inquiry. That is the way it is. It is the way it has been for Dave Taylor and for every ordinary rank-and-file garda; it is doubly important in the case of the Commissioner. That is why one of the amendments we had proposed, had the terms of reference been before us, was precisely to deal with the issue that the Commissioner should step aside. Our second amendment was a more restricted version of the amendment Deputy O'Callaghan tabled in which we wanted to see included the extent to which the Tánaiste had been briefed by the Garda about allegations of criminal misconduct against Maurice McCabe supposedly forming the basis of his malicious motivation. We are happy to go along with the Fianna Fáil proposal to expand that to include all Members of the Oireachtas. The most important thing that must be included under these terms and conditions of inquiry is the broadening out to include the allegations of the other whistleblowers. Our amendment stated that the protected disclosures of all gardaí who made such disclosures about bullying, harassment and such treatment, and who wanted to be included, would be included. At the heart of this necessity is that there is an unbroken thread here, precisely the point made by Deputy Wallace, that the smear campaign and tactics unleashed against Maurice McCabe have been experienced by other Garda whistleblowers. The difference between them and Maurice McCabe is that their allegations emerged and their treatment happened solely under the watch of Nóirín O'Sullivan. I have no doubt that the present Commissioner will attempt to distance herself from the allegations and claim it was the responsibility of the former Commissioner and that she was only the girl who made the tea. We need to look at what happened to whistleblowers under her watch. I am really upset about the point being made and am particularly upset that Fianna Fáil Members have latched on to it because I do not believe they realise the significance of this. Mr. Justice O'Neill has said that he considered the other allegations and that on the basis of that he did not think that they should be included. Deputy O'Callaghan said he thought they should be included until he heard that. Mr. Justice O'Neill did not get any information from those two whistleblowers or their legal counsel. I believe he could only have got that information from the Tánaiste, or else I do not know where he got it from; but he did not get it from them. It is really important that they be included. I welcome some of the other terms of reference. I am delighted to see RTE included, because I actually made a complaint about that broadcast. RTE wrote back to me and gave out about the personal nature of my complaints and their hostile tone. It claimed they were without foundation and would be defamatory if I repeated them to a third party.

He will be called on to defend the Government when some other party is in power. That is why I previously told the Tánaiste that I support the Minister, Deputy Ross's, battle over the register of interests. We are lucky to have judges to do this, but we should have full clarification with nothing hidden about involvement in anything else either. As regards An Garda Síochána, I have been involved in Community Alert since 1986 and have supported the Garda all my life. We must never forget there is a very thin line between them and their duties and the public. No police force can survive without the support of the public. The vast majority of members of An Garda Síochána do that night and day, often in very precarious situations. They often risk life and limb. All too often sadly their lives have been taken and sucked away from their family. As the Tánaiste said in her speech:We have to remember that the truth or otherwise of allegations is not determined by their seriousness or their frequency but by the facts. Establishing those facts, without fear or favour, is what I and the Government are determined should happen. [The Tánaiste expressed her gratitude to Mr. Justice Charleton] ... It is of the utmost importance that allegations of wrongdoing by members of An Garda Síochána are fully addressed and there is no doubt that in the past this did not happen as it should have. It is very important that in addressing one injustice we do not create others. In that vein - tá sé imithe - I was alarmed at the intervention of the former Minister and high priest yesterday, Deputy Howlin. He has experience, including as a former Leas-Cheann Comhairle. He showed arrogance in the past five years and was untouchable. In the last Government he was one of the magic four who ignored the rest of the Cabinet, including probably the present Tánaiste. He certainly ignored us. I questioned him about his role, his party's role and his family's role in the banishment of local democracy. Who was at the head of the Association of Irish Local Government, AMAI? It was someone very close to him. When I served a summons on the former Minister, big Phil the enforcer, in the restaurant here, he laughed at me. It was the first time it ever happened that I was forced to go to the High Court with FLAME, an organisation representing former councillors. We wrote to the AMAI-----

He spoke enough yesterday morning. I think it was outrageous. We had a situation recently with a journalist asking someone to ask questions. I heard him this morning. It was a case of dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi mar a dúirt tusa, a Cheann Comhairle. It was a case of dúirt bean, fear agus buachaill óg freisin. There was no buachaill or man anywhere to be found. He was backtracking big time. The full story in Tipperary is dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi go raibh fear i dTiobraid Árann a bhfuil póca ina léine aige.A woman told me that a woman told her that there is a man in Tipperary with a pocket in his shirt. That saying is 50 years old and I would have loved to hear the Tánaiste quoting it yesterday. It is a lovely old adage. In terms of Leaders' Questions, it was very serious to rush this in. There are only seven Members here now but in terms of polls, Deputy Howlin needed some kind of an outburst. He has serious questions to answer regarding what happened with the AMAI and the management of local democracy. Those questions have been put to him, but he has point blank refused to answer them. He needs to look into that. What happened to the funds given by local authorities to the AMAI? Where did they go? I am not alleging the Deputy has anything to do with that, but where is the money trail?

It is about how important Deputy Howlin felt the subject matter was and how he could not wait for today. This was scheduled for today by the Business Committee and he knew that from his own representative. Is mór an trua that he did not have the patience to wait for it. I welcome the commission. It is very important that any wrongdoing is addressed. I have met Garda Wilson and Sergeant McCabe and I know David Taylor and his family, who are a decent family from Tipperary. They are entitled to their good names. A good name is all one is entitled to in this country and one must be allowed to retain it. Privilege or no privilege does not give anyone the right to attack or undermine that. The facts must always be to the fore. An Garda Síochána does not need this. We see the highly visible members out there in the fight against crime to save our community in Tipperary. They are making a difference and, with the Tánaiste, the Department and An Garda Síochána, grappling with the serious issue of all sorts of crime, including marauding gangs going around attacking them. The first person in all of this is the garda so we need to have the matter cleared up. If the Commissioner is found to have acted wrongly, she will have to pay the price, but I do not like to see two Commissioners being forced out of office. It does not send a good message to the House, the public or to those looking in at us from abroad. While I know the Minister looked abroad in the appointment of the previous Commissioner, it might be best on a future occasion to insist that someone from abroad is appointed to take over. In fairness to the superintendents, inspectors and ordinary gardaí I deal with, including Chief Superintendent Catherine Kehoe in Tipperary and her teams, they do a tremendous job. I have had issues with what went on in a different jurisdiction in Dungarvan this week. I also have issues where I myself was blackguarded and only five of 13 statements were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, while seven were never sent. There were no questions or answers. This only happened in the middle of my own trial. We cannot have that carry on. There must be total transparency. I supported the Minister's bail initiative here last night and said that I was very concerned about legal aid. For the public to continue to support An Garda Síochána, this must be cleared up. I hope the judge will get to the end of it. It has been dragging on. If there is wrongdoing, it must be rooted out. Above all other organisations across the State, An Garda Síochána is the one we depend on every night when we are in our beds and its members are minding the house. Reference was made earlier to the fact that gardaí threatened to go on strike. It had never happened in the history of the State. As such, I am glad the Tánaiste and gardaí were able to come to accommodation and avoid that because people were frightened. People watching this today and hearing the attacks know they depend on their local gardaí. One cannot beat the garda on the beat, the local man or woman. He or she has to be supported. We must get to the bottom of this. I hope it will not be a long process and that the eminent judge will get all the information without any difficulty or blockage, including the phone and e-mail information alleged to have been there. I hope none of that will be missing. We have to have that to have confidence. I support the commission of investigation. I have read the terms of reference which could probably be a bit different. No matter what terms of reference one comes up with, however, someone will challenge them. As I said, we must have faith in An Garda Síochána and the confidence they are out there to serve us, including even the lads outside the gates of Leinster House. My colleague, Deputy Michael Collins, lost his telephone last night and will be forever grateful to An Garda Síochána. He just said it to the gardaí outside and they acted swiftly, above and beyond the call of duty, and Deputy Collins and his phone were reunited this morning. We all know how much information is on our smartphones. There are thousands of simple incidents like that day and night which are dealt with by gardaí in the countryside and urban areas. They also work abroad on service with the United Nations and Interpol and they are tackling the huge issue of gun crime in this city. We do not need any distractions from that. We need a swift, accurate and in-depth investigation, a concise report and swift action by Government on the recommendations. We must move on from this. Whoever the cap fits must wear it, whether he or she is male or female. It might be a hat or scarf on the female, but she will have to wear it. That is an old saying too. We want to get to the bottom of this. The public and An Garda Síochána deserve no less and, indeed, the whistleblowers and their families are entitled to have their good names cleared. On the other hand, if there is wrongdoing, there must be punishment and retribution. I rest my case there.

My understanding at the meeting of the Business Committee only two or three hours ago was that we would be voting on it. I am glad we are not because it is time to pause for thought. This is not an insignificant issue. It is a very important issue at the intersection of the Legislature, the judicial and policing system and the media. It is important that we get our part in that mix right. I am glad there is a commission of investigation, the creation of which the Green Party will support. The reason things have moved on is that the Tánaiste appears to be willing to accept changes to the terms of reference. I listened with interest to what Deputies Jim O'Callaghan, Jonathan O'Brien, Clare Daly, Brendan Howlin and others said in that regard. It is no harm to pause for thought in terms of how the investigation will work. For that reason more than for any other, I am glad we have a little time to think and reflect on this. What Deputy Jonathan O'Brien said is true. Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment to the effect that there should be early contact with members of Government was broadened by Deputies O'Brien and Howlin to refer to Members of the Oireachtas. That is valid. If Deputy McGuinness was one of the people involved in this, there may have been others. As such, why would we restrict it to Government? I was particularly interested in listening to Deputy Daly's arguments to hear that it should also be extended to include those other incidents of gardaí claiming they too were abused in the process of being identified and targeted as whistleblowers. That is one of the interesting things the Tánaiste might consider in the next few days in the context of how broad this goes. I want to put another twist or consideration on the matter. I was at a very interesting meeting last week on digital surveillance organised by the Goethe-Institut in Dublin and attended by a range of people interested in digital privacy and the surveillance we are subjected to. I do not know all the finest details of the role of a commission of investigation but I am very glad it will be led by a Supreme Court judge. We have respect for our Judiciary here unlike in some other jurisdictions. The question appears to me to be how far this will go in terms of whether we are giving the commission of investigation the ability, as Deputy McGrath has implied, to look at the phone records of Deputies. To answer the questions that have been raised, that level of investigation might be required. There are difficulties around that. We saw, even today, how inadvertently the raising of a certain issue in the public interest can bring a person's name to public notice in a way that is disadvantageous to him or her. As such, we have to be careful about this. This causes me to question some of our legislation around digital surveillance and how we manage such a process. Dr. Dennis Jennings, the former head of computer science at UCD, was at that digital surveillance meeting and presented an idea with which some might disagree but which I consider to have a great deal of merit. He said that in setting up digital systems, as we have with our phones and computers, we must have a clear mechanism to review and oversee the guardians who review the digital material in the first place.We must have a clear and transparent system whereby somebody is looking at the digital data relating to us all. This could affect any citizen as well as any Member of this House. All of those types of data should be loggable, accessible and transparent within safe judicial systems. This might seem an abstract point that is outside the bounds of the debate, but it is very important if we are looking to investigate who contacted who in this case. Members of the media are historically very sensitive about revealing their sources, who spoke to them, when they spoke and the nature of the conversation, and they will be interested to know how such an investigation is carried out. This is not a clear-cut issue. There probably is scope for a longer-term project here, but it is relevant to the matters we are discussing because we are talking about investigating the contacts between people and the only way to do that is to check telephone records, e-mails, computer logs and so on. I noted Deputy Daly's point that there are concerns to address if the Garda has control of that surveillance-type system. Mr. Justice Charleton has a very difficult job to do, no matter what brief we give him, and how he manages it will be an interesting test case in some ways. I hope consideration is given in devising the terms of reference of the inquiry to the mechanisms for investigating the types of data to which I referred. I take the Minister absolutely at her word when she talks about the need for reform of the system. Everybody on both sides of the House recognises that our judicial and policing system is in need of reform. We have seen the issues that arose regarding the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, the subsequent retirement of the former Commissioner, Martin Callinan, and the resignation of the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter. One of my concerns is that we do not have a Secretary General in the Department in the midst of this process.

I was not aware an appointment had been made. We have an important responsibility in how we do our work. The judgment in the Angela Kerins case last week, as I already pointed out in this Chamber, gives us additional powers, and rightly so. However, as the Supreme Court ruling indicated, this is not a jurisdictional Chamber. In this instance, we are right and it is absolutely valid to set up a mechanism of investigation. We must have somebody to guard the guardians and, in this case, that role falls to us. We must carry out that function in a thorough and sensitive manner. I am glad we are not rushing into it and are giving it at least an additional week. I look forward to hearing from the Minister if there are other mechanisms she is considering, which amendments she will accept and how the terms of reference might be changed. I would appreciate if she would communicate to other parties and leaders as to how that will be done. If possible, we should have clarity around the mechanisms of investigation when it comes to the issue of access to digital and telephone records. If we are saying we want Mr. Justice Charleton to examine the records of all the journalists involved and potentially Members of this or the previous Dáil, we must ensure it is done right within the context of a proper judicial process. I look forward to hearing from other Members as to how they see that happening in the course of the commission's work.

When the Garda Commissioner was appointed, we were led to believe there would be all sorts of sweeping changes. In reality, unfortunately, she has acted in much the same manner as previous Commissioners. Nothing has changed. In fact, things have got a lot worse. We are going back to the days of the early 1980s when the acronym GUBU, which stood for grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented, was coined. The events we are discussing today are GUBU-esque. Having investigated the circumstances in which there was interaction between the Commissioner and Garda whistleblowers, Mr. Justice O'Neill was incapable of deciphering who was and was not telling the truth. That is what it came down to. It amounts to an incredibly serious allegation when a member of our Judiciary is incapable of saying that the most senior garda in the State was telling the truth. That is why we are now moving towards the establishment of a commission of inquiry. I do not believe the Commissioner in this matter, having come to that conclusion on the basis of her actions and how she instructed her legal counsel to deal with the O'Neill investigation. This is the most senior police person in the State who knows the legal system better than most. She gave a clear instruction to her senior counsel to show that Sergeant Maurice McCabe was acting with malice, seeking to get his own back on the force and that everything he said was unreliable. The words put out about him were a lot stronger than "unreliable". The Commissioner had the opportunity to clarify her instruction to her legal counsel but she chose to use legal privilege, as she is entitled to do. She opted not to waive that privilege and not to give a full and clear explanation for why her legal team used the methods and tactics it did. In its guide to legal professional privilege, published this month, the global law form DLA Piper states in respect of Ireland: "Note that legal professional privilege can be waived expressly or implied by the "owner" of the legal professional privilege, the client." The Commissioner was the client and if she wanted to explain herself, that was how she could have done it. She chose not to do so. The information I have been given is that as many as ten journalists were briefed in regard to Sergeant McCabe. The Irish Times states that Superintendent David Taylor has put that on record. Superintendent Taylor was arrested by Detective Superintendent Jim McGowan, who is the Commissioner's husband. In the course of that arrest, Superintendent Taylor's Garda-issue mobile telephone was confiscated. That is the device which held the potential evidence but we do not know where that evidence is or who is in possession of it. It is remarkable that these circumstances were allowed to transpire. Deputy Eamon Ryan spoke about the checking of mobile telephones in evidence gathering. In the past, mobiles were just telephones and back in the 1980s it was a question of tapping a landline. There are now so many different platforms for communication that one cannot say where it starts and ends. One could not make it up that the Garda Commissioner was investigated by a justice of the State and will now be investigated by a commission of inquiry under a Supreme Court judge, that the Commissioner's husband arrested one of the individuals in question, and that the telephone containing the evidence was taken by her husband and is now missing. I support my colleague from Wexford, Deputy Howlin, whom I have known all my life. He is not somebody who makes things up. He has a serious track record in terms of his dealings with the Morris tribunal and other events in the past. The information he has put on the record is helpful. Superintendent Taylor has been on leave from work for 21 months even though he has not been convicted of anything.It is appropriate that the Garda Commissioner should step aside. It is important, in the interests of natural justice, that the Commissioner step aside in the interests of An Garda Síochána. The interests of one individual cannot come before those of the police force. There are approximately 15,000 members of An Garda Síochána and if one includes civilian staff, the total number of staff is almost 20,000. Their names and reputations are all in disrepute to some degree when the person at the top faces allegations as serious as those that have been made. The Commissioner should step aside. It is the appropriate thing to do in the interests of the Garda.

The Tánaiste received that report on 7 December and, this week, two months later, she has published it. The first point I would make is that a period of four and a half months has elapsed. We need to be mindful that the careers of members of An Garda Síochána who are involved and affected by this matter are on hold and it is important that we deal with the issues in as timely a manner as possible. From that point of view, I was somewhat surprised to hear people referring to the fact that when the commission of investigation gets under way, it may well be nine months before it concludes its work. For those who are affected and who may well still be at work, this matter is having an adverse affect on their careers in all aspects and it needs to be dealt with in a timely and efficient manner. I raised this issue with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste responded to me. I welcome her reply. I will not read it all, but the Tánaiste wrote: The Report, which I received on 7 December 2016, sets out in detail the allegations contained in the protected disclosures. In view of the nature of those allegations, and the fact that third parties are mentioned, the Report was referred to the Attorney General for her advice on how to proceed, including the question of what material might properly be put in the public domain, having regard to the rights of all concerned. Advices were received from the Attorney General's Office which raised further issues and which are the subject of ongoing consultation between my Department and the Office. This is with a view to bringing proposals to Government as quickly as possible. These proposals will obviously be guided by the conclusions and recommendations of Mr. Justice O'Neill as regards what further action might be necessary and appropriate.What was made public this week was quite limited. It was the recommendations and the terms of reference for the commission of investigation which the Government is largely accepting subject to whatever amendments the Tánaiste might accept from the floor today from Members here. Then there is the document, "Statement of reasons for establishing a commission to investigate matters relating to two disclosures made by members of the Garda Síochána under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014". We thought we would see, as the Taoiseach described, a redacted report. We were expecting something more substantial than merely the terms of reference and the recommendations that accompany them, which are quite specific. We are used to reading executive summaries, bullet points, etc., but when trying to engage in such a process, it would have been useful to understand more of what Mr. Justice O'Neill had been reading and what his recommendations were based on. I say that because the document to which I referred states, "Finally, Mr Justice O'Neill indicated that he was aware of other disclosures made by other members of An Garda Síochána ...". We would like to know if he was aware of them in a general way or if he had the specifics and details of those disclosures. That is the type of information we are missing in making a determination on the appropriate terms of reference for this commission of investigation. It is quite difficult to be genuine and fair, having the report in its entirety redacted with only the recommendations available to us. There is only one other issue that I will refer to because it has already been raised. I refer to the position taken by the Commissioner. The allegations, as the Tánaiste has indicated quite clearly, are very serious and it is not only one person who is affected. What is happening affects the morale of members of An Garda Síochána and public confidence in the force. When the Tánaiste was asked about her position on the Garda Commissioner earlier today, she quite rightly set out the position that the Garda Commissioner is entitled to the presumption of innocence and that she has not been found guilty. That was the manner in which the Tánaiste set it out in reply to Leaders' Questions earlier. In her opening statement on this debate, the Tánaiste said, "We should all be mindful of the dangers of disrupting the leadership of that organisation at a time of great risk to communities and for no established cause." I accept those points. On the other hand - and only the Tánaiste can make this decision because she has the report and we do not - there is a balance to be considered. One of the issues that the Tánaiste must consider in making that decision is whether, with the Commissioner in situ, the confidence and transparency of the commission of investigation being set up is in any way compromised and will stand up to the type of scrutiny that we all would like it to. I am not going to answer that. Nobody but the Tánaiste can do so. However, it is a question that needs to be addressed. The Tánaiste stated that she believes the Commissioner should remain in position and she indicated one set of reasons in this regard. There are, however, counterbalances that must be adjudicated upon and the Tánaiste is the only person who is in possession of the relevant facts. The point the Tánaiste makes is, "We should all be mindful of the dangers of disrupting the leadership of that organisation ...". I would ask is the Garda Commissioner's position already endangering that organisation. Do the members of An Garda Síochána have absolute confidence in her while these investigations are going on? Those are some of the issues the Tánaiste must make a decision on. While Mr. Justice O'Neill was - as reported - quite clear in his findings to the effect that there was no guilt attached, suffice to say that he did not find that there was no reason for not proceeding with a commission of investigation. That is quite a serious matter. From our point of view, without being able to read the report, an element we would have liked to have seen is the basis of Mr. Justice O'Neill's decision that a commission of investigation is necessary. My party supports, in full, the amendments that were put forward by my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan.

At the time, the controversy in question arose in respect of the penalty points system. Members will recall that Sergeant McCabe stepped forward in an unprecedented way, came before the committee and gave evidence. That evidence was contested. It was certainly my impression, as a member of the then committee, that the system had no appetite for Sergeant McCabe coming before the committee. I am using temperate language in my description of the atmosphere at the time. Nonetheless, Sergeant McCabe came forward, told his story and, for the most part, his allegations stood up. Certainly, his intentions were vindicated, as was the fact that he was acting not from malice, but out of genuine concern. Sergeant McCabe emerged from that episode with this honour and his good name very much intact. I suppose what this commission of investigation looks to is the behind-the-scenes action, if I could call it that, of the relevant period. In other words, what was going on. Whereas those of us at the front line in the then committee could get a sense of hostility, I could never have imagined the things that are now alleged to have gone on. Let me repeat what I stated to the Tánaiste this morning. These are not minor issues. If even a fraction of these allegations are held to be true, then we have a deep, deep problem within An Garda Síochána. If it is a practice to target individuals in a way that is vindictive, malicious and dishonourable, if that has happened in any way in respect of a serving member of An Garda Síochána, we have a big problem.We have a problem that extends beyond the Garda because the other allegations suggest a level of collusion among elements of what is called the mainstream media and a question mark over the contacts, and the influence or otherwise, of political figures, be they in government or Members of the Oireachtas. These are very serious matters and nobody contests any of that. Therefore, it is very important to get the terms of reference right. In large measure, I believe Mr. Justice O'Neill has set the compass in the right direction - let us agree on that. We have moved an amendment to extend the remit to capture any potential contacts between An Garda Síochána and other agencies of the State, that is to say, contacts in addition to the alleged contact with media outlets and political figures. It is important we get to the bottom of that and that we have full knowledge of exactly the extent of communication, and malicious communication at that. Our amendment, which was discussed by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, captures that. There is also the issue of the other whistleblowers, which Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace have raised, legitimately so. I can understand the value of having a particular focus within this commission of investigation. I believe what is alleged to have happened to Maurice McCabe warrants in and of itself independent investigation, but that is not to say the complaints of Garda Harrison and Garda Keogh, and perhaps others, must not also be investigated. We need an answer from the Minister. If she is not accommodating the other whistleblowers within this framework and she has a rationale for that, how then will their complaints be answered? Do we need a separate scoping process and another commission? We need an answer to that question. On the issue of the Commissioner and her position, to set the record straight, because a bit of mischief has been made on this issue, nobody has suggested for a second that her constitutional right to her good name is up for grabs - that is not what has been said. To my knowledge, nobody has argued that we set that aside. However, what is as plain as the nose on one's face is that Mr. Justice O'Neill did feel moved to recommend a commission of investigation. He regarded the question marks over senior gardaí, including the former Commissioner and the serving Commissioner, to be of sufficient gravity to warrant a commission of investigation. I do not know how, in the real world, given that set of circumstances, one could possibly argue for Nóirín O'Sullivan to remain in position. I do not believe that is tenable. I would go further and say it is in her best interest, in my view, in the defence of her good name and reputation, that she would do the sensible and decent thing and stand aside. The Minister should listen not just to those of us on the Opposition benches but, it seems, to those on her own back benches in order that a common sense approach is adopted in this regard.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	282	The points have been well made. I would like to add my voice to the suggestion that the information within the Minister's remit, the information that other Oireachtas Members may have and the contacts they may have had in regard to this matter should be part of the terms of reference of the commission of investigation. I agree that, as Deputies Daly and Wallace suggested, the cases of the other whistleblowers should also be included in the commission of investigation. I agree that the Commissioner should step aside until this investigation is concluded. The Minister's main defence against the last suggestion is that Commissioner O'Sullivan is entitled to her good name and to due process. Of course, until an investigation is concluded, there is no conviction and there is no definitive certainty on the rights and wrongs of these allegations. However, when serious allegations of this sort are made, generally speaking, it is normal practice in employment or anywhere else, pending an investigation and without prejudice, that people would step aside. This is particularly the case here because, if the Commissioner remains in situ, given we do not know the truth of these serious allegations, she potentially has a position where she could influence the evidence chain relating to the investigation itself. That is simply not acceptable if we want a proper investigation. I do not think it in any way prejudices anybody's good name. It is just sensible practice for people to step aside without prejudice to allow the investigation to be conducted. If the Commissioner is vindicated, or if the investigation into any of the other matters in regard to political or media involvement, or collusion in a possible smear campaign against Maurice McCabe, finds that none of that took place, then people will be vindicated and that will, no doubt, be made very clear and made public in the aftermath. For now, however, she should step aside. This saga has gone on and on, with Maurice McCabe and other whistleblowers being treated appallingly and every effort being made to stymie them, or at least the allegations are that this has gone on. However, when we have somebody like Superintendent David Taylor, who was close to Martin Callinan and who was operating at a very senior level subsequently with Nóirín O'Sullivan, making the sort of allegations he is making of a scurrilous smear campaign against Maurice McCabe that used the nastiest, most character-impugning allegations about him, it could not be more serious. If there is even a scintilla of truth in this, heads have to roll right along the line. It calls into question the whole culture at a senior level in the Garda, particularly because he is alleging a continuation from Callinan through to the new Commissioner. He is suggesting we are not just dealing with a couple of rotten apples but potentially with a rotten barrel, an absolutely rotten culture, at the most senior level of the Garda, which is trying to smother, defame and intimidate people who are trying to blow the whistle in the public interest about wrongdoing within the Garda. The Minister needs to take on board what was said today, broaden the terms of reference and insist that Commissioner O'Sullivan steps aside until we get to the truth of these incredibly serious allegations.

I am grateful for the acknowledgement from some Deputies that the approach I am taking is the right way to consider this matter, namely, to take some time to reflect on what has been said here today and the suggestions that various Deputies have made. We all recognise the seriousness of the situation.I have made it clear that we need to investigate them. If any of the allegations were proved to be true, it would have the most serious consequences. A number of Deputies have made the point and I accept it. I see merit in a number of the suggestions that have been made here today on the terms of reference. A number of the suggestions proposed had fairly widespread support across the House. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan suggested an amendment and made the point that there are two questions at the heart of the commission, including whether there was a campaign against Sergeant Maurice McCabe, particularly using the circumstances surrounding a criminal complaint. A number of Deputies, including Deputies Jonathan O'Brien, Brendan Howlin and Clare Daly, felt there was merit in Deputy O'Callaghan's suggestion. Deputy O'Callaghan felt the terms of reference could be worded in such a way that would deal with it more effectively than the way they are worded now. He thought the wording under the terms of reference could be interpreted as being too restrictive. I am not sure it is too restrictive. I would have thought it could have covered any allegation or criminal complaint. I have no doubt Mr. Justice O'Neill worded his terms of reference based on the specific details that were alleged to him. The terms of reference give Mr. Justice O'Neill broad scope in conducting the commission and if anything else comes to his attention, it is built into the terms of reference that he can deal with it. Notwithstanding that, I accept that it is right to put beyond doubt the matter Deputy Jim O'Callaghan raised and I will include it fully in the terms of reference. To summarise my approach to it, I agree the commission needs to be fully able to pursue the issue of the criminal complaint being used improperly. I will address the point in the revised draft order which I will put before the Government reflecting the amendment which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan suggested. A number of Members also made the point that there had been contact with the then Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. Deputies raised the question of whether there had been similar contacts with members of the Government. Some Deputies asked whether there had been contact with other Members of the House. If there have been, nobody has put them in the public arena, as far as I am aware. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan suggested that we include in the terms of reference whether there was contact with members of the Government. I accept it, I have no problem with it and it is sensible. I have no objection to doing it. Obviously, I have to go to the Cabinet to change the terms of reference. If the commission is looking at contacts with the then Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, it would be reasonable to examine whether there had been similar contacts with members of the Government. I will ask the commission to examine it. I have no difficulty agreeing to it. Other Deputies have talked about extending it to all Members of the House and agencies. It was Mr. Justice O'Neill who had access to the relevant material and who was best placed to decide how it would be dealt with and make a judgment call on the terms of reference in order to get at the truth. The more changes we make to the terms of reference and the greater the number of matters we ask the commission to investigate, the longer it will take to establish the truth. This is something on which we should seriously reflect. We have had experience of tribunals and commissions that went on for very long times. We must take a reasonable approach that deals with the central issues raised today but does not extend the terms of reference so much that the time period will be much longer. As so many Members have said today, it should be dealt with in a timely way. Deputy John Curran felt even nine months was too long and suggested it should be dealt with in a more efficient and timely way. There is a provision to amend the terms of reference of a commission of investigation after it has been established, if matters emerge which warrant it. I would have no difficulty pursuing it in the course of the commission sitting and Deputies could always use the mechanism. Some people said the commission's remit should be extended to cases of other people who have made disclosures. As is clear from the statement of reasons, Mr. Justice O'Neill recommends it. Because of the nature of protected disclosures and the rights of confidentiality of the people involved, I have previously explained to the House that I do not comment on individual cases. However, a number of cases are under consideration by GSOC and I do not want to do anything to interfere with any statutory examination or investigation which is currently under way. It is open to members of the Garda Síochána, to make protected disclosures about any aspect of how they believe they are being treated. Mr. Justice O'Neill decided a commission of investigation was warranted into very specific matters. He described them as unique, given who they were against and the seriousness of them, which we have acknowledged here. It would be wrong to take the view that a commission is the only way we have to examine the issues. GSOC has been given a very specific statutory role regarding these issues and it is very important that it is allowed to do its work. GSOC wants to establish a very specific protected disclosures unit, which would be the appropriate place for such cases to go. I have discussed this with the chairman of GSOC, the Government will support and resource the unit and GSOC is establishing it. I am also doing the ten-year review of GSOC legislation. I have, at all times, attempted to deal with these issues in the most timely manner possible. Deputy John Curran raised the point. I received the two protected disclosures on Monday, 3 October. I asked Judge O'Neill to review them on the following Friday, 7 October. I received his review on 7 December. The Attorney General gave advice on the complex issues that were involved due to the interaction between the Constitution, protected disclosures and a commission of investigation. Given that it is very complex legally to decide what can be put in the public domain and the various issues, it took time to examine them. However, I have acted in a very timely manner. One message is clear to me from today's debate. We absolutely must continually work to ensure we have proper arrangements for Garda oversight and accountability. Allegations cannot be resolved here. We must have an effective way of dealing with them in a way that protects those who make disclosures while respecting the rights of all to the fairness which is a cornerstone of our Constitution. I thank the Deputies for the input and I will revert to the House with a revised draft for approval by the House.

Brexit will impact on all policy fields of the Department and agencies and I have tasked my Department officials with making Brexit their number one priority.  I am satisfied that all efforts are being made to understand and respond to the challenges and opportunities. This is reflected in the recently launched Action Plan for Jobs 2017, which contains a special chapter on Brexit and several detailed actions. I have secured significant additional capital and current funding for my Department in 2017 – a 10% increase on 2016 to support the enterprise agencies of the Department. Enterprise Ireland, EI, the local enterprise offices, InterTradeIreland, and Industrial Development Agency, IDA, Ireland, are engaging on a one-to-one basis with all client companies to help them assess, plan and act. We will work to preserve Ireland's fullest market access to the UK in the framework of any future deal between the EU and the UK. This includes a particular focus on the trade implications for the Border region. We will do our utmost to promote the interests of those companies and businesses that engage in cross-Border trade. InterTradeIreland has a programme of initiatives to deal with the practical consequences of Brexit for cross-Border trade. I have put in place a structured dialogue with companies of different sizes, across different sectors and regions with the support of various representative bodies, to identify the real needs of firms and develop potential responses. This will give me a clear evidence base for what the various sectors need and want. We are also enhancing our trade and investment missions and events.

The Minister is aware that the Department of Finance in the scenario which it produced recently predicted a fall in our economic output of 3.5% that would effectively reduce our exports to the UK by almost one third. In a reply to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister informed me that, as of 19 January last, only half the Cabinet had engaged in bilateral meetings with their counterparts. That is seven out of 15 Ministers, which is poor. Those figures may have improved since. We have been advocating an enterprise stabilisation fund. The Minister outlined how she has resourced IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland but we need a stabilisation fund that business and small and medium enterprises, SMEs can tap into, a fund that they can apply to with a set of criteria. Does the Minister have any plan to introduce such a measure at Cabinet and if not, why?

That will be difficult. We are conducting a targeted survey and we and EI are finding there are different requests from companies.

We need these responses and hard information before saying what we need.

She has not expanded on what the difficulties are and whether they can be surmounted. Everything is surmountable if we try to address it. We have to consider our competitiveness. We have a huge deficit in terms of competitiveness in respect of the UK. We have highlighted for example the capital gains rate of tax for entrepreneurial start-ups. Have the Minister or her Cabinet colleagues discussed with their counterparts engagements on a change in the state aid rules? They should be having more of these engagements. The limit is €200,000 but previously it was €500,000. If we work hard and focus on trying to change our state aid rules by way of collaboration and engagement with our EU colleagues we would greatly help our SME sector and could then roll out an enterprise stabilisation fund.

It is quite confidential at the moment. We give grants with EI in accordance with state aid rules. That is not all of what the companies want. We are engaging with them. EI has 1,500 clients on its books and is engaging one-to-one with the companies and the sectors. The answer is not to throw money at them. It is to have a targeted response so that the company and the agencies, EI and InterTradeIreland, will be confident that those companies will be vibrant and successful after Brexit.

Its regional spread means it underpins the socioeconomic development of rural areas in particular. Ambitious plans under the Food Wise 2025 strategy could see the creation of 23,000 jobs and a growth in the value of exports by 85% over the next decade. Enterprise Ireland works closely with Irish food and drink companies to support innovation and to build scale and resilience for them to be positioned to compete on world markets. I have secured additional funding for Enterprise Ireland to respond to Brexit. This includes 39 additional staff with sectoral knowledge and expertise. While Enterprise Ireland is the development agency for companies in the food and drink sector in Ireland, Bord Bia under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is responsible for working with such companies to access overseas markets. The UK remains a key market. Enterprise Ireland is working closely with Bord Bia to help Irish food and drink companies to build on their international reputation for product excellence and to drive growth in other key markets such as the eurozone, Canada, the US and Asia.

Brexit has the potential to be the biggest economic disaster to hit the North and the South of Ireland for many generations. We need to meet the challenges that will arise in that frightening context. The provision of €3 million is welcome, as is the allocation of an additional 39 staff to Enterprise Ireland and an additional nine staff to IDA Ireland. We now know what type of Brexit we are facing. We no longer have to wait for the UK to trigger Article 50. Theresa May has made it crystal clear that she is going for a hard Brexit. The Minister will be aware of Ms Patricia King's comments at last week's conference in Carrick-on-Shannon. She said that Irish jobs must not be lost because of a UK decision. I think we need additional funding to help people in the markets that will be affected by that decision. Professor Kevin O'Rourke, who is a professor or economics at Oxford University, recently suggested that the Government should allocate €25 million for a market diversification and product innovation strategy in support of Irish food and drink companies that will have to try to replace UK exports with EU exports and in compensation for the hit caused by Brexit. His analysis of the food and drink sector provides an insight into how the paltry expenditure of €3 million is nowhere near the level of funding needed to meet the challenge of Brexit.

I remind the Deputy that extra staff have gone in from Enterprise Ireland. Further supports for these sectors were provided for in budget 2017, including the €150 million low-cost loan scheme that was launched on 31 January last, agri-taxation measures and the increase in funding under the rural development and seafood development programmes. A €150 million cashflow support loan scheme is available to farmers throughout Ireland at a low interest rate of 2.95%. This loan scheme forms part of the three-pillar strategy in response to income volatility that was announced by the Minister as part of budget 2017. This scheme, along with tax measures and farm payments, will help to alleviate some of the pressures being caused by the recent market difficulties which have been compounded by the uncertainty around Brexit.

Some commentators have suggested that we might be able to attract foreign direct investment. However, jobs that are lost in the agrifood sector will be lost straight away. The European Union Committee of the House of Lords recently published a report on the impact of Brexit which included a suggestion that "Dublin’s limited infrastructure and shortage of housing might deter financial firms from relocating there". The relocation of financial services is one of the supposed benefits of Brexit. It is clear that we will fail to realise that opportunity because of the State's failure to invest in infrastructure over a number of years. On Tuesday of this week, members of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence met Dutch parliamentarians who were on a fact-finding mission to Ireland. They were shocked to hear about the concerns we have in this country regarding the Border. They were talking about the North, in particular, when they said that Ireland is not on the radar of the EU. We need to spend more money. We need to get over there more often.

When I was first elected to this House in 2011, the Government was having to cut budgets and the IMF and the EU were in here, having loaned us money. I am not sure whether the Deputy remembers that. It was a short time ago. I absolutely acknowledge that we need to improve infrastructure like roads, housing and office space. When I took up this job last year, I was told there was a huge shortage of office space. A great deal of office space is now being provided by private investors. That will be available in Dublin. I am conscious of the importance of ensuring all the regions get a piece of the action when opportunities are presented by Brexit. We will make sure jobs from back offices and middle offices go to the regions. I will continue to push that agenda.

The contract, which was extended by 12 months early last year, is now set to conclude on 26 March. When the board of IDA Ireland considered the long-term future of the initiative at its meeting last November, it decided that the agency would not re-tender for the continuation of the Succeed in Ireland programme at this stage. I have asked my Department to commission a review of the initiative, to include a full assessment of its costs and its contribution to employment generation in the State. Such a review may also consider the development of a new programme, for example through an examination of the experience of similar initiatives in other jurisdictions.

Seventy-nine international companies have been approved by IDA Ireland under the programme, with 2,411 jobs being created over three years. It is noteworthy, given that regional job creation is a big issue for us, that 66% of these jobs are in 15 counties outside Dublin. ConnectIreland has 78,285 connectors based in 147 countries. Some 44 of its 84 projects have involved 20 jobs or fewer. It is getting into our communities. ConnectIreland claims that IDA Ireland has not given it credit for many of the projects and jobs I have just mentioned. It is clear that there is a bit of a dispute between the two. The point is that ConnectIreland is delivering jobs at a fraction of the cost at which IDA Ireland is delivering jobs. The Minister has said she will commission a review of this matter. How long will the review take? Does she agree that the current Succeed in Ireland programme should be extended until that review has been completed? It is bringing in jobs and linking into a huge global network. If we do not use every avenue we have to create employment, particularly through a scheme that creates jobs more cheaply than IDA Ireland does, we will cut off our nose to spite our face.

I am informed that as it currently stands, 527 jobs on the ground have been created. I make it clear that IDA Ireland oversees and manages the operation of the initiative. I certainly have no reason not to rely on the data and information provided. I am carrying out a review and it is clearly in the interests of good governance that such a review would be undertaken before determining the future of the programme. We must fully understand how the initiative has functioned, its strong and weak points and how we could potentially improve it in future. This is in the interests of the taxpayer, the State and, ultimately, the programme itself.

It would make perfect sense to my mind to keep the programme running and use those worldwide connections. There are more than 80,000 connected people around the world in the Irish diaspora. It is a large network and we would lose all of it. DKM Economic Consultants has reported that ConnectIreland has created an estimate of 1,028 jobs. The figures are in dispute but the operation of the client companies arising from the scheme has added €123 million to the Irish gross domestic product, GDP, benefitting the Exchequer by €26 million. Those figures are in the DKM report. It is a positive initiative. There is a dispute between the operator and IDA Ireland, which is fine, but it does not merit not agreeing to continue the programme until the review concludes. The review could indicate that the process could be improved or changed but parking it on one side or discontinuing it would be very silly.

I must understand exactly how that initiative functioned, as well as its strong and weak points, as I mentioned. The experience of IDA Ireland in this area is unparalleled and we must be careful not to risk defusing expertise and awareness of multiple entities and governance arrangements. I want to see the review and the figures.

West Cork comes under the south west action plan for jobs, which covers counties Cork and Kerry and was launched in July 2015. As of quarter three, the south-west region unemployment rate had dropped to 6.4%, from a high of 14.3% in 2012. The downturn in employment hit the south west heavily in 2008 but there is potential to grow sustainable jobs based on the sectoral strengths, skills profile and innovative capacity within this region. As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2017, my Department, through Enterprise Ireland, has committed to support all eight regional action plans for jobs and to provide investment of up to €60 million over the period to 2020 to support collaborative approaches to boost enterprise and job creation across the regions. The regional competitive funding initiative will be launched shortly.  It will be aimed at accelerating economic recovery in every part of the country by delivering on the potential of local and regional strengths. The number of jobs created by Enterprise Ireland in County Cork in 2015 was 1,443 and in 2016 it was 1,505. The number of jobs created by the Industrial Development Agency, IDA, in 2016 was 1,675.

Good jobs are what any area would want and in west Cork, unfortunately, we have been forgotten for far too long. The Minister provided very rosy employment figures but the bottom line is that is not felt on the ground by many people. They feel there are not enough good quality jobs in west Cork. For the creation of any good employment, we need good road structure, mobile phone coverage and broadband. These are three simple and basic foundation elements for any job creation but, unfortunately, it is not there in west Cork. We have fallen far behind on all these fronts because of Government inaction. Historically, while we have had some great companies like ROWA in Bantry, Ceramicx in Ballydehob and Irish Yogurts in Clonakilty, there is still a lack of good quality jobs. I plead with the Minister to work towards creating these jobs. How does she intend to turn this around for the people of west Cork?

There is a new 10,000 sq. ft. Ludgate digital hub building that opened this year in Skibbereen, providing up to 75 desks, training and meeting room space. The building has 1,000 MB connectivity. I am definitely in the business of making sure that good quality jobs come to Ireland and are developed and scaled in Ireland by Enterprise Ireland companies and firms that work with our local enterprise offices. We are also announcing a consortium involving University College Cork, Cork Institute of Technology, the National University of Ireland, Galway, and Trinity College Dublin to win the health innovation hub. That will provide good quality jobs. I have attended meetings of all the regional action plan for jobs implementation groups. They all sing from one hymn sheet and we want good quality jobs.

We find it an uphill struggle in making this happen. Unfortunately, we are turning to work schemes to see if we can make up many of the job losses and the fact that many low-income farmers and fishermen find it very difficult to thrive. Even with that, only 39 came to County Cork and 79 went to Mayo, which is very unfair. It shows how west Cork is being forgotten, even with the lowly case of a community employment or rural and social job. Unfortunately, west Cork has been forgotten. Will the Minister consider a jobs task force for west Cork in order to concentrate on bringing good employment to the area?

I pay tribute to the work it does. On it working together there are industry partners, local employment offices, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and all the different educational bodies.

IDA Ireland has paid €2.069 million to ConnectIreland as a financial reward in respect of those 527 positions. It has also provided ConnectIreland with a further €150,000 for marketing support for the operation of the programme. As payments to ConnectIreland are dependent on the number of jobs generated through the programme, the final sum due from IDA Ireland will depend on how many positions are ultimately created. This exact figure will not be determined for some time. I have asked my Department to commission a review of the initiative. This will allow for a full assessment of its costs and contribution to employment generation in the State. Such a review may also consider the development of a new programme, including through examining the experience of similar initiatives in other jurisdictions. The original contract underpinning the Succeed in Ireland initiative was due to expire in March 2016. In advance of that date, however, the contract was extended for a maximum period of one year. The purpose of that extension, agreed by both parties, was to allow an orderly wind-down of the programme.

IDA Ireland said it created 527 verifiable jobs at a cost of €2 million but ConnectIreland, and its chief executive officer, Terry Clune, claim it created more than 2,200 jobs. There is a serious dispute about these figures. I understand there are significant tensions between IDA Ireland and ConnectIreland to the extent that it has gone for arbitration. Will the Minister confirm this?The Sunday Business Post also revealed that, based on freedom of information requests, there have been several meetings with IDA officials and ConnectIreland with the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, John Moran, lobbying on ConnectIreland’s behalf. There seems to be some dispute as to whether the State agency might be required to disburse further amounts to the company to offset losses. Will the Minister confirm this? If so, will she specify the amounts involved?

It will create new employment opportunities for the people of the area as well as serving as a real endorsement of the Shannon area as an attractive destination for inward investment. All companies operating in Ireland, including the business in question, are subject to a range of employment related legislation. Employees also have the benefit of various statutory protections and entitlements. This legislative framework provides certainty for all those in the country’s labour market and ensures workers are treated fairly under the law. Beyond changes to minimum wage rates, the Government cannot specify remuneration levels for new hires in businesses, whether those are supported by our development agencies or otherwise. Private sector employers must retain flexibility to determine the appropriate pay levels in their respective businesses. We need to remember too that multinational companies in Ireland are operating in an increasingly competitive and challenging global marketplace.

It is a long way from Clare to the Dublin South-Central constituency. While I do not represent Clare, I have had e-mails from workers in Element Six as I am on the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. They have informed me that the majority of the workers of this subsidiary of the global company, De Beers, a hugely profitable company which made €1 billion in profit since 2014, are contracted to an agency known as eFlexes. This agency has driven down the pay, terms and conditions of its employees. This should be a concern of this House and the Minister’s office. Her brief is for jobs, and the quality of jobs matters. On the one hand, it is wonderful we can celebrate the announcement of new jobs in Clare and elsewhere. On the other, we have to take in the human cost to the people who work there. I have spoken to some of the workers in the company. They are jaded and tired. The sorts of shifts they have to work through the night are poorly remunerated. They get little notice of their rotas. This is a very anti-social and anti-family way of conducting employment. It is increasing, however, particularly with multinational companies which we are so grateful to have in this country.

In 2009, the company in question had to restructure and it nearly closed down.However, as I said, the 100 jobs that were announced in the recent past are very well-paid and senior positions. While many of the employees are on contracts, many have also been working there for some time and are long-term employees of the company. The new jobs have the same starting terms and conditions as existing jobs although those who have long service with the company are paid more.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	346	While I do not work there, I want to refute what the Minister has just said. Approximately 300 of the 500 employees work under the auspices of an agency called eFlexes. I have to hand copies of the contracts stating that eFlexes reserves the right to change a person's working hours at any time, provided the person is told about this and the company hears the person's reasonable objections. I have evidence that people who have objected to being told at the last minute that they must work for the next 15 hours have been threatened with the loss of their contracts. There is also an interesting procedure in the disciplinary section which I have never seen before in any contract of employment. It sets out that a person who is subject to a serious investigation of ill discipline may be suspended without pay pending the investigation. Garda Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan, should she be suspended, will be suspended with pay because that is in the contract of most employees in the country; the opposite is the case with this contract. I argue that there are serious breaches of the concepts of work and lifestyle decency within these types of new jobs that we are celebrating. It is part of the Minister's brief to examine and watch over what is happening in the employment arena in this country.

Again, many of the employees in the company to which the Deputy refers are long-term employees. I acknowledge that many are working on a contract basis.

We need a particular focus by the State's industrial promotion agencies on assisting companies to maintain and, hopefully, to grow employment. There is a particular need to assist those companies to remain competitive. Many of the companies in the Border region, mainly small and medium enterprises, depend on the sterling area to which they export their products and currency fluctuations cause them particular problems. There is a need for the Government to introduce, as was done in 2009, particular measures to assist companies that are impacted by currency fluctuations.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	354	Enterprise Ireland, EI, the local enterprise offices, LEOs, and IDA Ireland are engaging on a one-to-one basis with all client companies regarding the impacts being felt as a result of Brexit. All agencies have clear plans in place. In budget 2017, I secured additional moneys, both current and capital, to support the enterprise agencies' strategic response to Brexit. More than €1 billion of Enterprise Ireland client companies' exports go to Northern Ireland and I am very conscious of the challenges that may be faced by companies operating in close proximately to the Border. My Department is funding a research project to inform future responses on a sectoral basis. That research is being conducted by InterTradeIreland. The LEOs are working in partnership with EI to roll out
targeted initiatives to drive innovation, market diversification, cost competitiveness and business management. IDA Ireland has a clear Brexit plan which is being executed and includes one-to-one investor engagements, public relations and media campaigns and an international marketing campaign. InterTradeIreland also has a programme of initiatives to deal with the practical consequences of Brexit for cross-Border trade.  The regional action plan for the north-east-north-west region aims to support the creation of 28,000 jobs across counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth by 2020. There has been strong progress to date, with 5,600 more people in employment across the region since the start of 2015.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	355	I thank the Minister for her reply. As she is aware, for historical reasons during the awful period of the Troubles, it was extremely difficult to attract inward investment to the Border region, to places like Monaghan, Donegal and Cavan. We had to depend on indigenous industry. By and large the industries in the counties of the Border region, including my own constituency, are small and medium-sized enterprises. The briefing note prepared for the Minister by the various agencies states that they are engaged with all companies. However, there may be companies with half a dozen to a dozen employees that have not sought the assistance of Enterprise Ireland or any other statutory agency in the past. It is very important that all industries and enterprises are spoken to, involved in negotiations and given details of what assistance can be made available to them. I emphasise that many of the companies in my particular area are heavily or completely dependent on exports to the sterling area. There should be a plan in place so that if there is currency instability, a mechanism would be activated to support those enterprises that experience immediate problems in their export markets.

Obviously we all welcome that. I have four very specific questions for the Minister. I am looking for specific figures which, I presume, the Minister will be able to give me off the top of her head or else they will be in her supplementary notes. What is the total number of additional staff members in the IDA to deal with Brexit? How many IDA staff members are there in Britain? How many staff members are in the London office? What is the total headcount of the IDA in February 2017 compared with February 2016? In summary, I want to know the number of extra staff members in the IDA to cope with Brexit, the number of staff members in Britain and in London and the total headcount this month versus this time last year.

Deputy Brendan Smith spoke about the Border and specifically about companies that are not under the auspices of Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland. There are two main agencies that can help such companies. The LEOs will speak to and advise small companies. The other relevant agency is InterTradeIreland, which has published a fact sheet for companies. A series of information sessions for companies has been held, with a further programme of such sessions planned. An initial series of meetings in eight different locations around the country are also being developed. One such meeting was held recently in the Border area. Further information and awareness events will be initiated in due course. InterTradeIreland will review and adjust its supports, if necessary, as new rules and regulations emerge. In the short term, InterTradeIreland is planning to put processes in place to ensure that it is in a position to provide information to small and medium-sized enterprises. InterTradeIreland will also monitor business needs and challenges through its business monitor survey process so that it is in a position to respond quickly to business concerns. My Department is establishing two initiatives to address cross-Border trade issues.

I would like to record my appreciation of the work that InterTradeIreland has done since its establishment following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. It is an all-Ireland body that does exceptionally good work. I hope it is adequately resourced to do the very important work that will be required over the next few years.I have another issue, on which I do not expect a reply from the Minister, about two substantial landbanks. One is in Cavan town of 40 acres is owned by IDA Ireland. It is serviced and available for the location of industry. Similarly, there is a site in Monaghan town that is a substantial landbank owned by IDA Ireland. I would appreciate if the Minister could speak to the chief executive officer and the senior officials of IDA Ireland on the potential and the need to market those locations. It would be a timely booster of confidence for the Border region if we were to attract some industry to the area, be it the development of an indigenous industry or a foreign direct investor. I appeal to the Minister to speak to the senior people in IDA Ireland to put a particular focus on the needs of Cavan and Monaghan.

Enterprise Ireland has 570 staff in full-time equivalent posts before the Brexit-specific recruitment of 39 staff takes effect.IDA Ireland had 268 staff - and I shall quiz Deputy Kelly on these figures - in 259 full-time equivalent posts before the Brexit-specific recruitment of upwards of 21 staff takes effect. Science Foundation Ireland has 47 staff, 46.5 whole-time equivalent posts, before Brexit-specific recruitment of two additional staff takes effect while the Health and Safety Authority has 167 staff, which we will be increasing by two additional staff to deal with specific Brexit issues. IDA Ireland has 21 additional staff resources to enable it to meet the jobs and investment targets, as set out in the strategy Winning: Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019 and to meet the global challenges. The agency has also submitted a further staff resourcing strategy and has sought sanction for the retention of the 35 staff members who were hired on the three-year fixed term contracts under the winning abroad programme. An allocation of €2.75 million was made for extra staff, nine extra staff members for IDA Ireland and 39 extra staff members for Enterprise Ireland since Brexit was announced. With regard to Deputy Smith's issue, I will talk to IDA Ireland. Deputy Smith was at the meeting held in my office with the Cavan-Monaghan Oireachtas Members, the county councillors and the Senators from the area.

Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise offices and IDA Ireland are engaging on an ongoing basis with all client companies regarding the impacts being felt as a result of Brexit. They have clear plans in place to mitigate challenges and maximise opportunities arising from the UK decision. In 2017, I secured additional moneys, both current and capital, as a strategic response to Brexit. I have a particular focus on the trade implications for the Border region and am heavily engaged with all stakeholders in the region on an ongoing basis. InterTradeIreland also has a programme of initiatives to deal with the practical consequences of Brexit for cross-Border trade. The regional action plan for the north-east and north-west area, which has a strong Brexit focus, aims to support 28,000 new jobs across counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth. There is strong progress to date, with 5,600 more people in employment across the region since the start of 2015. Brexit is a standing item in the implementation meetings on the regional action plan for jobs in the north-east and north-west area.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	372	I thank the Minister for her response. It is particularly important that the Government is aware of the challenges posed by Brexit for counties such as Donegal because of its geographic location and the fact that over 95% of the county's border is with Northern Ireland as opposed to bordering the Republic. There is no doubt that Brexit poses a significant challenge for the whole island but especially for Donegal where the challenge is even more pronounced. On the work of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, there must be a significant stepping-up of the efforts to attract employment into the county, particularly by IDA Ireland. The visit numbers in recent years have not been what they should have been. I would like to see the Government and the Minister work with IDA Ireland to ensure that at a national level, companies are given the opportunity and every incentive possible to invest in the county. I want to raise a particular issue with the Minister concerning cross-Border workers. There are some 14,500 people who, on a daily basis, travel between the North and the Republic. More than 8,000 workers and students from Donegal travel into the North while some 6,500 people travel from the North to the Republic. Nearly 7% of Donegal's working population are employed in Northern Ireland. What is the Government doing to ensure that the issue of cross-Border workers can be safeguarded in light of Brexit and to address the concerns of those people?
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	373	I thank the Deputy. While he asked me to set up a committee to look at this issue, I can tell him we have a very strong regional action plan for jobs implementation group there. I have met them and they are absolutely working hard to ensure they land jobs in the region and that the jobs that are already there can be sustained. The Deputy made reference to IDA Ireland site visits. Of course, we all want site visits but it is very difficult to make chief executives and senior management go on site visits if they do not want to. It must also be remembered that when jobs are being created they are often within existing IDA Ireland companies. I assure the Deputy that IDA Ireland will work very hard to ensure those jobs are created in the north-west region. I do not believe we need a committee, as we have an excellent implementation group there that is making sure the regional action plan for jobs is implemented. I am very aware of the cross-Border workers issue. I am sure the Deputy has heard the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Theresa May speak of the importance of the Border and to make sure it is frictionless. That is what we will be doing, to make sure it is easy for people to conduct business and for students to cross the Border on their daily school trips. We will ensure this will be a hugely important negotiating issue in the run-up to the Brexit negotiations.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	374	With regard to the commentary we have seen so far on the Border issue, especially from Prime Minister May and domestically about not having a return to the borders of the past, it does not count for a lot. If one drills down, nobody is clear on what they are talking about. As I have outlined previously to the Minister, 7.5% of workers in Donegal actually work in Northern Ireland.They have very real concerns about the post-Brexit scenario. I have no doubt things will move very fast from now on, with the legislation having been passed last night in Westminster. The Government must make every effort to identify what the situation is likely to be in terms of cross-Border workings and put in place the resources to deal with that. Will the Minister undertake to consult strongly with the organisations that are already doing work in the area? Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council, for example, have done a great deal of preparatory work and investigation regarding the impact of Brexit. We need a clear plan of action on which we can work in co-operation with our European and British counterparts to ensure that the agreement that emerges is suitable. I emphasise the importance of achieving a particular designation for Northern Ireland within the Brexit context, working with the State on the basis of an all-island economy. We must ensure counties like Donegal do not suffer as much as is likely if a hard Brexit takes place.

I recently hosted a meeting near the Border at Carrick-on-Shannon at which the matters identified by the Deputy were raised. The meeting was attended by more than 250 small and medium business owners, as well as IDA Ireland organisations and representatives of IBEC and the Small Firms Association. We will be fighting hard to achieve a frictionless Border. As the Taoiseach has said, that is one of our main priorities as the negotiations on Brexit begin. I am very much aware of the concerns of the 7.5% of workers in County Donegal whose daily lives would become intolerable if there is a hard physical Border.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	376	My question relates to the remit of the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in respect of funfair and fairground equipment. The funfair business is a huge industry which affects many communities as the operators move from town to village, and there are major implications for the health and safety of children arising from its activities. Does the Minister have any plans to review the role of the HSA in this regard?
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	377	I am pleased to have an opportunity to address this important question. Public safety as regards fairgrounds and theme parks is regulated by the Planning and Development Act 2000, which requires the owners of fairground equipment to have a valid certificate of safety under the aegis of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is currently reviewing issues in regard to safety at funfairs, theme parks and community events. I look forward to the outcome of that review. The Health and Safety Authority, which is under my remit, is the national statutory body with responsibility for ensuring the provisions on workplace health and safety set out in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 are implemented so that those affected by work activity are protected from work-related injury and ill health. The 2005 Act places a range of duties on undertakings and individuals to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of employees. The authority does not have any statutory responsibility for ensuring the health and safety of users of fairground equipment. Nor does it have any role in the regulation of public safety where the operation of funfair equipment used by members of the public is concerned.

The report outlined the inadequate statutory provisions relating to the capacity of the HSA to investigate the incident. Has the Department initiated a plan of action to address this serious issue? In the United Kingdom, there is a large body of documentation setting out guidance on safety practices at fairgrounds and theme parks, which we do not have here. If we look at best practice abroad, there is clearly a gap between the standards applying in this State and what is being done in other jurisdictions. Do we have to wait until somebody dies or will the Department move to address this matter? Is the Minister of State aware that my party has published legislation which seeks to address concerns in this area?

The Deputy is correct that there is a gap in this area which needs to be addressed by all concerned. There are two relevant items of legislation here, namely, the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. As I said, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has initiated a review of the planning legislation. We sympathise with all those involved in accidents of this nature. Theme parks did not really feature when the legislation was introduced. I have written to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and asked him to bring on board officials in the labour relations section of my Department and the HSA so that we can work together to see what can be done. These issues are relevant to other settings such as sports events and other public events. I expect to hear from-----

They need to focus on building housing and tackling homelessness. It is a pity they did not adequately oversee building standards when they should have done. I reiterate that this is a huge industry and our eyes have been off the ball for too long. It is particularly urgent given it is children who are most at risk. We have a range of policies on child welfare, including Children First and all that goes with it, and it is important we close this gap without delay. I hope our proposals will be brought to the House in the near future. I am asking the Minister of State to bring a degree of urgency to addressing this matter. Will he agree to meet representatives of the Irish Showmen's Guild, which is the representative organisation for funfair and theme park operators?

That is why I have written to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, asking him to address the review of section 289 of the Planning and Development Act in an inclusive way which allows for input by my departmental officials and the HSA. We must work together to find a solution that addresses the concerns raised by the Deputy.As the Deputy will be aware, the operator has to get a certificate every year and there are nominated engineering staff who provide that through the local authority. There is a gap and it will be addressed. I am treating it as an urgent matter. I assure the Deputy it will be dealt with. I will keep the Deputy and the House updated on recent accidents. As the Deputy states, there are many funfairs, events and festivals all over the place. Accidents can happen and we need to deal with it.

#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	384	Regional development is a top priority of mine and I am determined to help drive job creation all over Ireland. Increasing and sustaining foreign direct investment, FDI, outside of the main urban areas represents a vital part of this. IDA Ireland's strategy for 2015-2019 includes a commitment to increase FDI in every region outside Dublin by 30%-40%. The 2016 results show that IDA Ireland is actively working towards this goal with 52% of all jobs created by the agency's clients last year based outside of Dublin. Site visit statistics also indicate that progress is being made towards this goal. In 2016, there were 638 IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits nationwide, up from 565 in 2015. Locations outside Dublin accounted for 55% of these visits.  It should, of course, be remembered that site visits are of limited value in projecting future investment, as most investment comes from an expansion of existing company activity. To attract more FDI to the regions, IDA Ireland must maintain an adequate supply of marketable serviced land and buildings that can be offered to potential investors. There are currently 23 vacant IDA Ireland-owned properties which are available for investment. If such properties were not available it would significantly diminish the agency's ability to win mobile FDI, particularly for regional areas. I emphasise that IDA Ireland is actively encouraging clients to locate in regional locations. The final decision, however, always lies with the company concerned and can be influenced by many different factors including access to talent, proximity to transport hubs and the suitability of local infrastructure.

The Minister quoted some of the figures and I will rehearse a couple back to her. In 2016, County Cavan had only two site visits and County Roscommon had only one. These are two counties out of 26 and it is abysmal for them to receive only three site visits. The greater Dublin area attracted 45% of all visits. The capital is effectively getting half of the attention from IDA Ireland. IDA Ireland's first objective is to try to get companies to come to Ireland and then it has to try to ascertain where can it fit them in or what location it can sell to them but we must focus on attracting companies to locations outside of Dublin. The spillover effect from Dublin will not wash for the communities outside of Dublin. We need more targeted measures.

For example, in 2016, the site visits to County Clare, about which the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen will be delighted, numbered 18; while those for counties Galway, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Limerick - the Deputy's native county - Louth, Sligo, Waterford and Westmeath numbered 42, eight, ten, eight, 49, 24, 20, 17 and 36, respectively. The Deputy mentioned Cavan, for which there were two visits. Certainly, there are regional site visits but it is rather silly to be talking about site visits here as we should be talking about jobs created. As I noted earlier, jobs often are created in companies located in the county anyway. One should not equate a site visit with job creation.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	387	I would not agree that it is silly. In fact, it is silly of the Minister to call it "silly". Site visits are the step on the road to new job creation. There are 23 vacant IDA Ireland properties around the country. The availability of serviced sites was mentioned by the Minister but the availability of serviced office space is imperative and we are falling behind in that regard. IDA Ireland has an advance facility programme whereby it builds ready-to-go facilities. We need to ramp that up. We need to look at alternative mechanisms of funding that such as, for instance, a public private partnership or whatever the Minister can come up with to provide ready-to-go office space for these companies outside Dublin. It is a big challenge for these target FDI companies to come in and engage in the planning process and all the other headaches that go with that. I ask the Minister to talk to IDA Ireland about ramping up the advance facility programme and rolling out a far more ambitious building programme to have ready-to-go facilities for companies outside of Dublin.

Those in Galway, Limerick and Dundalk, as well as a further one in Galway, will start their design stage in 2017. Those at Athlone, Carlow and Waterford will follow. Returning to my earlier comment, job creation is far more important than any site visit. For example, in 2016, the number of jobs created in County Clare, which is a regional and rural area, was 295. The job creation figures in 2016 for counties Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Limerick, Louth, Mayo, Sligo, Waterford, Westmeath and Wexford were 145, 1,896, 186, 291, 1,634, 453, 181, 190, 697, 185 and 171, respectively. Those are only the IDA Ireland figures. I can also call out all the jobs that have been created in Enterprise Ireland's client companies. It is not a matter of site visits.

This question is about keeping jobs. We discussed this last week, both the future for Ardmore Studies and the jobs, hundreds directly and thousands indirect, that are dependent on the studio. I seek an update as to what the Minister has done and what she knows about the efforts to secure the future of Ardmore Studios as a working film studio and to maintain the jobs and its critical importance in the Irish film industry.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	392	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 17 together. Ardmore Studios is a commercial entity, owned 68.33% by private interests and 31.67% by the State. The State's shareholding is managed by Enterprise Ireland, EI. Enterprise Ireland inherited the stake from NADCORP, the former State investment agency, in 1986. As a passive investor, EI has no enterprise development role in Ardmore or any involvement in its day-to-day operations. While Enterprise Ireland offers supports to exporting companies involved in film and the creative sector, policy responsibility for the development of the film industry rests with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys.The sale of the Ardmore Studios is a commercial decision by the owners of the studios. Ardmore Studios is being placed on the market for sale as a going concern. Enterprise Ireland has not placed any preconditions on the pending sale of Ardmore Studios due to the existence of planning restrictions on the site which safeguard its use as a film-making studio into the future. Wicklow County Council has recently confirmed to me that it agrees to maintain the film-only zoning as a matter of policy. At the appropriate time, any proposal requiring a decision on the sale of Enterprise Ireland’s shareholding will be reviewed by Enterprise Ireland in consultation with me, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. In turn, I will consult the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.

To take up the last point, will she give us a commitment that not only will she consult the Cabinet but she will also consult the Dáil on any decision about the disposal of Ardmore? While I welcome the fact the Minister is talking about it as a going concern, and I obviously welcome the commitment of the county council to retain the zoning, which would mean it cannot, for example, be sold off for housing, if we do not definitively secure its future as an operating film studio, zoning can change further down the line. That, in itself, does not secure its long-term future. While I take the point that Enterprise Ireland is not in the business of running film studios, the State has to make a clear commitment that it is going to maintain the studio. There needs to be joined-up thinking between Creative Ireland and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in terms of understanding that the Government has to guarantee its future. If necessary, if we cannot get a buyer, we should think about the workers buy-out proposal or the State buying over the rest of the shareholding.

It is also zoned for film production. The only way that can change is if the councillors in County Wicklow vote for that rezoning to be changed. I held a meeting with the county manager and many of the representatives from Wicklow County Council, as well as with the Wicklow Oireachtas representatives. I also met the workers and I have given them a commitment that it is for sale as a going concern. I have also given them a commitment that the Action Plan for Jobs for that region contains a plan to develop film. If that is in the action plan, why would I make sure not to do that in regard to the sale of Ardmore Studios? I, like the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, want to see a viable film industry at Ardmore Studios.

With regard to a different but linked enterprise, will the Minister revert to me with information on the level of support the Department or its agencies have given to the development of Troy Studios in Limerick, which is also in the film business?

What I am saying is that while the retention of the film-only zoning is very much to be welcomed, in itself it does not guarantee that somebody will come in and buy it, and keep it as an operating studio. I would like to have further confirmation that, if some outside buyer does not come in with a guarantee to retain it as a working studio, the State will commit to do whatever is necessary to retain it as a working studio. I hope somebody comes in, and I know the workers also hope that, because the problem is then solved. However, if that does not happen, we could have a problem. We need to have a plan B, which means looking at options like the possibility of supporting a workers buy-out or, if necessary, the Government buying the rest of the share and having the studio retained and supported under public ownership.

I have met him on two occasions already on the issue of Ardmore Studios. I will send Deputy Niall Collins the information in regard to Troy Studios. In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, we have a very viable film industry in Wicklow. For example, Irish films have taken an impressive €145 million at the worldwide box office in 2015 and 2016. Like Deputy Boyd Barrett, I hope some good, reputable film production company buys that site. I am not sure the State would be able to manage film production studios in any way.

At the end of November 2016 the unemployment rate in Wexford was 18.4% and it rose to 18.7% by the end of January 2017, so it is getting worse in Wexford while the national average is improving. The Minister might be planning to tell me about the 200 new jobs in the south-east but they are in other counties, not in Wexford. Is the State going to take hands-on action to deal with the fact Wexford is now one of the most deprived counties in the country?
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	403	The Action Plan for Rural Development is part of the wider cross-governmental Action Plan for Jobs process.  The regional Action Plans for Jobs, published by my Department, will feed into the Action Plan for Rural Development. Through these plans, IDA Ireland aims to increase foreign direct investment in each region by 30% to 40%.  In the south-east region, which includes Wexford, this will be achieved through measures including the development of advance facilities, new marketing initiatives and a campaign to encourage Dublin-based multinational companies to establish satellite offices in the region. The number of IDA Ireland-supported site visits to Wexford has increased to seven in 2016. While this increase is news in itself and evidence of increased interest in investing in Wexford, it is important to note that data on site visits are not necessarily an accurate measure of the level of FDI activity in a region or county. A better measure of FDI activity is IDA Ireland’s record 2016 results. IDA client companies created 18,627 jobs during the year across a range of sectors. Every region of Ireland posted net job gains, with FDI jobs in Wexford increasing from 2,486 in 2015 to 2,630 in 2016, an increase of almost 6%. These were IDA Ireland-supported jobs.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	404	As I told the Minister, the figures show unemployment is rising in the county. The Minister spoke about seven site visits, which is the lowest number of visits to any county in the south-east, even though Wexford has the worst unemployment in the south east and the second highest population.There are ten FDI companies in Wexford, which is low. From 2010 to 2015, there were 12 IDA site visits to Wexford. It was easy to increase from there. We received fewer IDA visits than any other county in the south east, despite our terrible unemployment rate. People do not seem to realise that we have one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, the highest suicide rate, one of the highest rates of rent supplement payment, one of the highest percentages of people who have no formal primary education, and one of the lowest rates of people completing third level education. The Government must take positive action to deal with it. It is a special case. Wexford, Donegal and Longford are the three most deprived counties.

The point is that the unemployment rate in Wexford this week is 18.7%. Where in the country is there a worse rate. There is no point even talking about the youth unemployment rate. It is way up in the high 30s. It is madness. The Minister is living in cloud cuckoo land if she thinks the problem is being addressed. It is not. I am not saying it is the Minister's fault. For many years, the Government has neglected the country. Might the Government consider taking a different look at it, given that it needs special attention?

The last time the Deputy raised the question, I invited the Deputy to meet the implementation group. They are very willing to meet. The group includes the chief executive of Wexford County Council, representatives of the IDA and LEO, and business partners. It has helped create jobs across the county. We are focused on the south east. I am aware that it was a black spot, however jobs have been created. It is still 2% below the national average. We will ensure jobs will definitely be created. I ask the Deputy to work with the south east implementation group.
#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	408	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Canney. In November 2012, I spoke here on the same issue. I described the situation then as critical and severe. Since then, there have been promises of funding, work and solutions. Yet, all that has been done has been makeshift barriers paid for and constructed by locals in fear of their lives of being swept away. During the past week, we have had high tides and easterly winds. Social media and online news sites show videos of waves crashing over Clontarf promenade and dramatic seascapes in Dublin Bay last week. What failed to get any attention was the further washing away of the dunes and remnants of the broken boardwalk on the Burrow beach in Portrane. Portrane is near here. It is a lovely part of Fingal, a picturesque part of the Dublin region. There are videos on Facebook showing live and in real time the power of the sea and how close it is getting to homes and businesses in Portrane. If the situation was critical and severe in 2012, it is nothing short of an emergency now. In 2014, the OPW made funding available for works to protect dunes in the Burrow, Portrane. The then Minister of State, former Deputy Brian Hayes, visited the location to see the destruction of the dunes. I ask the Minister of State to come out next week, if possible. I would love him to see it first hand. It would be helpful to him in coming to some conclusions about it. I am outraged that Fingal County Council did not draw down the funding. Fingal County Council would refer to some confusion on it. I am seeking an urgent meeting with the council next week to discuss its role in finding a way forward. The residents of the Burrow are annoyed at what they see as a total lack of interest in their plight on the part of the council and the Government. I ask the Minister of State to take a direct role in protecting the community of the Burrow in Portrane. I want him to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation and allocate a senior official to work with Fingal County Council to install urgent measures to deal with the worsening situation in Portrane. I know of no other community which is so close to being breached and washed away. We cannot continue to bang our heads against the brick walls of Government or local government to find a solution. We need direct action now. Funding must be found to deal with the situation. We have had studies, plans and strategies but no meaningful action. Residents have filled one tonne bags with sand to provide a barrier. They toiled hard on many mornings to fill these bags, knowing these efforts would be in vain once a serious storm hit the beach and the high tides returned. Those bags have been rendered useless. They were breached last week. The sea has reclaimed dunes and land and there has been no help from the authorities. We need direct action by the Government, and we need it now.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	409	I thank Deputy Brendan Ryan for raising this important matter. Coastal erosion is a natural and ongoing process which takes place around the entire coastline. Coastal erosion may threaten human life and infrastructure, such as roads, and may undermine and cause damage to properties. However, it should be recognised that coastal erosion also has beneficial effects to the local environment, such as providing natural nourishment and supply of sediment to adjacent beaches. The primary objective of Government policy on coastal protection is to ensure that in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss of economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding, appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by local authorities to protect those assets and, where such measures are economically justified on cost-benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they are implemented subject to the availability of resources. The OPW has undertaken a national assessment of coastal erosion, including erosion rates, under the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study, ICPSS. The results of the study have been published on the OPW website. The study has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline, and the information is available to all local authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature.The local authority may carry out structural protection works using its own resources. If necessary it may also put forward proposals to the relevant Department for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat. Since intervention within a coastline area may cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal erosion risk management study that has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of management options. Portrane was assessed under the Fingal East Meath flood risk assessment area study as a coastal area for further assessment. The detailed engineering analysis found that no properties were at risk from coastal or fluvial sources in this area for further assessment, AFA. Therefore, optional assessment was not undertaken as it is designated an AFA of low risk in the draft flood risk management plans. The Office of Public Works operates a minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection schemed, under which applications for funding from local authorities are considered for up to €500,000 in each instance. Funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is made available for projects which meet the eligible criteria. Fingal County Council applied for and was approved funding of €57,800 under the scheme in 2012 to carry out a coastal erosion risk management study at Portrane to Rush which included Burrow beach. The funding was drawn down in 2013 following completion of the study. Following the severe storms of the winter of 2013-14, total funding of €200,000 was provided by the OPW to Fingal County Council under the Government decision for repair works to coastal protection infrastructure, which included projects at Burrow beach. The OPW has published guidelines for coastal erosion risk management measures and funding applications under the minor works scheme available on the website. I assure the Deputy that the OPW will continue to work with Fingal County Council to address coastal erosion issues in the county over the coming years having regard to the available resources and in the context of the framework for State investment in this area that I have outlined.

I know the material has been provided. It simply is not the case that the area is of low risk and there is no home at risk. That is why it is important for the Minister of State to come out and have a look. I feel as if I am repeating myself from four years ago. The works previously carried out to safeguard the sand dunes on this coast line were done in good faith and with the best intentions but they were not long-term solutions. Comprehensive and possibly cross-departmental approaches are required to provide the best possible protection for this coastline. We need to ensure that all possible solutions are given consideration and that a long-term solution is put in place. A coastal erosion study was carried out, as the Minister of State indicated. Hard and soft engineering solutions were assessed but no meaningful action was taken and no progress has been made. In fact, it is worse than no progress as it seems things have gone backwards. The clock is ticking and the tide is moving in. I do not know anyone from Burrow who has any faith left in the institutions of the State to protect their homes. The people of Portrane are not only concerned; they are at breaking point. The have witnessed the ongoing erosion of their coastline and can visibly see the dangers they face. They will be appalled at the reply the Minister of State has read out. They do not want their concerns to be dismissed on the basis of negative cost-benefit ratio analysis. The council says that no money has been forthcoming at national level to fund solutions. I walked Laytown beach lately and could see robust rock-based protective measures in place to deal with what was obviously a similar problem. Therefore, it can be done. Most of us look at weather forecasts to decide which coat to wear or check the times of high tide to go fishing. However, the community in the Burrow, Portrane check these forecast to see if they will have a home the following day, contrary to what the report of the Minster of State claims. Are we going to wait until we are dealing with homes disappearing into the sea before we address this issue? Are we going to allow the situation to develop to a point of catastrophic emergency? I hope not. I hope there is no policy of managed retreat at play. This is a serious matter and it needs urgent attention. This matter must be addressed with the urgency it deserves.

The studies were done and money was provided. I suggest that because the local authority and the Office of Public Works are involved in this area, I ask that the local authority meet the officials of my Department to see what projects can be done. While it is okay to suggest spending money, I note we simply cannot spend money willy-nilly when a study is done and the cost-benefit analysis is not proven.

The Minister of State is probably well aware that in 2015, many areas in east Cork were totally destroyed. The main road from Cork to Waterford was blocked for several weeks. The area I want to speak about specifically is an area in Midleton, namely, Towns Park, Mill Road, Midleton. I brought to the attention of the Minister of State a catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study carried out in 2013. It advised on the measures to address flood risk in this area and in Towns Park, Midleton, in particular. The area was subsequently flooded leaving three homes completely uninhabitable. This means three families cannot live in those houses to this day. I hope the Minister of State will be able to answer my question. The CFRAM study cost a good deal of money. I have read the study on numerous occasions. I provided the Minister of State with two copies of it, one to his pigeon hole and another by hand. Page 16 of the report predicted where the flooding would materialise. The report estimated the volume of water, which reached heights of over 1 m in the area at the time. Pages 26 and 27 of the study proposed preventative recommendations and measures. Recommendations included a landscaped embankment and the associated costs for carrying out the works. The range was between €15,000 and €25,000. That is not a great deal of money in comparison with two two-storey homes and one bungalow. If possible, can the Minister of State tell me who is responsible for carrying out these works? Who has sole responsibility for ensuring these studies are acted upon? Why were the recommended preventative measures not carried out?

I want to start by assuring all communities, including those living in Cork, that the Government is actively planning and taking every feasible measure to manage flood risk. Ireland is more prepared than ever to tackle flood risk from the significant investment being made to tackle flooding. This investment includes 38 major projects completed at a cost of approximately €285 million, resulting in 7,700 properties being protected. A total of 11 flood defence schemes are currently under construction. Five are due to be completed this year protecting a further 2,000 properties. A total of seven schemes are scheduled to commence this year and a further 20 schemes will continue at the design and development stage. A further 6,100 properties in more than 400 locations are being protected from localised flooding completed under the OPW's minor works scheme. A further 200 projects have approved funding. An area of 650,000 acres of agricultural land is protected through the programme of maintenance of 11,500 km of river channels by the OPW. Planning guidelines have prevented building on flood zones since 2009. The CFRAM core strategy for addressing significant flood risks nationally is the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme. A total of 300 areas at potentially significant risk of flooding nationwide, selected as areas for further assessment, have been assessed under the programme, the purpose of which is to implement the EU floods directive and national flood policy. For the purposes of the national CFRAM programme, the country has been divided into six regional study areas, including the south-western and Shannon CFRAM study areas, including the two AFAs, Milford and Charleville, which are within the Shannon CFRAM. There is a total of 35 AFAs in Cork city and county.The CFRAM programme is the largest flood risk management planning programme ever undertaken by the State. To date, the CFRAM programme has included detailed modelling and mapping in each of the 300 AFAs, including surveying and modelling of 6,700 kms of channels; the publication in 2015 of approximately 13,000 individual flood maps for public consultation; and over 400 public consultation days held in the AFAs throughout the CFRAM programme at which the CFRAM teams met and consulted with local representatives, residents, business owners and community groups at key stages on the flood maps and potential solutions. It has now identified feasible flood relief measures to provide protection to 95% of flood risk properties in the 300 CFRAM areas. The details are set out in 29 draft flood risk management plans which I have published since July 2016 for public consultation, which is now complete. The national CFRAM programme is being undertaken by the OPW in partnership with its consultants, local authorities and other stakeholders. Cork County Council has been actively involved and has fully participated in progress groups and advisory groups for the CFRAM study. The OPW has also on two occasions made presentations to elected councillors on the draft flood risk management plans, one at the beginning of the study and most recently on 16 September 2016. The current position on the CFRAM study is that the draft flood risk management plans are now being finalised, taking into account the important and constructive submissions made through the public consultation held in 2016. When this process, scheduled for spring 2017, is completed, a prioritised list off feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, will be drawn up to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective way. The plans will then be submitted for approval to the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform and subsequently for adoption by the local authorities. In the Cork area, while the Government is committed to prioritising future planned investment by the benefits that accrue, it has to be acknowledged that Cork has already benefitted and continues to benefit from significant investment. Only a few weeks ago I launched the public exhibition of the planned Cork city scheme. This is the largest flood defence scheme ever constructed in this country. The major capital investment commitment, which the Cork city flood relief scheme represents, is part of the significant capital funding envelope of €430 million which has been allocated to the OPW to spend between 2016 and 2021. The Cork city scheme will add to the very significant programme of investment in flood relief in Cork. Two further schemes are under way in Bandon and Skibbereen and six further schemes are planned for Blackpool, Glanmire, Douglas-Togher, Clonakilty, Ballymakeera and Midleton.

I thank the Minister of State. I have developed a bit of a knack of speed and power reading so I will get to it straight away. The answer is very welcome and I welcome these major projects. I also welcome the minor ones. In the conclusion of the Minister of State's written reply, he says in the last line: "In the interim I am satisfied that the identified and assessed flood risk in Cork is being appropriately addressed." However, it could not be addressed if we are doing CFRAM studies that are not being acted on. It goes back to my question. This study, which came out in 2013 and was sanctioned by Cork County Council, tells us exactly where the flooding was going to happen and what the preventative measures were but nothing was done. This is only one particular study and there are a number of studies out there. We have three families that have not been in their homes since 2015. There have been no preventative measures. It is grand telling us what will happen, how to prevent it and getting us the plan and telling us the cost but it is then shelved. If that will happen with this one, I feel something else will happen. I know it is not directly the fault of the Minister of State but I need to get answers for these people because it is very unfair and unjust that this has been sitting on somebody's shelf after so much money was spent saying exactly what happened and what will happen. It happened and three families are now homeless.

In the interim, I am satisfied that the identified and assessed flood risk in Cork is being appropriately addressed. CFRAM is a process that has been going on for a number of years. When there were reports prepared, they had to be tested and modelled and maps had to be drawn. The answer I have given the Deputy sets out that the CFRAM process is now coming to an end. When that process has been completed, 300 projects will be ready to start. They will be taken in a prioritised order based on a lot of different criteria. It is a major structural plan for flood relief for the next ten years. What has been done is unprecedented. What has been done has taken about two years off the planning process of any of these projects. Every project I have seen that has been done in the past has taken six to seven years to bring from inception to construction. We will now be short-circuiting that. Of course, in the meantime, people have flooded. We will not get to everybody in the same day. If I was to follow the Deputy's logic, as soon as a report becomes available, we would jump in and do something. I have great sympathy for people who flooded. They flooded all over the country. It is as a result of the volume of rainfall we get. I must assure people in the public that flooding is being dealt with in a coherent way at long last. We have a whole-of-Government approach to this and we will be dealing with each of the areas once they are approved by the Minister.

For those who perhaps are not acquainted with the condition, it is a very serious one. It has a very serious effect on people's lives and restricts their future hugely. Not only are they unable to regulate their own sleep patterns but their personalities can change drastically. There are around 70 to 200 estimated cases in the country. The State says there are between 70 and 100, but the Society of Unique Narcolepsy Disorder, SOUND, estimates that as many as 200 people of the 800,000 who were given the Pandemrix injection have this condition. It is quite hard to assess the number of young people and teenagers, in particular, who have this condition because many of the symptoms are often misidentified as hormones or changes in the lives of teenagers and young people. It is quite hard to quantify the number of people it affects. What we can say is for those who are diagnosed it is a very serious condition. Without help or treatment, those who are affected by it can have greatly reduced potential in their own lives. There are no cures but things can be made more manageable. One of the only true ways of diagnosing it is through a multiple sleep latency test, which must be done in a special overnight sleep test facility. Currently, there is only a handful in Ireland, with the Mater Hospital being the most used. There is no public sleep centre in Ireland. For people under 16, Temple Street hospital is often used. We are unique in Europe in that we are the only country without such a facility. Such a facility was committed to as far back as 2012. Funding was pledged for it. As such, I am bringing forward this Topical Issue to ascertain exactly where we are on that. It is my understanding that critical decisions are being made now on the allocation of budgets. I have a few specific questions. Is the funding still in place? When will the project proceed? Are there timelines in place for its delivery? Has hiring of the specialists who will be needed for such a facility commenced? I understand that a leading expert in this area, Dr. Catherine Crowe, is involved in this and she has said there is a clear link between the Pandemrix vaccine and the condition. She and a great many others who are involved, and even people such as Mairead McGuinness, MEP, have highlighted the urgent need for Ireland to bring about this facility, fund it and to address this important problem. I would appreciate if the Minister of State would give me an update on that.

Narcolepsy is a chronic brain disorder and people with this disorder experience periods of extreme daytime sleepiness and sudden, irresistible bouts of sleep that can strike at any time. These sleep attacks usually last from a few seconds to several minutes. I acknowledge the impact on the 1,500 to 1,600 patients with narcolepsy in Ireland. Narcolepsy can greatly affect daily activities. People may unwillingly fall asleep while at work or at school, when having a conversation, playing a game, eating a meal or, most dangerously, when driving or operating other types of machinery. In particular, I am aware of a specific group of individuals who claim to have developed narcolepsy as a result of receiving the Pandemrix vaccine during the 2009 influenza pandemic. Many of this group were children at the time of their diagnosis. As many of the patients are now becoming adults, there have been calls from advocacy groups recently for the setting up of a centre of excellence for narcolepsy based in St. James's Hospital, which would include a nurse specialist, a dietary service, a psychological service and a full service between St. James's Hospital and the children's hospitals. A business case for a service for adults with narcolepsy was submitted by St. James's Hospital as part of the overall 2017 Estimates process. St. James's Hospital is part of the Dublin Midlands hospital group. Any proposals for the funding for the narcolepsy clinic in St. James's Hospital have to be considered as part of the hospital group's overall priorities for services across the group and with regard to resources available. While no developmental moneys have been allocated for this proposal in the HSE's national service plan for 2017, I understand that work is under way on the proposed centre of excellence. It is a priority for the Department of Health and the HSE that the individuals and families affected by narcolepsy receive appropriate health and social care supports. Therefore, my Department engaged with the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection to ensure the provision of a range of services and supports on an ex gratia basis. The HSE's advocacy unit acts as a liaison with other service providers and Departments to facilitate access to required services. It is in regular contact with the individuals affected. Regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals by providing advice, information and access to local services. The ex gratia health supports include clinical care pathways to ensure access to rapid diagnosis and treatment; multidisciplinary assessments led by clinical experts; counselling services for both the individuals and their families; discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed to allow unlimited access to general practice care and any prescribed medication; ex gratia reimbursement of vouched expenses incurred in the process of diagnosis and treatment; and physiotherapy, occupational therapy assessments, dental assessments and dietary services all on a needs basis. I again acknowledge the impact on the lives of these people and their families affected by narcolepsy and reiterate my commitment to the ongoing provision of appropriate services and supports.

I know that, like myself, she cares about those who are affected by this condition and that she places a great deal of emphasis and importance on resolving this issue. Even though this condition affects a relatively small number of people, it has had a serious impact on their lives. As the years are progressing and as these people are getting older, we are beginning to see how it has a deep impact on their lives. I welcome the Minister of State's response. I am grateful that progress is being made. I would like to see more progress being made throughout the year. I would appreciate if I could be kept updated on this matter because it is an important one for the families to whom I have spoken. I will speak to them again having got the Minister of State's response and I hope they will be satisfied also. I believe we are making progress on this important matter. If the required level of progress is made, I will be delighted with that, but if it is not, I will be happy to raise this issue again in the future.

This project has been ongoing for ten years. As I mentioned previously, its unfinished town centre development is not a great addition to or advertisement for the town or a great sign of it being a case of business as usual in the town. Naas was one of the best business towns in the country. It has been severely hampered as a result of the stalled development of its town centre site. In recent times a number of businesses have closed and now there are rumours of other businesses closing. This has all come about as a result of a lack of footfall because people need to have a reason to come into the middle of the town, to want to stay in it for a while and to be able to conduct their business there. Despite that this issue should have exercised the minds of those in the Department with responsibility for the environment and in the Department with responsible for local authorities, and I am sure that it does, it has not done so successfully. Having brought this issue to public attention on more than one occasion, I am now getting to the point of beginning to become impatient. They say that everybody has a limit to their patience but to beware of those who lose their patience. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, for coming into the House to take this matter. I realise that the Minister and the Minister of State in the Department with responsibility for the environment are not available for reasons over which they have no control. The raising of this Topical Issue matter gives me a unique opportunity to lay down what I believe needs to be done now as a matter of urgency. The Minister and the Minister of State with responsibility for the environment need to call together the players involved, get them around a table, inquire of them what is happening and why matters have not progressed at a greater rate than they have heretofore. If an opportunity was ever presented to people who want to get on with this business, now is the time given that the rural development programme was recently announced and it presents an ideal opportunity to become involved in the badly needed redevelopment of the town of Naas.  As I mentioned previously, the visual appearance of a business town or any town has a significant impact on what happens in that town. While developments are taking place in large supermarkets adjacent to the town and drawing people into those areas, it is to the exclusion of the particular area to which I am referring. The business people of the town have been concerned about this matter and they will begin to lose confidence and to worry about what is happening and if the town centre will be left as it is. Naas is not a town down in the far end of the of the country and obviously people are very concerned about what is happening in those areas and anxious to ensure their towns are reinvigorated, but Naas town is within 25 miles of the centre of this city. There is no excuse for allowing the current lethargy to continue. Now is the time to electrify all those involved, to bring them all together and let them tell us exactly what is happening and why we have not seen a situation arise in the recent past whereby somebody would have said it is time we got something going here again.

I thank Deputy Durkan for raising it. As indicated in previous replies to parliamentary questions and in previous Topical Issue debates, the management of stalled development in Naas is a matter for Kildare County Council in the first instance. With processes under way involving NAMA and arbitration, it would be improper for the Minister to become involved. Nonetheless, I am informed by Kildare County Council that the securing of a satisfactory conclusion to the development of the Naas town centre site has been a particular focus of its efforts over the past number of years. In this context, the council, on foot of arbitration procedures, has successfully completed an agreement with one of two site owners relating to the provision of roads infrastructure to service the Naas town centre site. The arbitration case relating to the second site owner remains to be heard by the property arbitrator. Kildare County Council understands that the hearing in this case is scheduled for April 2017. In parallel with these arbitration cases, Kildare County Council has also been involved in ongoing discussions with the owner of the Naas town centre site and his agents with a view to advancing development of the site as early as possible. The council continues to encourage both the financial institutions that have a controlling interest in the site and the owner of the site to either apply for planning permission for development on the site or to offer the site for sale on the open market. This matter was discussed at a meeting in Kildare County Council on 25 January 2017, and I am informed that there has been no change in the position since the Minister's last reply to Deputy Durkan on this issue. The appointment of proper arbitrators is a matter for the Land Values Reference Committee, as provided for under the Property Values (Arbitration and Appeals) Act 1960. While I have no function in this matter, it is understood from the committee secretary that, as regards resources available to deal with arbitration matters, there is currently one full-time property arbitrator and, following a competitive process undertaken by the Courts Service on behalf of the Land Values Reference Committee, seven part-time property arbitrators were retained from 25 August 2014 on contract to be available to undertake arbitrations where, due to conflict of interest or volume of work, the permanent arbitrator was not in a position to undertake the arbitration. I understand also that the full-time property arbitrator was assigned to deal with the application that is the subject of the case raised by the Deputy and that the reference committee understands that the matter has not been held up by virtue of the arbitrator assigned. I am sure that if the Deputy requires further information on the matter, the committee, if contacted directly, would be happy to engage with him.

I say simply this: the time for action has come. We have done all the talking. This has been going on for ten years, and that is long enough. The softly-softly approach adopted by the local authority is no longer acceptable. The local authority is deemed to have all the responsibility in this area. Therefore, it is time to bring all the bodies together and find out who is stalling, why the stalling is taking place and why it has gone on for so long. We have already waited too long. There are several property arbitrators, as the Minister of State said - at least seven - all helpers. If there is a problem or some logjam in that office, we should deal with it now. There is no use waiting for another ten years. The Leaning Tower of Pisa has drawn particular attention to a certain part of Italy, with great acclaim and great admiration. The leaning towers of Naas have brought nothing but ridicule to us, as public representatives, and, through no fault of the people who live there, to the town itself. I do not care whose feelings get hurt in this business. Enough is enough. Time marches on. It is time now for those who have responsibility to come forward, make a clean break and let something start as and from now. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue again, I thank the Minister of State and I appreciate the Acting Chairman's forbearance in the course of the debate. However, I hope I do not have to bring this matter to the attention of the House again. Enough is enough. Now let us see some action from all those who are responsible and who are doing the town of Naas a great disservice.

I understand his frustration regarding the fact that the issue has gone on so long but I assure him that I know how a town centre can be a magnet for communities and can draw people into it. However, as indicated earlier, it would be inappropriate for the Minister to become involved or make any further comments on the matter while a number of processes are under way. Regarding the availability of only one individual arbitrator across the entire State and the insurance backlog, the Minister has no role in this matter, and I am informed that my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, has no official role in the matter either. The appointment of a property arbitrator is a matter for the reference committee. This is a statutory committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the president of the High Court and the president of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland under the Property Values (Arbitrations and Appeals) Rules 1961. It is the reference committee that is charged with appointing one or more persons as property arbitrators. I again concur with what the Deputy has said and I will bring his concerns to the attention of the Minister, who, unfortunately, could not be here this evening.

Tá áthas mór orm bheith i mo sheasamh anseo mar bhall den choiste airgeadais, mar bhall de Shinn Féin agus mar ionadaí poiblí. Tá sé feicthe agam thar na blianta an dóigh ina gcaitheann cuid mhór comhlachtaí árachais leis na gnáthdhaoine. Tá sé seo le feiceáil ó thaobh mótarárachas, mar shampla. Níl daoine áirithe ábalta clúdach árachais a fháil dá gcuid tithe nó dá gcuid gnóthaí agus iad i mbaol tuilte. Is léir go bhfuil na comhlachtaí árachais ag plé go scannalach leis na daoine seo le blianta anuas. The House has discussed the issue of motor insurance previously and has made it clear that the industry is not fulfilling its side of the arrangement, whereby the private sector is given sole responsibility for insurance. We have also seen areas in which the insurance industry behaves despicably when, for example, it fails to insure households and businesses that are not even likely to be at risk of flooding as a result of a 100-year event. Another issue relates to the contracts individuals enter into in terms of how the balance is shifted towards the companies as opposed to the consumer. This legislation, the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017, attempts to provide a level playing field. The Judiciary has been crying out for this legislation and has found itself, time and time again, siding with the insurers because it must follow the letter of the law but has expressed time and time again regret to the consumer in doing so. The question we must ask revolves around why there is a need for this Bill. As a Parliament, we have the power to act. We make the law within which the insurers must act. At least, we should be doing that but, in fact, decades and even centuries of complacency have left us with laws on insurance contracts that are hundreds of years old and no longer fit for purpose. I previously won support for a Bill I introduced that would have ended the six-year rule, by means of which consumers were banned from taking complaints in respect of financial products sold to them more than six years ago.More recently, I won support in respect of support for tracker mortgage victims. Now this Bill can mark a huge win for consumer protection when it comes to insurance claims. I wish to acknowledge the work and expertise of the Law Reform Commission in producing the report on this Bill. Its report, published in 2015, makes a powerful argument that reform in this area is long overdue.  In its 2011 report the Law Reform Commission quoted the expert Buckley who said, referring to a code of conduct for the insurance industry a code of conduct, or statement of self-regulatory practice, is not a substitute for reform of the law. The need for reform is confirmed by the very existence of the code and by the recent repudiation of it in open court by a major insurer. For decades, the need to legislate has been identified. There is no reason to delay any more. I hope all Deputies can support my Bill and bring about that reform. This is a medium length Bill but it is dense in content. Section 1 Bill defines a consumer along the lines used for the purposes of the Financial Services Ombudsman jurisdiction and the consumer protection code. There are valid arguments why in other contexts such as the Financial Services Ombudsman scope why this definition might be considered too broad. While in that case the argument is that very large companies can access the Ombudsman when the commercial court might be more suitable, in this case I believe the definition is well suited because small and medium enterprises are the core beneficiaries here alongside the individual consumer. The section also defines an "average consumer" and "fraudulent misrepresentation" and other technical terms used throughout. The purpose of section 2 is to clarify the relationship between this Act and other Acts already in force, such as the Marine Insurance Act 2015. No provision of these Acts applies to contracts covered by this Bill. Section 3 allows the Minister to make necessary regulations and the Central Bank codes as required. Section 4 allows any such code of practice to be admissible for consideration by the Financial Services Ombudsman, a court or any other adjudicating bodies. Section 5 abolishes the outdated concept of "insurable interest" with only a very small exception where the contract is also a contract of indemnity. Insurers would no longer be able to avoid a claim because after the fact they decide that the insured had no interest in the policy. Here we see how out of date some of the existing law provisions are. The "insurable interest" concept goes back to naval insurance and was designed to prevent gamblers or speculators from betting on the non-arrival of ships at their destinations. In 2017, however it has the effect that where for example a child would take out insurance on the parent's home because for whatever reason the parent deems it not necessary to insure the family and subsequently the home burns down the child would not be able to make valid claim because he or she has no insurable interest despite having paid premiums to the insurance company for many years. Modern contracts have developed beyond the point where such gambling would be profitable or exploitable. The Bill therefore abolishes the concept of "insurable interest" and replaces it with a legislative provision suitable to the modern day. Section 6 is one of the most important aspects of the Bill. It shifts the burden of disclosure away from the consumer and to a degree places the responsibility on the insurer to asks questions. What is more, the questions the insurer asks must be in plain, intelligible language. On average, although the detail is confidential, we know that duty of disclosure features in nearly 100 cases a year that the Financial Services Ombudsman deals with. Again, outdated concepts that work only in favour of the insurer such as utmost good faith are replaced. The invisible duty of the consumers to volunteer information that they know is relevant is removed. This is a real shift in the power relationship between consumer and insurer. All the duty and obligations are shifted from the shoulders of the consumer. The consumer must, of course, answer all questions honestly and with reasonable care. Section 7 flows from section 6. It introduces the concept of proportionate remedies for misrepresentation. In layman's terms a small omission with little material impact should not lead to a complete refusal of a claim. Common sense and proportionality must come into play. A simple innocent misrepresentation should not lead to families and businesses being left completely empty handed when a fire breaks out or some other insurable event occurs. Consumers who are found to be negligent in the information given likewise are to be treated proportionately under the legislation. Again, the key is proportionality. This section ensures mistakes or even negligent replies to questions do not lead to a blank cheque for insurers to avoid all responsibility. It is a question of balancing the power relationship between consumers and insurer. Section 8 tidies up what forms and paperwork that must be supplied to the consumer. The various provisions around this scattered throughout different Acts are collated together into the Bill. The clarity in the section about the exact information to which the consumer is entitled benefits the consumer. Insurers must make this documentation intelligible to the average consumer. If there is any dispute over language the benefit of the doubt lies with the consumer. Section 9 allows a 14 day cooling off period for non-life insurance and 30 days for life assurance contracts in which consumers can withdraw from a contract without penalty. There are some sensible exceptions such as very short-term contracts. There are already some Acts regarding consumer credit where a cooling off period is in place. The concept is one that favours the consumer and should be included in insurance contract law. Section 10 puts into law the obligations of an insurer regarding renewals. The 15-day notification period is already found in regulations and it is sensible that it is being placed in primary legislation. The main focus of this section is in listing the information that insurers must make available in the case of life insurance policies. This list includes surrender and maturity values, investment growth and charges deducted among other things. This approach could be considered for non-life insurance too given the darkness motor insurance consumers can be kept in regarding the reasons for some of the massive increases that seem to be popping up for consumers in that sector. I would be willing to consider amendments on Committee Stage if this Bill passes Second Stage. Section 11 brings the duty of the insurer into the twenty first century when it comes to cancelling a contract because of, for example, failure to pay. The duty will now be on the insurer to make sure the cancellation notice has been received. This can be an e-mail or text message as long as there is proof that it was received. Section 12 is linked to section 6 and carries the logic of putting the onus on the insurer to ask the questions and not the consumer to guess which information he or she should be volunteering. A renewal does not mean the consumer has to give additional information unless explicitly requested to do so. Many individuals would not be aware that when they renew their insurance contract they are entering into a new contract and many of their insurance contracts will require them to give additional information. Failure to do so will mean that the insurance company will not pay out on the claim. In this section the insurance company will have to ask specific questions to be answered by the consumer upon renewal if it wants additional information. The Law Reform Commission report gives an example of why this is important. A more extreme example arose in the High Court decision of Hanna J. in Flynn v. Financial Services Ombudsman and Allianz Plc, where the respondent insurer had declined to indemnify the appellant under a household policy on the basis that he had failed to disclose, at the renewal of the policy, that he was facing pending criminal charges in relation to alleged possession of cocaine. Although the charges were subsequently dismissed, the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, held that the pending charge was a material fact that should have been disclosed to the insurer. In the High Court, Hanna J. dismissed the appellant's appeal on the basis that the correct test of materiality had been applied by the FSO and that the insurance contract in question had converted the non-disclosure into a "basis of contract" warranty. Hanna J. added that it was "regrettable" that the appellant who stands wholly innocent of the drugs charges which were levelled against him, must find himself in a position where he cannot recoup insurance on a premises seriously damaged in wholly innocent circumstances. That is how bizarre our insurance laws are today.It is completely unjust that an individual who does not inform his or her insurance company when he or she is renewing his or her insurance contract that charges are pending against him or her in respect of untrue allegations can lose €200,000, €300,000 or €400,000 if his or her house burns down because the insurance company is able to walk away without having to pay the claim. This legislation fixes that. Section 13 is important because it removes much of the ground which insurers can use to avoid paying out. It takes the logic of the duty of disclosure to changes in circumstances. It distinguishes between cases in which there is a new risk about which the insurer did not originally know and cases in which there is an alteration of risk. In other words, a house insurer will not be able to refuse to pay out after someone's house burns down on the basis that he or she did not mention that he or she lights candles in his or her house. However, substantive changes made without the insurer’s knowledge that would have changed the decision on whether to insure the house are still grounds for a refusal to pay out. Section 14 deals with what happens after an insurable event occurs. This means that the duties of the consumer to co-operate fully and respond to reasonable requests from the insurer are provided for in law. In return, the insurer is legally bound to pay out in a reasonable time period. In addition, neither party can hide any information it has that might be relevant to a decision on compensation. Section 15 allows the consumer to seek extra compensation if the insurer unreasonably delays a valid claim. It asserts the principle that insurers do not have to pay out on fraudulent claims, but, importantly, it does not allow for a party making an innocent claim to have that claim disallowed because a second party may have acted fraudulently, for example, in a joint claim. Section 16 deals with warranties which have been described in the courts as vicious devices and traps for the unwary. I refer to the small print used to prevent legitimate claimants from receiving compensation. Until we pass this Bill, insurers will continue to have the power to include in contracts so-called "warranties" which form the basis of a contract. These warranties have rightly been criticised by the Judiciary. In an infamous case the court found in favour of an insurer after a pizzeria had burned down because there had been some waste on the premises. That was enough to trigger an avoidance of the claim because it was in the small print that all waste should have been removed from the premises at night. Warranties should be abolished and replaced with specific reforms. That is what is being dealt with in this legislation. I will give an example. There may be a condition or a warranty in a contract of home insurance which requires the homeowner to maintain a burglar alarm at his or her premises. If the house burns down after the burglar alarm had malfunctioned for a period of time before subsequently being fixed, an insurance company can refuse to pay out, even though the burglar alarm had nothing to do with the fire at the property. Section 17 places an onus on the insurer to bring to the attention of the consumer terms that might be considered "unfair or otherwise". Such terms need to be explained in order that they are not hidden. Section 18 concerns the right of a third party to make a claim directly against an insurer in certain cases; for example, where the owner of a shop has passed away or where a shop is in liquidation. In such cases the insurer would be treated in the same way as the insured party. Sections 19 to 21, inclusive, cover the issues of subrogation or substitution. Insurers will no longer be able to step into the shoes of a family in certain circumstances. For example, if a home has been damaged by a visiting relative, the insurer will not be able to sue that relative if the family do not wish that to happen. Exceptions are built into the legislation. Wilful damage, for example, is excluded. Similarly, an insurer cannot seek to go after an employee who causes damage to an insured party, unless it was done on purpose. The Bill codifies the common law "recovery down" principle for the distribution of funds where subrogation is used. This Bill is what we need. It is about moving forward. It is about a new culture that will protect consumers from banks and other financial institutions. We need only look at the laws we have, some of which date back to the 1870s, to see that this is required. Some of them were introduced to deal with the 19th century practice of gambling on whether the cargo of naval ships would be landed in port. These are the laws judges are currently under an obligation to pass and adjudicate on. It is time for us to do what the Judiciary is demanding by bringing our laws into the 21st century. I hope all Members of the House can support this legislation.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-02-09 00:00:00	Hospital Waiting Lists: Statements	443	I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017 which was introduced by Deputy Pearse Doherty in the Dáil on 19 January. I will begin by expressing my support in principle for the objectives of the Bill which is aimed at reforming and modernising the law on consumer insurance contracts. Like cré na hÉireann, we are creating common ground. As Deputy Pearse Doherty outlined, the Bill is based on the Law Reform Commission's 2015 report on consumer insurance contracts. The rationale for the Law Reform Commission's review was that insurance contract law principles and rules had been developed in the 18th and 19th centuries when insurance contracts involved wealthy landowners and ship owners. There was a need to review these principles and rules to determine their appropriateness in the 21st century. Of particular concern to the Law Reform Commission is the current state of the bargaining powers of insurers and consumers. Most insurance contracts are concluded between large corporate bodies, with vast resources and expertise, and consumers with limited financial, technical and other resources. The Law Reform Commission concluded that while recent EU and domestic legislation on the regulation of insurance contracts had benefited ordinary people and small businesses in Ireland, there was a need for further reform and that the relevant provisions should be consolidated into a single statutory framework. It undertook extensive research which culminated in a report with 105 recommendations, including the abolition of some laws and their replacement with specific legislative measures. Draft legislation to give effect to these recommendations was included in the report and provided the basis for this Private Members' Bill. The Government agrees that the Bill is relevant to the lives of virtually all citizens. A contract of insurance is something that most, if not all, of us will enter in to at some stage of our lives. This is particularly clear in the light of the wide range of areas of insurance cover, including motor, health, property and business insurance. The research of the Law Reform Commission which plays an important role in Ireland’s legal landscape reflects this wide scope. I take the opportunity to thank the commission for its work and acknowledge the high quality report it has produced in this complex area. I understand the report is the result of a number of years of work and follows a consultation process involving the consumer protection side of the Central Bank of Ireland, the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation as the Department responsible for consumer protection matters. The Department of Finance did not participate in this process and, therefore, had no opportunity to work with the Law Reform Commission while it was completing its report. Since the publication of the report, the Department of Finance's priority focus in the insurance area has been on a range of issues such as a review of the insurance compensation fund legislation, flood cover and the cost of insurance project. While some consideration has been given to the Law Reform Commission's report, up to now it has not been a matter of priority. Nevertheless, the Government supports what the Bill is trying to achieve and we intend to engage constructively in advance of Committee Stage. The wide-ranging scope of the Bill covers many issues which the Government acknowledges have caused an immense amount of frustration for many ordinary policy holders, including small businesses, when dealing with insurance companies. One of the key issues addressed by the Law Reform Commission which is recognised in the Bill is the imposition by the current law of onerous requirements on the consumer to disclose information on which a hypothetical prudent insurer might rely when deciding whether to insure him or her. By definition, this requires the consumer to try to anticipate what the insurance company needs to know, even if he or she is unsure what information is relevant. Consequently, it puts the insurer in a position where it can refuse a claim if it has not received a full and complete disclosure, even in circumstances in which such information, if it had been disclosed, would have had minimal or no impact on the decision to provide cover in the first place. The Bill proposes to replace the current pre-contractual duty of disclosure imposed on consumers with a statutory duty to answer carefully and honestly specific questions posed by an insurer that identify the material risks and the relevant information relied on by the insurer. Directly related to this is a provision that proposes to provide for proportionate remedies for innocent or negligent mistakes by consumers, while continuing to allow insurers to be able to repudiate liability completely in cases of fraud. Other provisions in the Bill include its application to insurance contracts between insurance companies and individual consumers or SMEs with a turnover of less than €3 million. The concept of insurance warranties is being replaced with statutory provisions allowing insurers to include provisions that precisely identify or define the risk insured but which also protect consumers from unfair and unjust outcomes. As Deputy Pearse Doherty mentioned, in the example given by the Law Reform Commission a consumer wrongly warranted that a particular type of burglar alarm had been installed - this is referred to as the "basis of the contract" - and the premises subsequently burned down as a result of faulty electrical wiring. In such a case, an insurer would probably be able to repudiate liability under the policy, even though there was no connection between the breach. The requirement for a consumer to have an insurable interest in the risk insured is being abolished and replaced with legislation that requires a consumer to prove actual loss when making a claim and also applies the principle of indemnity to ensure a policyholder cannot make a profit on any claim. The Bill also permits third parties intended to benefit under an insurance contract to make a direct claim against the insurer. It reforms and modifies the current laws governing subrogation in order to avoid unintended consequences for family and employer-employee relationships. Subrogation is the means by which an insurer can step into the shoes of a policyholder after it has paid out on a claim in order to take action to recover the compensation from the person responsible for the claim being paid out in the first place.The Bill would replace the post-contractual duty of good faith with specific statutory duties, including a duty on consumers to pay premiums within a reasonable period and a duty on insurers to handle claims and complaints promptly and fairly. It would also adapt the existing legislation on unfair terms for insurance contracts and include the consolidation and reform of existing legislation to ensure policyholders receive clearly written information on the essential terms of the insurance contract, including policy documents. As indicated at the outset, the Government is supportive in principle of the Bill and willing to engage constructively. As part of this process, however, we must be able to develop a better understanding of its potential impact on consumers and insurers. The one certainty about this Bill is that it is legally complex and cuts across a number of fundamental and well-established legal principles such as subrogation, for example. We, therefore, need the time to closely review it in order to ensure that there is no unnecessary replication of existing provisions and no unintended consequences arising from its implementation. The type of elements we will have to consider include what elements of the Bill are currently catered for in the Central Bank’s consumer protection code, which is an important tool in the protection of consumers and needs to be considered in full, and any legislative developments since the publication of the Law Reform Commission’s report, which will require an analysis of whether any the provisions of the Bill are already on the Statute Book. If they are, it would be superfluous to address them once again through legislative means. We must consider whether any provisions in the Bill conflict with current legislation, as appropriate amending legislation would be required in that case. For example, there may be some repetition between the Bill and SI 74 of 2007, (Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) Regulations 2007. We must consider whether any provisions are likely to add unnecessary legal complexity and may result in higher litigation costs, as well as the work of the cost of insurance working group. There is potential for the recommendations in the report of the working group to overlap and if this is the case, the work will need to be streamlined to avoid duplication or conflict. For example, the working group report contains recommendations on providing additional information on premium breakdowns to consumers and an extension of the notification period for renewals. We will also examine developments at European Union level since the Law Reform Commission concluded the 2015 report. For example, the Insurance Distribution Directive was agreed in 2016. This directive will replace the insurance mediation directive 2002/92/EC, which was transposed by the European Communities (Insurance Mediation) Regulations 2005. It applies to the entire insurance distribution chain, which includes both undertakings and intermediaries, with intermediaries being distributors who are not reinsurance undertakings selling directly. The main aim of the directive is to facilitate market integration by the enhancement of retail insurance regulation and increasing the level of policyholder protection. It will also seek to identify and mitigate conflicts of interest, in particular in the area of commissions, and strengthen administrative sanctions. The Department of Finance has commenced its transposition work, which is required to be done by February 2018, with some transitional provisions applying until February 2019. Several Departments and agencies will need to be involved with this process. For example, while the Department of Finance is responsible for insurance regulation, it will be necessary to engage with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to gain its perspective on consumer protection matters. Engagement will almost certainly be required with the Department of Justice and Equality, which I understand has responsibility for general contract law-related matters in order to ensure there are no unintended consequences on the broader contract law area. In addition, the Central Bank will play a central role given its expertise in the area. The Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau must also be consulted. It should be noted that the Central Bank has provided some high level views on the Law Reform Commission’s report in which it expressed broad support for the recommendations in the report. However, it has raised concerns that some elements of the recommendations may prove legally difficult to implement and may result in increased litigation and costs. Thus, given the nature of the reforms being proposed, they need to be given proper consideration and analysis in order to ensure that we get the legislation right. The Government supports the Bill in principle but due to its complex legal and wide-ranging nature, along with the breadth of its impact, an in-depth review of the Bill will be necessary. This will take a certain amount of time and I would be grateful, therefore, if the Deputy could take this into account when thinking about the scheduling of the Bill for Committee Stage. It should also be noted that the Government is likely to submit substantive amendments on Committee Stage.

Insurance has a direct impact on the security and peace of mind of individuals and businesses, large and small throughout the country. It is essential for providing people with protection and security against the risks of everyday life. As we know, the insurance market in Ireland is dysfunctional in many respects. As far back as the collapse of PMPA, there have been serious issues with the insurance market. More recently there was the collapse of Setanta, where three years on, over 1,600 claims are still unsettled. Last year, Gibraltar-based Enterprise Insurance Company collapsed with 14,000 motorists left to find alternative insurance. The customer has faced exceptional increases in motor and health insurance premiums over the past number of years. We have long been calling for the Government to act on the rising cost of motor insurance. In 2014, motor insurance premiums increased at an annual rate of 11.6%, while in 2015 the rate rose by 30.8%. In the 12 months to August 2016, motor insurance increased by 28%. We have seen similar increases in the health insurance market. With motor insurance, we have welcomed the recommendations from the Government's working group and we now eagerly wait for action on this issue. In addition, we have had issues regarding flood insurance, whereby insurance is been denied to people and businesses where flood protection has been installed. These are just some of the issues with the insurance market in Ireland. It is in this context that the Law Reform Commission began to look at the legal area surrounding the insurance contract. In July 2015, the commission published a detailed and comprehensive report on consumer insurance contracts. This Bill, brought forward by Sinn Féin, essentially mirrors the output from the Law Reform Commission. We commend Sinn Féin on bringing it forward and the Law Reform Commission on its work in this area. Fianna Fáil will support this Bill on Second Stage and will engage constructively thereafter, bringing forward amendments if appropriate. The commission's report brings together a vast array of law ranging from legislation to court judgments, many of which date as far back as the 16th and 17th centuries. The commission produced recommendations that would consolidate existing law and update it for the 21st century. One of the key areas identified by the Law Reform Commission was to abolish what is known as insurable interest. This concept dates back to the 18th century and it stipulates that a consumer must have an identifiable interest in the property or risk being insured. This means that a consumer would not be able to obtain compensation if he or she did not own or had no interest in the property. Even in a case where loss has been established, compensation would not be payable because of the concept of insurable interest. The Law Reform Commission recommended the removal of insurable interest and replacing it with a law that requires a customer to prove actual loss, applying the principle of indemnity. This would make it a fairer system for the customers, whereby they are compensated for loss, and the insurers, whereby they are protected from the consumer making a profit on the claim. In many cases compensation is not paid to a customer because of pre-contractual duties and obligations to disclose any information that may affect the risk of damage or loss. The Law Reform Commission in its report recommended the removal of this standard and replacing it with statutory pre-contractual requirements for both the consumer and the insurer. Under this proposal, as set out in section 6 of the Bill, the consumer will only be required to disclose information that is directly asked for by the insurer and the questions set out for the consumer cannot be general in nature. The consumer is still obliged to provide truthful and detailed information in response to the questions asked by the insurer. This has the potential for clearing up a grey area whereby a consumer can be punished for not providing an exhaustive amount of information at the pre-contractual stage. The recommendations from the commission also extend to circumstances whereby the consumer unintentionally fails to disclose certain information. Under the current system, there is an all or nothing approach whereby if the consumer does not disclose certain information, he or she will not receive compensation, even if the omission was made in good faith or unintentionally. This is unfair to consumers as certain misrepresentations are innocent or negligent. Not all misrepresentations are done intentionally or fraudulently. However, it is important to note that the recommendations from the Law Reform Commission do not remove all the protections for the insurers. In the case of fraudulent misrepresentation, the insurer will not have to pay compensation. Section 8 of the Bill deals with the form of the contract of insurance and the information to be provided by the insurer. The information to be provided by the insurer to the customer includes the subject matter of the insurance and the risks covered, the sum insured and any deductibles and the method of calculating the premium. In addition, the insurer would need to outline the right to revoke the application or terminate the contract. This will make the contract of insurance more accessible and clear for the consumer, which is to be welcomed. Sections 9, 10 and 11 deal with the right to withdraw from the contract of insurance, the renewal of the contract of insurance and the cancellation of the contract of insurance. These sections clear up many issues around the signing and renewal of insurance contracts. Section 9 in particular would require a cooling off period of 14 days for non-life insurance and 30 days for life insurance. This would allow the customer to carefully consider all the issues before signing the contract of insurance. Sections 12 and 13 cover the duties of both the insurer and the consumer at the renewal stage and in the post-contractual period.This deals with any new information the insurer wishes to obtain at the point of renewal and the alteration of risk that occurs during the post-contractual period. At the moment it is unclear what information the consumer must declare at the point of renewal. This increases the risk for the consumer of mistakenly not disclosing certain information. With section 12 any new information required by the insurer must be asked specifically from the customer. Sections 14 and 15 deal with claims handling and the duties of the consumer and the insurer. This would stipulate that a consumer must co-operate fully with the insurer in the investigation of the insured event. This is a strong tool for the insurer in cases where the consumer is un-co-operative. It would also compel the consumer to report an insurable event in a timely manner and would compel the insurer to process the premium promptly. This is essential as we have witnessed cases where insurers take a considerable time to pay compensation. Section 17 would protect the consumer from the insurer inserting unfair or onerous terms in the contract of insurance. This section has regard to the strength of the bargaining positions of the insurer and the consumer and whether the consumer had an inducement to agree to the term. Subsection 4 outlines specific items that would be deemed unfair or onerous on the consumer. This section would be an essential tool to protect consumers from insurers placing terms in the contract that are overly unreasonable. The remainder of the Bill deals with the right of third parties to claim against the insurer and the subrogation by insurance companies. In summary, the Bill brings together and updates the law that is currently disjointed and outdated. We will support the passage of this Bill through Second Stage and will engage constructively on Committee Stage and, if appropriate, we will bring forward amendments. We believe the work of the Law Reform Commission was extensive and detailed and the recommendations, if enacted, would be good for consumers and insurers alike. Let us make no mistake. This Bill, if enacted, will not solve the problems individuals experience with the current insurance market. They are continuing to experience exceptionally large increases in their premiums, whether it be motor insurance or health insurance. Small businesses and households will continue to struggle to get flood insurance in areas where flood protections have been installed. We simply have not seen the urgency from Government in addressing the main issues involving insurance in this country. This Bill, if enacted, will not solve all the problems but it will help solve some issues in the market surrounding the insurance contract.

It is in line with the Government priorities in our focus on the insurance area to date. Much work has already been done recently by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, relating to the review of the framework for motor compensation and the publication of that review. A transposition of Solvency II is taking place. Work has been ongoing in respect of flood insurance. We have seen the publication of the report of the work on the cost of motor insurance. The implementation of that report has begun. Each of these segments of work along with the Bill Deputy Doherty has introduced will help us to deliver what we want to see, that is, a stable properly functioning insurance market that delivers fairer premiums and contracts for consumers without any unnecessary delay. We will engage constructively. We believe it will take some time to consider each of the elements of the Bill. It is likely that we will have substantive amendments on Committee Stage. We support the Bill in the move to Committee Stage.

I imagine the others who did not use their slots are fully satisfied with the legislation and took the view that they had no need to make comments in the Dáil. We will take their absence as consent. Indeed, that is what the legislation does. If people do not answer the question, then the insurer waives the right to hold that against a customer in a court of law in terms of voiding the contract. We can take the fact that others have not said anything as agreement with the legislation. I wish to remark on comments by the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy. His comments are sensible and right. We are under no illusions: this legislation is the culmination of a large number of years of work by the Law Reform Commission. In 2011 the commission produced the first report. In 2015 the report which is the basis for this legislation was produced. We have engaged with the Law Reform Commission in respect of the changes to subsequent legislation since the publication of the Act. We have accommodated the changes into the Bill as presented. There needed to be detailed scrutiny of this legislation. This is not legislation that will affect only one sector or a group of individuals. This will affect every person in the State, if not now, then at some point in future. It will have an effect when people renew motor policies or house insurance or life insurance. This legislation will have a serious impact on those events. The legislation states that, upon renewal, customers will no longer be required to furnish information to the insurer unless the insurer asks specifically for information. Moreover, that has to be done in plain and simple language. It has wide-reaching effects. It balances the scales in terms of the consumer. There is no doubt about it. However, it is not something the insurance industry should be overly fearful about. We have cited cases in terms of the burglar alarm. The Minister of State referred to a similar case in which a customer is warranted. A customer does not see the term “warranted” on the insurance contract, but it is under the terms and conditions. People must maintain a type of burglar alarm. If the alarm is not maintained and the house floods, then the customer cannot claim. Worse, if the burglar alarm was broken for six months, then was repaired and was working again and six months later the house burned down, the insurance company could still void the claim. To be fair to the insurance industry, under its code of practice it says that is not acceptable and that only if it was a reason for the risk relating to the claim in the first place should it be acceptable. Only in the case of theft would a company decide not to pay out because of the burglar alarm not working. However, that has not always been the case. I referred earlier to a quote from Buckley. One large insurance company went to court in contravention of the industry's own codes. That is why there is a requirement on us as legislators to ensure that practices widely accepted in the insurance industry as unfair are no longer allowed to be part of codes and dependent on the goodwill of insurers but are provided for in law. That is the intention of the Bill. Consultation will need to take place with the Central Bank, the Financial Services Ombudsman, the insurance industry and advocates for consumers. This is wide-ranging and affects millions of people across the State. It is long overdue. I note what the Minister of State has said in terms of the scheduling of the Bill. I will keep that in mind as we deal with this in the committee. My intention is to work with other parties, including the Minister of State and his officials who have a depth of knowledge, while conscious of the other work the Minister is bringing forward, particularly in respect of motor insurance. I suggested that we could consider amendments to one of the sections which could enable this Bill to be a vehicle to deal with some of the implementation of the measures the Minster of State intends to bring forward. I thank the Members for their support for this legislation. When enacted it will be a major step forward in terms of consumer rights. I commend all those who have worked on the legislation in the Law Reform Commission over a substantial period. They carried out the consultation and looked at the practices internationally and produced the first report. They developed the second report and the legislation. I thank my own staff, including Declan O’Farrell, who helped me to bring the Bill to this point.

The relevant committee for this Bill is the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. Does the Deputy wish to move the motion of referral now?
