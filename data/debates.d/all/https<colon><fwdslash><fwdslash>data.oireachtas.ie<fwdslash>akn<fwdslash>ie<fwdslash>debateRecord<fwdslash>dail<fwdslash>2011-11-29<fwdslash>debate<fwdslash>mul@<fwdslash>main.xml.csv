#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Section 124 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 sets out the mechanism by which increases or decreases of the television licence fee may be determined.  In particular, it allows for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, to recommend in a report to the Minister an annual licence fee modification.  This recommendation is to be based on an annual review on the extent to which RTE has fulfilled its commitments in respect of its public service objectives stated in its annual statement of performance commitments for that financial year and the adequacy, or otherwise, of public funding to enable the corporation to meet its public service objectives.A review of RTE's 2009 public service commitments and adequacy of funding was carried out by the BAI and submitted to my Department in December 2010.  The authority recommended there be no modification made to the licence fee with which I formally agreed.I expect to receive the authority's review of RTE's 2010 public service commitments and adequacy of funding in the next fortnight.  This review will contain a recommendation from the authority on a licence fee modification.  I look forward to examining this review and its findings on the adequacy of funding in RTE.  This review will inform any decision I may take, in conjunction with the Government, on adjusting the current level of the television licence fee or otherwise.  Any such decision will be informed by any relevant decisions taken in the context of the budget.In making any decision on television licence fee modification, I will need to be mindful of the impact such a modification would have on the recipients of net television licence fee receipts.  The legislation provides that I pay approximately 88% of net television licence fee receipts to RTE, 7% to the BAI in respect of the broadcasting funding scheme for public and independent broadcasters and 5% to TG4 in addition to its direct grant-in-aid from Exchequer funds.  I will also be very mindful of the impact on persons who pay the licence fee.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThe broadcasting sector in general, including the public broadcasting sector, has been facing a challenging funding environment over the past several years with a large fall in commercial advertising revenues.  As regards public sector broadcasters, this situation behoves them to be vigilant on cost containment while trying as far as possible to mitigate the impact on output and programming.  I acknowledge that both RTE and TG4 have been proactive in this regard but the efforts must be maintained and indeed intensified.In addition to the statutory requirement for annual reviews of the public service broadcasters, section 124(8) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 requires the BAI to also carry out a long-term forward looking five-year review on the adequacy, or otherwise, of the funding of public service broadcasters not more than three years after the passing of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  I look forward to receiving this review, which is due to be completed by the authority by mid-2012 at the latest, as it will assist in informing any policy decisions I may take on the future public funding of public service broadcasters.

Does he also agree that given RTE can pay exorbitant salaries to both staff and contractors at the top end — I do not refer to ordinary workers — and it has a surfeit of money provided by the taxpayer, it would be a good idea to give that money back to the licence fee payer rather than paying exorbitant salaries to these workers on top of the generous holidays and other arrangements they have?When the Minister speaks to the BAI regarding RTE's expenditure, will he seek a detailed outline of all the costs incurred by the station over the past year as a result of libel actions, including the awards in successful actions against the station?  Will he take action on foot of that?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Given the straitened economic circumstances in which we have found ourselves over the past three years, the Deputy is correct that any alleviation of charges, fees or levies on people generally would be helpful but he should not hold out a reduction in the television licence fee as alleviating the pressures under which people find themselves.  I am not sure that of itself it would constitute a significant mitigation of the burden.I take it that when the Deputy referred to high earning people in RTE, he was referring to a small number of contract staff because in so far as I have examined this — primarily it is a matter for the board and management of the station — it is not fair to broadcast the canard that ordinary RTE workers are paid exorbitant salaries.  That is not the case.  Some of the first impositions in terms of reductions and so on or constraints in the cost base were imposed in RTE and a severe redundancy programme has just concluded.  The Deputy is probably referring to a small number of highly paid contract staff and my understanding from the chairman and director general is steps have been taken in that regard, having regard to the contracts those people entered into in the profligate years.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Every little would help the licence fee payer and every small reduction would be a help.  If the fee increased a little, many people would say that would be a big imposition and, therefore, it is important if it comes down a little.I agree it is only a small number of staff at the top of the pyramid, as is the case in all these organisations, who receive large payments.  Some are PAYE staff as I understand the figures and others are contractors.  However, this was only a device to break the pay guidelines.  Let us not cod ourselves; these people do not bring anything to the job except themselves.  I am talking about them and, in my first question, I specifically excluded the ordinary staff in RTE.  Will the Minister take steps to ensure licence fee money is not paid to condone pay levels that are totally out of line with the industry norm?  Other broadcasters do not offer anything like the salaries or conditions RTE provides.  Will the Minister ensure in return for the licence fee income that these salaries are brought down to the average across the industry nationwide rather than remaining at the exorbitant levels we have at the moment?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	4	It is important to bear in mind that broadcasting is suffering the same stresses and strains as the economy in general.  There has been a dramatic reduction in RTE's commercial income, which is nowhere near what it was three years ago.  That is a serious development.  There has been a significant shift of advertising away from the traditional television platform and towards the Internet.  I presume Deputy Ó Cuív would share my surprise regarding an estimate which indicates that this year Internet advertising will exceed that which relates to television.  A couple of years ago, no one would have made a projection to the effect that this would be the case.  However, it has already become a reality.In addition to the stresses and strains of the economic situation, there is the convergence of technologies to consider.  These aspects all give rise to a challenge for the national broadcaster.  When he served as a Minister, the Deputy participated in a decision — it was probably a good one — to devote some €10 million from licence fees to TG4.  The sound and vision fund also benefits to the tune of 7%.  It must be recognised, therefore, that certain constraints apply.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	5	As Deputy Martin Ferris will be aware, I published the affordable energy strategy, which meets our commitment in the programme for Government, at the weekend.  This strategy will be the framework for building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty.  These include the thermal efficiency-based measures delivered through the better energy-warmer homes programme.  I am convinced, and the available research confirms the fact, that providing energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, energy poverty, results in benefits to recipients in terms of energy affordability, tangible health improvements and overall well-being.  This will be my guiding policy philosophy in implementing the 48 actions identified in the strategy.  We have identified five priority measures including a commitment to review the national fuel scheme in the context of examining the feasibility of aligning income supports with the energy efficiency and income of the home, the phased introduction of minimal thermal efficiency standards for rental accommodation, ensuring greater access to energy efficiency measures, reforming the eligibility criteria for energy efficiency schemes and framing the work of the interdepartmental agency group on affordable energy on five priority work packages.The overarching vision of the new strategy is to achieve a situation whereby households are able to afford all of their energy needs and where families live in a warm and comfortable home that enhances their quality of life and supports good health.  Improving the energy efficiency of low-income homes through permanent structural improvements is the most effective means of addressing energy affordability.  Since 2006, over €70 million has been expended on providing energy efficiency improvements in almost 76,000 homes under the better energy-warmer homes programme, which is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland on behalf of my Department.  To date this year, 16,391 homes out of a target of 20,000 have been retrofitted.  Better energy-warmer homes programme is primarily delivered by 28 community-based organisations, CBOs, which work in partnership with their local networks of poverty and community support organisations to identify and address vulnerable homes.  Private contractors are also engaged to address areas or technologies not covered by CBOs.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I thank the Minister for his reply.  The review of fuel poverty indicated that between 1,500 and 2,000 persons may have died in the winter of 2009-2010.  I am not saying they all died from lack of heating in their homes but, certainly, it was a big contributing factor.  The grant scheme that was available and operating up until now has helped in many cases to encourage people to properly insulate their homes.  If this scheme is no longer available or if Better Energy: Warmer Homes is linked to a type of loan procedure, the indications are that will not work out because those who cannot afford to pay energy bills are unlikely to participate in any scheme that seems to take further from the household income.  Would the Minister agree that the poverty of those on low income and of the elderly who do not have the money to purchase fuel in order to heat their homes or do not have the money up-front to engage contractors to insulate their homes, is a major contributing factor in what is happening?  Many are living in cold homes that they cannot afford to heat.  Is there anything in the Minister's proposal that can help such people?  I refer to low-income families.  In fact, this problem is expanding into middle-income families.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I must call the Minister to reply.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Is there any scheme that can help those who will not qualify because of income?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I agree with Deputy Martin Ferris.  It is undoubtedly the case that there are people living in the circumstances that he described.  No doubt he is correct that it has a negative impact on their health, etc.I can assure him that the grant scheme to which he refers will survive the budget.  Together with the jobs initiative announcement earlier in the year, we will have spent some €100 million this year on the retrofit programme, which will have done the job on maybe as many as 60,000 homes with the happy spin-off of providing 6,700 jobs in the process.If there is not a copy of the Affordable Energy Strategy in Deputy Ferris's pigeon hole, it should be there by tomorrow, as for all other Members of the House.  It sets out 48 specific actions with timetables for implementation.  All of the evidence shows that it is the poor standard of thermal efficiency in houses that is the single biggest contributor.  One can give as much as one likes on the fuel allowance, for example, but if the house is very badly insulated, much of it goes up the chimney.  Such efficiency is the priority and we hope to integrate it with the schemes that are there already.

That is encouraging for those who are hoping to make the improvements necessary.Regarding fuel poverty, is it possible for the Minister to intervene with the regulator regarding the prices of ESB and Bord Gáis to ensure that energy is affordable and there will be no further hikes over the winter?  The people are desperate to maintain heating for their families and, in particular, their elderly.  A ministerial intervention, if it takes that, should be forthcoming.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I am happy to communicate my view again publicly to the regulator, which is that any further changes in energy prices this winter ought to be downwards.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Yes.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I accept entirely that we are price takers in a global energy market and that gas prices, in particular, have gone up almost 30% in the last 11 months or so, which has a very severe impact on the provision of energy, including electricity.  That is a very serious situation.In reply to Deputy Ferris's question, I would hope the discussions we have been having over the past six months with the banks and the energy supply companies will lead to a new partnership between Government, banks and energy supply companies that will enable us to progress to a pay-as-you-save scheme whereby we could engage in retrofit far more widely than is the case at present and that could remunerate the cost of doing that out of the savings made in their energy bills.I have not forgotten that some six months ago or so I met the Construction Industry Federation about the role it might play in this regard, given there is a significant dimension of this that would create employment.  As I was asking him questions about the standard of heat efficiency in Irish houses, one member of the CIF said to me: "To tell you the truth, Minister, most of the houses in Ireland are only shelters from the rain."  I did not remind him that he had built a good deal of them himself, but if that is the standard, we need to address it as our first target.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is an independent statutory body.  I have no statutory function in the regulation of marketing for either the business or domestic sectors.The regulator has informed me that it is in the process of outlining procedures for clear and comprehensible presentation of tariffs to domestic customers.  The regulator requires all suppliers to put in place a marketing code of practice, setting out all their practices and ensuring that the information they provide to customers is accurate at the time of distribution.  The regulator is currently consulting on its guidelines in regard to marketing, with a view to strengthening the protection for customers.Contained in the consultation is a proposal to standardise the way in which suppliers present tariffs to customers to ensure that customers can compare offers.  The regulator also recognises that, as the markets develop, suppliers may choose to offer different products with different types of discounts and services associated with them.  In order to ensure that customers can understand and compare the tariffs they are being offered, the regulator considers it appropriate to put in place requirements regarding the presentation of tariffs.  This will ensure a level of consistency for customers when looking at different information.  The regulator is also proposing that suppliers must notify household customers of changes to tariffs 30 days in advance of the changes taking place, with the exception of where a customer has signed up to a more flexible tariff.  This is to allow customers the time necessary to shop around and consider their options in advance of any changes taking place.Furthermore, the regulator stipulates in its proposed code of practice on marketing that suppliers adopt a transparent and fair approach to the marketing of their products and services and in the arrangement with customers.  This includes ensuring that agents do not provide misleading information or apply undue pressure to any person in order to gain a customer.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseSuppliers must take all reasonable steps to ensure marketing material is easy to understand, accurate and specifies clearly the product being marketed and the period it covers.To aid the process of price comparison, the CER recently launched a system for accrediting websites that compare energy suppliers' gas and electricity prices.  Under this framework, a website providing an energy price comparison service will only be accredited by the CER if it meets defined standards, for example, in terms of its accuracy and reliability.  This will help provide energy customers with the confidence to use these websites, assisting them in "shopping around" for the best tariff deal.Price comparison websites can be an invaluable tool in helping energy customers to decide the best deal for themselves.  To assist customers in reliably comparing different energy tariffs, the new framework will accredit a price comparison website only if it meets certain prescribed standards, such as independence, impartiality and accuracy.  There will also be a monitoring system whereby any CER-accredited website that fails to meet these standards will have its accreditation removed.  This should help energy customers in comparing tariff offers and in getting the best deal to suit their needs.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I welome the Minister's announcement that the energy regulator is putting in place new procedures for a marketing code of practice etc.  This is not before time.  There are four companies operating in the gas and electricity sector — ESB Electric Ireland, Bord Gáis, Airtricity and Flogas.  These suppliers do not make it very clear that their headline offers are for new customers only, and that after the initial contract period elapses one reverses automatically to the standard prices.  There appears to be no requirement on the supplier to notify the customer when the initial offer elapses.  Thus, the supplier benefits from the inertia of people who do not have the time to clinically analyse each monthly bill to see what is happening with the rates they are being charged.  They might think their initial teaser rates are still operating when they have actually expired.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I agree with the Deputy.  It is very important that there is sufficient transparency to allow customers and competitors to compare and contrast.  The Deputy is correct about that.  Of course, this market has seen changes in recent years and there is now competition in it.  In those circumstances, it is important that there is the ability to compare and contrast and that there is adequate transparency.  It is timely that the regulator will promulgate these codes, and I welcome that.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Energy prices have already increased by approximately 25%.  Weather conditions this winter might be similar to those of last year and the previous year.  Consumers have benefited from a reduction of 20% when they switch supplier and statistics show that about 50% of them have switched.  If they get a 20% deduction, by next spring they could be facing an increase of 45% when these offers are removed.  I am sure the Minister will keep in contact with the regulator to ensure that in these straitened times customers will benefit over the next number of months to the maximum extent from the deregulated market.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I can give the Deputy that assurance.  It is the case that due to various global developments the price of the raw material being imported into this country has risen dramatically.  That has had the effect the Deputy described on domestic prices.  That will be especially difficult if we have as severe a winter as last year.  I am happy to point out that since the new Government took office the weather has improved and November this year was quite mild.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	19	REFIT 2, the next phase of the renewable energy feed-in-tariff, REFIT, scheme, is designed to support up to 4000 MW of onshore wind, landfill gas and hydro technologies.  There is also a new REFIT scheme for biomass technologies, known as REFIT 3, which will support a range of technologies, including combined heat and power, CHP, and anaerobic digestion as well as for co-firing of biomass in the peat power plants.Separate state aid applications were submitted to the European Commission in relation to these two new schemes.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that earlier this month my Department received the state aid clearance decision from DG Competition for the REFIT 3 biomass technologies application.  Government approval is currently being sought to open the scheme and once this has been obtained, the scheme will be formally launched and open for applications.  I am advised that the second state aid decision from the European Commission on REFIT 2 for onshore wind, hydro and landfill gas should be forthcoming shortly and, once obtained, I will immediately seek Government approval to proceed to open the scheme.New renewable electricity generation is supported in every member state and is necessary to underpin delivery of the European Union's ambitious 2020 renewable energy and climate change targets.  It also displaces imported fossil fuels in our electricity generation and improves our overall security of supply.  The REFIT scheme was announced in 2006 for certain categories of renewable energy, including wind and hydro power.  It received state aid clearance in 2007 and projects under the original scheme continue to build out.  There is just over 1200 MW of REFIT supported generation included in the 2011/12 PSO decision.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThe REFIT scheme was successful with Ireland achieving and marginally surpassing its 2010 renewable electricity target.  Under the new renewable energy directive, 2009/28/EC, Ireland has been set a new legally binding target of 16% of all energy consumed in the country to be from renewable sources by 2020 across the transport, heating and electricity sectors.  This is a more than a threefold increase on where we are today and will be challenging to deliver.  As set out in our national renewable energy action plan, a large proportion of the mandatory target will be delivered through the electricity sector, and REFIT will play a key role in ensuring sufficient new renewable generation is built out.The real challenge is to ensure that we are able to build out the necessary supporting grid infrastructure to enable the Gate 3 projects to develop.  Grid reinforcement plays a key role in ensuring regions have a secure and reliable electricity supply.  It is also necessary to strengthen the grid to be able to accept new renewable generation which is typically located in more remote areas that have weak grid systems.  Our ability to get this infrastructure built is critical to achieving our renewable energy ambitions.

However, I am surprised that he has not yet got word on the refit for the onshore wind energy project.  The Minister stated in the Dáil on 19 October that he expected to get that in a few weeks.  What contact has he had with the Commissioner in charge of state aids to ensure this permission will be given expeditiously?

I expected that we would have it by now.  The Deputy asked me in his question to specify the reasons for the delay and to be honest with him.  I do not know the reason it is taking so long.  I am advised we have complied with everything that has been requested from us.  The application is submitted and I presume the bureaucratic processing of these applications takes this length of time.  When we got the approval for REFIT 3 in respect of the biomass technologies approximately three weeks ago or whenever, we were then orally advised that REFIT 2 would follow on immediately.  As recently as yesterday it has not followed on.

The Minister might inform the House when the application was lodged and how long we have been waiting because it is important that this matter be put on the record.I am surprised at the relaxed attitude here.  I understand there is 1,000 MG of power ready to be commissioned if REFIT is approved which would create a lot of employment and, as the Minister stated, would ensure a huge amount of energy substitution from fossil fuels.  Was the energy Commissioner concerned that we are not achieving our Kyoto protocol commitments because the Commission is holding up the whole process?  What did the energy Commissioner say to the Minister as a justification for his colleague not getting on with the job and delivering these approvals in good time so that we can save the planet?

REFIT 2, which relates to onshore wind, is a very important aspect of our policy on the build up of renewable capacity.  The Deputy is right; there are some projects which are backed up but which I hope will proceed very quickly after we get sanction.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Since 2002, the regulation of the gas market has been the responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation, which is statutorily independent in the performance of its functions.  I have no direct statutory function for liquefied natural gas projects, including specific projects like the Shannon LNG project.I understand that Shannon LNG — a wholly owned subsidiary of the US firm Hess LNG — received full planning permission in 2008 for its proposed merchant development of a liquefied natural gas re-gasification facility near Ballylongford in County Kerry.  As a commercial project, the investment decision is a matter wholly for Shannon LNG.The LNG facility would provide additional security of supply to Ireland as it would bring diversity to Ireland's supply sources and would bring direct connectivity for the first time to the global LNG market.  The prospect of such a facility is therefore a potentially positive step for the island of Ireland.  Therefore, I strongly welcome the proposal by Shannon LNG to construct an LNG terminal.I am aware that Shannon LNG, among others in the gas industry, currently has an interest in the outcome of a deliberative process being undertaken by the CER on the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors with Great Britain.  There has been regular engagement between the CER and Shannon LNG about this matter. I have also met with promoters of the project.This issue, currently under consideration, is an extremely complex regulatory question, not least given the implications for gas and electricity business and domestic consumers.  The regulator's ongoing deliberative process in this regard is at a very advanced stage, with a decision expected to be made in the next two months.   The regulator's own process has been delayed, ironically, by the formal complaint made by Shannon LNG to the EU Commission, alleging that the options being considered in the regulator's consultation amount to unlawful State aid.

We are concerned with as many as 450 jobs to start it up.  Reports, true or otherwise, have been consistently circulating in the area that Hess LNG is on the brink of pulling out because of the possible €10 million tariff per year to use the national gas pipe network.  The regulator has told Shannon LNG that it must pay to use the gas pipeline that connects Ireland to the UK and that will cut costs by €10 million.  The parent company, Hess LNG, sees this charge as unsustainable and as a consequence, has been considering its future.  The company has invested up to €50 million in the project to date.The Minister said he expected a decision from the regulator within the next two months.  I heard in September that the decision would be in October, yet now we are at the end of November.

Will it be in two months or in the next few weeks?I assume the Minister is aware of the unemployment situation in the north Kerry area, which is more than twice the national average.  Can he comment on that?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The Deputy is right.  I did say that I expected a decision at the end of October or early November, as I was so advised.  I believe that is what would have happened were it not for the rather unusual step by the company to lodge a formal complaint with the European Commission against the process underway by the regulator.  One can understand the lodging of a complaint against a decision of the regulator but it is unusual to see an action taken against an anticipated decision by the regulator.This regulatory issue is complex.  Under the current regulatory regime the coming on stream of this liquefied natural gas, LNG, project will have implications for gas network tariffs set by the regulator.  The same applies to the Corrib field.  This, in turn, will have implications for general wholesale gas prices bearing in mind that the model is based on Irish prices following United Kingdom prices plus an additional amount for the price of transport through the interconnectors.  In an environment in which gas from the Corrib field and LNG meet some or all of Irish demand, the interconnectors built and owned by Bord Gáis Éireann would become under utilised and their proper remuneration by the reduced number of gas customers becomes an issue.  In such circumstances, the prices for the consumer would go up and there would be a windfall gain for the multinationals.Deputy Ferris is likely to be minded to agree with me that this is not the outcome we seek.  We have no wish for prices to be pushed up as a result of a stranded asset, that is, the interconnector, and a windfall profit to the multinationals, much as we welcome them here, whether they are associated with Corrib or LNG.  I have met the company and I have met several colleagues who have made representations to me, including Deputy Ferris, the Minister, Deputy Deenihan and Deputy Spring.  Others have made representations and I have met members of Kerry County Council and Shannon Development as well.  We had a situation whereby we were correct to anticipate a decision at the end of October from the regulator but, ironically, the action of the company has delayed it.

I gather the Minister is aware of this.  This should be cleared up because the people who live in the area are depending on this to proceed.  As the Minister is aware, I have no love for multinationals and I am keen to ensure value for money for the taxpayers of the country — I subscribe fully to this principle as I have done consistently all my life.  Some cohesion is needed from Ministers regarding what is happening here.  The truth about what is holding this up should be spelt out for the people of the area.  People are not aware of what is going on.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I agree it is important that the matter is cleared up not least from the point of view of the jobs that will be created.  It is important from the point of view of the additional security of supply that it would give to our energy provision here as well.  For this reason I welcome and support the project and I have made as much clear to the parent company, to the local company in Kerry and to Shannon Development.  We are doing everything we can to bring in this plant because LNG would be a valuable addition to our diversity of supply.  As Deputy Ferris suggested, the fact that there are many unemployed people in the area is something we will take into consideration and I am keen to help in any way I can.  The regulator is set up by statute of this House and is independent and has a job to do in the interests of consumer protection, competition and so on.  I cannot interfere with that but I will be helpful in any way I can.  I have signalled only recently following a request from my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, my willingness to meet the county manager and I am pleased to do so.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The administration of the free electricity allowance is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.  The decision taken by the Minister, as referred to in the Deputy's question was, I understand, necessary to achieve savings in the household benefits scheme as budgeted for in the 2011 budget.  The impact of the decision of the Minister for Social Protection was to restore the number of electricity units provided under the electricity allowance to 2007 levels.  My responsibility in this general area encompasses the issue of energy affordability.  I recognise the valuable role the fuel allowance and free electricity allowance play in the mitigation of energy poverty.  These schemes are part of a variety of measures necessary to tackle the root causes of energy.My focus is on implementing the 48 actions contained in the affordable energy strategy published last weekend.  We have identified five central actions in the strategy.  These include a commitment to review the national fuel allowance scheme in the context of examining the feasibility of aligning income supports with the energy efficiency and income of the home; the phased introduction of minimal thermal efficiency standards for rental accommodation; ensuring greater access to energy efficiency measures; reforming the eligibility criteria for energy efficiency schemes; and framing the work of the interdepartmental agency group on affordable energy on the five priority work packages.It is my strong belief that enhancing the energy efficiency of low-income homes through permanent structural improvements is the most effective means of addressing energy affordability.  To date, almost 76,000 homes have been improved under Better Energy: Warmer Homes.  As the Deputy will know, splendid leading-edge innovative work has and is being done on this by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, with the assistance of officials in my Department who have devoted a great deal of time to the plan we announced on Sunday.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	41	What was the question?

The Minister is wrongly informed.  The decision in the 2011 budget was quite clear, namely that there would be no change in the number of units and the saving was to be made through negotiation with utility companies, something the Minister belatedly announced this weekend she would do.  If the Minister checks the budget documentation from this time last year he will find I am correct.  Did the Minister have discussions with the Minister for Social Protection?  Was he consulted?  Did he agree that she was right to take away vital electricity units from people who badly need them?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I have had discussions with the Minister for Social Protection.  She advised me this was one of the sides deals done between the former Ministers for Social Protection and Finance, but was not announced in the budget.  She also advised me it was the conclusion, she believes, of both Ministers in the previous Government that they would not be around to answer for it, therefore they did not have to put it into the public domain.  They made the decision and she inherited it in her Department.  She has restored the position to 2007 levels.I ask the Deputy to examine the affordable energy plan published at the weekend.  We highlighted the fact that, believe it or not, over the past ten years some €2 billion has been spent on fuel support schemes but only €70 million on the improvement of the thermal efficiency of homes.  We have to address that as the single biggest issue confronting us, and one which is likely to tackle the issue of energy poverty.

The saving we budgeted for was made by getting a better deal from the utility companies.  What was specifically written into the budget, and is in the budget documentation and the leaflet we published on budget day, is that there would be no reduction in the number of units and that the saving would be made by going to the utility companies, mainly the ESB, which supply electricity to the customers in receipt of the free allowance and seeking a discount on the basis that the State is paying a huge amount of money, on time and all of the time.  That was the whole basis of the decision made by the last Government.  At no stage was it ever considered to reduce the number of units; that was specifically ruled out in the documentation on budget day.The Minister is being barefaced in propagating incorrect information from the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  Will he correct the record?  Second, will he acknowledge that, as Minister for Social Protection, I was the first to propose that terminal standards would be laid down for rental properties and that a comprehensive regime of energy efficiency would be operated between the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of Social Protection?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	58	As the Deputy may be aware, a steering committee was established in 2009 by the then Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht with the specific purpose of developing a series of recommendations aimed at stimulating the growth of Ireland's audiovisual industry over a five-year period.  The results of the work of this committee are set out in the Creative Capital report which was published in July 2011.Among the recommendations contained in this report is a proposal for the creation of a single funding agency for the audiovisual sector.  In essence, this proposal envisages that all State funding related to audiovisual content production would be transferred to a revamped Irish Film Board.  This would include the funding currently available to television and radio content producers under the Sound and Vision fund, which is part of the broadcasting fund currently administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.Since the publication of the report and on foot of a Government decision, a new interdepartmental committee was established by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and has been tasked with examining the feasibility of the various recommendations contained in the report.  This committee comprises representatives of relevant Departments, including the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, as well as certain industry bodies.The committee has met twice since it was established and it is my understanding that no formal discussion has yet taken place on the recommendation referred to by the Deputy.  As the committee has yet to consider the feasibility of this particular recommendation, there have been no discussions or correspondence in respect of the question of any legislation that might be required in the event that this particular proposal was considered to be practical or feasible.  I can confirm, however, that I have had correspondence with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in regard to the possible inclusion of a representative of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland on the committee and this has now been agreed.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Is it intended to use this report to substitute Exchequer funding given to the Irish Film Board with licence fee money?  Would the Minister be concerned about the effects of any possible change, particularly in the community radio sector, the commercial broadcasters and also the likes of TG4, etc., if such a proposal was to cause a diminution of the funds available to the broadcasting media under the Sound and Vision fund?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	60	The short answer is that speaking personally, I would be concerned.  As Chou En-lai said about the French Revolution, it is a bit too early yet to know.  The recommendation to which the Deputy refers has not even yet been reached by the interdepartmental committee and it will consider it.  I am happy that the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, has agreed to my request that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland would be represented on that committee.There are obvious possibilities for Ireland in the creation of employment in the creative industries and in the broadest sense of the term, audiovisual.  We have plenty of creative people and I would like to see that sector continue to develop.  However, the Sound and Vision fund has a particular purpose and it is not my disposition at this stage anyway, to contemplate changing it.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I am reassured by the Minister's response.  I ask him to confirm that a representative of his Department will be on the interdepartmental committee.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Yes, my Department is represented on the committee.  The report merits the kind of study it is receiving.  Various people working in this broader area have made the suggestion that Ireland has a certain competitive advantage which we should exploit in the sense of creating wealth and jobs and in terms of our international reputation.  Having said what I said about the Sound and Vision fund, I do not wish to constrain those possibilities in any way.  It seems to me that as the Deputy has said, the Sound and Vision fund at the moment has a purpose.  It is a fund which is well used and those who have access to it at the moment would be of the view they could not really manage if they did not have access to the Sound and Vision fund.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	63	The regulation of the electricity and gas market is the responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation which is an independent statutory body.  My Department and I are, nonetheless, in contact with the regulator from time to time regarding the functioning of the domestic electricity market.  In this context, addressing the issues faced by customers experiencing genuine financial hardship is of paramount importance to me.In line with the regulator's code of practice on disconnection, electricity and gas suppliers must facilitate payment options for domestic customers experiencing genuine financial hardship and, where appropriate, engage with a money adviser acting on behalf of the customer, such as MABS or a recognised charity.  This must include offering the customer a prepayment meter or budget controller if this is possible.The regulator has been working with electricity suppliers on the provision of prepayment meters.  In this regard, the regulator has developed a more modern prepayment keypad meter solution with the industry, which will be available to customers of all suppliers in financial hardship.  They are similar to the keypad meters offered in Northern Ireland.ESB Networks commenced the installation of these meters last month and the roll-out is progressing well.  Prepayment electricity meters have been available since 24 October 2011 to customers in financial hardship.  The regulator is working to ensure meters are distributed in an equitable manner between suppliers and are being rolled out as efficiently as possible.  ESB Networks has both the systems in place and sufficient stocks of prepayment meters to install an estimated 2,000 monthly, a figure that comfortably outstrips current and projected demand.  The company also has a further supply of meters on order.

Is the Minister confirming there is no shortage of this type of meter and that anyone who needs one will receive it promptly?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	65	Yes.  As I indicated, the position is that the availability of prepay meters "comfortably outstrips current and projected demand".  I hope that will remain the case.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	66	That is not what I have been told but I will take the Minister's word on the matter.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	67	In accordance with the new protocol I announced a couple of months ago, where a customer in genuine financial hardship has entered into a prepayment plan or installed a prepay meter, his or her service will not be disconnected.  The important dimension is that disconnections will not take place in cases where people exercise their right to request a prepay meter or be party to a payment plan.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	68	A key objective in the naming of public bodies is to convey clearly to the widest possible number of people a sense of the purpose and role of such a body.  As most such bodies are established by statute, the name in both Irish and English is set out in the relevant statute.  While responsibility for policy on the Irish language is a matter for my colleague, an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta, my own view is that it would be appropriate that the name of a body be used in either language as appropriate to the context.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Among State agencies, the Health Service Executive, which is always referred to as the HSE, is the predominant name.  There has been a tradition of using Irish language titles for State companies, for example, Bord na Móna, Bord Gáis, Bus Éireann, Coillte and FÁS.  This practice gave us a sense of national identity.  Recent indications from the Government suggest it intends to effectively refer to all such bodies by their English name.  While it may allow for an Irish version in the relevant Act, the English name, as opposed to an Irish equivalent of Bus Éireann or Coillte, will be the one used.  Is it the Government's intention to continue with this policy rather than revert to the policy pursued in previous times when names such as FÁS, Coillte, Bord na Móna, Bord Bia and so forth predominated?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Did I say that?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I do not believe I said that.  I am becoming forgetful but not to the extent that I do not recall what I said a moment ago.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I am not aware of any change in policy in this regard and none has been communicated to me.  Bodies under my remit, for example, Bord na Móna, and that of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, for example, Coillte, are branded and trade under the names they have been given.  That will continue to be the case.  It was Deputy Ó Cuív's Government which changed the name of Teilifís na Gaeilge to TG4.  I am not aware of any intention to change the policy but if the Deputy indicates specifically what he is referring to, I will attempt to respond.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	76	When new bodies were established the policy until recently was to use the Irish name as the predominant name, as in the case of Bus Éireann and so forth.  I accept that under the previous Government, the use of the English name became a habit, one with which I did not agree.  As the Minister has outlined in documents on new agencies which are to be established, the English name will be universally used.  When naming new bodies or redesignating bodies will he revert to making the Irish name the predominant name, as was previously the case?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	77	If there is any policy by the Government to change practice and refer to the bodies in question in the English language only——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	79	——I am not aware of it.  Such a policy is not intended.  It is not exactly the daily meat of the Government to think about what we will call any bodies that are set up.  We are trying to close down some bodies and merge and amalgamate others.  It is not immediately on the agenda to have an bord nua in whatever area.  If, however, there are good reasons to establish a new State agency or commercial entity, I am happy to agree with the Deputy that we should select a suitable name as Gaeilge which would be the brand under which the new company would trade.  It is not my intention to establish new bodies unnecessarily, however.  We had too much of that in the recent past, as I am sure the Deputy will agree.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The possibility of merging Coillte and Bord na Móna has been discussed and the proposed name for the new organisation is in the English language.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Although the Taoiseach and I met yesterday, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I offer our sincere sympathy on the recent death of his mother, Eithne.  May she rest in peace.  In that context, I appreciate the Taoiseach's attendance today.The budget leaks have been continuing at an unprecedented pace.  The most recent leak, on motor tax hikes, is particularly cynical in so far as any such increase in motor taxation would appear to target fuel efficient cars.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, has confirmed he will increase the bands and rates.  To reduce carbon emissions, enhance the environment, help produce a cleaner environment, tackle climate change and promote energy efficiency the previous Government introduced various incentives for the purchase of more fuel efficient cars.  This policy worked.  Those who bought fuel efficient cars did so on the basis that there would be certainty and consistency in the motor taxation regime.  They will, therefore, view the Government's decision to increase motor taxation rates as an act of treachery which flies in the face of measures being taken globally to tackle fuel emissions.  As the threat is a significant one in terms of our environment and so forth, time is not on our side.  As a result of the various leaks and commentary by the Minister, there is widespread uncertainty concerning the motor taxation regime.  There is also a lack of clarity and many doubts in respect of the sustainability or long-term nature of the regime when people make decisions on the types of cars they wish to buy.  We have been promoting the idea that people should buy fuel-efficient cars.  Does the Taoiseach accept that increases in rates and bands for fuel-efficient cars would essentially reverse the trend towards a better and cleaner environment in Ireland?  Does he accept that in such circumstances, the Government would essentially be engaging in an act of treachery against those who have gone down that route?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I thank the Deputy for his kind words and for his attendance at the funeral yesterday.  I appreciate that very much.  The issue he has raised is obviously a tax measure that will be referred to when the Minister for Finance delivers his Budget Statement on 6 December.  The change that was made was partly responsible for people wanting to buy more fuel-efficient cars, in the interests of a cleaner environment and better regulation in that regard.  New rates of motor tax based on emissions were introduced by the then Minister in 2008.  They provided for significantly reduced rates of motor tax for new smaller cars.  The income from motor tax was just over €1 billion in 2008, €1.058 billion in 2009 and €1.024 billion in 2010.  The income from motor tax this year is expected to be €988 million.  That will represent a reduction of 3.5%.  The Minister for Finance has not yet brought his tax proposals to Cabinet.  He will do so this week as part of the preparation for next week's budget.  If changes in motor tax rates are adopted by the Cabinet, the owners of cars with smaller engines and lower emissions can expect to continue to pay substantially less in motor tax than those who purchased cars with bigger engines and higher emissions.  I understand what Deputy Martin is saying.  There are inadequacies in the system that was introduced.  This is one of the tax measures that will have to be considered by the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet when matters are being finalised in advance of the budget on 6 December.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	83	My difficulty with what the Taoiseach said is that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, has confirmed publicly that there will be changes.  He has said there will be "adjustments in the bands" and "adjustments in the rates".  He has argued that the Minister for Finance needs to use resources from motor tax and adjustments in the bands to reduce the budget deficit.  The Minister has said there will be changes.  Other leaks have added to the Minister's statement.  The Minister for Finance said VAT will increase by 2%.  The Dáil should have been brought into these discussions at a much earlier stage.  The budget will be a fait accompli by the time the Dáil gets a chance to discuss these issues adequately.  Any analysis of the climate change agenda will show that the transport sector in Ireland has always been the biggest factor here.  We need consistent policies to change the nature of emissions from transport in particular.  It is the big area.  The cumulative effect of the 2% increase in VAT; the pension levy, which will hit ordinary pensioners; the increase in motor tax that has been confirmed by the Minister, Deputy Hogan; and the lack of relief for mortgage holders will be a significant imposition on people on budget day.  Has the Government considered the cumulative impact of all the tax measures confirmed by the Minister for Finance to date?  Perhaps we do not yet know about some of them.  Would the Taoiseach care to comment on the cumulative impact?  Does he not accept that the move to a fuel-efficient motor tax model was a good idea and a strategy that should be continued?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The first thing the Deputy should bear in mind is that the budget has not yet taken place.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	87	He is running out of scope.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	88	——related to his intention to bring a proposal before the Cabinet for a 2% increase in VAT as an alternative to increasing income tax, which would have a direct impact on jobs.  That is a fundamental concern for the Government.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has pointed out that the income being gained from motor tax has decreased by 3.5%.  He has said he intends to bring proposals to the Government.  I can genuinely say the tax aspect of the budget has not yet been presented by the Minister for Finance.  There has been speculation and comment on the matters mentioned by the Deputy when he spoke about the cumulative effect of the budget because people know they have to be considered.  The overall position of the Government is that the deficit will be reduced to 8.6%.  A balance will have to be struck between current cuts and tax measures.  The Government has set out its stall in this regard.  The list on either side is not very palatable.  The Government has to make choices and it will do so.  We will take account of the cumulative impact of our decisions on people in the harder-pressed sections of our society.It would be lovely to say we have discovered a new pot that will deal with all of these problems, but we have not.  Regardless of the crisis in the eurozone, which is of utmost concern to everybody, we have to sort out our problems here.  We cannot do that without making political decisions.  I assure the Deputy that the Cabinet has reflected long and is reflecting hard on the decisions that have to be made.  Decisions must be made and will be made.  Our people know this reality.  As the Deputy is aware, a balance always has to be struck in a way that allows for growth to return to the economy, jobs to be created and work to be facilitated.  We have to keep that balance.  We have a fix on the need to deliver on the 8.6% commitment.  It is unpalatable in the extreme to have to decide between increasing tax and cutting current expenditure.  The Government will finalise its decisions in this regard in the coming days.  I can confirm that the Minister for Finance has not yet brought his tax proposals to the Cabinet.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhrón a dhéanamh leis an Taoiseach faoi cailliúnt a mháthair.  Bhí mé i Londain ag an deireadh seachtaine.  Bhí mé ag smaoineamh faoin Taoiseach agus faoina chlann.  Tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil sé éasca dó bheith anseo inniu.A particular characteristic of these leaks is that they are planned ministerial leaks.  They are coming from Ministers.  Details of cuts in child benefit, VAT increases, huge hikes in prescription charges and community nursing home closures have been leaked.  The Taoiseach has said on many occasions that all citizens are in this together.  I remind him that 30 former politicians — members of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats — are earning pensions that are significantly in excess of €100,000.  Some of them are earning an additional €3,000 for attending certain meetings.  In addition, some 100 civil servants take home pensions that are in excess of €100,000.  The Taoiseach knows that if an ordinary citizen — I use the word "ordinary" advisedly — won €50,000, €60,000, €70,000 or €100,000 on "Winning Streak", he or she would be over the moon.  These elites take such money home every single year.  It is coming out of the people's pockets.  It is not the case that all of us are in this together.  There are two Irelands.  The Taoiseach should take this opportunity to say that the Government will cap public pensions and stop the payment of pensions to people who are still in employment.  These people are still working.  They have not retired.  The Taoiseach should set the record straight on this issue today.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta as ucht an glaoch a chur sé orm nuair a bhí sé i Londain.  Tá a fhios agam go raibh leas-Chéad Aire an Tionóil sa Tuaisceart ag an sochraid inné.  Tá mé buíoch as ucht é sin.  Ní chuireann sé isteach ró-mhór orm bheith anseo.  Déarfadh sí féin liom gur cheart go mbéinn anseo.  The question of serious amounts of money being paid in pensions to retired persons is a matter of some importance to the Government.  I get it all the time myself around the country.  It did not start just now but has been going on for some time.  In its own small way, I happened to be the first public servant to take a voluntary pay cut and leave aside whatever bits and pieces of pensions I had, including one from a different profession.The Government is concerned about this matter.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will make a statement about it later this afternoon.  It might be more appropriate for the Deputy to wait for it rather than me giving the details about it now.

However, I will give the Taoiseach a health warning, if I may.  It will not be good enough unless the Minister clearly brings an end to the obscene practice in question, especially when budget cuts, as heralded by other Ministers, will not just affect the most vulnerable of our citizens but people who never thought of themselves as economically vulnerable.  It is disgusting that for attending a meeting a person would be paid €3,000 by the taxpayer, on top of an exorbitant salary of €100,000 and a pension.I applaud the Taoiseach's willingness to set aside whatever pension payments he had before coming into office.  We wait, however, in anticipation of the Minister's statement and hope it will not be another broken promise.  All the issues that I signalled, the subjects of ministerial leaks, are ones which the Taoiseach's Government partner described as red line issues.  Thug an Taoiseach agus daoine eile ó Fhine Gael a lán gealltanas faoi na rudaí seo.  Tá a fhios acu go bhfuil go leor de na gealltanais sin briste acu.While the Government got a huge mandate in the election, it will not get any more support if it goes forward with these budget cuts while the elites cream off moneys from the taxpayers' pockets.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The pension levy was introduced on the remuneration of all public servants which will realise over €1 billion in savings this year.  A tiered reduction in all public service pensions above €12,000 was also introduced which has cut pensions on average by 4% while retirement lump sums of over €200,000 will be taxed.  The grace period which allows people to retire on their pre-cuts salary will end on 29 February 2012.  Those retiring after then will see a pension reduction of 7% on average as their final pensions will be calculated on a reduced pay level.The Minister's statement later this afternoon will be in respect of the superior pensions, as one might call them.  There are approximately 250 people in receipt of pensions over €100,000 which is the focus of some considerable attention.  There are also other areas where huge amounts are paid every day.  The Government will look across the range of these payments.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will deal with the large amounts paid in pensions to a specific number of people in the House later.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I join with my colleagues, Deputies Martin and Adams, in expressing my sympathy to the Taoiseach on the recent bereavement in his family and to thank him for being in the Chamber today at a time which must be difficult for him.While we have been discussing what may possibly be in next week's budget, I believe it will be one of the last meaningful budgets in this State's history, particularly if events take shape in the manner they seem they will in Europe in the next several weeks.  Last week, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, said Europe should take one big step towards fiscal union.  The European Council meeting the Taoiseach will attend on 9 December is beginning to shape up and become clearer.  What will probably happen is that the weaker European Union countries, including Ireland, will concede fiscal union while the stronger countries will allow the European Central Bank to release the funds and take the measures to give necessary relief to the euro.  This will have serious implications for Ireland as it will involve EU treaty changes.  The Taoiseach will have to go to the country with a referendum suggesting fiscal union and its implications.  This will be serious for Ireland as it will involve the second surrender of our sovereignty in recent times, the first being the surrender to the European banks by the last Government.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	99	Thank you, Deputy Ross.  Is there a question?

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Hear, hear.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I thank Deputy Ross for his kindness.  His question is valid.  Clearly, there is a difference between fiscal union and fiscal discipline.  What the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has talked about is fiscal discipline.  She believes that if countries sign on for a set of conditions, then they should be seen to be enforceable.  At the recent meeting I had with her, she stated the European Court of Justice should be enabled to impose sanctions on a country that did not measure up in its budgetary fiscal discipline.  The French President, however, has a different view about the requirements for fiscal union, an entirely different matter, in areas such as tax harmonisation.The Government has made the point that Ireland never breached the Stability and Growth Pact.  We support regulations and conditions that are enforceable.  We have actually gone beyond this with the EU-IMF-ECB troika regularly forensically analysing our budgetary position.  Next spring, the Government will introduce legislation to establish a debt break for the State's finances.Under the Constitution, any changes to the EU treaties are subject to legal advice from the Attorney General as to whether a referendum is required.  Treaty change is a large process of intergovernmental conferences, conventions and so forth, unless it is decided to be done by a specific narrow amendment which may still require a referendum here.The crisis is now.  It has to be addressed with the facilities and tools available.  From our perspective, I have not hitched our wagon to the concept of eurobonds because one might well store up serious trouble for the country further down the line.  Our view is that the ECB should be the backstop of ultimate and infinite firepower to deal with the question of contagion that affects every country.As Deputy Ross will be aware from his study of history, in the 1930s people assumed that banks that were well managed and well run could survive when in fact they could not.  They cannot, and will not, in the future unless a credible backstop is provided.  That backstop must be dealt with in the immediate future by political consideration because even if one assumed treaty change would be accepted by everyone, one could still not do it in time to deal with the crisis that affects us now.My perspective for the meeting on 9 December is to deal politically with the crisis we have now and that means making political arrangements to provide a sufficiently credible backstop.  The Ministers for Finance are attending a meeting today to discuss some technicalities around this.  The EFSF has failed to attract the confidence of the markets and, whether it is a combination of the ECB, the IMF or whatever, that is where the focus of political leadership should be and decisions have to be made and made quickly.  The question of anything beyond that is a matter for serious consultation in this Parliament and so on.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I thank the Taoiseach.  I understand his point about fiscal discipline but the quotes I used from Angela Merkel specifically referred to fiscal union.  Fiscal discipline may be the one step she referred to but, undoubtedly, fiscal union is on the agenda and it will be on the agenda on 9 December even if it is deferred.  Could the Taoiseach assure us that the Government will not allow the issue of tax harmonisation to arise at that meeting and that he will not countenance any talk, as a  quid pro quo, of a change in the 12.5% corporate tax rate, which may well arise?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The objective of our political direction is to retrieve economic sovereignty for our people and our country.  That has been lost in the sense that we have been subject to a bailout in the troika programme.  As I have said previously on many occasions, I have no intention of agreeing to anything on tax harmonisation.  We have been clear about our corporate tax rate, as has everybody else in the House.  It is set out clearly across the entire spectrum at 12.5%, with an effective rate of 11.9%.  It is there for everybody to see and it has not moved up or down.  Given that it is a legal right and responsibility of the Commission to produce papers in respect of the common consolidated corporate tax base, we participate in discussions but the paper to be tabled on 9 December will be about President Van Rompuy's proposals, which he has been mandated to produce.  I have heard a great deal of comment about what might or might not be in them but, suffice it to say, we have no intention whatsoever of doing anything to disrupt the confidence in inward investment in regard to our corporate tax rate.I go back again to the difference between fiscal discipline, which was the focus of the Chancellor's words, and fiscal union, on which other countries might have a view.  With regard to fiscal discipline, the problem is countries signed on for conditions to which they have not adhered and, therefore, this naturally causes a lot of angst for countries providing loans in such situations.  Ireland has measured up in this programme to all the conditions and has never breached the Stability and Growth Pact.  We will go further next year by legislating for debt brake.  From that perspective, I have absolutely no intention of doing anything disruptive to our corporate tax system and we will focus on every attempt we can to retrieve our economic independence and sovereignty, which is a requirement of everybody in the country.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.The programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a constitutional convention and indicates areas for it to examine.  The programme states that the convention will report within 12 months.  I have previously indicated that, to give the convention time to fully consider the matters referred to it, the 12-month period should run from the date of its establishment, which is intended will be in the spring of next year.  Work is proceeding in my Department on the preparation of proposals for the setting up of the convention, including consideration of issues raised in the Deputies' questions.  I intend to invite Opposition leaders to meet me to discuss the convention before the House rises for the Christmas recess.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I welcome that the Taoiseach intends to meet the leaders of political parties before the recess to discussion the establishment of the constitutional convention and the Government's proposals because when I last tabled this question as far back as June, the Taoiseach indicated that, before the final structure and terms of reference would be agreed, party leaders would be consulted.  We have not had any consultation since then on anything to do with the establishment of the convention.  Will the Taoiseach facilitate the presentation of some ideas on the terms of reference and parameters of the convention?  In previous replies, he raised the prospect of the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad and the children's rights referendum being debated separately to the work of the convention.  Is it still his intention to deal with the abolition of the Seanad outside the parameters of the convention or does he envisage that matter being deliberated on within the convention?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I thank the Deputy for his question.  I would like to have a meeting with Opposition leaders about the proposed structure for the constitutional convention, give them a few days to consider the terms of reference and so on and then reflect on people's views.  We would like to get this as right as possible because it will affect the people long after we are gone from here.We have committed to dealing with the questions of the abolition of the Seanad and a referendum on children's rights outside the convention.  There is a separate argument in regard to the nature of the way we hold referenda in the future and whether it is appropriate to hold more than one on the same date given the confusion surrounding the recent referenda.  If the turnout on an issue is not greater than 30%, it is invalid.  The Oireachtas needs to consider these questions.There is also a cost involved.  We cannot hold referendums on a quarterly basis.  I would like to talk separately to leaders about that and perhaps we can have an appropriate debate on it but it is the intention to hold the referendum in respect of the abolition of the Seanad and, when the children's advocacy groups get together and agree on a wording, to have the children's rights referendum outside the terms of the constitutional convention.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I welcome the fact the Taoiseach has set a time for consultation with leaders of the Opposition on the convention.  It is important that they be open-ended discussions.  The programme for Government gives some sense of the time it will last but clarification is needed on membership and participation by civic society, people from the Six Counties, the Unionists and the new Irish.  The Taoiseach also has given a commitment to put on the clár an issue we have raised a number of times with him, which is voting rights for people in presidential elections, including passport holders from the North and among the diaspora.  He is aware this is a big issue.  I was in London over the past number of days and it was raised there.  I support the Global Irish Economic Forum sponsored by the Government.  I visited New York during the past month and I am aware that people feel robbed because citizens from other states who live abroad can vote in presidential elections in their home countries.  Time is required and I am of the view that there is a need for more than one meeting.  There must be a proper discussion and exchange of ideas on this matter.  We can draw upon the work done by particular conventions and conferences in the past, although I accept that these entities did not deal expressly with the issue of the Constitution.  I am seeking a clear commitment that the constitutional convention will be as inclusive as possible and that its membership will not merely be limited to people who live in this State.  As well as people from the North, members of the diaspora from across the globe should be able to make a contribution.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	109	We want the membership of the convention to be representative of society in general and to include people of all ages and genders, regardless of where they reside.  These issues have been discussed from time to time in the past.  As the Deputy is aware, there is not due to be another presidential election until 2018 and this will give us the time and space to get matters right.  In the first instance, I want to establish as inclusive and as comprehensive a convention as possible.  This will then be given its remit and terms of reference and directed to carry out its work.  There is no reason the convention could not take into account or consider reports, recommendations or proposals from a wide variety of individuals and interests.  If the Oireachtas wants to consider changes to the Constitution which would reflect and evolving Ireland, then it is in everyone's interests that all relevant proposals be examined.I do not perceive this to be a narrow, extremely confined issue.  The constitutional convention will have quite a broad remit that will cover a range of subjects.  In that context, I have no objection to groups or organisations, either at home or abroad, putting forward proposals for consideration.  This matter is relevant to all Irish citizens, not just those who live in this State but also those who reside elsewhere.  In saying this I am not giving a signal in respect of the outcome of the convention.  However, I do not see why all proposals or suggestions put forward should not be discussed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	110	The budget is due to be introduced next week, which suggests an extremely tight timeline with regard to meaningful engagement on this matter prior to the recess.  I am of the view that we should engage on this matter before the recess.  I respectfully suggest, however, that there may be a need for a more detailed engagement when the House reconvenes after Christmas.  I offer that suggestion in good faith because I am aware of the situation which obtains at the end of a Dáil term, particularly in the context of the introduction of the budget.  The Taoiseach appeared to indicate that the structure of the convention has almost been worked out and that he wants to put this to the other parties in the House.  Those parties might want to reflect on what is to be proposed or, alternatively, they may wish to put ideas to the Government in respect of both the structure of the convention and the parameters within which it should operate.  Does the Taoiseach envisage that a wide-ranging public consultation process or mechanism will form part of the deliberations of the convention in order that people might offer submissions, etc.?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Yes, I accept that.  I propose to discuss with Opposition leaders the structure I have in mind.  I am sure people will respect the confidentiality requirement relating to the latter.  I do not have a preference with regard to whether we should consider the matter before the Christmas recess or in the new year.  It is only right that we should discuss it in some detail in order that we might arrive at the best kind of convention possible.I envisage that public hearings will take place.  As the Deputy is aware, the National Forum on Europe held a process of public engagement.  This worked in some respects but attendance at meetings held in some areas was extremely poor.  As a result, the agendas of certain groups which might have issues with regard to treaty change or whatever were deliberately pushed to the fore.  In the context of the Constitution, which belongs to the people, I envisage a process of public engagement.  We should use all the modern methods of communication in this regard.  Rather than just holding meetings in Bantry, Bunclody or wherever, we should — if we are to proceed with it at all — make the process as inclusive and as comprehensive as possible.

Will he elaborate on what will be his role?  Who will be responsible for convening the convention?  Will it be the Taoiseach's Department or would he consider putting in place an independent group which would convene the convention and then make submissions or recommendations to the Government or the Dáil in respect of its work?

As he is well aware, it is possible to engage in comprehensive conversations and contact with members of the diaspora abroad.  I had experience of this in the context of recent contacts with a number of multinationals.  The nature of that contact was as clear, if not clearer, as that in which the Deputy and I are now engaging.  Instead of obliging groups to fly to destinations across the globe, there are modern methods by means of which we can establish direct contact and obtain the relevant information in ten minutes.  If Ministers were on official business in particular locations, then I am sure they could meet delegations and listen to their views.  The modern way of obtaining information from locations across the globe is more than adequate in the context of gathering together the views, proposals and ideas which people may wish to put forward.

I reiterate what I said to Deputy Martin, namely, that I will discuss this matter with Opposition leaders prior to the Christmas recess.  They can then reflect on it over Christmas and we will engage in a more detailed discussion in the new year.  In that context, the Deputy can follow through with regard to the type of structure which should be put in place.  I would like to think that the constitutional convention will not just be perceived as some form of sop and that it will instead make a meaningful contribution in respect of the changes which people envisage as being important in the context of their Constitution.  The Constitution belongs to everyone and if we are going to do something, we should try to do it in as comprehensive and as widely beneficial a way as possible.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I wish to express our condolences to the Taoiseach on the passing of his mother at the weekend.On the constitutional convention, the Taoiseach referred to one or two matters, such as that relating to the Seanad, which he will progress outside of it.  In the context of the reform of the presidency, during one of its periods in opposition Fine Gael introduced a Bill which would have changed the requirement whereby any citizen who wishes to contest a presidential election is dependent on Members of the Oireachtas or county councillors in order to obtain a nomination.  Does the Taoiseach envisage pursuing this change during the lifetime of this Dáil and to hold a referendum on the matter?  One way to proceed would be to require presidential hopefuls to secure a certain number of signatures of citizens or voters in order to obtain a nomination rather than obliging them to submit to the current undemocratic and exclusive system which applies in the context of standing for the Office of President.  Another way to proceed — this would be my recommendation — would be to abolish the office entirely.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I thank Deputy Higgins for his expression of condolence.  I appreciate what he said very much.The programme for Government contains a reference to a reduction in the period of the term of service of the President from seven years to five.  As already stated, that matter should form part of the conversation of the convention on the Constitution.  A range of matters relating to the Presidency have been discussed, including age limits, voting rights, the nomination process etc.In fact, there is an independent Private Members' Bill proposing seven changes of which Deputy Higgins will be well aware.This is an issue in its entirety that is very appropriate for the constitutional convention to discuss.  From that point of view, I would not see any restriction for the convention to discuss the full gamut on the spectrum of the requirements for the presidency.  I have no intention of abolishing the presidency.  I believe that the new presidency of President Higgins will be able to build on the bridges created by the former President, Dr. McAleese, and her predecessor, Dr. Robinson, in a way that will be beneficial for the country in terms of such matters as our status, reputation, and trade or economic links.  In respect of the presidency as a part of the Constitution, the entire range would be very appropriate for the convention to discuss.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 18, inclusive, together.I met the newly elected leader of the SDLP, Dr. Alasdair McDonnell, on Wednesday, 9 November, during the course of his visit to Dublin.  I congratulated him on winning the party leadership and assured him of my support and co-operation in the period ahead.  We also agreed to strengthen co-operation at political and official level between the Government and the SDLP.On Thursday, 17 November, I travelled to Belfast for my first visit to the city since becoming Taoiseach.  I paid a courtesy call on the Northern Ireland First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, at Stormont Castle.I also visited two community projects.  My first call was at the East Belfast Mission on the Newtownards Road.  I then visited the Short Strand Community Centre in Beechfield Street.  In both cases, I met local community representatives and was greatly impressed by the work being carried out in both centres.I was the guest of honour at the annual Aisling Awards where I delivered the keynote address.  I also had the privilege of presenting the Aisling Person of the Year Award to Ms Geraldine Finucane.Prior to the awards ceremony, I met Ms Finucane, members of her family and their solicitor, Mr. Peter Madden.  We discussed the issue of a public inquiry into the death of her husband, Mr. Pat Finucane.  I reiterated the Government's firm position referring to the all-party Oireachtas motion calling for a public inquiry and referred to my conversation with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, prior to his recent meeting with the Finucane family when I reiterated the Government's position.As I have previously stated on the record of this House, my Government is committed on this issue on the basis of the all-party motion and of giving whatever help we can to Ms Finucane and her family in their continuing search for the truth through an independent public inquiry.  Officials from my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have met the family since I met them in Belfast to examine how further assistance, particularly in the US, could be arranged.On the Friday morning, I attended a business breakfast event in Belfast where I addressed 70 members of the Northern Ireland Business Alliance representing the business community and organisations in Northern Ireland.  I also met the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Niall Ó Donnghaile, and cross-party members of Belfast City Council when I visited Belfast City Hall.Following my visit to Belfast, I travelled to Armagh to attend the North-South Ministerial Council plenary meeting.  This was the 13th meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council and was co-chaired by the First and Deputy First Ministers.We discussed a wide range of shared issues, including the economic challenges we both face against a backdrop of fiscal contraction in the European Union and global economies.  I briefed the Northern Ireland Executive on our cost saving plans and on our continued efforts in reducing the deficit.We discussed areas of co-operation, including on NAMA and the banks, and also opportunities to make efficiencies and mutual savings through co-operating in areas where it makes sense to do so.  We also explored potential collaboration to meet the emerging challenges in third level education and reviewed the important contribution that the agrifood sector could make to the economy.We approved the appointment of members to the boards of the North-South implementation bodies and directors of Tourism Ireland for the next four years and expressed appreciation for the work of the outgoing members and directors.The importance of tourism to the economy and jobs, North and South, is well recognised and events such as the MTV EMA awards recently held in Belfast with significant international audiences highlights the potential of the sector.  In that context, we explored opportunities to work together to maximise the benefits of forthcoming initiatives both North and South, including the Titanic centenary in 2012 and the Derry City of Culture and "The Gathering" in 2013.  We also discussed the north-west gateway initiative and agreed on the next steps to make further progress which will be subject to a report to the next meeting of the council.We discussed the Government's recent decision to defer further investment in the A5 — north-west gateway to Aughnacloy — and A8 — Belfast to Larne — road projects.  I previously discussed this with the First and Deputy First Ministers when I met them on the margins of the presidential inauguration in Dublin Castle and we discussed the matter again when we met in Stormont Castle on Thursday last.  On each occasion I made it clear that the Government's decision is to defer, and not abandon, these important projects.  At the North-South Ministerial Council plenary we approved a payment of £3 million in accordance with the previously agreed procedure in respect of a milestone reached in the project.  The Government's commitment to realising these projects through our undertaking to provide £25 million for each year 2015 and 2016 was acknowledged.  The relevant Departments have now been mandated to prepare a new funding and implementation plan in this context.Progress on the St. Andrews review was discussed and proposals were agreed to advance the review with a view to taking decisions at the next plenary meeting in June 2012.We also discussed ways to progress movement on the North-South consultative forum and agreed to finalise our deliberations on this matter at the June 2012 meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  We welcomed the work undertaken over a number of joint meetings by the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly towards a North-South parliamentary forum and look forward to the outcome of the next joint meeting on 15 December.Finally, Ministers approved a comprehensive schedule of NSMC meetings, including a NSMC institutional meeting in spring 2012 and the next NSMC plenary meeting on 15 June 2012, which will be held here in the Republic.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I have 11 of these questions.  Five of them are what I would consider questions of substance.  Most of those relate to parts of agreements between the Irish and British Governments and some relate to parts of international agreements.  Therefore, I would like the opportunity to come back on them.I will concentrate, if I could, on the Pat Finucane killing and the Government's efforts on that.  I welcome very much the Taoiseach's meeting with Ms Geraldine Finucane.I could make a number of suggestions on how this case can be advanced. First, the British Government has acted in breach of the Weston Park agreement.  There were a number of parts of that agreement in terms of killings, all of which have been put in place.  Some of them have completed their findings.  On this one, the British have not acted.  This is unusual in so far as it is a breach of an agreement between the Government here and the government in London.I wonder if the Taoiseach has instructed the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, or would he, to provide a briefing paper on these matters for the widest possible international distribution.  I wonder could such a paper ask organisations, individuals and other Governments to publicly support the Finucane family's demand for an independent inquiry.  Would the Taoiseach instruct our embassies to raise this issue in discussions with other Governments?  In particular, would he instruct our embassy and consulates in the USA and in Europe to raise these issues with the government in London?  Would he formally raise this issue at the UN, at EU ministerial level, etc.?  In other words, would the Government, in supporting what is an all-party motion of the Dáil and a long-standing campaign by the family, use all of its resources, contacts and diplomatic skills to ensure that the British Government gives the Finucane family what the Dáil and the Finucane family have asked for?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I had a very good meeting with Ms Finucane and members of her family and their lawyer prior to the function of the Aisling Awards, at which Ms Finucane received the Person of the Year Award.  I undertook at that meeting that I would raise this matter with our United States colleagues because of their considerable interest in this over a long period, and I intend to follow through on that.  I also said I would explore other ways whereby this might be followed through.I take note of what Deputy Adams says here.  I consider that this particular case is not unique in that a man is dead.  My sorrow is for every victim, and I made that perfectly clear both to media and to the Finucane family.  However, this was the subject of agreement at Weston Park.  There was an agreement that the recommendations of Judge Cory would be followed through on and this was one of those areas where his recommendation was that there should be a public inquiry.  This State followed through with that in respect of a similar recommendation, which is why the Smithwick tribunal was set up and is running.I met subsequently with the Ministers, Mr. Danny Kennedy and Ms Arlene Foster, in Armagh.  I noted subsequent comments about requiring that this State should apologise on the basis of a perception of the collusion of this State with killers who would have returned from Northern Ireland to places in the Republic.  I want to make it perfectly clear that when the IRA was in operation, it was an enemy of this State——
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Hear, hear.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	126	——and citizens of this State were murdered, shot and blown up, including members of the Defence Forces, the Garda and the Army.  As they were enemies of the State, I deplore absolutely every single death and have sympathy for the families of every victim, but I do not want anybody to run away with an assumption that this State was in formal collusion with the IRA, or killers associated with the IRA, who were using the opportunity as cover.The Pat Finucane murder, in my view, was specifically in the context of the Cory recommendations, and the Cory recommendation was that there should be a public inquiry.  When I was on the other side of the House in opposition, the House unanimously supported my motion in that regard, and we still support that.  However, let nobody be under any illusions here.  We are not going back to the old ways of the past.  People should not, under any circumstances, assume that Governments of the past were in direct collusion when people were unfortunately wounded, maimed, killed, blown up or murdered in Northern Ireland, or that there was a State safe haven for them in the Twenty-six Counties.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Citizens of this State were blown up, murdered, maimed, shot and killed by persons within the IRA and associated with that kind of activity.  I have no wish other than to say that everybody who lost a family member is a victim, and I have sympathy and sorrow for all of those families, irrespective of how that happened.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I also read those comments from Unionist politicians in general.  I would accept, of course, that this State has consistently been resolutely opposed to the Provisional IRA campaign, and the campaigns of others.  These were militant campaigns which inflicted unnecessary violence on thousands of civilians on the island of Ireland, and which resulted in death, destruction and misery for generations of families and people.In that context, I would ask the Taoiseach to reflect on and question how the Minister, Deputy Shatter, dealt with the Smithwick inquiry as it has given cause for concern in Unionist circles.  We should never leave ourselves open to the accusation that we are short-termist or dealing with an inquiry in a certain manner that might give succour to those who want to believe certain perspectives or viewpoints in regard to the Republic or successive Governments.  This is why I was very concerned about the motions that came before the House in regard to the Smithwick inquiry and the refusal to give us all the advice the judge had given to the Minister at the time, and in particular how that would play with Unionist sensitivities.  It is extremely important that, from here onwards, there is not a scintilla of doubt about the independence of Smithwick from any intervention by any Minister or anybody in its deliberations and work.With regard to the Finucane case and the need for a sworn public inquiry, I believe we are agreed in the House that this a breach of the Weston Park agreement.  Fundamentally, therefore, a breakthrough can only take place between the two Governments which are signatories, with others, to that agreement.  We have celebrated, if one likes, the changed nature of the relationship — the happier relationship — between Britain and Ireland.  However, I suggest the fact an inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane has not been held to date has the capacity to significantly sour and undermine that relationship, which we do not want, just as the difficulties we have had in regard to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings has further eroded all the work people have put into consolidating and enhancing the relationship between the two Governments and two peoples.A way has to be found between the two Governments at intergovernmental level in order to have this inquiry.  At present, there is stalemate.  The British Government is essentially setting its face against an inquiry — that is how I read it and it seems to be its position.  It is a matter for the Dáil and the Government in particular to persuade the British Government to go ahead and hold such an inquiry, which is the unanimous view of Dáil Éireann.There are a number of further points I would like to put to the Taoiseach and I would like the opportunity to come back on some of my other questions at a later stage.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I thank Deputy Martin for those comments.  Let us be very clear on this.  The Government and the Minister for Justice and Equality had and have absolutely no intention whatsoever of interfering in any way with the independence of the Smithwick tribunal.  I understand that, when these things are mentioned, it can oftentimes give the perception that one wants to in some way interfere with a process.  The Oireachtas, in particular the Dáil, set up the Smithwick tribunal.  What happened in June of this year is that the terms of reference to the Smithwick tribunal were amended to require it to produce an interim report to the Clerk of the Dáil not later than 30 June 2011.  Within the process of setting these things up, it is appropriate for the body which set it up to hear an interim report by 30 June and that its final report should be presented to the Clerk of the Dáil not later than 30 November 2011.Judge Smithwick had previously indicated to the Minister for Justice and Equality that the tribunal would be able to conclude its work in the timetable that was established in the amended terms of reference.  It was made perfectly clear by the Minister in the Dáil that if, for any unforeseen reason, the chairman found he could not conclude his inquires and have his report finally dealt with by 30 November 2011, he could report that to the House and the House would consider that.  The House did consider that.  As the House is aware and Deputy Martin will know, following a request from Judge Smithwick, the Government approved a further extension of six months for a final report to be produced by 31 May 2012, and a motion in that regard will be put to the House in due course.  The tribunal will also be required to produce another interim report by 9 March next year.I understand the tribunal is currently conducting public hearings.  Given the body was set up by the Oireachtas, it is appropriate the Oireachtas should be able to hear interim reports on the proceeding and state of business of the tribunal without any question of interfering in any way with the independence of Judge Smithwick, the chairman.I want to make this perfectly clear.  In handling this, the Minister for Justice and Equality was quite specific on the record.  There has been no other involvement with the Smithwick tribunal other than to say we would like to have an interim report and a final report by November.  If it cannot done by then, the tribunal was told to inform the Oireachtas.  That happened, and a further six months extension was granted, with a request for a further interim report by 9 March.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	131	Is the Taoiseach aware that 80,000 public sector workers are taking strike action in Northern Ireland tomorrow?  It is part of a 3 million strong strike in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales in response to serious attacks on living standards and the policy of the British Government.  Again, like in this country, it is the working class that must pay for the crisis.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the concern of workers in the North or has he had an opportunity to meet with public sector workers or unions about swingeing cuts in public expenditure which threaten dire consequences?  The Northern Ireland Assembly is tasked with carrying through these cuts, the effects of which will be the downgrading or closure of accident and emergency departments, the closure of schools and the loss of thousands of jobs in the public sector.Does the Taoiseach agree that in Northern Ireland there is a higher than usual dependence on the public sector for historical reasons?  The public sector is a very important employer and also supports many jobs in the private sector.  Cuts such as these are very serious for the lives of working people and the working class in Northern Ireland.  Will the Taoiseach make it part of his business in regard to the North to urge the British Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly not to proceed with such cuts because of the damaging effect on workers and society in the North?  There will be a further intensification of the unemployment problem which, traditionally, has been quite serious in the North and has serious social and political repercussions, apart from the repercussions on the lives of the unemployed and those who are dependent on the public sector.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Deputy Higgins is correct that Northern Ireland has a high proportion of workers in the public sector.  On the evening I was there to meet the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, MLA, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, MLA, in Stormont Castle the Northern Ireland Assembly had approved its fiscal programme for the next period and had published it that day.  That is its response and deliberation on how it sees Northern Ireland developing.  A degree of confidence was expressed by both Ministers in regard to business and the economy in general, although it is challenging.  Part of their analysis and discussion centres around consideration being given to the possibility of a reduction in the corporate tax rate to make it more equivalent to the rate here in the context of the island economy.  However, that is a matter for themselves and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and it would have to take into account compensatory measures.For many years and for a variety of reasons Northern Ireland has had serious budget deficits and both Ministers, the Assembly and the Executive are well aware of the challenge they face.  Cutbacks in any location or sector are difficult at any time, but it is a matter for the Assembly to make decisions about reducing its cost base, increasing competitiveness and taking the opportunity to grow jobs and increase employment in Northern Ireland.  Yes, the number of public sector workers was extraordinarily high in the past and that is now being addressed in the fiscal programme agreed and published by the Assembly.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I wish to return to the Pat Finucane case.  I agree with the Taoiseach's expression of concern for all the victims.  Sinn Féin represents many of those victims.  I know many of them and their families.  They include members of my family, so I have an affinity with what the Taoiseach said on the issue.  The Taoiseach also took the opportunity of responding to my question about Pat Finucane to set out his opposition to the IRA's armed campaign.  His position is a matter of historical fact.  He also asserts that there was no collusion between this State and the IRA, which I also believe to be true.However, it is also a matter of fact that the establishment here turned its back for decades on the people in the North.  In some cases, elements in the services here, such as the heavy gangs, particularly during that period in the 1970s under a dreadful Fine Gael-led Government, set aside many of the rights of citizens, including the rights of people who were not engaged with any armed groups but were simply strongly nationalist or republican.  There were many instances of injustice.  In the Taoiseach's native county, the hijacking of the remains of Frank Stagg was a dreadfully dark chapter.  Censorship under section 31 was nothing to be proud of.  In all of that the issue of collusion between elements in this State and elements of the British security forces does arise, famously in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and in other cases, including in my constituency of Louth.  All of these issues must be probed.  Perhaps we should have a wide ranging debate on these matters at some time.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I remind the Deputy that this is Question Time, not a debate.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	135	Yes.  To return to the question about Pat Finucane, I would like if the Taoiseach will go further than simply noting the suggestions I made.  If a government has an agreement with another government and the other government breaches that agreement, there is a duty on the government that is the injured party to draw upon the strengths, influence and goodwill it has to seek adjudication on the issue.  Remember that in this case a lawyer, an officer of the court, who was acting in a human rights brief was killed and it is strongly suspected he was killed by agents of the British state.  There is a huge duty on the Taoiseach to come forward at some point — if he does not wish to do so today, that is fair enough because this issue will continue to be raised — and give an outline of what the Government has done to get the British Government to fulfil its commitments on this matter.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	136	Deputy Martin raised a question which I did not answer earlier.  The only facility to arrange this is not for the House but is between the Governments, and that obviously means at the level of Taoiseach and British Prime Minister.  When the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, called me about his decision to appoint Desmond de Silva QC to review the papers in regard to the Finucane case, which run to over 1 million, I pointed out to him that the House had adopted a very clear all-party motion on this and that we would continue to press for the public inquiry recommended by Judge Peter Cory.  The Prime Minister said the Government did not wish to go down the road of having an interminable line of public inquiries.  I reminded him that this was part of the overall agreement at Weston Park, arising from the recommendations of Judge Cory, which was followed through here with the Smithwick tribunal.  That is why on each occasion I have the opportunity to meet with the British Prime Minister I will raise this, arising from the all-party approval given in the House, and because it is necessary to do so at government level.I understand the sensitivities of this and how it can upset people but the question that was raised with me following my meeting with the Northern Ireland Ministers, Danny Kennedy, MLA, and Arlene Foster, MLA, was an assumption that there was State collusion here with killers, who could go to Northern Ireland, do their bloody and foul deeds and return to safe havens.  I was very clear in my response to that.  While I fully understand the sensitivity and the sorrow of every family who lost a member through those bad times, I reiterate that the IRA was the enemy of this State and people in our Defence Forces, the Garda, the Army and civilians, ordinary citizens, lost their lives because of those kinds of activities.  In expressing that sorrow for every victim, I ask if we would not be in a different place if we did not have over 3,000 deaths.The point I raised again directly was that in the Finucane case there was a recommendation that there be a public inquiry by Judge Cory and that we had followed through in dealing with our end of it.  Nobody expects that we will have 190 public inquiries and when Minister Bell gave me the list and told me he would like me to talk to some of the people from his locality who had been deprived of family members through this kind of activity, he was very strong on that.  I want to be equally clear here that the IRA and its personnel were the enemies of this State.  People lost their lives because of decisions taken, either authorised or unauthorised, within the IRA.For my part, I will continue to raise this with the British Prime Minister in a situation where clearly there was a recommendation for a public inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane.  I said that to his wife, his son and to his lawyer, and I said it publicly.  That is why it is important because it was in the Weston Park discussions, and the Cory recommendation was very clear.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	137	A number of issues arise in such a large volume of questions and we will not get time to get through everything but specifically arising out of the Taoiseach's reply and in the context of Question No. 15, and the question relating to Dr. Alaisdair McDonnell and the issues of common concern, the Taoiseach referred to the A5 project as a deferral rather than an abandonment.  Originally, it was announced as an abandonment of the road project.  When I first heard about this I said one could be cynical and say there are no votes for Fine Gael or Labour in the North.  This is the first serious doubt that has been put on a project, and several projects in terms of infrastructure, that had an all-island context to it and that was putting flesh on the bone in terms of a genuine development of synergies between the Northern Ireland economy and the economy of the Republic because we bemoaned for years the lack of two-way traffic.  That is the reason InterTradeIreland was established to develop stronger links and synergies between businesses on both sides of the Border.  I saw this as a significant decision by the former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, who drove it when he was Minister for Finance and subsequently as Taoiseach, but it also makes sense in terms of enhancing the productive capacity of the island's economy.I appeal to the Taoiseach to reverse the decision because there is a danger that we are playing politics with the projects in terms of throwing a few bob a year at them to keep them afloat but in essence it will be a long way down the line before anything will happen.  Commitments had been entered into and given the shared journey we have travelled on the island of Ireland regarding all of the issues, this one issue of the infrastructural development and the road projects is moving the situation into a new territory and a new phase, and I believe it will come back to haunt the State if it is seen to be resiling from heartfelt commitments given not just by the previous Government, but by the entire Oireachtas in voting through the moneys for those projects.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	138	Could I ask one brief question before the Taoiseach replies?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	139	Yes.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	140	The Taoiseach might know this but for his information, the decision on the M2-A5 project was part of the St. Andrews Agreement.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Clearly it is a matter of choice.  A previous Government stated it would put up €400 million for this development which was to be a dual carriageway to Derry.  Everybody supports good transport and the lines of trade that follow from that but in consideration of the capital programme we published here of almost €17 billion over the period of the programme, we had to make choices to defer metro north, the joining up of rail links, the Navan line, the western rail corridor and the vast majority of major road infrastructure in the Republic.  We were not in a position to provide them because the money is simply not available and, against that background, we recognise the importance of the connection across to the north west and beyond Derry into Donegal, which would free up lines to Dublin.  The consideration was also one for the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly because there is a substantial amount of money involved.We made a formal Cabinet decision that €25 million would be provided in 2015 and in 2016.  The discussions I had with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in Stormont Castle concerned the possibility of rejigging the Executive's own financial projections for the years ahead, in other words, how could the moneys to be provided through the Assembly and the Executive be adjusted to cater for an injection of €50 million from the Government here between 2015 and 2016?This road development is to be in three phases — to Sion Mills, Aughnacloy and further south.  Having stated this was a clear Cabinet decision for a €50 million injection, which we could have abandoned and put into projects here, and because of its importance and its link, the question of whether it be a road facility project that would be revised downwards, that is, from motorway to whatever, and the adjustment of the fiscal programme by the Executive and Assembly in Northern Ireland, we agreed that the officials from the two Departments would meet the following week to discuss a rejigging of that proposal.As I said in my reply, I discussed this with First Minister Robinson and Deputy First Minister McGuinness in Dublin Castle at the inauguration of President Higgins and also in Stormont Castle and I was absolutely clear that is the decision we have made, cutting cloth according to measure as circumstances economically are now very different from what they were when a previous Taoiseach stated we would put in €400 million.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	142	We imposed €6 billion in cuts last year and kept it in.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	143	We have given them clarity on €50 million — €25 million in 2015 and €25 million in 2016 — and the officials were to work out the detail of how that is to apply.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I take the opportunity also to express my sympathies on the Taoiseach's family loss.Does it give the Taoiseach any pause for thought in implementing the policies of austerity dictated by the troika, given the massive mobilisation that will take place in the North of Ireland tomorrow which will see 80,000 to 100,000 public sector workers come out against attempts to essentially cut their pay and increase their pension contributions to pay for an economic crisis they did not create?  This will be an unprecedented mobilisation in the North and across Britain of people, our nearest neighbours, who are saying they are not accepting this and that it is not right or just that ordinary workers should have to pay for a crisis other people created.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	145	Sorry, Deputy, that is not one of the questions.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Does the proximity of these events make the Taoiseach pause for thought in that we are pursuing the same policies here and imposing the same unfairness on public sector workers, other workers and vulnerable sectors of society?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	147	That is a separate issue.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Was that discussed at the Ministerial Council meeting?I would also like to ask about the Aughnacloy to Derry upgrade.  It is lamentable that the State is pulling back from these infrastructural projects.  Given that there is some level of commitment to continue with this project, can the Taoiseach investigate suggestions made by some of our party colleagues in Derry that there are serious questions to be answered about the huge expenditure on consultants that has been sanctioned to date both by the Northern Ireland Executive and by ourselves, in so far as we have any involvement in it?  We are talking about millions of euro going to big consultancy firms.  The Government should look into how money is being spent on these infrastructural projects, who is getting the money and what precisely these consultants are doing for a project that has not yet moved one inch.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for his expression of condolence.  I appreciate it.  We too have often questioned the work of consultants over the years.  I assume that if this was to be designed to motorway status in the first instance, then consultants would have been employed.  I do not have a figure for what was allocated to consultants who worked on the road design, whether any of them was employed by this State or what process was followed.  If that figure becomes available, I will send it to the Deputy.In respect of the public sector protest march against cutbacks, every group takes its own actions.  As I replied to Deputy Higgins earlier, there was a huge dependence on public sector workers in Northern Ireland for many years.  The Executive clearly considered the implications of the economy of Northern Ireland for the next number of years.  It took all these things into account and passed its programme on the day I was to meet the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.  No more than here, people are perfectly entitled to protest provided that they are peaceful.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	150	It is now late 2011 and the Taoiseach has stated that €25 million will be provided for the A5 in 2015 and 2016.  I ask him to reconsider that.  Following the North-South Ministerial Council meeting, I would have thought there would have been a review of our commitment to the A5.  The infrastructural development that has occurred on the island has been of huge benefit to the economy, in terms of the movement of goods, services and people.  The completion of the A5, as originally envisaged, would have a transformative impact on the North-South economy and on the island economy as a whole.  I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider his decision on this.  When we had to bring in a budget with €6 billion worth of cuts last year, including cuts to the capital programme, the then Government still managed to preserve the provision for the A5 upgrade.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I hear the Deputy's proposal.  The Cabinet made a clear decision, given the economic circumstances that prevail, that €25 million would be made available in 2015 and in 2016.  I conveyed this very clearly to the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.  The officials on both sides were tasked with a readjustment of the fiscal programme to cater for that.  We discussed that directly with the two Ministers involved.In the west and the north west, much other work is continuing in third level institutions.  The Minister for Education and Skills had a very useful bilateral meeting, and discussed the payment from the Government for radiotherapy facilities at Altnagelvin Area Hospital and other cross-Border activities in the north west.The redesign and readjustment of the fiscal programme will now take into account the clear decision of the Government.  While it is not all that was envisaged in the first place, neither are the economic circumstances, but the decision brings clarity to things.  The Executive and the officials here will now work on the adjustment of the fiscal programme to cater for the three sections of the road involved.  We are not in any way abandoning the project, but will see it through to fruition in the three stages outlined.Written Answers follow Adjournment.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	154	It is not agreed.  The referral to committee, without debate, of Vote 34, dealing with jobs, enterprise and innovation, relates to an underspend in Enterprise Ireland of €12 million.  Given that there is such a crisis for indigenous enterprises and their difficulties and failure to source funding, there should be a debate on why €12 million has been underspent in Enterprise Ireland.  I ask the Government to allow such a debate.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	177	It is not agreed.  I oppose the proposal of the Taoiseach in this regard because it is completely inappropriate to guillotine the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Bill 2011.  The Order of Business as proposed only allows for half an hour to complete Committee and Report and Final Stages despite the fact that Opposition parties have tabled 21 amendments.  The amendments are serious, substantive and are designed to save the taxpayer money.  Are we serious about political reform?  I am unsure what it says about the attitude of the Government in terms of political reform when it seeks to use its overwhelming majority to ram through a measure such as this in half an hour.  It is incredible and unjustified.  I call for this to be reconsidered and for some time to be allowed to debate Committee and Report Stages.  Even if a vote is taken on Second Stage, as the order stands the vote would take time out of the half an hour allocated for discussion of 21 amendments.  This is farcical in terms of how we order our business in the House.  I call on the Taoiseach to reconsider this and to allow time for Committee and Report Stages tomorrow.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I oppose the guillotine imposed on the debate.  This totally flies against the Taoiseach's assertion that he seeks a more open, inclusive and transparent Dáil.  Half an hour is allocated for more than 20 amendments of which our party has put forward a substantial number.  Our Deputies have done their work diligently but the debate will not get beyond the second or third amendment.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I call Deputy Boyd Barrett on behalf of People Before Profit.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I think they know that by now but I appreciate the point.  It is completely unacceptable to impose a guillotine on this Bill.  The financial emergency measures are taken in the context of the current economic crisis that we are facing.  We all agree that emergency measures are necessary but one must have time to debate them.  People throughout the House will have ideas about what is in the Bill and what should be in the Bill.  We want time to hear and consider the debate and to put forward amendments and suggestions for the type of financial emergency measures we need to deal with the current economic situation.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to lift the guillotine and to allow for a proper debate and proper consideration of the Bill.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	181	We can be helpful to the Taoiseach.  Until yesterday, the draft schedule included the Local Government (Household Charges) Bill 2011 for Thursday and had approximately five hours of debating time set aside for it, too little time in any case.  Despite the Tánaiste promising me on Thursday that legislation would be with us at the weekend and that it would be debated on Thursday, we have not had sight of it and it has been withdrawn from discussion on Thursday.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	199	Notwithstanding the very significant commitments in regard to mortgage interest relief for hard-pressed householders and the undertakings in regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the Keane report, will the Taoiseach indicate when he envisages the personal insolvency Bill will be brought before the House?  In addition, will the Government take a more proactive approach to progressing the Bill brought forward by Deputy Michael McGrath through the House as urgently as possible?  That legislation would give genuine relief to hard-pressed mortgage holders and people with significant household debt.  A considerable period has passed since the publication of the Keane report and there is no evidence of anything emanating from the Government side.  Deputy McGrath's Bill should be progressed, not simply left to rest indefinitely with the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.

Mortgage holders throughout the country have been struggling for the past four years and are now in a very vulnerable situation.  I applaud the Government's efforts thus far in this area.  It is hugely important that we proceed with the necessary realignments as soon as possible.

We expect the full and final Bill to be published in the first quarter of 2012.  There are several very technical and complex issues involved.In respect of mortgages generally, this is a matter of considerable concern to us.  The banking policy division of the Department of Finance has been requested to continue its discussions with the banks in order to bring about implementation of several measures in the Keane report.  Some of the issues can be dealt with more quickly than others.  The report was discussed in the House.  It is an issue of very considerable importance to the Government and to everybody else.

#EricJByrne	unknown-#EricJByrne-party	unknown-#EricJByrne-dob	unknown-#EricJByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for choosing this topic.  I expected to see the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, as he is the relevant Minister.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Quiet please, in the Gallery.
#EricJByrne	unknown-#EricJByrne-party	unknown-#EricJByrne-dob	unknown-#EricJByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I raise this issue as I believe urgent steps must be taken by the Minister — hopefully he will return to the Chamber soon — and this Government to tackle the increasing problem of racially-provoked attacks on foreign national members of our community.  These racist incidents cover the entire spectrum including physical, verbal and psychological attacks.  As Irish society becomes more diverse, our primary agenda as parliamentarians in tackling the problem of racially provoked attacks should be to make Irish society more inclusive, tolerant and open to accepting and understanding our new friends and neighbours who have come to Ireland from other countries.While attacks on members of our new communities cannot be deemed to be racist in all cases, there is substantial evidence to suggest that racism is on the increase in Ireland.  A very recent and tragic example was the attack on and subsequent death of Moses Ayanwole, a Nigerian taxi-driver.  This attack has created great fear in the African community.  I spoke to the leaders of the African community in Ireland at a press conference in Buswells Hotel and their fear is palpable.  I refer also to the horrendous attack on Alexandra Trotsenko, an artist whose three fingers were severed in a burglary attack on her home.  There has been an allegation of a gang rape of a young African girl.  I also wish to highlight the sad and tragic experience in my constituency of Dublin South-Central when two Polish men were savagely beaten and killed with a screwdriver.  I commend the work of the integration centre, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Show Racism the Red Card and Dublin City Council's office for integration.  These bodies do tremendous work in attempting to counteract racism in Irish society on very limited budgets and with stretched resources.  Not enough is being done.  I ask the Department of Justice and Equality and specifically the office for the promotion of migrant integration to work closely with these bodies to have a sustained and targeted campaign to tackle racism in all its forms in our society.The Minister of State will be aware it is Government and local government policy that Ireland and Dublin, in particular, are internationally marketed as a country and city open for business.  Dublin is marketed as an open, friendly, tolerant, diverse and welcoming city.  Students from countries as diverse as China and Oman have been invited to come to Ireland to study and our universities are encouraged to look wide and far for international students.  The Department of Health has recruited people from India and Pakistan to fill the skills shortage in the health service.  We must take urgent action to prevent the spread of racism.  If racism, and in particular racially-motivated attacks, continue to occur, these will have a detrimental impact on the economic progress of our society.  The reputational damage for Ireland or Dublin will be massive if racism takes a foothold.  It is essential that we are seen as an attractive place for inward investment and therefore racism must be tackled.  Foreign multinational companies will not invest in a country that is open to racism.  I conclude on that point but I hope to deal with some additional points after the Minister of State has spoken.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	225	The Deputy will have the opportunity for a supplementary question.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I compliment the Deputy on his ongoing commitment to this issue and he has spoken out against racism over a long period.Recent attacks on foreign national members of the community are the subject of ongoing Garda investigations and therefore I cannot comment on these cases nor on whether any racist motivation was involved.  Any such attack must be strongly condemned and I urge anyone with any information to assist the Garda Síochána in its investigations.Ireland has strong legislation prohibiting incitement to racial hatred along with robust equality legislation supported by an institutional infrastructure to promote equality and to provide redress where discrimination, including discrimination on grounds of race, occurs.  There are currently a number of official mechanisms in place to record complaints of both racist crime and racial discrimination.  All crime statistics, including statistics on reports of racially-motivated crime, are collated by the Central Statistics Office, using the data elicited from the Pulse system of An Garda Síochána.  Information on reported criminal racist incidents from 2006 onwards is publicly available on the website of the office for the promotion of migrant integration and is broken down into ten different categories of crimes.  The Central Statistics Office advises me that a further breakdown of the data in relation to, for example, gender and geographic location, is not made publicly available as this could lead to the identification of individual cases.  The trends in these statistics are monitored by the office for the promotion of migrant integration and are updated on a regular basis.There is no evidence of a significant upward trend in reported incidences of racist crime.  In 2009, the total number of reported racist crimes was 128.  In 2010, the total number of reported racist crimes was 122.  The total number of reported racist crimes for the first three quarters of 2011 was 112.  There is, however, no room for complacency and the Government is committed to combating and challenging any and all manifestations of racism.  Depending on the nature of the racist incident, members of the public can report to a number of other organisations besides An Garda Síochána, including the Equality Authority, the Equality Tribunal, which deals with complaints of discrimination in the provision of goods and services and in employment, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, for complaints against members of the force, the Office of the Press Ombudsman, the crime victims helpline and the Irish Internet hotline.  Contact information about the various organisations and the avenues available to the public, in addition to a range of statistics on reported incidents, are available on the website of the office for the promotion of migrant integration and also the organisations which the Deputy has identified and which have played a significant part in ensuring that people who come here from abroad are helped to integrate.Ireland was one of the first states in the EU and, indeed, in the world, to develop a national action plan against racism.  The plan was launched in 2005 and it was conceived as a four-year programme to run until the end of 2008.  It was designed to provide strategic direction towards developing a more intercultural and inclusive society in Ireland and was largely integration driven.  Under the plan, support was provided towards the development of a number of national and local strategies to promote greater integration in our workplaces, in An Garda Síochána, in the health service, in our education system, in the arts and sports sectors and within our local authorities.The Deputy outlined all these areas in his contribution.  The remainder of the reply will be available to the Deputy.
#EricJByrne	unknown-#EricJByrne-party	unknown-#EricJByrne-dob	unknown-#EricJByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I thought the Minister, Deputy Shatter, would be dealing with this topic and I do not wish to embarrass him in his absence.  If he had been present I would have said to him that this gentleman from Naas, Councillor Scully, has done irreparable harm to race relations particularly in the Kildare area.  He has achieved notoriety by his statements.  I suggest to our coalition partners that the leadership of Fine Gael is very slow in properly reprimanding that gentleman who has undermined completely the work of people engaged in promoting integration policies.  He should have been expelled from the Fine Gael Party the day he did that radio interview.In the past, there was a Minister of State who worked closely with the Dublin City Council office for integration in targeting racism and bringing about integration.  There is a bit of a disjoint and I appeal to the Government to make sufficient funding available, particularly to the office for integration in Dublin so it can work more positively in addressing the integration issue and combating racism.I applaud Dublin City Council.  I remind Deputies that Dublin has been ranked fourth of 29 cities by the Council of Europe on the basis of integrationist policies.  We must redouble our efforts to create the type of society on which our international economic policy is built, namely, one which is open to inward capital and labour.  We must also support integrationist policies to ensure people go out of their way to come here to live and work.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I again thank the Deputy.  It is particularly important that elected representatives are careful in the language they use, not only on race but across a range of issues.  Local authorities must drive policy on these issues and ensure that people with a disability or mental health issue and those from different cultures, races and nationalities live in comfort and security in our communities.  I commend Cork City Council on its forum and Dublin City Council on ensuring the capital is close to the top of the league in terms of openness to outsiders.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this topical issue, particularly as I was unable to contribute on the Private Members' motion on mental health tabled last week.  The tragic death of Gary Speed in England at the weekend highlighted the issue of suicide, as did two recent tragedies in County Kildare in the past two weeks when people took their own lives.  Globally, the equivalent of one quarter of the population of Ireland take their own lives each year.  Last year, 486 people died by suicide in the Republic.  We should bear in mind that for every suicide, at least 20 people attempt to take their own lives.  This figure does not take into consideration the number of people who self-harm and may or may not be admitted to accident and emergency units.The safeTALK training programme is one of the suicide prevention training programmes available through the Health Service Executive's suicide prevention resource officers and their partner agencies.  It is co-ordinated by the National Office of Suicide Prevention, NOSP.  According to the NOSP, safeTALK is a half-day training course which prepares participants to identify persons who have thoughts of suicide and connect them to suicide first aid personnel and resources.  These specific skills, known as suicide alertness, are taught with the expectation that the person learning them will use them to help reduce suicide risk in their communities.It is interesting to note that safeTALK is one of a number of suicide prevention programmes which provided training to 3,689 people 2010.  This begs the question as to whether a sufficient number of people are being trained in suicide prevention.  I am informed that the target ratio for such training is to reach one in eight people.  Based on the figures available to me, the ratio achieved here is one in 550 people.  We must ensure funding and staff are available to co-ordinate and offer safeTALK to as many people as possible.  There are 89 trainers of the programme.  In one area, the number of safeTALK trainers has declined from ten to four.The benefits of the safeTALK course are straightforward.  It offers a large number of people a learning process by which they can discover precisely how to recognise individuals who may have thoughts of suicide.  Other courses are also available, for example, Reach Out and ASIST, the latter of which is aimed at professionals.  In addition, a new dialectical behaviour therapy, DBT, programme is being rolled out.  The beauty of the safeTALK course is that it focuses on young people aged from 18 years and upwards.  It is widely recognised that the 18 to 26 years age group is the most vulnerable to suicide.  The two and a half hour course, which is not time consuming and is not as advanced as the ASIST course, has been internationally recognised, having proved successful in many countries.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I thank Deputy Lawlor for raising this issue which, as he will be aware, is close to my heart.  The Deputy has also done considerable work on suicide in his locality.I recognise the importance of the safeTALK suicide prevention course which is one of a number of suicide prevention training programmes available through the Health Service Executive suicide prevention resource officers and partner agencies, including the Defence Forces, National Youth Council of Ireland, national Traveller suicide prevention project and RehabCare.  To revert to the topic we discussed a few moments ago, we must be conscious of the need to ensure the safeTALK and ASIST programmes are culturally appropriate.International and national evidence shows that for suicide prevention training to be effective it needs to be done in a co-ordinated and targeted manner.  No single training programme is effective within communities on its own and a higher proportion of community members need to complete suicide awareness training with smaller proportions of health professionals or community gatekeepers completing suicide prevention alertness and skills programmes.  The HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, recommends and funds the delivery of suicide prevention training programmes across the country, including the safeTALK programme, a half-day training course which trains participants to identify persons with thoughts of suicide and connect them to people and agencies.  Training in the programme was provided in 2010 in 199 workshops to some 3,600 people and continued in 2011.The National Office for Suicide Prevention continues to work with key professional and community group, such as the Garda Síochána, Fire Service and education personnel, to ensure the most appropriate programmes are delivered across these groups.  We must seriously consider making participation in the programme a compulsory element of health and safety programmes in all jobs and workplaces.  Surely suicide prevention awareness is as important as insisting that employees are taught how to lift heavy items or deal with fires in the workplace.  We must start to speak to the whole of government about how to make suicide prevention part and parcel of everyday training.The National Office for Suicide Prevention is responsible for the implementation of Reach Out, our policy strategy on suicide prevention which outlines the actions that need to be taken to prevent suicide and deliberate self-harm and increase awareness of the importance of good mental health and well-being.  Reach Out identified the development of a national training programme as one of the key priorities for the NOSP.  Funding for suicide prevention activities is approximately €9 million in 2011.  This figure includes the annual budget of €4.1 million for the National Office for Suicide Prevention and €5 million which is used to fund resource officers for suicide prevention, self-harm nurses in accident and emergency departments and the development of local suicide prevention initiatives.Apart from the development and implementation of the national training programme, a number of suicide prevention initiatives have been progressed in recent years, including the development of mental health awareness campaigns, continued support for voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention and the launch of a "tough economic times" information and training programme for the staff of organisations such as Citizens Information and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.I acknowledge that there is a great deal of commitment in many sectors to tackle this serious health and social issue.  The Government's commitment to the development of our mental health services, in line with A Vision for Change and Reach Out, was clearly shown in the programme for Government, which provided for €35 million to be ring-fenced from within the overall health budget each year.  This money will be used to develop community mental health services, to ensure early access to more appropriate services for adults and children and to implement Reach Out.  This is being considered as part of the Estimates process for 2011 and future years.  We must continue to work together to identify people at risk and ensure appropriate services are in place to provide the help and support needed.  I have not even dealt with the issue of stigma and the reasons people do not reach out for help.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.  I took part in the SafeTALK training programme in the Oireachtas a number of weeks ago.  I was the only Deputy to do so, unfortunately.  There were some other people there.  Another training course is taking place this Thursday.  I encourage as many Deputies as possible to take the course.  We deal with people who may have suicidal thoughts.  We need to be able to recognise if that is the case.  We should be in a position to identify that at an early stage.  Deputies deal with people who are under pressure for all sorts of reasons.  The possibility may exist that some of these people might consider taking their own lives.  The last thing a Deputy wants is for someone who has passed through his or her office to decide eventually to take his or her own life because he or she cannot deal with the pressures that exist in this country.  I encourage as many Deputies as possible to attend the SafeTALK programme on Thursday.  If they are not in a position to do so, perhaps their staff might attend instead.I welcome the Minister of State's repeated commitment to ring-fencing the HSE's mental health budget of €35 million.  It is vitally important that we send a signal that we are serious about mental health and that we intend to reduce the number of people who take their own lives each year.  I welcome the Minister of State's comments about the stigma associated with mental health matters.  One of the reasons I am in favour of the SafeTALK course is that it ensures as many people as possible in the community are aware of the problem of suicide.  If more people talk about and highlight this problem, it will surely be prevented in the future.  We need to send a serious signal that we are determined to reduce the scourge of suicide in our communities.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I thank the Deputy.  I agree with him that we need to talk about this matter every time we get an opportunity to do so.  It is no longer a hidden subject.  We have to get rid of the taboo that surrounds it.  We need to start breaking the silence that is causing the stigma, which in turn is preventing people from reaching out for help.  When people decide to reach out, we need to be able to point them in the direction of the help that is offered by those who have been trained in programmes like ASIST and SafeTALK.  Sometimes we have to provide that help ourselves.  I thank the Deputy again.  The more we can talk about this matter, the better.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important topic.  I refer to the recent resignation from a Government high level co-ordinating group of the president of the Olympic Council of Ireland, Mr. Pat Hickey.  The group was established to find ways in which Ireland could capitalise on the fact that next year's Olympic Games are being held in London.  In particular, it was charged with identifying and pursuing business and tourism opportunities.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, when I say I am disappointed that the Minister of State with line responsibility for this area is not in the House.  When this endeavour was instigated, the Government indicated that senior Ministers and Ministers of State with line responsibility would be in the House on a daily basis.  That seems to have slipped.  It is unhelpful to this process, which is about giving Opposition Deputies an opportunity to question the relevant Minister in some detail about specific matters.  With the greatest respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, who is very competent and well-versed in his own area, it is clear that he cannot be expected to respond to me in the kind of detail I am seeking today.  I am not making a negative reference to the Minister of State when I make that point.I am extremely concerned about some of the comments made by Mr. Hickey in the letter of resignation he sent to the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Ring.  He said he was "disillusioned" with the level of progress being made by the London 2012 co-ordinating group.  He referred to the group as a "toothless talking shop".  He said it has achieved nothing, in essence, over the past two years.  That is a damning indictment of the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Ring, and the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  We were all happy when a senior official like Mr. Hickey, who has considerable experience, took a position on the co-ordinating group.  He brought with him his network of contacts around the world.  We had high hopes when this group was established by the former Minister, John O'Donoghue, to co-ordinate the roles of sport and tourism in assisting the promotion of Ireland's efforts and endeavours in this regard.During statements on sport in the Seanad in early October, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, said he was chairing a high level co-ordinating group which is identifying opportunities for Ireland across the sports, tourism, cultural and enterprise sectors from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  The Minister of State mentioned that tourism opportunities were being pursued.  The president of the Olympic Council of Ireland, Mr. Pat Hickey, seemed to be suggesting the opposite when he said — I do not want to be repetitive — that it is a "toothless talking shop".  The previous Government was accused of establishing various quangos that had little or no effect and no capacity to intervene in important areas.  This country's proximity to the host country of the 2012 Olympic Games should be a startling opportunity.  However, we seem to be failing miserably to capitalise on it.  My understanding is that many national delegations have already made arrangements for their teams.  Various incentives have been offered by England.  These countries are taking up opportunities in the host country.  It seems ludicrous that we have failed in a real way to capitalise on that and thereby benefit the country from a long-term perspective.We need urgent clarity from the Government on the progress of the high level London 2012 co-ordinating group.  We want the Minister of State to clarify or outline the number of Irish cultural events, for example, that will take place in London next year.  Can he give details of the different measures that will be taken to promote Ireland as a destination for those attending the Olympic Games?  I do not expect the Minister of State to be able to answer my questions but I will pose them anyway.  Have the Minister of State with responsibility for sport and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, been in contact with any of the delegations?  Has face-to-face contact been made with the delegations from around the world that will attend the Olympic Games in London?  Have the Minister or the Minister of State contacted the relevant sports ministers in other countries and jurisdictions by telephone or in person?  Has the Government taken a hands-on approach to encouraging teams to base themselves in Ireland and thereby benefit this country during the important phase I have mentioned?
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I am replying on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, who is the chair of the London 2012 co-ordinating group.  As the Minister of State is in Brussels for a meeting of European sports ministers today, he cannot respond to the Deputy in person.  The high level London 2012 co-ordinating group, which was established in 2009, is looking at opportunities for Ireland across the sports, tourism, cultural and enterprise sectors that arise from the proximity of next year's Olympic and Paralympic Games in London.  The group comprises representatives of the Irish Sports Council, Paralympics Ireland, Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Arts Council, Culture Ireland, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  A letter from Mr. Hickey advising of his resignation from the London 2012 co-ordinating group was received by the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, last week.  The Minister of State responded to Mr. Hickey on 24 November last to thank him for his contribution to the group since its inception.  While the Minister notes Mr. Hickey's views regarding the group, he believes the group has been most effective in its brief to identify opportunities across all sectors that can benefit from the London games.  The discussions of the London 2012 co-ordinating group are taking into account the current economic situation and the findings of the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics task force report, which was published in 2009.The taskforce report made several recommendations arising from an audit carried out of high quality sports facilities in Ireland and the findings of a report by Indecon, International Economic Consultants, on the economic evaluation of the benefit to the island of Ireland of the London Olympic Games.  It concluded the largest potential benefits of the games were in the enterprise and tourism sectors and these are being actively pursued.  Enterprise Ireland is pursuing opportunities for Irish business and to date, Irish companies have secured over €300 million worth of contracts relating to the games.The tourism agencies are working closely with a range of partners at home and overseas to maximise the tourism opportunities.  Tourism Ireland is working with several official agencies and official sponsors of the Olympic Games to bring incentive and corporate meetings to Ireland during the games.  Several familiarisation visits have taken place and further visits are planned to secure this lucrative business.  Tourism Ireland is continuing to pursue this area with the key agencies in London.To secure additional business for Ireland both as a result of displacement and additional long-haul opportunities, Tourism Ireland is working closely with tour operators in all markets.  The visa waiver scheme presents additional opportunities which are being exploited.  Tourism Ireland is also working with the official operators in several markets to assist them in offering package extensions to Ireland for their clients who are attending the games.  The agency is also working on an extensive consumer campaign during 2012 to target displaced Londoners and those wishing to escape the games.  These are just a number of the areas that Tourism Ireland, in conjunction with the London 2012 co-ordinating group, is exploring to maximise the potential from the games.A proposal was made to Tourism Ireland on the Ireland House concept raised by Mr. Hickey, seeking funding of between €50,000 and €300,000, which was evaluated.  Tourism Ireland considers this proposal would not make sense for the organisation as a stand-alone project or did not justify an investment of this scale by the taxpayer, particularly in the current budgetary conditions.The potential to attract international athletes to train in Ireland in the lead-up to the games is another issue that the co-ordinating group has been pursuing.  Several international teams, including the US synchronised swimming team and the UK Paralympic swimming team, have chosen the National Aquatic Centre as a training base, a reflection of the world-class calibre of this facility.The Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport is working on attracting other teams to train here and has prepared a CD outlining the facilities available in Ireland which has been distributed to all embassies abroad and to national Olympic committees around the world.  A difficulty that arises in attracting teams is that the UK is offering financial incentives to international teams to train there in the lead up to the games and it is not possible to provide such incentives here.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseAnother recent positive development around the London games is that the Irish Hockey Association has secured the hosting rights for a men's Olympic qualifying tournament which will be held at the National Hockey Stadium in UCD next March.  This event will give Irish people a flavour of London 2012 and will enhance the Irish hockey team's opportunity to qualify for the games.The cultural agencies are also developing a number of proposals for a cultural programme around the games.  I have given a brief outline of the wide range of issues that the London 2012 co-ordinating group is considering.  The group will continue to meet regularly over the next year to ensure the various initiatives already agreed by the group are brought to fruition.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, for his frank position but it is not adequate that the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, is not present in the Chamber.This co-ordinating group seems to have identified opportunities arising from the London 2012 Olympic Games.  Unfortunately, many people can sit there and identify opportunities.  What is needed is an action plan to exploit these.  On what Mr. Hickey has said, this is not happening and the group is just a toothless talking shop.  Opportunities that existed have been lost.The Olympic Games will begin in nine months.  Due to the detailed planning involved for teams and even spectators, many have already decided their itineraries without including Ireland.  The horse has bolted; we are gone past the notion of sending out CDs.  Sending around Foster and Allen CDs to national Olympic committees is ridiculous.  With the relative size of its budget, a local authority puts together CDs to promote its county.  For the State to do so is an appalling and disappointing approach.  It speaks volumes of the so-called hands-on approach of the Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  We want the Government to provide an action plan.  We need the Minister to sell this country as a location for Olympic teams to his various counterparts across the world.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I do not know if Foster and Allen were involved in the production of the CD but I would not like Deputy Dooley to get the impression this is the sole action of the co-ordinating group.  Enterprise Ireland secured more than €300 million worth of contracts, a substantial outcome.  There is considerable communication between the Minister and embassies abroad in selling Ireland as a destination, particularly for training in the lead-up to the games.  We have been successful in attracting two teams already.  It must be remembered, however, we are competing with the UK which offers £25,000 to each team which decides to locate in the UK.  That is a difficult incentive to compete with in a time when we are faced with major budgetary constraints.I do not agree the horse has bolted.  The co-ordinating group meets regularly and will do so right up to the start of the games.  The group is scheduled to meet Tuesday next.  It is being most proactive in identifying any opportunity that may arise.  Its results to date indicate its efforts have been successful.  It gives the hope that they will have similar positive results in the run-up to the games.The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, would have been quite happy to respond personally to the Deputy on this matter in the Chamber this afternoon.  However, just as Deputy Dooley stressed the importance of Ministers going abroad to sell the country, the Minister of State is in Brussels at a meeting for European sports Ministers.  I am sure he will use every opportunity available to him to sell Ireland as a destination for Olympic teams and spectators.
#NickyMcFadden	unknown-#NickyMcFadden-party	unknown-#NickyMcFadden-dob	unknown-#NickyMcFadden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	237	For the record, Foster and Allen are a great Westmeath group.Coosan national school was originally built at its current site on the outskirts of Athlone in 1964 as a two-teacher country school.  In 1987, five new classes were built while the original two classrooms were converted into a general purpose room.  The current school consists of the main building, housing five mainstream classes, one language and two resource teachers with the general purpose room now again being used as a classroom.  A further eight mainstream classes, along with one language, one learning support and one resource teacher, are in prefabs.In 2005, the school enrolment stood at 247.  Now it is 351, a 42% increase.  Of the 351 pupils, 226, 64.5%, are being educated in prefabs.  Three of these prefabs are being rented at an annual cost to the Department of Education and Skills in excess of €32,000.  Two were purchased by the school's board of management and six are the property of the Department.  The school no longer has any form of indoor activities area — no gym, no hall, nowhere for band practice or assembly.The growth in enrolment is a direct result of increased housing development in the school's catchment area.  Growth in school-going numbers is expected to continue over the next four to five years as many young families have moved into the area.Having been originally sanctioned by the Department for development of a new 16-classroom school on the present site in January 2007 and with a design team having been appointed subject to Department approval, the process was put on hold due to "progression of all projects being reviewed under restructuring of the multi-annual building programme budget" in January 2008.  In other words, this was due to a lack of funding and the design team was not ratified.Communication between the Department and the school continued over the following two years, with the appointment of a departmental architect to the project and, eventually, in September 2010, the approval was reactivated and the board of management was advised by the Department to enter the process of appointing a design team under new guidelines.  The team was duly contracted in accordance with the Department's requirements in January 2011.  The team has presented reports to the Department to the point of completion of stage 1 of the development.  Subject to departmental approval, the school is ready to seek planning permission from Westmeath County Council.  In light of recent announcements regarding the Government's capital programme, as it relates to primary school developments, can the Minister of State update the House on the intention of the Department to proceed with the development of this national school?
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I am replying to this topical issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter, as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and to clarify the current position in regard to Coosan national school, County Westmeath.The school authority submitted an application for major capital funding in 1999.  As part of the assessment process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  The current major project for Coosan national school has been assigned a band rating of 1.1My Department is forecasting an increase of more than 45,000 primary pupils by the start of the 2017-18 school year.  The delivery of new schools together with extension projects to meet the needs of our increasing population of school going children, will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years.  The primary aim will be to ensure every child has access to a school place.  The Government's medium-term infrastructure and capital investment framework, which was published this month, includes an allocation for education capital of in excess of €2.2 billion over the five years of the plan — an average annual allocation of approximately €440 million.  The investment for the next five years will provide more than 100,000 permanent school places of which 80,000 will be additional school places; the remainder will be replacement of temporary or unsatisfactory accommodation.  This substantial investment will result in more than 11% of the total school population benefiting from new permanent places delivered between 2012 and 2016.Coosan national school has 13 teachers and it had 341 pupils enrolled in the 2010-11 school year.   Enrolments have increased by 24% in the school over the past five years.  The brief for the major capital project for the school will provide a new 16-classroom school and a two-classroom special needs unit on the existing site. The site is approximately 4.75 acres and it is located north of the gateway town of Athlone.  The existing school is a single storey structure constructed in 1953.  The project is currently at an early stage of architectural planning.  The design team was appointed in February 2011.  Officials from the planning and building unit of my Department met with the board of management as the client for the project and its design team in May to expedite the preliminary design process.The board of management and its design team are currently finalising the stage 1, initial sketch design report, which includes examining all design options on the site to facilitate the delivery of the required accommodation.  The design team has advised that all options to be considered will comply with my Department's technical requirements.  As part of the stage 1, the board of management and its design team have also held pre-planning discussions with the local authority.  Upon completion, the stage 1 report will be submitted by the board of management to my Department for technical review.  Thereafter, and assuming no issues arise, the next steps for the project will be the completion of stage 2(a), developed sketch design, and stage 2(b), which will include applications for planning permission, disability access certificate and fire safety certificate.The Minister has announced his intention to publish details of the school building programme for 2012 early next month.  Early in the new year, the Department will publish a five-year plan outlining the projects to be constructed in that time.  All school building projects, including that for Coosan national school, will be considered as part of this process.

The Minister is undertaking a major programme of construction which will, hopefully, negate the need to rent such units in the future.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The primary purpose of the Bill is to apply the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009 to serving members of the Judiciary in line with the decision of the people in the referendum on the Twenty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution.  The latter amended Article 35.5 of the Constitution in respect of judicial remuneration.  The proposed amendment to the Constitution was approved by both Houses.  The referendum on judicial pay, as proposed and put before the people, was passed by a significant majority — some 79% — on 27 October last.  The terms of the amendment were very carefully crafted from a legal and constitutional perspective in order to ensure that the ongoing independence of the Judiciary in carrying out its functions on a daily basis is maintained.  This is as it should be.  It would be a blow to our status as a constitutional democracy if there was even the perception, no matter how remote the possibility might be, of Government influence over decisions by judges on cases.  In approaching this issue, that constitutional imperative was an absolute priority for the Government.In my view, the role and standing of the Judiciary in our democracy is actually enhanced by these measures.  The measures proposed within the Bill uphold the obligation on all citizens to share their part of the burden of addressing the current severe fiscal crisis which the State faces.  The Bill provides for the application, equally and proportionately, to the Judiciary of the public service pension-related deduction and the same salary reductions as those applied to other public servants in 2009 by the previous Government.  Our late colleague, Brian Lenihan, stated in 2009 at that time that the decision to apply these measures was not taken lightly.  Their application in respect of public servants in 2009 and 2010 represented the first statutory reductions in public servants' pay since 1933.  That is an extraordinary fact and it highlights not only the exceptional nature of the measures but, equally, the depth of the crisis faced by the State.The essence of this crisis is summarised in the preamble to the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.  I wish to repeat what is set out in that preamble in order to set the backdrop to the measures being put forward in the Bill I am putting forward for Members' consideration.  The preamble refers to "a serious disturbance in the economy and a decline in the economic circumstances of the State", "serious deterioration in the revenues of the State", the need "to take urgent measures to reduce the significant shortfall between expenditure and revenue" and the need "to reduce State expenditure to maintain international confidence".  Most importantly, the preamble refers to the requirement "for the State to achieve significant savings in its expenditure, both directly and indirectly, on remuneration".Despite the difficult steps the country has already taken, it still faces an extraordinarily difficult fiscal challenge.  We are currently borrowing over €1.25 billion every month in order to pay our ongoing expenses.  This excludes any banking-related expenditure.  We are borrowing from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in order to continue funding our public services, pay costs, pensions and social welfare benefits.The Government is committed to sustainable, ongoing reductions in the overall cost of the public service pay bill.  This will be achieved through measures such as those included in the Bill, as well as through planned reductions in the numbers of public servants as set out in the programme for Government and through greater efficiencies in the way in which public services are delivered.  The Government has already introduced significant reforms and I announced further substantial proposed reforms when the Government's statement on the public service reform plan was published on 17 November last.  I will not discuss the details in this regard now.  The Members opposite will be at the meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform at which I will provide detailed presentations in respect of these matters where I hope we will be able to engage in some good interaction on them.In the context of pay, since taking office in March the Government has demonstrated a policy of salary reduction and restraint for higher earners in the public service.  On coming to office, all members of the Government accepted further reductions in their pay.  In June, the Government approved my proposals to introduce a general pay ceiling of €200,000 in respect of future appointments to higher positions across the public service, a general pay ceiling of €250,000 for future appointments to CEO positions within commercial semi-State bodies and a voluntary waiver of up to 15% for current post holders who have salaries in excess of the relevant pay ceilings.  Existing incumbents of posts in the public service that attract salaries in excess of the general pay ceilings adopted by Government have responded positively to my request for a voluntary waiver.  All new appointees to the public service are being made in line with the policy adopted by Government on pay ceilings.  New pay rates for Secretaries General of Departments were introduced in June, with a maximum rate set at €200,000.  This represents a reduction of almost 30% on the rate of Secretary General level 1 pay that obtained in September 2008 and it means that no civil servant can earn more than €200,000.  These new pay rates will also reduce Exchequer pension costs into the future in respect of all new appointees.  The savings that will arise under the terms of the Bill are relatively small, amounting to some €5.5 million.I wish to inform the House of my intention to bring forward an amendment to the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, which reduced public service pensions in payment and for those who retire before the end of the so-called "grace period" when the Bill goes before Seanad Éireann.  My amendment, which will be introduced in the Seanad and then brought to this House, will impose a higher reduction rate of 20% on public service pensions above €100,000.  Pensions in excess of €60,000 are currently being adjusted downwards by12%.  It is estimated that a reduction in public service pensions above €100,000 such as that proposed would potentially affect pensioners who previously held office, such as former Presidents, taoisigh, senior members of the Judiciary, including Chief Justices, or members of the High Court and the Supreme Court, heads of universities, Civil Service Secretaries General, chief executives of non-commercial State bodies, some hospital consultants, Garda Commissioners and Chiefs of Staff of the Defence Forces.  My Department's initial estimate indicates that this would lead to a modest saving of €400,000 in a full year.I wish to provide some examples of how what I have outlined might affect particular individuals.  A person on an annual pension of €125,000 will see a cumulative reduction in his or her pension of €13,760, or 11%.  Someone on a very high pension of €150,000 will see a corresponding fall of in the region of €18,760, or 12.5%.  It should be noted that these pension holders are also subject to the usual array of taxes, including PRSI, the universal social charge and the upper rate of income tax.  They are already being taxed or charged at well in excess of 50% and this rate will be additional to that.  I asked my Department to provide an estimate of the net income of a public service pensioner whose gross pension before tax or the public service pension reduction is €125,000.  The net income of a single pensioner over the age of 70 would be reduced to a net take-home amount of €71,716.  This is a substantial income, particularly when one considers that such an individual is unlikely to be obliged to shoulder the same costs as his or her younger counterparts.  However, the reduction is significant.  While the level of savings would again be modest, I am of the view that this measure should be implemented in the broad public interest.The Attorney General has advised that pension entitlements are vested property rights which have already been earned.  As we know, however, the existing legislation already affects vested pension rights in the public interest.  I consider that this progressive amendment is also in the broad public interest and that is just and equitable in the circumstances.  There are those who believe that people had an expectation that certain levels of pension would apply and that they had made contributions in respect of their pensions over significant periods.  However, there is also an understanding that in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves, those with the broadest shoulders must bear the greatest burden.  It is for this reason that I sought to introduce this particular measure, to which the Government has readily agreed.Safeguards are contained in all the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts.  Measures must be publicly reviewed annually and I, as Minister, may consider and may grant claims for exemption or modification if it is considered just and equitable to do so.  No one will seek to make the case that the savings I have outlined will make significant inroads in the context of the financial crisis which the State faces.  They will not resolve the extraordinary problems of borrowing and indebtedness by which our nation is currently affected.  However, that is not the rationale behind the Bill or my proposed amendment to it.  The terms of the Bill reinforce the principles of fairness, ability to pay and burden sharing among all of us.  It ensures that those in eminent office demonstrate their leadership and, most importantly, their solidarity in a real and concrete way with the people most affected by the economic crisis.This is the fourth item of financial emergency legislation to be put before the House since the spring of 2009.  It might serve some purpose to remind Members of the contents of the three Acts previously passed by the House.  The first Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act of 2009 provided for a progressive pension-related deduction to apply to public servants with access to a public service pension.  The Act was introduced in the context of the priority to be given to the stabilisation of the public finances.  As well as the pension-related deduction, it contained a number of measures designed to produce savings, which would be remitted to the benefit of the Exchequer.  The pension-related deduction, which came into effect on 1 March 2009, currently applies to earnings in excess of €15,000 per annum and is calculated progressively at rates ranging between 5% and 10.5%.The deduction is not a pension contribution and was introduced in the context of the recitals to that Act, which, as I mentioned already, set out the serious and ongoing disturbance in the economy and threat to the finances of the State.  The deduction also reflected the general comparative value of public service pensions vis-à-vis private sector pension provision.The Financial Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 provided for the reduction in the remuneration of all public servants with effect from 1 January 2010.  The Act provided for reductions of an average of some 7% where the salary of the public servant was less than €125,000.  Fixed reduction rates of 8%, 12% and 15% applied to salaries of more than that amount.  The public servants affected included officeholders such as members of the Oireachtas and the Government and employees of public service bodies — more than 300,000 people all told.  Of course, the House will understand that since then, and since the election of this Government, there is a ceiling now on all civil servants' earnings and no civil servant in the State is earning currently more than €200,000 because they all have taken a waiver to below that level.Prior to the recent referendum on judicial pay, members of the Judiciary together with the President were not subject to the provisions of either Act.  The Bill we are discussing today removes the exemption for the Judiciary and, if passed, they will be subject to the measures in both 2009 Acts from 1 January of next year.The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010 introduced an income graduated reduction applied to each gross annual public service pension in excess of €12,000.  That deduction already applies to retired members of the Judiciary and will apply to the pension of any public servant who retires before the expiry of the grace period after which pensions will be reduced in line with the pay reductions set out in the second Act.  The Bill today includes provision to extend the application of the pension reduction to Central Bank pensioners with the consent of the Governor of that Bank, as was intended by the legislation.  It was not possible to do that heretofore.  This provision is necessary owing to the legal position of the Central Bank as part of the euro system.  I already mentioned the amendment that I propose to introduce for those on very large public service pensions and we will have a chance to debate that when it comes back, hopefully, from being passed in the other House.In addition to the three Acts, a 10% reduction in pay from 1 January 2011 was introduced for new entrants into entry grades in the public service. The Bill today makes provision to apply a similar 10% reduction to new judicial appointments from enactment of the Bill.This short Bill, in addition to the provisions relating to the Judiciary, also includes the legislative provisions to underpin the significant decision taken already by Government on the remuneration of officeholders.  It also includes a number of technical or ancillary amendments.  As I mentioned, it is intended that the Bill, if passed by both Houses, will be brought into effect from 1 January 2012.I will go through the provisions of the Bill in detail.  As stated already, the main purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the outcome of the referendum to amend the Constitution to allow the pay of judges to be reduced in certain very exceptional circumstances.  This Bill provides for the application of the two Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009 to both serving and new members of the Judiciary and military judges on the same basis as other public servants.I am aware that there has been some controversy about the non-application of the pension-related deduction to the Judiciary in particular.  However, the clear legal advice was that the constitutional bar on reducing the remuneration of serving judges prevented the application of that measure to judges.  That was the advice given to the previous Government and accepted by it.  It was advice reiterated to this Government and that is why we had to proceed down the line of a referendum.  Deputies will be aware that a separate provision was put in place under the taxation code to permit judges to make an equivalent waiver on a voluntary basis and that the majority of judges did so.Following the amendment to Article 35.5 of the Constitution on judicial remuneration, sections 3 and 4 of this Bill will apply the reductions in salary applied to other public servants through the application of the pension related deduction to serving judges, and sections 5 and 6 will apply the reduction in salary effected through the provisions of the Financial Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act.  The net effect of the provisions of the Bill will result in reductions for serving judges ranging from 16% in the case of a District Court judge to 23% in the case of the Chief Justice.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	248	Military judges were also exempted from the provisions of the Act.  The same sections of the Bill also make provision to remove the exemptions applying to a military judge from the application of the pension related deduction and pay under sections 3, 4 and 5.  There is currently no serving military judge.  In the context of developing the conditions of appointment of the next military judge, the pay adjustments have already been made.  As a consequence, it is not necessary to apply the pay reductions again under section 6.I am conscious of time and I will not go through all of the remaining provisions of the Bill.  They are set out in my script and we will have a chance to go through them later in this debate.Deputies should be aware that many of the remuneration provisions in the Bill for consideration today were included in the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011, which was published in September and passed on Second Stage in the House.  I consider it more appropriate and expedient from a legislative and administrative viewpoint that all remuneration provisions be dealt with in a single dedicated enactment.  Through this means, I hope to facilitate the enactment of the Bill in time to apply the pay reductions, as I have indicated, from 1 January next.  Accordingly, the necessary changes to reflect this transfer from the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011 will be made on Committee Stage.  We will simply delete those sections that are now transposed into this Bill.The Government is committed to continued stabilisation in the overall cost of the public service pay bill.  The provisions set out in the Bill before the House are in keeping with that objective and will provide greater equity in the application of public sector pay policy.  I look forward to hearing the views of the House on the Bill and to considering amendments and suggestions put forward by Deputies.  I commend this Bill to the House.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Bill 2011.  I welcome the Bill, but I am disappointed by how the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is handling it in the House here tonight.  I am surprised at him because he gave a clear commitment when he took office that he would be open and allow for discussion.Nothing epitomises more my disappointment than the last words of his speech, when he stated: "I look forward to hearing the views of the House on the Bill and to considering amendments and suggestions put forward by Deputies."  There are 21 amendments before the Minister tonight and he is allowing 30 minutes.  There was a vote here earlier in the day to allow more time for Committee Stage.  Second Stage, this general debate, will run from now, with an interruption for Private Members' business for an hour and a half, until 10 o'clock.  If a vote is called at 10 o'clock, it will be 10.20 p.m. before we get to commence Committee Stage and the Minister wants the entirety of the Committee Stage amendments to be dealt with and Report and Final Stages to be completed in ten minutes.  There are 21 amendments and the Minister comes in here and states that he looks forward to considering the amendments.

There will be ten minutes for 21 amendments.  The Minister knows that what he is doing in the House is unfair.  He has the numbers behind him to back it up, whether it is fair or unfair.I will come to what is doubly insulting, from the Dáil's point of view.  I support the suggestions the Minister made on reductions for persons in receipt of a pension of over €100,000, but then he stated that because he is guillotining the Bill here tonight, he will not even give the Dáil the opportunity to discuss this amendment.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I would prefer him to table it and then allow time to discuss it tonight.  We would have no problem giving this an extra hour or an hour and a half tonight.  There are 21 amendments and the Minister is now bringing forward a couple of amendments on that issue.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	260	No, that will be in the Seanad.  I will come back and give it time here.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I understand that.  However, does the Minister not see that, from the Dáil's point of view, the Minister is allowing a maximum of 30 minutes for Committee Stage amendments before Report and Final Stages?  I spent hours drafting pages of amendments, as did Deputy McDonald and others in her party, but we are not given an opportunity to discuss them.  The Minister is now saying he has more amendments but that he will bring them to the Seanad tomorrow or next week, and that he will then have to come back here again the following week.  Why does he not just take his time and do it all here tonight or tomorrow, and then go to the Seanad and be finished?  He is taking it off because he does not have his work done.While I welcome what the Minister proposes to do, he should have taken more time.  We would have given an hour tomorrow for this debate.  I do not know why he is not allowing our amendments to be properly discussed.  The Minister's final remark was that he looked forward to considering the amendments.  It will be quickest consideration of amendments ever because, if a vote is called, there will be no further time to discuss any of the subsequent amendments.The Minister knows the point I am making.  Although he will make amendments later in the Seanad, this is the House in which he is introducing the legislation.  There is no need for this guillotine, and it is very important we say that.We support the legislation as published by the Minister.  The people spoke in a referendum when 79% wanted the constitutional amendment to allow a reduction in pay for serving judges.  The legislation is before us, and we appreciate it and agree wholeheartedly with the Minister on it.The Bill puts into statutory effect the reductions in the salary of the Taoiseach, which were decided upon the Government assuming office.  I compliment the Taoiseach, who reduced his salary to €200,000, which I support, it having been at a much higher figure despite our having reduced it by €90,000 previously as a result of last year's budget.  Ministers, Deputy Howlin included, also agreed at the first Cabinet meeting on taking office last March on a reduced figure for Ministers, which we support.  This was done voluntarily up to now and the Minister is giving it statutory effect in the Bill to ensure it has the force of law.The Bill also makes specific provision for the salary of the chairman of An Bord Pleanála because it was connected to that of a senior judge, and the Minister states this salary will be decided in future by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  While I welcome this, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, should have included a cap of €200,000.  Although he might claim a future Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will not pay more than that, there is nothing in the legislation which states that.  Similarly, the salary of the Ombudsman is set relative to judges' pay at present and, given this is being changed, that linkage is being removed for the next Ombudsman and the salary will be decided by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Again, however, a cap is not included and that figure could be higher, although I hope it will not be.  In any case, a cap could easily have been included in the legislation.The Bill is good in so far as it goes.  I look on it as a step in the right direction, although I am surprised the Minister did not take a bigger step.  The Minister singled out certain groups of people on the public payroll in order to change their salaries under this Bill, which we support.  However, what about all of those who are still being omitted?  The Minister should have inserted sections into the Bill to set a cap of €250,000 for current chief executives of semi-State companies and in regard to public services.  The Minister will say that some in the semi-States have taken a reduction but that is only a voluntary, not a statutory waiver.  Allowing for this, having taken their voluntary waivers, the chief executive of the ESB is still on a basic salary of €400,000, the chief executive of An Post is still on a salary of €328,100 and the chief executive of the Dublin Airport Authority is still on a salary of €297,000.  We have listed all the semi-State companies that should be included in this statutory cap of €250,000.  While the Minister will say this will apply to future incumbents and that he cannot make it apply to current incumbents, he is applying it to current judges, the current Taoiseach and current Ministers, and he is also making specific changes for the chairperson of An Bord Pleanála as well as inserting a special section in the legislation for the Ombudsman.  He could have included the semi-State sector in a similar section.We might not get time to discuss some of the amendments tonight.  When the Minister comes back from the Seanad with his amendments, I ask that he would allow a debate without a guillotine.  We are not unreasonable people, Deputy McDonald and I, and we are entitled to have the time to say what we want to say.  The Minister could have given us an extra hour tonight.  There is no great difference between 10.30 p.m. and 11.30 p.m. and the guillotine was not necessary.  We would not have abused the situation and there would have been no need for this debate or for the vote earlier today.I want to alert the Minister to the fact I have included other organisations which are also in State ownership and should also have a €250,000 cap in addition to those semi-State organisations I have listed.  I begin with the chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank, which has changed its name to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, and the new chief executive of Allied Irish Banks, who has just been appointed.  I watched the former AIB executive chairman at the finance committee during the course of the summer.  For every question we asked him in regard to where AIB was going as a bank, he had to defer to the Minister for Finance.  While I understand this as it is a 99% State-owned company and Anglo Irish Bank is 100% State-owned, and I understand both have technically independent boards, the boards and the chief executives are in fact subservient to the senior people in the Department of Finance.  When the Minister for Finance and the Secretary General of the Department of Finance are paid no more than €200,000, it is absurd that the people who report in to them to clear policy issues are on a higher salary.  I am sure the Minister sees the logic of what I am saying.The Minister will agree with me in regard to another organisation I have included for a maximum salary cap of €250,000, namely, our friends in the National Treasury Management Agency.  The last time we discussed this in the House, the Minister was able to elucidate some information in regard to salaries but he and all previous Ministers, the Committee of Public Accounts and all other arms of the State have not been able to extract from that organisation what it is paying its chief executive.  Let us not discuss it any further; let us simply legislate for it and that will sort out the matter.  They can have all the secrets they like about their salary rates once they are under the cap set in this House.  We believe some of these people are on €500,000 and €600,000 per annum and, I understand, the former chief executive, who was a good man in his job and a very competent individual, had a salary which approached €1 million in one year when all the various bonuses were added in.  In these straitened times, that is very hard to justify.The Minister will be here next Monday justifying some severe expenditure cuts.  I do not know how his colleagues in the Labour Party in particular will come to the House tonight and reject an amendment to put a cap on the chief executives of the semi-States and then come in here next week and support the Minister in a budget which will inevitably include some severe cuts which hurt people at the bottom end.  I ask the Labour Party to be consistent and the way to do that is to vote for this amendment.  I believe every Member of the House would agree with a cap on the salary of a chief executive of a semi-State company and of every public servant at the figures proposed.  Deputy McDonald proposes a lower figure but, be that as it may, there should be a cap of some description.  It would be a good day's work for the Oireachtas if we went down that particular route.I wish to refer to one group of approximately 15 individuals, namely, the Secretaries General.  I cannot understand why they are not included in this statutory cap of €200,000.  Again, while they have taken a voluntary waiver so they are under the €200,000 figure on a voluntary basis, the Minister should put this on a statutory basis.  He might clarify the following point.  Their official salary is probably somewhere above €200,000 and their future pensions will be calculated on the basis of that figure, which is their statutory legal salary.  I believe they have got around the Minister to ensure they were not included under this legislation.  They should be included under the cap.  It would not affect them now, because they have taken a voluntary waiver, and it would not affect future personnel because that has been covered as well.The logic of what the Minister is doing in putting a cap on the top pensions, which he announced a few minutes ago that he will introduce in the Seanad and which we welcome, is to facilitate the top paid public servants in Ireland drawing a pension based on a salary that is higher than the actual salary they receive as a result of the waiver they are currently applying.  There is an inconsistency there.  The Minister should provide measures to cap the salary on which their pension is based.  They have taken the voluntary waiver.  Ministers and the Taoiseach took the voluntary waiver, and the Minister is now giving that statutory effect.  The Secretaries General took the voluntary waver but that will not have statutory effect.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	267	The Minister's official response as to why he cannot apply this to the chief executives was given in the House last week or recently.  He said there were seven chief executives still above the €250,000 level who have not taken the 15% waiver or salary cut.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, announced in the House a few days ago that there are 99 people in the education sector on salaries of more than €200,000.  I am shocked at that figure, but that is the figure in the Official Report.

The Minister will appear before the Oireachtas committee tomorrow to discuss public sector reform, so we can discuss it then.I am still appalled, and the people of Ireland will be shocked, that there are 100 people in third level institutions on salaries that are higher than the Taoiseach's.

I accept there are nuances but the general point is very clear.I tried to introduce a measure to cut the pay of senior personnel when the Minister introduced the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011.  The Minister said, to paraphrase his response, that he could not introduce a measure that would be narrowly focused and targeted on a specific group of people because it might be subject to constitutional challenge.  I do not know if he could stand over that answer today given that what he has announced today regarding pensions is targeted on a very narrow, focused group of people.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	276	It is a continuum——

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I understand.  There is very little time for Committee Stage and we would have welcomed more time for that tonight.  However, in this legislation there is a separate section referring to the chairman of An Bord Pleanála and another one relating to the Ombudsman.  That is targeting a very narrow and specific group of people, but I do not believe those sections will be subject to constitutional challenge because they only apply to one person.  I do not accept, therefore, that the Minister can respond to the measure I propose relating to the chief executives of semi-State companies by saying it cannot be permitted because it targets a small group of people.  He is already targeting smaller groups and individual categories of employment in this Bill.A number of the chief executives of semi-State companies have taken the voluntary waiver to bring their salaries below €250,000.  The legislation should cover them because, when things pick up next year, they might not take the waiver and return to their high salaries again.  I hope the Minister will take that point into account.  I look forward to him dealing with these matters in more detail at the committee meeting tomorrow on public sector issues.The estimated reduction in public service pensions above €100,000 that has been proposed will potentially affect pensioners who were formerly officeholders such as the President and Taoiseach and other members of the Judiciary.  The Minister outlined the list of those affected tonight and I believe it was highlighted on tonight's "Six One News".  I welcome and support that.  Given that those people paid superannuation and contributed to the pensions they now receive, they have a very strong proprietary right to that asset.  The reason we must introduce the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Bill is to copper-fasten the legislation in targeting those people.Given that the Minister can target people who have contributed to their pensions, high as they are, and that it is presumably legally safe to do so, I cannot understand why he is not targeting the current salaries of people who are still in the system.  Each time he comes to the House he talks about their contractual obligations, but I do not see how the same arrangement does not hold true for pensioners if it applies to people currently employed.My view is very clear.  I challenge the chief executive of the ESB or An Post or Dublin Airport Authority to go to the High Court and try to overturn it.  I would welcome it because if I was on the board employing him, I would tell him to get on with his job and not waste his, the company's, the taxpayers' and the court's time.  It will only be found to be unconstitutional if somebody goes to court about it.  There are many matters that have been agreed in the House and if they were tested in the court, it would be up to the judges to decide, so I would not automatically assume that they would have a cast iron case in court just because the Minister received legal advice that they would.I urge the Minister to just do this.  I believe he has right on his side under the emergency financial measures.  The people of Ireland would support him.  He should put it up to these people to go down to the courts and challenge what the Oireachtas does.  I do not believe the Minister would encounter a challenge.  They have a serious job to do and they should not be arguing down in the courts, wasting their and the public's time for their personal gain.I again stress that my remarks are focused at the very highly paid.  The Minister has done a great deal on public sector reform but most of his efforts to date have been concentrated on new recruits.  Some of the salaries that have been introduced will not have a major effect on pensions for 40 years, until the people who are recruited in the future retire after 40 years, or it will probably be after 45 years with the retirement age increasing as the years go by.  The zeal the Minister has shown in tackling employees who are not yet in the system should be exercised with regard to the high paid people who are currently in the system.  Next Monday, the Minister will announce tough measures and I have no wish to see him hitting the lower paid, the poor and people on social welfare while at the same time letting these chief executives off scot free tonight.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	279	Before dealing with the legislation, it is important to comment on the manner in which this Bill is being put through the House today.  This is not the first time legislation has been rushed through the House by the Minister.  This practice, which is particularly associated with the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats, is bad.  It is also bad for the democratic process.  Indeed, if the Minister were still on this side of the House, he would be hopping up and down at the prospect of such serious legislation being rushed through all Stages on a cold, wintry Tuesday night.  There is no justifying this practice, yet each week legislation is brought before the House and is rushed through by guillotine or, occasionally, without any debate at all.The new Government promised us a new dawn on many issues, including political reform, equity, transparency and accountability, but nine months later we still wait for this bright new day.  Sinn Féin supported the referendum on reducing the pay of serving and future judges.  It was ridiculous that members of the Judiciary were somehow the privileged few who must be protected from the financial realities facing all other citizens and public sector workers.  Their role, like the role of all other public and civil servants, is to perform a specific duty to the best of their ability in the interests of the citizens.  However, the salaries provided for in this Bill for the Judiciary, Government officeholders and the President are so far removed from the financial reality facing this State that it beggars belief.We are broke.  It is that simple, and the Minister knows it.  Will he tell me on what planet does an insolvent country award salaries of €226,376 to a Chief Justice, €200,000 to a Taoiseach or €210,206 to a High Court judge and then promote those salary rates as a great coup for political reform?  Our economy is in serious trouble.  It is stagnant.  Unemployment is soaring and will remain very high for the lifetime of this Government.  Much of our infrastructure is not fit for purpose and our young are emigrating in their droves.  Despite all of that, regularly articulated by Government, we still have an Administration that believes it is okay to award big bucks for the boys at the top while threatening cuts to child benefit and charges on our most vulnerable citizens for the right to hold a medical card.Sinn Féin cannot support this Bill and will not support a Bill that awards extravagant salaries to judges and Government officeholders during a time of economic crisis.  To be frank with the Minister, the Labour Party should not support it either, and I think he knows that.  We also cannot support a Bill that serves to copper-fasten the excessive salaries of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Government Ministers in a time of economic doom.I urge Labour Ministers and Deputies to take a step back and think about what is happening here.  We are in crisis.  Families are facing yet another draconian budget and nearly half a million of our people are out of work but despite those realities the Members opposite believe it is okay to pay themselves the kind of money that for the majority of families would never be seen or earned in the good times or the bad.  How can the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, justify a salary of €184,405 at this time?  The salary of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is not much less at €169,275.  All the while he tells us he is making the difficult decisions in the interests of the people but, to be frank, that line is hard to tally with the big bucks awarded to judges, the Tánaiste and Labour Ministers, including the Minister, in this Bill.The reality is that the Minister is not making the tough decisions.  He is not providing leadership at a time of crisis.  His Government is not stepping up and fighting the good fight in the national interest.  At best, he is tinkering around the edges, and I believe the Minister knows that.  High rollers paid from the public purse continue to be protected from the economic crisis by the Minister's Government.  This Bill, like the ongoing payments to Anglo unguaranteed bondholder debt held by speculators, shows just how detached the political establishment is from reality.  It probably best epitomises why the Labour and Fine Gael parties, like the Fianna Fáil Party before them, have failed to pull us out of this crisis.As the economy stagnates and small business can hardly keep the door open, unemployment creeps upwards, more people live in poverty and indebted families across the State are making the stark choice this winter of buying food for the family or heating their homes.  It is in that context that the Minister brings this legislation before the House.I want to set out a number of amendments we will table to the Bill.  Any future salary increase for the Judiciary, if it is to be made, should be properly brought before the Dáil and the Seanad.  The Minister stated, with regard to National Treasury Management Agency workers in the Department of Finance, that there must be full transparency when it comes to the salaries of those working across the public and Civil Service.  As judges are public servants, the same principle must apply to that group of workers.Any future increase awarded to judges should not, as the Minister suggests in the Bill, have retrospective effect.  It is bad enough that he would consider it appropriate to award such outrageous salaries in the first instance but to then legislate for any future increases to be paid retrospectively is unbelievable, particularly when set against this Government's punitive budget 2012 proposal.I acknowledge President Michael D. Higgins's voluntary acceptance of a reduced salary contained in the Bill but it is my strong view that the legislation should apply a reduction to the current President.  This is another example of a lack of leadership from Government.  Seeking out voluntary pay reductions from serving——

However, revised downward salaries must be applied to those who hold these positions currently.  I repeat that we are in crisis.  The dogs in the street know it.  If Government can apply immediate cuts in pay in the lowest paid public sector, it can impose comparable cuts to those on the big money — contract or no contract.  If this cannot be done through pay cuts, then it must be done through taxation.Tackling the high pay and pensions for those who reside in the upper echelons of the civil and public sector is clearly not something for which this Government has the stomach.  We might expect that Fine Gael Party Ministers would support big bucks for the big boys, but the position of Labour Party Ministers on this issue is beyond disappointing.  The Minister could stop the practice of bonanza pension payouts to Secretaries General and county managers today.  Existing legislation allows him to do that.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	347	The story we are consistently told by those who defend excessive pay is that in order to get the quality personnel, be they political advisers, senior civil servants or others in the public sector, we must pay excessive salaries.  The recent past demonstrates the folly of that argument.  If we were to do a value for money audit of all those who are in very senior positions in the political sphere and in the public and Civil Service and honestly asked ourselves if they delivered for the State, I think in many cases, in spite of their very high pay, the answer to that question would be a categorical "No".We are in crisis and the Minister's own speech sets it out in graphic terms.  We either have a crisis or we do not.  We either set about making the kinds of political choices that will remedy the situation or we do not.  We either reclaim for the political and public systems of this State the credibility, moral authority and confidence of the citizens, or we do not.  Measures such as this, which propose excessive salaries for the Judiciary, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and for the Minister do a grave disservice to the standing of politics.  In the starkest terms, we are witnessing the "haves" and the "have nots", the insiders and the outsiders.  As people speculate about the budget this evening and worry about how they will get by, let me say that their hearts will not be lightened, or their burden lessened at the prospect of some high flyer who will have to take a minor hit on an excessive pension.The Minister has failed in the task of addressing this issue.  He has consistently failed on the matter of runaway pay at the upper echelons of the public and Civil Service.  As the Minister charged with reform and as the Minister who has been party to and will deal further blows to middle and lower ranking civil and public servants, in bringing forward this Bill and in failing to deal with the large pension pots, he has blown his credibility and his standing——

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I am sharing time with Deputy Catherine Murphy, and I eagerly await the barracking from the other side.There is a pattern developing with this Government in the legislation it proposes and the statements of policy it outlines.  It tries to tap into the huge sense of outrage felt by ordinary working people, the less well off, the lower and middle income earners in our society, who cannot get over the injustice of being forced to pay such a severe price for an economic crisis that was caused by others.  Whether it was the last Government, this Government, the troika or the hallowed markets, all of these people insist that they keep paying year after year with vicious and brutal austerity.That is the view outside this House and the Minister knows this.  He knows that people are outraged.  He knows that one of the causes of that injustice was the gross inequality in the distribution of wealth and earnings in our society.  Another cause was an economic system that actively promoted inequality and an ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor, and between the high earners and the low earners.The mentality at the top which thought it was okay to earn €400,000 per annum, €600,000, €700,000, or €2-3 million per annum, was the same mentality that led us to the catastrophic crisis in which we find ourselves now.  Meanwhile people in the public sector were chasing the chief executives of the large corporate firms who were on obscene salaries.  They suggested that they should be paid the same because they had to discuss and negotiate with them and that if the bankers were getting €1 million per year then the head of the NTMA should get €500,000 or €600,000 per year.Such was the logic driving the top of our society and the system generally in Europe and throughout the world.  There were obscene salaries and pension arrangements at the top leading to extreme inequalities in wealth.  It is important to note that this is not simply a gross injustice, although it is certainly that, but it is the major reason for the economic crisis.  It is a fact that this grossly unequal distribution of earnings and wealth that has accumulated over time has lead to a situation where the behaviour of 1% of the population dictated the economic fate of everyone else.That is what led us into this mess.  Do we not know this?  Have we not realised, based on CSO figures and the Credit Suisse global wealth report, that 1% of people in this country have an estimated €131 billion in wealth?  Following the crash, a mere 1% of the Irish population has €131 billion in wealth.  A total of 50% of this is held in financial assets, not even in property.  This remains the situation and this is what must be addressed.  These are the emergency measures we need.  We must ensure that people believe there is some intent towards fairness in dealing with this crisis.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	361	Those at the top who had grossly inflated earnings and a vast accumulation of wealth used that wealth, their position and their earnings to drive an economic agenda that has crashed our economy and the entire European economy.  People want to know that we are serious about doing something rather than offering tokens and it seems to me this is tokenistic.  The Government knows there is anger with high earners and it has decided on some measures and has made a song and dance about them.  It held a referendum but it related only to judges and it provides for tokenistic reductions to €200,000 for the politicians or some top civil servants but it does not really address the problem.This gives those in Government cover to claim that they are being even-handed and it attempts to justify the real agenda which will be meted out on Monday and Tuesday of next week when the Government will lay into social welfare recipients and the lowest income families, either in the form of cuts in child benefit or rent allowance, increases in VAT or whatever nasty, socially regressive austerity measures the Government decides is the best way to implement the diktats of the EU-IMF group.

The pension of a public sector worker earning €100,000 will be approximately €50,000.  I propose no more than €50,000 for pensioners.  Is that not enough for the Minister or for the heads of the semi-State companies or top civil servants?  It is extraordinary that we do not have emergency measures to get back these vast pay-outs and lump sums to the heads of the NTMA and Departments and so on.  Where are the emergency measures to do so?  Where is the will and energy of the Government to go after these people?I see no justification for these people to continue to get these payments.  One individual will get €147,000 per year.  This is unbelievable when people are being slaughtered at the bottom.  There is no justification for people to earn more than three or four times the average industrial wage.  Do such people honestly believe they are worth five, six or ten times more than a nurse in an accident and emergency unit?

However, this speaks to the bigger issue.  It is not simply about the pensions and pay of public servants but the lack of willingness of the Government to take emergency measures to go after the wealthy.  Where is the wealth tax?  Earlier, I referred to a sum of €131 billion owned by 1% of the population.  If we include the top 5% then this figure becomes greater than €200 billion.  Can we not simply place an emergency levy on them?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	381	On farm land?

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	383	Then where is the wealth?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	384	Our proposal is simple and does not relate to private residences, it is limited to assets worth more than €1 million and not to farm assets worth less than €5 million.  As I pointed out to the Minister, the financial assets make up approximately one half of the figure of €131 billion to which I referred and the figure is rising.  These assets have risen significantly in recent years.  The money is there and there is a pot of gold despite the Minister's denial of its existence.  However, the Minister will not go after it because he invited those who have the pot of gold and who live as tax exiles to advise the country on how to get out of the economic crisis at the global forum on economic recovery.  That says it all.  The Government is willing to slaughter the people at the bottom and continues to adulate the tax exiles and billionaires, who became billionaires through dubious circumstances.  Let us put it no stronger than that.  Why not take the measures that the United States, hardly a haven of revolutionary socialism, has taken in terms of tax exiles?  Serious measures were put in place there.  Why does the Minister not consider what the United States has done in terms of tax exiles and provide for emergency legislation to recoup some of their money?I propose a cap on public sector pay of €100,000 to include executives, chief executives and politicians; a cap on public sector pensions of €50,000; that the Government should go after the tax exiles and provide the necessary emergency legislation to do so; and the imposition of a super levy on the super wealthy.  I believe such a measure should be ongoing but in the context of the current economic crisis could we not demand such a super levy?  Dare I mention the sacred cow of corporation tax?  Could we not tax profitable multinationals or such firms as Tesco on an emergency basis?  Should they not be asked to make an emergency contribution to the country's economic plight?  Would such firms really run away if we put in place a levy for a few years on their vast profits which run into ten of millions and billions of euro?  These are measures the Government could take if it were serious but, naturally, it is not serious and the real business will be done to ordinary people on Tuesday.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	385	First, I wish to complain about the way this legislation is being handled.  This is not about getting the business done efficiently but about crafting legislation that will be robust and that will resist any challenge that might be presented in the courts.  It is important that we have time to do this in a careful and thoughtful way.  This is not the way to do it and I wish to emphasise this point.A number of savings to the Exchequer are included in the Bill.  I acknowledge they are welcome but they do not go far enough.  It is important that we achieve a sharing of the burden.  I hear a sense of outrage from people who are struggling on a weekly basis to try to pay mortgages and bills.  They are dipping into their own pockets to pay these very large pensions and packages.  I am sure the Minister is aware that people are offended.  It is very dangerous from a societal point of view that is such inequity can be seen so visibly.  Huge amounts of money will not be saved, no matter what decision is made, but the lack of perceived equity and the idea that people can retire aged in their 50s on huge pensions which will be paid for the rest of their lives while they are still of working age is offensive.I acknowledge in principle what the Minister sets out in the amendment.  It does not go far enough but is making a small positive contribution.  Substantially more has to be done.  Not only this budget but another two are needed if we are to achieve the figure set out in the programme.  It will be incredibly difficult.  Social stability will be challenged if people see gross inequities.  It is important that is taken on board.I refer to the Ombudsman and the chairman of An Bord Pleanála.  I understand the separation between the Chief Justice and the setting of wages.  I am not referring to the amount of money involved, but I have a problem with any infringement on the independence of both positions.  The current Ombudsman will not be affected but a future one will.  The office will be incredibly important and it is vital that we do not undermine its independence.  I have serious concerns about the principle of doing that.The same pertains to An Bord Pleanála.  The Minister was Minister for the Environment some years ago.  If we want to go to the heart of the property bubble and many of the failings in this country we only have to look at the planning system and how we have managed the building industry.  I have serious concerns about the lack of independence of the chairperson of An Bord Pleanála.The reality is that the people who are in the most privileged positions, who write and make the rules, will always protect themselves.  That is what elites do.  That is why the really hard decisions are taken against the people who are in very privileged positions.While there are savings in terms of what has been announced, by international standards we compare very unfavourably in terms of pay rates for the Judiciary, something which has to be examined.  There has to be a graduated difference between the District Court, the Circuit Court and the Supreme Court, and there is more to be done on that.Other Deputies referred to semi-State bodies.  An outrageously high salary was paid to the head of Coillte and people refused to accept a voluntary reduction in salary.  Salary reductions should not be voluntary.  There is nothing voluntary about what the ordinary person on the street has to confront, such as the universal social charge and the pension levy which are universally applied.  The separation between people who are perceived to be powerful and ordinary working people is exercising people.I have a problem with the separation of powers and the independence of particular bodies, but I am not suggesting that wage rates should be protected.  However, there must be some sort of framework for a separation between a Minister and offices because the position can be dangerous.  I am unhappy with how this has been handled.

I was going to close my eyes and go to sleep because I thought I was living in Utopia, a land where milk is plentiful, there is gold in the streets, no unemployment and nothing is wrong.  However, there is no pot of gold.Sinn Féin is in government in the North and is making tough decisions on behalf of the people it represents.  I am sick of listening to the mantra about people who are suffering, the unemployed and those living in negative equity while no solution is offered.  I am living in negative equity.  I come from a community of family, friends, neighbours and relations who are unemployed and are in financial distress.  They understand the difficulties the country and they are in.Deputy McDonald spoke about a laissez-faire attitude.  The State is intervening and not leaving things the way they are. We have increased the minimum wage and we are reducing the salaries of the elites.  A difference is being made.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct.  The gargantuan salaries paid to those at the top in this country, in particular those in the public sector and the semi-State bodies are appalling and wrong.  They should be and are being changed by the Government.The Taoiseach and his Ministers reduced their salaries on their first day in office.  When the Taoiseach was Leader of the Opposition he was the first leader of a political party to take a voluntary pay cut.  That is called leadership, understanding and bringing people along.  What did Sinn Féin do?  It had Members in Westminster and claimed expenses but never turned up.

Child benefit is keeping bread on the table.  It is paying the food bills of a significant number of families who have had a massive reduction in their income.  Often the grandparents are helping to pay the mortgage to keep the wolf from the door, put food on the table and keep the house from being repossessed.  That is true of so many families in so many parts of the country to which I have spoken recently and it constitutes a kind of stimulus in the current extraordinarily difficult economic conditions for so many families.These are laudable words.  However, when one considers that they were spoken during a debate on a Labour Party Private Members' motion calling on the then Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government not to cut child benefit, one sees how far the Labour Party is moving to the right in its pursuit of power.  Two years later, together with its collaborators in Fine Gael, it is contemplating further reductions in child benefit.Recalling these words of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, two years ago should embolden Labour Party Members to support tonight's Sinn Féin motion.  The Labour Party motion was moved by the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for primary care, Deputy Róisín Shortall, on 1 December 2009.  That motion called on the Dáil to note the "ongoing high cost of raising children in Ireland today and the significant cuts that have already been made to family income".  It went on to observe that "every child deserves to be cherished and recognised by the State, regardless of the circumstances of its parents".  The motion called on the Government to "maintain child benefit at the current level in the forthcoming budget".The Sinn Féin motion tonight reiterates that call.  More than 205,000 children — 19% of all children in the State — are at risk of poverty.  Another 96,000, or 9%, are living in consistent poverty, which means they are experiencing material deprivations such as not having a warm waterproof coat or a substantial daily meal.  These figures, compiled by the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions and relating to 2009, are the most recent data on child poverty.  The CSO is due to publish the 2010 data tomorrow morning.  We anticipate that the numbers of children experiencing consistent poverty will have risen further in the intervening years.  My colleagues and I will bring those figures to the attention of Members opposite tomorrow night in order to ensure there is no doubt in their mind as to the effect of reductions in child benefit.The role played by child benefit in tackling child poverty is irrefutable and was acknowledged last week by the Minister, Deputy Burton, during a debate in this Chamber.  In 2005 consistent child poverty stood at 11%.  Subsequent child benefit increases, together with general wage increases, helped to reduce that figure to 6% in 2008.  However, that trend is now reversing following the cuts to child benefit imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Any additional reduction next Tuesday would further accelerate this reversal.  Media reports have suggested that a cut of €10 is on the cards.  A monthly loss of that magnitude might sound like nothing to those on high wages, but to a low or middle-income family with three children, an annual cut of €360 is very significant.  Consider, for example, that the minimum cost of sending a 12 year old to school is €815.Not only is it wrong to cut child benefit but it is also unnecessary.  A €10 reduction would save the State in the region of €150 million.   However, as we illustrated in our pre-budget submission, the Government has a whole host of alternative options to choose from which would help to close the budget deficit while also protecting children.  For instance, a third rate of tax at 48% on incomes in excess of €100,000 would raise €410 million.  A wealth tax of 1% on assets worth more than €1 million would raise €800 million.  It is a question of political choice.Any reduction in child benefit will have a further negative impact on our struggling economy, especially locally.  The Labour Party used to agree with we me on this.  Its 2009 Private Members' motion stated that "cutting child benefit would be far more deflationary than alternative revenue raising or cost-saving measures open to the Government".  This remains the case.  Speaking on that motion, the Minister, Deputy Burton, then spokesperson on finance, said: "It should be remembered that child benefit is spent in this country — on children's shoes, food and school books.  It is probably one of the best stimuli".  The same could be said of all social welfare payments.Last week the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, highlighted the multiplier effect of spending in the local economy, pointing out that a €10 spend locally generates an additional €24.  Conversely, for every €10 cut in child benefit, €34 will effectively be drained from local economies.  This will have disastrous consequences for local shops and their suppliers, resulting in even more job losses.It is important to address the debate surrounding universalism versus means testing or "targeting", as it is called.  To put it in context, child benefit is our only universal payment.  Countries which base their social protection systems on universal payments are faring better in this time of financial crisis.  Generous universal social welfare payments act as an automatic stabiliser during a financial crash.  Universal payments buffer demand in the local economy, thereby protecting jobs which in turn protects state revenues.  Generous universal payments also enable a workforce to be flexible, a key requirement of competitiveness.Child benefit should remain a universal payment.  Talk of targeting will merely dig us deeper into the recessionary hole.  A range of child benefit reforms is being and has been considered by this and previous Governments, including means testing or taxing the payment, both of which are thankfully being deemed an administrative nightmare.  If people are genuinely concerned that spending on child benefit profits the wealthy then the fairest and simplest thing to do is to maintain it as a universal payment and use the general tax system to tax wealthy people at a higher rate.There has been some speculation that child benefit will be cut and the qualified child increase will be raised so that the Government can claim that the vulnerable have been protected.  However, such a measure would be no compensation at all for the hundreds of thousands of low and middle income earners whose families do not qualify for social welfare.  A move like this would also reinforce poverty traps and unemployment traps as the gap between income from outside of employment and from employment would be narrowed as a result.I want to pre-empt some of the arguments that will be made that Ireland's child benefit rate and other relevant social welfare rates are relatively high.  Someone will undoubtedly raise the fact that child benefit is significantly lower in the Six Counties.  I can hear Deputy Buttimer already.  We heard him spouting earlier but without any knowledge of how the Six Counties is organised.  He has already wrongly charged my party with engaging in double standards.Such an argument would be based on two false assumptions.  The first assumption is that my party has fiscal powers.  This is not so because these are retained by Britain, primarily because previous Administrations here did not have the commitment to support republican demands for a full transfer of powers.  They could not be bothered and they have not been bothered since the founding of this State.The second assumption is that like is being compared with like and this is not so.  For example, in the Six Counties, people do not have to fork out more than €60 every time a child gets sick.  Likewise, across Europe, countries may have a lower specific child benefit rate but the state contributes much more to the cost of raising the next generation in a range of other ways that far exceed the difference.  For example, in Finland, which is world-renowned for its literacy outcomes, education is truly free for all.  There are no school fees, books are free and a free lunch is available to all children, regardless of means.  In addition, unlike many other countries, the Irish tax system does not recognise the existence of children, unless they have a serious and permanent disability.  Under our tax system, a couple with a child pay the same tax as a couple without a child, despite the significant and growing costs of raising children.It is anyone's guess whether the €10 cut to child benefit is really on the cards or if it is just another kite flown by the Government.  This motion is providing Members with an opportunity tomorrow evening to make it clear that child benefit is off the table when it comes to the budget.  We are offering Government Deputies the opportunity to declare that they will exempt all children from the burden of recovery.  We are offering Government Deputies the opportunity to live up to their pre-election promises and to their programme for Government commitment which states, "We will maintain social welfare rates".  Fianna Fáil already landed children with the burden of recovery and the sins of their cronies by twice cutting child benefit rates.  The people reacted and they voted for a change in Government.  I call on this Government and the Government Deputies to support this motion and demonstrate real change.In the final days of the general election campaign, the Labour Party sold itself on a promise to protect child benefit from cuts.  Speaking to a group of mothers in my own constituency at the Saint Nicholas of Myra parish centre, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, now Tánaiste, promised that his party would protect families.  He stated, "[Things] like not cutting child benefit any further.  Enough is enough.  Families can take no more".  The Labour Party made this a red-line issue pre-election.  The time has come to deliver.  If the Labour Party cuts child benefit or other social welfare rates which impact on children, it will commit nothing short of electoral fraud.The Labour Party should not give us the tired old excuses such as, "no decision has yet been taken"; "we cannot disclose under the budgetary process"; "everything is on the table".  Fine Gael Ministers have had no problem making unequivocal commitments not to raise income taxes on the wealthy so there is no barrier preventing any backbenchers and Ministers from voting in support of the Sinn Féin motion.Níos lú ná 20 cent in aghaidh na huaire an chloig a fhaigheann tuismitheoirí i bhfoirm liúntas leanaí.

#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	400	Mar a dúirt an Teachta Aengus Ó Snodaigh, tá polaitíocht uilig fá dtaobh de roghanna.  Politics is all about choices and unfortunately, the choices this Government has made are the same choices the former Government made.  I am sure the Minister of State, as a former member of one of the parties in the former Government, is delighted he is now in Government with two new parties and implementing the policies he espoused a number of years ago.Twelve months ago this week, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party handed over control of the economy to the EU-IMF.  Eight months ago, Fine Gael and the Labour Party abandoned their pre-election pledges and bowed down to the diktats of the troika.  It is 12 months since the troika arrived and the Government still has no strategy for altering the details of Fianna Fáil's EU-IMF austerity programme.  It is clear that Fine Gael is using the troika as a smoke-screen to introduce policies it supports but for which it has no mandate.  This is apparent in the dismantling of the joint labour committees and the sale of profitable assets.  That the Labour Party is so willing to go along with this is shameful.We need to ask ourselves these questions.  A couple of days before this Government is considering cutting child benefit, we must ask who has benefited from the bailout.  Who has been bailed out?  The Government would have us believe that the money from the EU-IMF is being used to pay the teachers, the nurses, the gardaí, those in receipt of child benefit.  Unfortunately, the truth is very different.At the end of last month, the Exchequer deficit stood at €22 billion.  Half of this amount, a staggering €10.7 billion, has been given by Fine Gael and the Labour Party to the banks since they came to office.  This included €3.1 billion to Anglo Irish Bank and a further €10 billion was given to the banks by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in July.  This is not recorded in the Exchequer figures as it came from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  A further €3.7 billion was given by Fianna Fáil to the banks in the dying days of 2010.  Put simply and boiling it all down, the deficit currently stands at €22 billion but since the troika has arrived, Government parties have injected €24.4 billion into the banks.These figures speak for themselves.  The EU-IMF programme is a bailout for banks and not for ordinary citizens.  They are the ones being bailed out.  Who will pay the price under Fine Gael and the Labour Party?  If the leaks to the press are to be believed, it will be our children who will have to pay the toxic debts of these banks.  If the leaks are proved correct on budget day, it will be our children who will be forced to shoulder the burden of the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Party austerity programme.Cuts to child benefit, cuts to social welfare and increases in VAT will hit children hardest and in particular the 96,000 children who today are living in consistent poverty, without the essentials for acceptable standards of living.  When the Government cuts the income of the families in which these children live, how will those parents put food on the table or clothes on backs?  How will the parents afford the cost of education and health care?  These are the stark choices that many families are already having to make because of the failed policies of bank bailouts and austerity introduced by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party and now implemented, shamefully, by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.Sinn Féin's motion calls on Deputies not to cut child benefit or other benefits that impact on children.  We call on those Deputies who, during the election campaign, promised to protect children, to stand up, to have the courage of their convictions and to stand by their beliefs, protect child benefit and support the Sinn Féin motion.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	401	According to the Labour Party's general election manifesto, our country's best days are yet to come.  It was not enough to wish for a better future.  The party told us that polling day offered people an opportunity to come together and make a decision for change.  The general election of February last was to be about real, transformative change that would bring about the kind of Ireland we want to live in, not only for ourselves but crucially also for our children.  Less than a week from budget day, the same party has spent the past month frightening the life out of struggling families across the State with a succession of budget leaks which would make even Fianna Fáil eyes water.  Let the Labour Party and Fine Gael be in no doubt that this budget, if we are to believe the leaks, will hit struggling families the hardest, particularly women and children.As the Minister may have noted, TASC recently undertook a gender impact assessment of budget 2011.  The organisation set out to quantify the cumulative effects of the main changes to direct taxation, social insurance and social welfare payments on the income of women and men.  Not surprisingly, its assessment found that those on the lowest incomes were hardest hit.  Cuts to social welfare, alongside the introduction of the universal social charge, widening of the tax bands and reduction in tax allowances, had a crippling effect on those families least able to shoulder the burden.  The Government could abolish the universal social charge but chooses not to do so.  It could introduce a wealth tax and a 48% tax band on individual income in excess of €100,000 per annum but chooses not to do so.  Instead, it appears to be intent on travelling the same path as the Fianna Fáil Party by targeting those least able to carry the burden of further cuts and tax increases.The TASC study found that women were concentrated in lower income groups, which was not a new or surprising finding.  As a result, they suffered a disproportionate impact of budgetary cuts.  The group most adversely affected by budget 2011 were single people with children, 73% of whom are women.  In real terms, families in this group lost on average 5% of their income.  Given that lone parents are more likely to be at risk of poverty and experience consistent poverty, reducing their income by 5% perpetuates the crisis they face and places even more vulnerable families at risk.  We now understand that the Government wants to go after this group again.  Imposing a plethora of stealth charges, reducing social protection supports, cutting child benefit and charging for the right to have a medical card will only drive even greater numbers of women and children into poverty.  While such measures could be expected from the Fine Gael Party, it is astonishing that we need to make this argument to the Labour Party.The Government pays out billions of euro on unguaranteed speculative bonds and chooses to mollycoddle high rollers in the public sector by standing over their lavish salaries during an economic crisis.  Like its Fianna Fáil counterparts, it chooses to shackle citizens with the bank guarantee.Given that we are specifically discussing child benefit, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to families across the State.  They are the unsung struggling heroes of the piece who care for their children and are barely coping but will, none the less, protect their young.  They are leaders and examples whereas the Government chooses not to lead.  Thanks to its failure to do the right thing, hundreds and thousands of children will be pushed further into poverty.  Families cannot and should not take any more.  Child benefit must not be touched.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	402	In the weeks leading up to the budget Government Ministers have been responsible — this is what journalists have told us — for leaking a constant flow of rumour and speculation about what the budget may contain.  The steady drip-drip of possibilities and rumour appears to be designed to instil fear.  It appears the warped thinking behind them has calculated that the leaks will somehow soften the blow when the cuts are announced.  I do not understand the psychology of those who are behind the leaks.In the past month, the media have published stories about the annual €50 charge to medical card holders, a possible 2% increase in the top rate of VAT, an €8 cut in unemployment assistance, the reintroduction of third level fees and the introduction of water charges and a household charge of €100.  These leaks have fuelled increasing anxiety among many people who are already at their wits' end and terrified by what is coming down the tracks.  It now appears that an essential benefit paid to the primary carer, usually the mother, is to be cut.  The majority of parents use this benefit to pay for essential items such as school uniforms, school books, new shoes, heating and electricity bills or household rent.  The leakers suggest the payment will be reduced by €10 per child per month.  While this figure may not appear to be a large amount to many Members of the House, it can make a hell of a difference to low and middle income families, especially if one or both parents have lost their job, spent their savings and are struggling to find employment.The saying goes that what we experience in childhood shapes us as adults.  I grew up in Dublin when there was not a great deal of wealth, poor housing was plentiful, transport links were poor, work was scarce and poverty and hunger were not far from the door of many families.  I thought we had moved on as a society.  It is of vital importance that any cost-cutting measures implemented in next week's budget are not targeted at children.  Organisations such as Barnardos estimate that 91,000 children live in consistent poverty and the figure is likely to rise significantly in the years to come.  As elected representatives, we have all called to houses where one can smell poverty on the children of the household.  This is an indictment of society.  If children are our future, it is unacceptable to cut the limited financial support available to them and their families.  To do so will only make matters worse and result in more children becoming marginalised, excluded from opportunities and unable to break the dark cycle of intergenerational poverty.Child benefit is a universal payment.  It is a direct means of assisting low income families which offers a type of social protection that has a proven track record in many countries, especially during prolonged recession.  In 2005, the rate of consistent poverty stood at 11%.  Increases to child benefit helped reduce this figure to 6% in 2008.  Regrettably, however, this trend is being reversed.  A €10 cut in child benefit would be another serious blow to low and middle income families who are already bearing the brunt of job losses, wage cuts and rising prices even for the most basic items.Poverty affects every aspect of a child's upbringing.  It has both short-term and long-term consequences on their health and education and can cripple life chances.  Consistent poverty means thousands of children are living in households where the income is below 60% of the national average, with many facing significant levels of deprivation.  These are glaring facts, as the figures show.  Consistent poverty can mean going lengthy periods without a substantial meal or being left cold at home because parents are unable to afford the price of heating oil or electricity.In recent years, a number of significant cuts have been made.  These have increased pressure for welfare payments and mortgage supplements and disrupted homes affected by unemployment and an inability to afford education related costs.  Unemployment has increased from 4% to 14%, with children in workless households suffering most.  It has also resulted in an inability of parents to afford child related costs, especially those with high educational costs.We are often told education is a right, not a privilege.  There is no doubt school can provide pathways which can greatly improve a child's future.  I agree with the sentiment expressed by a Labour Party Deputy prior to this year's general election:"First and foremost, we believe that our children should not be made to pay for the current economic crisis, and for this reason Labour will not cut child benefit, particularly in the wake of recent budgets in which family incomes have already taken a substantial hit."I want to know whether the Labour Party will honour that commitment in government, as enough is enough.  Families cannot take any more.  Poverty demeans us all.  Collectively, we need to wage a war against it.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	403	When we come through the hallway at the entrance to Leinster House every day, we pass an original copy of the 1916 Proclamation hanging on the wall.  It states Ireland will cherish "all of the children of the nation equally".  We have come to the Chamber this evening, 95 years on, to defend universal child benefit.  That an attempt is seemingly being made to diminish it shows how little progress the State has made in some respects.  As the Proclamation states, we must cherish all of the children of the nation equally.  That should be our mission statement.  Rather than focusing on improving the quality of life of children in the State, the Government — if we are to believe the leaks — is threatening to impose a further burden on families which are struggling to survive the economic recession.We do not have any reports from the German Parliament on this one, but media reports suggest child benefit might be cut by €10 a week.  Such a cut would make little difference to some.  For many, however, €10 a week is the difference between having and not having a meal, having and not having shoes, or having and not having warm clothes.  How can anybody dare to threaten to take these moneys from children?  The problems faced by the economy and the country were not brought about by the children who benefit most from child benefit.  In 2005 the level of consistent poverty stood at 11%.  We acknowledge that this figure dropped to 6% when child benefit was increased.  Unfortunately, these gains have been reversed.  Some 9% of people are now living in consistent poverty, while a further 10% are at risk of poverty.  What is the Minister for Social Protection who represents the Labour Party doing in these circumstances?  She is choosing to take the lazy and easy option of threatening to cut child benefit.  It was shameful of the Minister to make such a threat.Rather than going after high paid senior civil servants, the Government is going after children living in poverty.  Rather than increasing tax on the wealthy, it is threatening to bury more children in poverty.  What sort of Labour Party does this?  I suggest the Irish Labour Party is doing it.  James Connolly would be weeping if he were looking down on it now.  From my viewpoint, it is all the more frustrating because it does not have to be like this.  If the Government took the time to read the proposals made by Sinn Féin in its pre-budget submission, Route to Recovery, it would learn that other approaches are available.  A growing body of economists agree that the Government cannot cut its way out of recession.  The way out of it is to eliminate wasteful spending.  We suggest the Government should start at the top by capping the wages of senior civil servants at €100,000, creating a wealth tax and, importantly, putting a €7 billion package in place to stimulate job creation and help the economy to grow.Government spokespersons seem to be on the airwaves night and day.  They are on our television screens on a daily basis to tell us just how bad things really are.  They say we must learn to live within our means.  They remind us that there is simply not enough money to go around.  That is not true, however.  The money is available and we can choose what to do with it.  Over €20 billion has been taken out of the economy since 2009.  On 2 November the Government chose to sign away €715 million to unsecured bondholders.  It has promised another windfall — €1.25 billion on this occasion — for unguaranteed bondholders in January 2012.  How many children would sleep safer and warmer in their beds tonight if money was put into child benefit rather than the bank accounts of unguaranteed bondholders?  This time last year the Labour Party lambasted Fianna Fáil and the Green Party for cutting child benefit.  It covered every part of the country, including my constituency, with posters calling on the people to vote for the Labour Party in order to protect child benefit.  Where has that approach gone?  I appeal to the Government, especially the Labour Party, not to cut child benefit.  If it does, it will be remembered for it.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I welcome the opportunity to speak to this important motion.  At a time when more and more families are struggling to make ends meet, the job of the Government and legislators is to ensure the most vulnerable in society are protected.  The Government has a clear choice in the House tonight.  I am sure Members on all sides are used to dealing with people who face serious financial constraints.  We are familiar with the hardship and suffering it can cause.  We have met mothers and fathers who go without to ensure bills are paid and children are fed.  This is Ireland in 2011.  It was not supposed to be like this and it does not have to be, as we have options.I am sure the Cabinet has had time to consider many of the options available to it.  It must decide whether to apply blunt cuts which affect everyone.  By their very nature, such cuts have a disproportionate effect on those least able to cope.  Alternatively, it could apply progressive measures that target those with a little more fat to burn.  I do not know how more clearly I can put it.  I would have thought Labour Party Deputies, in particular, would be acutely aware of the choice they face.  It is a question of the difference between people having one less meal or one less holiday.  Should people have to go without adequate home heating or electricity, or without the latest technology update?  I implore Government Deputies to recognise the difference.  I cannot believe they do not see these problems in their constituencies day in, day out.  I trust they represent everyone, not just the section of society that is relatively protected.  If they are more interested in the latter group, that would go some way towards explaining the options that seem to be floating about.The ideological argument that supports cutting the welfare rates that protect the most vulnerable in society, rather than imposing taxes on those who earn more than €100,000 per annum, for example, has been rife in this country in recent years.  I suggest it is a matter of relativity.  The effect of increased taxes and cuts on the quality of life of individuals or families is relative and proportionate to their ability to pay.  This is straightforward.  There is an abundance of evidence to show this devastating recession is affecting some people much more severely than others.  The figures for indicators such as mental health problems, suicide, alcoholism, depression, stress and anxiety are startling.  In that context, it beggars belief the Government seems set to target children.  It would be a major indictment of the Government, particularly the Labour Party — the party of Connolly — if it failed to see the inequality, injustice and unfairness of a cut in child benefit.The Government must appreciate that child benefit is a vital source of income for many families.  It contributes to paying for many of the essentials — not luxuries — in a child's life.  I refer to food and drink, for example.  Many families use it to meet the ever-increasing cost of school books, uniforms and lunches.  Depending on the way parents or guardians organise their household budgets, child benefit can help to meet heating and electricity costs, which are essentials for any child.It is impossible to reflect on the possibility of a scurrilous attack on child benefit without examining the broader question of the Government's less than impressive approach to children and children's rights.  Like most people, I welcomed the appointment of a dedicated Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Nonetheless, I am horrified to read HSE figures on a monthly or quarterly basis that prove we are continuing to fail the country's children, particularly the most disadvantaged or vulnerable children.  We are still waiting for implementation of the recommendations of the Ryan report and the long-promised referendum on children's rights to be held.  Every member of the Government must examine the potential devastating effect of their decisions on the lives of ordinary people.  We recognise these are difficult times and difficult choices must be made.  The Government does have choices all the same.  In its pre-budget submission, Sinn Féin outlined alternatives which would protect those most at risk including children.  Tonight, every Member has the opportunity to show their position on this.

It is particularly interesting that Sinn Féin should be putting such a motion when its Minister for Education in Northern Ireland, John O'Dowd, is overseeing education cuts that may see 4,000 jobs lost in the next year, described by the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, as financial Armageddon.  Tomorrow, public service workers in Northern Ireland are expected to take strike action over the 3.2% additional pension contributions from public sector workers.  While it appears Sinn Féin is willing to take tough measures when in government in Northern Ireland, its Members here object to the reforms and tough measures that need to be taken to restore the Republic's economic sovereignty.The Government calls on the House to reject the Sinn Féin motion for several reasons.  The motion fails to acknowledge the economic situation confronting us requires us to put our public finances on a more sustainable footing so we can eventually restore our economic sovereignty, a critical issue for the future of all our children.  I accept Sinn Féin Members care about children but so does every other Member.  Guaranteeing our children's future starts with getting our economic sovereignty back.  If Sinn Féin is so concerned about our economic sovereignty, it has never explained why it voted for the bank guarantee in 2008.

The Department of Social Protection provides a wide range of supports to families and their children through the social protection system.Easily the best known is the child benefit payment, paid on a universal basis to approximately 600,000 families in respect of some 1.1 million children.  The current rates of child benefit are €140 per month in respect of the first and second child, €167 per month for the third child and €177 per month for the fourth and subsequent children.  In contrast, the rate of child benefit in Northern Ireland is approximately €100 per month for the first child and approximately €65 per month for each additional child.  Other allowances such as family income supplement are also accessible in the Republic.  The supports in the Republic are much higher than those offered in the North by the Sinn Féin Government there.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	441	Many media commentators do not seem to like the fact that child benefit is a universal payment, paid to all families with children to cover that part of their life cycle where the demand on income is at its peak whereas the capacity to earn income is often constrained through caring responsibilities.  Child benefit redistributes our income from times when we have less need of it to times when our needs are greatest.  It should be no surprise then that universal child benefits are strong features of social protection systems in most developed countries.  I am a strong supporter of universal child benefit payments.  It is an important element of our social welfare system which should be retained even with structural reforms of the system.Some commentators also claim supports for families with children should be targeted at those with low incomes.  This point seems to be made in ignorance of the fact that child benefit is not the only mechanism to support families and that an increasing part of the total amount spent on support for families is targeted in this way.  The social protection system provides assistance to low-income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases to primary social welfare payments and family income supplement.  Qualified child increases are paid in respect of some 500,000 children.  Approximately 26,000 families benefit from the family income supplement to their employment income which provides assistance in respect of approximately 60,000 children.  Our tax code does not make provision for children but it is done through the universal direct child benefit payment, a system that has been in place since the early 1970s.  There used to be tax allowances for children but they were done away with in favour of a universal direct cash payment to the caring parent, usually the mother, because this was considered to be the best way of delivering capacity to her to spend for the good of her children.  The payment has worked well in that regard.The Department spends more than €3 billion on children, two thirds of which goes on child benefit.  This accounts for almost 15% of my Department's spending of more than €20 billion.  One of the core commitments in the programme for Government is the restoration of fiscal stability.  Given the scale of the economic crisis, the Government recognises that it is necessary to address all aspects of the public finances to ensure that they are sustainable and that fairness exists in the allocation of public resources.  In line with the growth in the social protection budget during the boom, spending on child income supports increased from just under €1.3 billion in 2001 to approximately €3.1 billion in 2010.  This was largely driven by the increase in expenditure on child benefit, which more than doubled during the same time period from €935 million to €2.2 billion.  It is right that the Government should examine all its options in assessing the best way forward.Consequently, the transition to a more balanced budgetary position simply cannot be made without affecting social welfare spending, including child income support payments.  In the long term, this will help to maintain an adequate system of social protection for our citizens.  While recognising these constraints, the Government is aware of the severe impact of the economic crisis on children and their families and we are determined to protect them from the worst consequences of this deep recession.  I want to be part of a Government that will grow the country out of the recession and give children whom we correctly cherish so much an opportunity to become financially independent when they grow up.I remind the House that the EU and IMF programme of financial support commits the Government to a further adjustment of at least €3.6 billion in the budget, including a reduction in expenditure of €2.1 billion.  In making the necessary budgetary adjustments, the Government is determined to do its utmost to protect the most vulnerable people in society.  Our social protection system is in urgent need of both reform and transformation.  Since my appointment as Minister in March, I have examined the social protection system, schemes and policies.  Transformation of our system of social protection is required to ensure that it provides adequate and meaningful support to people in order that they can achieve their full potential.Sinn Féin Members referred to income poor families.  It is bad to categorise children who are brought up in poverty as being in some way or other deficient in respect of the love of their parent or parents.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	446	With regard to tackling poverty, much of the research shows that children most at risk of being in poverty are in families with low educational levels because it is difficult for the parents to get a job.  The research is similar in the UK and the US and it shows that children in those families are at a greater risk of growing up and going from being a child in an income poor household to an adult who is income poor as well.  As we focus on trying to improve outcomes for children, the critical issue in the budget is that the Government reforms how the society gives opportunities and options to them and their parents.  I have often referred to changing our social protection system from being passive to being active and giving parents an opportunity to get back to education and training, and, ultimately, giving them an opportunity to secure a job.  That, in turn, is probably the best way to assist a child to progress in school and to become a financially independent adult.  I hope everybody in the House shares that objective.I cannot comment in detail on the budget but Deputies opposite can rest assured that I have always defended the interests of children and families and universal child benefit payments.  I am having conversations with my colleagues in Government and we shall see next week.  Unfortunately, it will be necessary to achieve cutbacks, just as it has been necessary for Sinn Féin politicians to commit themselves to cutbacks in the North as well.

However, it would be remiss of me not to mention my uncle, Micheál Ó Ríordáin, whom I buried earlier.  He was proud of my achievement in being elected to the House in February.  He had campaigned with me since my first election.  I reflected earlier as we sat in the church about the life chance he had been given by this Republic.  He moved out of the tenement house in which he was brought up to a corporation estate in the 1940s.  The Republic owes a life chance to every child, regardless of who they are, where they are from, their religion, the colour of their skin or the income bracket of their parents.It keeps me awake at night — I am sure this is shared by others — that if we do nothing in the next number of years we will take away the life chance from our children because they had the misfortune to be born over the past few years or in the coming years.  We need to change the language we use to describe the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I find it offensive that people constantly state that people who are unemployed are costing the Exchequer €20,000 a year and they are a supposed drain on the social protection budget.  This is a societal cost, not an economic cost.  The impact losing a job and being unable to go to work has on an individual and, by extension, on his or her children is immeasurable.  It should not be measured in economic units.I am proud to be a member of the Government because of the some of the initiatives we have taken.  The reversal of the cut in the national minimum wage was not easy and it has not resulted in a huge change but we said we would do it.  We are determined to defend the Croke Park agreement because it defends the rights of low paid public servants.  Many Members have different views on the joint labour committee system but when we were targeted by representatives of the conservative Catholic right who suggested that members of my party and other parties were in some way anti-Catholic, I wish they had been so vociferous when we protected the rights of those who worked on a Sunday, the traditional day of rest, because they had to work to put bread on the table for their children, and ensured they would be compensated for giving up their Sundays.  Commentators on the conservative Catholic right were silent on that issue, which has had more of an impact on the family unit than any of the other stuff they go on with.  Poverty has the biggest impact on the family and I wish they would realise that.I appreciate the motion and I welcome the opportunity to discuss matters relating to children.  We are trying to correct the mistakes made in respect of our economy.  There is only one chance to be a child.  Unlike my uncle, Michéal, and my father, many children do not get the opportunity to fulfil their potential.  The social welfare system does not, in many respects, act as an enabler.  In many circumstances, it almost acts as a cage.  Everyone knows a cage will protect one from the wolves.  However, it does not enable a person or set him free.  In the context of what we are trying to deliver in respect of the education budget, one of the things of which I am extremely proud is the literacy strategy.  We are determined to push that strategy forward because if one cannot read, one cannot play a full role in society.People must take the totality of what the Government is doing into account when discussing the possibility of maximising children's potential.  As already stated, people only get one chance at childhood.  It is not a person's fault if he or she happens to be born in the middle of an economic crisis.  That fact must be taken into consideration when discussing the concerns raised in the motion.  I wish that every child could have the opportunity to grasp the life chances of which my uncle, Michéal, managed to avail, to live the kind of life he lived and to maximise their potential.  This is why I hope that next week we will be able to stand up and be proud of the direction the Government proposes to take.
#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion and on the Government amendment to it.  Since the Government has taken control of the country — which was so badly let down by the previous Administration — its primary ambition has been to restore economic sovereignty and to create a nation of which our children and their children can be proud and in which they can grow up and prosper.  I have no doubt that all Ministers are battling extremely hard to keep to an absolute minimum the impact of the cuts which must be visited upon the people they represent.I compliment the Minister on what she said and I welcome her commitment in respect of reform.  The recently published review on child income support makes specific reference to merging, in a more coherent fashion, the tax and social welfare systems.  It also refers to the position of self-employed people in the context of accessing social welfare payments.  Anyone who canvassed for support during the general election campaign and who met self-employed people will be aware that these individuals have experienced particular difficulties in accessing such payments.  The Minister has referred to this matter in the past.There are four different schemes by means of which child income support is provided.  Of these, family income support, qualified child increases and the back to school clothing and footwear allowances are all targeted in nature.  These three payments should be amalgamated into a single, universal payment.  The ambition in this regard is to encourage parental employment and reduce the administrative burdens and stresses on families seeking to secure three different payments.Sinn Féin's motion begins quite well and we all recognise the fantastic work being done by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Barnardos.  The motion notes the promise in the programme for Government in respect of maintaining social welfare rates.  We all want that promise to remain intact.  In the context of this motion we are dealing with a case of what I would term the pot calling the kettle orange.  In the North, where Sinn Féin is actually in power——

I have no doubt that Members on all sides of the House and the public are in agreement that investing in our country's children, tackling child poverty and removing poverty traps from the social welfare system are issues of immense importance.  During the economic boom, the overall amount devoted to expenditure on children grew significantly.  However, it is now abundantly clear that simply throwing money at the problem of child poverty is not, in itself, a solution.  Real, practical and structural reform is required.  I appreciate the Minister's use of the term "structural reform".Last week I visited a number of child and family resource centres and youth facilities throughout County Wicklow in the company of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  We saw first hand the excellent work being done at so many levels in communities in homework clubs, breakfast clubs, youth centres and through the provision of child care and training and further education for young parents.  So much is being done by so many, often on a voluntary basis.  It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge this in any debate relating to child poverty and the need to support this nation's children.  I warmly welcome the fact that the Minister has asked the advisory group on tax and social welfare to prioritise the matter of family and child income supports.  This highlights the importance the Government attaches to this issue.I understand that the Minister and the Government are constrained in the context of the current economic situation.  The Government finds itself in a position which no one would wish to occupy.  We must restore our economic sovereignty and independence so that we might control our own future and that of our children as quickly as possible.  There are a number of actions the Government can take if we are to genuinely tackle issues relating to supporting the vulnerable, protecting children and targeting limited resources at the areas in which they are most needed and can be best used.I refer to three matters to which the Minister for Social Protection should give consideration.  The first of these is the elimination of poverty traps in the current social welfare system.  We hear about such traps each year when the budget is about to be introduced.  It is time we stopped talking about these traps and began trying to eradicate them.  Social welfare is there to help people when they are in need; it should not create an environment in which an individual, often a young parent, finds himself or herself unable to return to the workforce or to take up a training opportunity for fear of losing too many supports.  We must assist those who are doing their level best for their families, specifically their children.  I urge the Minister to consider ways of assisting people in respect of the transition from the social welfare system into the workforce.  This is something positive and constructive which could be achieved within the economic constraints that apply.The second matter relates to co-ordination between Departments and State agencies.  The Committee of Public Accounts is continually being informed that various computer systems do not communicate with each other.  Last week we were informed that there is not even in existence a database relating to primary school children.  If we want to get serious with regard to targeting resources, tracking children's progress and ensuring that the vulnerable are protected, it is high time the computer systems to which I refer began communicating with each other.  I do not know who "Mr. Systemic Failure" is but he seems to be responsible for all the problems that have arisen in this country during my lifetime.The third matter I wish to raise is one in respect of which I possibly differ from colleagues on this and the opposite side of the House.  I refer to the need to target resources.  I take the Minister's point that universality is desirable and that there are other supports available.  However, the blunt increases provided in recent years did not take account of the broader point regarding the need to protect children.The opposite is also true.  A blunt decrease will affect everybody equally despite the fact that some may be more vulnerable than others.  This is an area at which we need to look.  The Minister may tell me, correctly, that she does not have it within the ability of the current system to do it this year, but let us hope that by next year's budget we are not using the same line and there is reform to ensure that the funding goes where we all want it to go.These are three constructive measures the Minister could take.  Child poverty must be addressed comprehensively and this can not be achieved without these reforms to the social welfare system.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	467	Like other speakers, I thank the proposing party, Sinn Féin, for bringing forward this motion and affording us the opportunity to speak in support of it.One must look back at the history of the child benefit payment, the children's allowance as we know it.  In the previous Government's time in office, from 2000 to 2009, it was raised by 330%.  When we spoke about this issue and others relating to the social protection brief some weeks ago, those Governments were accused of being populist and of electioneering and so forth.  As I stated then, I repeat now: that is the purpose of politics in its republican ethos in that when one has it, one distributes it.  One tries to help those who are in most need and one tries to put services and programmes in place in order to help and protect the most vulnerable.  There has been in this entire child protection area investment in child care and resource centres, in preschool places and in the school education system itself.In recent times, especially in recent months, there is a new cohort which is dependant on various forms of social welfare payment.  That was nowhere more evident than in the back-to-school allowance scheme.  Massive numbers applied for that scheme this year and there are still some cases today being processed and awarded.  I appreciate the difficulty the Department encountered in this regard and the efforts the Minister made to deal with them in so much as her Department could, based on the constraints of personnel and so forth.  That, in itself, would make plain for all to see that the universal child protection payment system was never more needed than it is now.  This new cohort has so many constraints and difficulties to deal with.  Many of them never thought they would find themselves in that situation based on their position with work, with mortgages on their homes and with the cost of education, and the threat of being faced with more hikes in the case of the latter.That same Government took no pleasure in the past number of years in taking almost €21 billion out of the public finances, including a 4% cut in social welfare rates across the board this time last year.  That included cuts in child benefit payments.  That was done in the face of an oncoming election.  We most certainly could not have been accused at that time of being populist or of electioneering.That election, many would argue, did not need the kind of rhetoric that was prevalent, especially in the final week of the campaign.  When the budget was put before the Dáil last year, it was vehemently opposed by all sides other than that of the Government, but one party promised to overturn those cuts.  One party then, on entering Government, promised to maintain welfare rates.  One party stated in the last week of the election campaign that child benefit was a red-line issue.  It was stated that Fine Gael needed to drop its stance on child benefit before the Labour Party would even begin to consult with it about the possibility of forming a Government.The Labour Party stated that cuts in child benefit were savage.  It voted against the Finance Bill and against the four year plan.  Yet, many members of this Government are happy to take the plaudits of international commentators and of European partners when they are congratulated for the manner in which they have tackled the public finances and closed the gap between what we spend and what we take in.During that election, there was much deliberation and engagement among the candidates and the public.  Many of the parties made no grandiose promises and many of the candidates who voiced that opinion with those at the door were commended for their stance in that regard.  In my own case, it had to be said that the gap had to continue to be closed, there was no magic fix, there was no silver bullet and we had to continue to wrestle with that prospect.In the meantime, we have seen the interest rate applicable to the bailout funds that we have drawn down reduced.  Many would argue this was by accident rather than design by virtue of the contagion that spread and so forth, but that is neither here nor there.  We are in a slightly different place than we were.  On the manner in which banks are capitalised, our partners in Europe have come up with a mechanism by which that can be done, contrary to the one to which the Government of which my party was a member had to adhere back then.The Government is faced with the prospect of closing the gap between expenditure and income in this year's budget by approximately €3.8 billion.  My party agrees.  I believe all parties, even the Sinn Féin Party, agree with those figures but the problem may lie in the fact that the Government predicates the figure on the basis of growth next year of approximately 1.6% or 1.8%.  The ESRI states that the growth rate will be somewhat less than that.  The position in Europe and in the eurozone indicates further recession in many countries and that puts in grave jeopardy any predictions of that nature, despite the success of our innovators and exporters.  That would mean that the task the Government envisages next year will be even greater than the one before it this year.  If that is the case I shudder to think, if the past few weeks are anything to go by, where we will be halfway through next year, when the Government begins to fly kites about what is expected then because there were so many of them in the air in the past few weeks that air traffic control was having difficulty guiding planes into this country.  It may be that this is merely a cynical exercise in order to appease some backbenchers.We, as a party, do not propose to oppose for the sake of opposition.  As I stated, I acknowledge we are committed to the same targets but we must seek to broaden the tax base and not to allow a narrow dependency in the future.  To remain with such a narrow focus may allow us to become unstuck, and maybe that is where the Government finds itself.The Government has committed to no increase in taxes and to no decrease in welfare rates, yet the Minister states the Government can meet the targets.  The watering down of that commitment by some Government members over the past number of weeks is worrying, for instance, when one hears a Deputy state that the Government is committed to primary rates.  When I and, I am sure, other Deputies meet people at clinics and on the streets and elsewhere, they tell us they are finding it difficult to survive.  When they are dependent on social welfare income of any kind or combination, they do not know the difference between primary and secondary payments.  Children especially do not know the difference between primary and secondary payments.  They must be protected at all costs, as must the elderly.Is it not strange to think we are talking about this issue and the threat and worries for families in fear for those funds that come into the house dedicated solely towards children's rights and welfare while, allied to that, community care nursing homes are threatened with closure throughout the country?  Is that a measure of where we are before the budget?

When the country gave the Government its mandate, it was given the authority to address the issues that will confront it.  Much of that mandate was based on its canvass, its communication and the message it gave the electorate.  The message that rang loud and clear then rings loud and clear now.  "Child benefit is a red line issue" — the Government can prove it next week.  "Social welfare rates will be maintained" — this was repeated consistently by members of the Government.  To be fair to the Minister, despite many questions from me and others, she never gave that commitment.  Her colleagues did, however, and her leader did, as late as three weeks ago on the plinth.That is what the electorate will remember.  For sure, they will remember 14 years.  For sure, we have taken a message from the last election.  Our party has many issues to address and we will continue to address them in the best manner we can.  We will reorganise our organisation.  We will deal with the people in trying to formulate alternative policy.  We will come forward with an alternative budget setting out the ways and means by which we, as a party, feel we can achieve the same figures the Government is looking to achieve in regard to the public finances.  We will put that there.  It will not be plucked out of the sky.  However, I can say for definite it will not involve cutting child benefit rates, although it did last year.

#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I particularly want to acknowledge the work of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, an organisation driven by volunteers, in the real sense of the word.  The society is in a unique position to speak on poverty, the effects of the cuts to date and the potential effect of further cuts.  It is not the typical lobby group whose members make their presentation in Buswells and then return to their offices and high salaries.  Its members are out in the hostels and centres, in the shops and housing associations, on home visitations and working with the most vulnerable in society.  I want to acknowledge its pre-budget submission.This voluntary group had to spend €75 million last year and has told us it received an unprecedented number of calls last year.  One of the most distressing figures is that in our country €9 million was spent on food by that voluntary organisation.  The society acknowledges that those most in need are families with children, in particular one-parent families, people living alone and migrants.  The Government must keep the commitments it outlined in the programme for Government.I note the amendment acknowledges the importance of child benefit and social welfare spending, as part of which €3.1 billion is a very significant amount, and reference is made to sustainable public finances.  The amendment also refers to ensuring "fairness exists in the allocation of resources" and I hope that is what we will see next week.  Some groups are very vulnerable, in particular those dealing with mental health and disabilities, as well as senior citizens who must rely solely on social welfare and children.The UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child refers to a happy childhood and the right to develop but also to the right to adequate nutrition, housing, recreation, medical services and education.  Child benefit is important in protecting children from poverty.  I accept some who get it do not need it whereas others need more, and those who can afford it should contribute more towards our economic and social recovery.  However, when we look at what is facing children if this is cut, we should remember that nobody should go to school hungry, every child should be able to look forward to Santa Claus and children should not feel inadequate because they do not have the right books in school.  They should all have the pre-school and after-school facilities and the clubs to which they are entitled.A humane and civilised society would not cut the remaining supports to the poorest among us because those cuts will further increase inequalities and will lead to massive social problems further down the line.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I support the Sinn Féin motion.  I raised this issue previously with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, when I specifically put the question to her on the basis of the 2010 UNICEF report, The Children Left Behind: A League Table of Inequality in Child well-being in the World's Rich Countries, and asked her whether she would stand over a cut in child benefit or oppose it if it was brought in as part of the budget cuts.  She did not answer, obviously.Welfare payments, even at the inadequate levels paid at present, play a crucial role in combatting poverty.  If left to market forces, the figures show that those at risk of poverty would be 41% of the population, and an incredible 52% in the EU-27, according to an European Anti-Poverty Network, EAPN, report.  When social transfers are included, the level of poverty risk falls to 16% both in Ireland and the EU-27.  The role of social transfers in affecting poverty levels is further confirmed by that 2010 UNICEF report, The Children Left Behind.Some 600,000 families with over 1 million children are paid universal child benefit, which I support.  For the record, contrary to the claim that welfare in Ireland is high and a disincentive to work, welfare payments in Ireland are the lowest in the original EU-15 states and a report from the same group, EAPN, from 2009 states in regard to social protection spending in the EU-15 that while there was an average spend of 27% of GDP, Ireland was the lowest at 18.2%.Some €809 million was cut from welfare in 2010 and €873 million was cut in 2011.  Factoring in the Christmas bonus cuts and cuts in fuel allowance earlier this year, in excess of €1.7 billion has been cut, which is almost 14% in five years.  This is despite what the Minister said in her contribution about unemployment having trebled and more people now depending on the welfare system.Hands off the people on social welfare.  It is impossible to see where €700 million can be cut without cutting the basic rates.  We hear rent supplement being flown as a kite in recent days, another cut in lone parent's allowance has been put into the public arena and the possibility of child benefit cuts is being suggested.  People are stressed out by all this talk of cuts to their income.  It is imperative that a child poverty impact statement is made along with any budget deduction next week because it is imperative we know how this budget will impact on child poverty.I am not asking the Minister to say what she is going to cut; I just want her to say that she is not going to cut in these areas, which will suffice to calm people down.  There are choices.  The top 1% of Irish adults hold €131 billion of wealth in this country and the top 5% hold €219 billion.  That money is not being touched and they are not being taxed on their assets.In practically every other country there is an asset tax.  Why does the Minister not pursue them, make them pay their fair share and use the money to reverse the cuts, rather than impose more?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	478	Deputy Jerry Buttimer was in possession.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	479	In welcoming the Minister's announcement tonight in the House, it is important that we also send a message or signal to those in charge of semi-State bodies.  The Government has continually raised the issue of the pay of those in charge of these bodies.  It was bizarre that an organisation such as Coillte had to wait until after the weekend to act, after gauging public reaction to the fact that its chief executive officer had not complied with the Government's request to reduce his salary.  This behaviour is unacceptable.  Contrast it with that of President Higgins who voluntarily took a cut in pay.There is a culture of entitlement prevailing in this country and has been for a long time.  I listened to Deputy Cowen speaking to the Private Members' motion and could not believe he had the temerity to speak about the past decade when his party presided over the exponential growth in pay for those at the top of the pyramid in the public service.  The Government has shown leadership and courage in tackling salaries and the issue of reform.  It is important to point out that these are not ordinary but extraordinary times.  Regardless of whether we like it, there is absolute outrage at the pay, pensions and severance packages not just of many of those who have left the Government but also of those who are employed by the State at higher levels in the public service.I knock on doors every week and live in the real world.  There is absolute incredulity among people at the way top civil servants can walk out with the amount of money they receive and walk back into jobs again the next day.  I call on those in receipt of State pensions and also employed elsewhere to hand back their pensions to the State.  That is leadership; that is what public service is about.  It is about bringing people with us.  It is not enough to say we are dismayed, despondent and outraged at the level of pay being awarded to people at the higher levels.  Will somebody explain how a person in their fifties can walk away with a lump sum of X amount, a pension of Y amount and still be able to go out and work?  It is wrong.  I am glad the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and his Cabinet colleagues have tackled this issue in the House tonight.  I understand the constraints under which they must work, but I really wish they could go further because when we are talking about savings, reform and leadership, we must start with those at the top of Irish society, be it in business, the semi-State sector, the public service or politics.Will the Minister, please, dispel the myth and rumour about the laundry arrangements of politicians and Ministers?  We have been hearing about it all week.  I am happy to confirm that I wash and iron my own clothes; nobody gets paid to do it.  I hope the rest of the Members do the same.  It is important to send the message from this House that we are here as the people's representatives.The Minister is right that it is not just about quantity but also about equality of treatment.  The Government has taken the initiative and shown leadership, not just now but from its first day in office.  I also wish to praise the Chief Justice for her leadership.  I made this point when I spoke in the House on the referendum Bill earlier in this session.  She showed absolute leadership, as have the members of the Cabinet.  The proposal the Minister has made tonight regarding public service pensions is welcome.  Real reform must be linked with leadership by those in authority.I call on all people in authority to show leadership.  This is a time when those at the very top of semi-State organisations, business, banking and private industry can show leadership and patriotism and bring people with them.  This is not about ideology or scoring political points but about getting the country back off its knees.  It is about inspiring young people who are in school wondering if they will have a college place or a job.  It is about the mothers who are crying and lonely about their children being abroad and about those who are abroad having the dream of being able to return.  If we want nothing else for ourselves, we should seek to have a country in which we can grow old, in which there will not be austerity and in which there will not be a return to the days of the boom and gloom of the Celtic tiger economy, in which we lost the run of ourselves and the sense of community and our sense of identity as a people were lost to the lure of the euro.  That is the reality.I am a public servant.  We have the Croke Park deal which I very much welcome.  However, if there is to be reform in the public service, it must be benchmarked against that deal.  I am not in favour of cutting the pay of public servants, but I support reform in which we can have an equitable health system, a proper public service that is fit for purpose and in which our schools and health system will provide quality teaching and care.  The job of the Government is to secure that reform and augment the good work being done in the public service, not to demonise public servants.I congratulate the Minister on his initiative tonight.  I hope it marks the beginning of further reform.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is a little unreal in a sense to be discussing this issue after listening to the previous debate on social welfare rates.  Those who are marginalised and in receipt of some benefit from the State will be dealt with in the context of the forthcoming budget by a decision we will make that day in this House.  The following day their lifestyle and household income, already limited, will most certainly be changed, perhaps dramatically.Contrast this with what we have experienced in the last few years, with people feeling they were in a position of entitlement and that they were an elite and untouchable group.  It does not say many positive things about our society or us as politicians and the way we legislated or dealt with the affairs of State, how Members of the House and those who administered the State were paid and the way we received entitlements.  As a Fianna Fáil politician involved in and part of those Governments in the last few years, I accept full responsibility for these decisions.  They were wrong and not challenged robustly enough to give us the balance in society for which we now strive.It is pity that it was necessary to hold a referendum, followed by this legislation, to signal clearly to people seen as an elite that they were living beyond the normal person and in a land that was certainly not shared by the great body of people whose lives had been affected by the universal social charge, reductions in benefits or just adjustments in their personal lives by way of their employment in the private sector.  They did not have a choice.  They did not have a referendum.  All they had was the decision of the market to stop trading or downsize.  Employers had to make unreal decisions, as I know from my own business.  One was faced with challenges and decisions one simply did not want to face up to.  One would prefer if they did not have to be made but if one did not face up to them, one was out of business.  While we grappled with all of that, another sector of society — the Judiciary and others — were receiving massive amounts of money in terms of their income.  I agree the political system can be blamed for that.  I am delighted the Government reacted quickly in terms of its response, and I compliment its members on the reduction to their own salaries, expenses and so on.  They are to be commended on that.  I encourage them to be brave to move beyond that and make whatever decisions are necessary to bring about equality in this society, as described by the previous speaker.Speakers in the previous debate spoke about the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the troika and social welfare but they do not compare well in terms of debates, this one following the other.  It shows how out of touch many people in receipt of these salaries were and, therefore, I welcome the Bill, but the Minister should go further.  That might be something that is always said by the Opposition.  I am not sure — it is my first time to be in opposition — but we should know the salaries of those in AIB, Anglo Irish Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency and so on.  They should not come before the Committee of Public Accounts and say they do not intend telling us how much they earn.  We should know what they earn.  The taxpayers pay their taxes and they expect transparency now.  It is not a case of politics as usual, thanks be to God.  It is change and reform.Regarding reform, I differ from the Minister on some aspects of it but reform in a positive direction in terms of moving us away from where we stand now politically and the way we administer our country is hugely important to our success in the private sector, and in the public sector about which I have said a great deal.  There are many good people in the public sector who will be heartened by some of the actions the Minister will take and who will act accordingly in their jobs and deliver us a service we can be proud of and that can be at the cutting edge of development in terms of the public sector and service delivery within Europe.  We are a small enough country to be able to turn quickly and achieve that and to be that example for others to follow, and looking at what has happened in other countries in Europe in recent months in terms of their financial policy and so on it is obvious they need reform.  They need to detach themselves from whatever position they are in and reattach themselves to the reforms the ordinary people in the street want and the certainty in their lives they want from these budgets.  What Europe is doing currently is causing so much uncertainty it is difficult to work or trade in terms of tomorrow or the day after.  Everything is done for the here and now and, almost certainly, it is done in cash.  That will require us to reform our system and get confidence back.  These measures will bring us somewhat nearer to getting confidence back.I welcome the other amendment the Minister will introduce on the reduction rate of 20% in public service pensions.  It was wrong that senior civil servants and politicians had pensions which I understand were to the value of almost €6 million when they were worked out.  The Minister is right to bring forward that amendment and to send out the message that such pensions will no longer be tolerated either for those of us in this House or for those involved in the administration of this country.In terms of the others — the 99 people in education and those in Coillte — Deputy Fleming will introduce a number of amendments which should be given serious consideration.  If it is not business as usual, and it cannot be, it cannot be business as usual in this House either.  In the spirit of proper governance, and acknowledging the huge majority the Government has, the Opposition will have some reasonable suggestions to make.  Deputy Fleming's suggestion that, in terms of the semi-State bodies listed, the salaries would not exceed €250,000, and €200,000 in education, should be looked at positively by the Minister.  As the Minister did when he was in opposition, we discussed the amendments.  We are serious about them.  I accept the Minister might ask why we did not do it when we were in Government but let us park all of that political guff and examine where we are now and where we are going because as an Opposition we are here to assist and to put forward our views.  A certain balance is needed in terms of the democratic nature of this House because of the Government majority, and I respectfully propose that when these amendments are discussed some leeway should be given on them.In terms of the Croke Park agreement mentioned by Deputy Buttimer, and benchmarking, I believe the agreement is not sustainable.  We need to examine it.  That is not to say we should examine the salaries and commitments made to the front line service operators, but other aspects of this deal must be examined.  These relate to the delivery of real reform in terms of value for money and doing business differently, including outsourcing, procurement and bringing the services together.  I have heard the Minister speak about this and it is up to those who serve with us to do that.  It is not a case of "us" and "them".  I believe that all of those Departments and agencies serve with us in this House and they must look at themselves in terms of ensuring that they give value for money, that they have the right numbers of staff, that board members are attending, and that the 145 quangos built up over the past 15 years are reduced drastically to size.  All of that must be done to address the public mood and to give that confidence.  That is the reason we were elected here.  We have had a result from the last election.  I am responding to it as positively as I can but the Croke Park deal must come under scrutiny because we cannot deliver a budget looking at only one side of the equation.  If the other side of that budget governed by the Croke Park deal is not delivering in terms of reforms and what is necessary to make this country run better, it must be questioned constructively by us.  It does not just stop at the salaries for the high players, but in terms of the delivery of all the reform that is urgently needed.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this legislation.  Like everybody else, this Bill is brought before the House out of necessity.  It is one of those things that has happened.  This country's economy has taken a fearful nose-dive and it is normal to expect everybody to make some kind of contribution in the emergency position in which we find ourselves.The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Bill clearly illustrates the junction we are at and what we are about.  There should be no doubt that it is not easy for anybody, at whatever level their income is pitched, to be told they must make some contribution to the situation we are in and it is important that it be done.  It is unfortunate that we have to introduce legislation to do that.  One would have thought, as has happened in many cases, that people in a particular position would voluntarily accept that, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, it would be expected that everybody would make a contribution, particularly those at the higher level.  I am not dismissing the fact that people may have commitments and may have liabilities which they entered into in good faith when times were better.  That is understandable but the fact remains that everybody else has those commitments as well.  People at every level of income throughout our entire economy have previously entered into commitments which impose on them liabilities that are ongoing, and they still have to shoulder the burden in that regard.It is timely that we do so and accept that we must put our shoulder to the wheel together.  That is hugely important.  I warn against any attempt to divide society, something that is increasingly populist, to seek political advantage.  It is not at all uncommon to pretend there is a different avenue of approach and an easier way out, that somehow we do not have to do these things, and that if a different Administration were in control, there would be a different remedy.  That is not so, I am afraid.  The situation is much more serious than that, and we should be very careful not to give that false impression.  Giving a false impression of a populist nature, as is now the case, will merely undermine public confidence in politics.  It is not in the interest of politics, either in opposition or government, that this happens.I sympathise with the point made by Deputy McGuinness.  Members of this House who were in the outgoing Administration obviously want to put clear blue water between themselves and the situation that brought us to where we are now.  They want the people to forget and they want to encourage the people into pretending that there is an easier, less painful way out.  Where did we hear that before?  I have been hearing that since I came into this House many years ago.  The fact is that there is no easy way out now.  It is a sad sight, but there is no easy way out.I read an interesting comparison recently.  I do not blame the public sector for what has happened in this.  The public sector was not the sole culprit in this business.  In actual fact, it was the private sector that led us astray, and the public sector followed.  That is a fact.  The comparison stated that in the ten year period of the boom, the public sector in Germany received an annual wage increase of 1.5%, while in this country the public sector received 100% wage increase over ten years.  In other words, there was a 15% increase in Germany, compared with 100% here.  That is a rather strange situation.  I was not given the same figures for the private sector in Germany during that period, but I understand during the same period, salaries in the private sector in this country went up considerably, to the extent of 300% to 400%.  However, the most interesting part is property prices.  During the ten year period of the boom, when we were the richest country in the world, property prices in Germany went up by 80% to 90%, whereas in this country they increased by more than 400%.  If we ever want to find out what was going wrong, we have to look back and ask ourselves what in God's name was going on.We are now reaping the bitter harvest of those halcyon days.  They were happy-go-lucky days when there would be no tomorrow and nobody would ever have to pay back.  Everybody indulged and everybody was encouraged to indulge.  Everybody was misled simply because there was an end coming and it was coming up short.There are those who say that the people should forget about all this, but I do not think they will.  They are going to think about it for a long time.  They will think about it every time they stick their hands in their pocket and contribute to what has happened.  The public will think again and again.  We have experts advising us day and night, wall to wall, floor to ceiling, on radio and television and everywhere else.  Their advice purports to suggest that they knew this was wrong all the time and they pointed it out.  They did not point it out.  They did nothing about it.  They gorged themselves on what was happening at the time.  They said it was great, joined in the applause and cheered on for more.I was listening to an Opposition spokesperson, from the outgoing Administration, saying that his Government had invited the then Opposition to inspect the books, to show them what was there, and that they saw it all.  We did not see it all.  We could not see it all because they did not know what was in the books themselves.  It was not until the IMF came in to tell them all about it that they recognised the true position.  I just cannot believe that this nonsense was going on.  The make believe is still rampant.  There are still people in this country suggesting that it does not have to be this way at all and that there is a softer option.  Do Members of the Opposition remember the soft landing they were telling us about not too long ago?  Do they remember the soft landing for the economy?  It turned into a crash landing, with a very heavy thud, and the reverberations will continue for a long time.

He campaigned for the spending of more money in an economy that did not have enough.  He decided to change course because he felt that the resources were there.  Unfortunately, he was misleading the public, and I would ask him not to continue to mislead the public in the future.I ask Members of the Opposition not to treat us with shrill exclamations, and not to point the finger at the Government and ask why it has not solved the problem after seven or eight months.  I hope the day does not dawn soon when the people suggesting this are given an opportunity to do exactly what they intend to do.  There is a grave danger that something might well happen at some time in the future, and that the whole litany of sacrifices now being made will have to be made all over again, because certain people may well come forward with a suggestion that there is an easier way.   We have heard all that before.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	485	I would like to return the debate to the subject of the Bill.  I assume that the purpose of this Bill is to bring in the action the constitutional amendment which we passed recently.  I was somewhat staggered to find out that judges were not subject to any kind of Government curtailment and that they had never been so.  I had always presumed this and I was absolutely staggered by the fact that this was not the case and that they were exempt from normal public service pay.  Therefore, I welcome the fact that the referendum was passed, and while I do not like parts of it as usual, I welcome the Bill in principle.It beggars belief that there should be any exemption for judges.  It reflects that constitutionally, and in general in society, judges are put on a pedestal in Ireland.  They carry some sort of mystique which I do not believe is deserved.  They are ordinary people with a certain expertise in law who are appointed for various reasons; sometimes for reasons of having expertise, and sometimes not.  Whatever the reasons for their appointment, they are nothing particularly special or elevated, and they certainly should not be put on the pedestal in society as they are, which is why I also welcome the abolition of the tipstaffs and criers in the Bill.  That gives them a kind of superior loftiness, looking down on ordinary people, which they do not otherwise merit.In cutting judges down to size, this is a good Bill.  It begs the question of why a large number of judges believed they should be exempt from normal public service pay rules, especially in the case of curtailment and reductions.  It seems this reflects their own particularly lofty ideas of themselves.  They gave rather obscure reasons for this and they suggested it would be inappropriate for their salary to be reduced by the Government or for them to be subject to public service norms because it would put pressure on them to make decisions that might be political.  They might be right but this begs the question of how they were appointed.  Should we not have tackled the matter of appointments when we were preparing this Bill?  One thing concerning judges which politicians, especially those in government, are loth to acknowledge is that judges are naked political appointees.In the case of this Government, and many previous Governments, there is a veneer or cover given to these appointments whereby the Government will go through the process of having seven names put to it and will then make appointments from the seven names but, ultimately, the Minister and the Government appoint people to the Judiciary and there is no doubt that people with political affiliations are constantly being appointed to the Judiciary by Governments with similar political affiliations.  This damages the reputation of the Judiciary.  Anyone here who discusses the matter with people in the Bar Library informally will hear them refer to such a person as being a Fine Gael person, to another as being a Labour Party person and that it is so and so's turn this time and so on and that this is the way it works.  However, it does not mean these people always make bad judges and I do not suggest as much.  But it means their appointments are sullied by the fact they are made by Governments with definite political preferences.There should be more in this Bill.  The Government had the opportunity to cut the umbilical cord which has existed between successive Governments and the Judiciary and which goes all the way to the Supreme Court.  Judges are coy about this and about their political affiliations when they are appointed.  It is never stated in the press announcements that they may have been Deputies nor is it ever revealed that they may have had affiliations to a given party and the same is the case with any semi-State body.  I suggest a means of examining those appointed to the Judiciary in front of an Oireachtas committee should have been included in this Bill so questions could be asked of them.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	486	It has been stated already but it is worth repeating that the manner in which this Bill is being brought through the House is reminiscent of the previous Government.  We were told by those in the current Government that this was to change, that they would do things differently and that there would be no guillotines.  However, the guillotine will apply to this Bill as it will to other Bills between now and the Christmas recess.Another feature of the background to this Bill is the same austerity policy of the previous Government being carried on by a new Government whose Ministers promised that everything would be different and that vulnerable people would be protected.  In fact we have had a change of faces but the same policy of protecting the rich and powerful in this society while fleecing middle and lower income people and social welfare recipients.  It is a policy of making vulnerable people pay for a recession in which they had no hand, act or part in creating.This is nothing new.  Those of us who were around for the PAYE tax marches some years ago will remember that we were told day after day that there was no pot of gold.  Lo and behold there was a vast pot of gold and a golden circle of rich and powerful people who fleeced the country at the time.  They allowed hospitals to be closed and they stashed away their cash, as they put it in the television gameshow, everywhere and anywhere including in overseas accounts, through DIRT avoidance and by other conduct to ensure they did not pay their fair share.  What happened then?  They were rewarded for not paying their fair share by tax amnesty after tax amnesty which allowed them to get off scot free.  Lo and behold the worst tax amnesty of all was introduced while the Labour Party was in government.  Not only did those affected not pay penalties or interest on tax but they received a tax cut as well.Nowadays, we have a similar situation.  We are being told day after day that the country is bust, broke and that we have no money.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is one of the richest countries in the world.  The difficulty is there is a great inequality in the distribution of wealth.  A recent independent report from the heart of the capitalist system, the Credit Suisse global wealth report of November 2011, informed us that the richest 1% of the population in this country own 28.1% of the wealth, amounting to €131.5 billion.  The wealthiest 5% own 46% of the wealth or €219.3 billion.  Moreover, in the past two years and in the teeth of the recession of 2009 and 2010 the same people made an additional €46 billion.  These are not my figures.  The initial figures are from the Credit Suisse bank and the figure of €46 billion is from the Central Statistics Office.  Again, these wealthy people are getting off scot free.The Bill was an ideal opportunity to introduce a wealth or assets tax, an ideal opportunity to tax high earners, those earning more than €100,000 per year, an opportunity to tax property exiles and an opportunity to raise vast revenues.  There is an opportunity under these three taxes to raise something of the order of €17 billion in one year, made up of €10 billion from the asset or wealth tax, some €5 billion from incomes greater than €100,000 and a further €2 billion from tax exiles.  This is the way to ensure that we put people back to work and to ensure that the recession is beaten.  People with vast amounts of money must pay their fair share and it is about time such people showed some patriotism.  Further, it is about time this Government ensured they showed such patriotism by introducing some of these measures in the Bill.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	487	The result of the recent referendum on judicial pay was overwhelming but we should be clear on the nature of that message.  The people sought for remuneration levels in the Judiciary to be reduced in accordance with those in the public service.  However, they want and remain in favour of an independent Judiciary.  I caught the end of Deputy Ross's remarks.  He left the matter hanging.  It is the case that there have been political appointments to the Judiciary in years past but he cannot point to anyone who served anything other than the interests of the State once they took up their appointment.  This has been the great tradition of the Irish Judiciary since the infancy of the State.  They have served the interests of the people and the citizens of the State regardless of their political background or of who appointed them.  The Judiciary provides the essential checks and balances for this House and the system in this House, which is Executive dominated, regardless of who is part of the Executive.  Throughout the decades the courts have acted consistently as the essential check and balance on that power and the power of this House and we must ensure this continues.The danger with the legislation and the process as currently framed is that a future Cabinet or House may decide that a member of the Judiciary or those in the Judiciary in general are getting too big for their boots, that they are acting in the interests of citizens against the interests of the Government and may decide through some back way to reduce the remuneration as a means of keeping them in check and in balance.I do not doubt the bona fides of most of the current Government in this regard and in particular the bona fides of the Minister.  However, the reaction of another Minister to the views of certain former legal officers of the State during the recent referendum shocked many people.  It was not so much his reaction, because we are used to that, but the manner in which he attacked them rather than the message.In 20 or 30 years time, long after we have all left here, there may be 15 of that type of person around the Cabinet table and we will not know what will happen.  The right and power of the Judiciary to act independently in the interests of the State may, at some stage, become undermined unless we put some sort of safeguards in place.I ask the Minister to examine the Bill, which I am aware is being passed very quickly, and consider setting up an independent judicial remuneration commission such as exists in a number of countries, including Canada.  If a request is submitted to review the pay of the Judiciary in the context of a public service pay review or any other context an independent commission, comprising people of good standing, should be established to examine that.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	489	That is welcome.  It would make non-binding recommendations on the request.  Decisions would not be binding because it is important that checks and balances are kept and the Judiciary cannot and should not get involved in a discussion with the Executive on its remuneration.  If the Government chooses to ignore those recommendations it must set out the reasons why to a parliamentary committee here in the Chamber.I am not interested in protecting individuals.  There has been a lot of talk this evening about semi-State CEOs.  It is important that we point out the majority of serving members of the Judiciary took a voluntary pay cut and only 14 or 15 did not.  It was slightly strange that the new judicial appointments announced subsequent to the referendum are not subject, I understand, to the Bill and the people concerned will have to take a voluntary cut.  Surely there was some way of delaying their appointment for a few weeks until the legislation was introduced or getting them to sign up to something.I have no doubt the individuals involved will accept a cut voluntarily but it sends the wrong message.  There was an 80% "Yes" vote on the day of the referendum, yet the following Wednesday three new members of the Judiciary were appointed on the same terms and conditions as had applied.The phrase "financial emergency measures in the so-called public interest" is wonderful.  I do not know how many times we have heard it over the past number of years.  We are doing a lot of things with a lot of haste and have done so for the past number of years.  I have no doubt the make-up of this or future Oireachtais will protect that but we do not know how these measures will be used by an Oireachtas which may be made up of entirely different sets of politicians than those currently here.I again emphasise that we are not interested in protecting individuals.  Nobody should be above what the country has had to do in terms of salaries and so on.  We need to protect a tradition of judicial independence which has served this State very well and will be required in the months and years ahead.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I am pleased to speak on this Bill.  I compliment the Minister for introducing it.  It is much talked about and needed and the public clearly expressed its wish in a referendum with an 80% "Yes" vote.I have an issue with the holding of elections on Thursdays or Fridays.  They should be held on Saturdays or Sundays.  There are people who want elections to be held on Thursdays and Fridays and work overtime on Saturdays and Sundays.  The system should be changed to allow the highest possible number of people, especially students and people working away from home, to exercise their franchise.The last Government did not get to grips with this problem.  I had many an animated debate with the former Taoiseach, Brian Cown, and the former Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, God rest him, about the capping of salaries in the public service to show faith with the hundreds of thousands of people who have been made redundant.  Businesses and people are struggling and people have emigrated.  Unfortunately the will was not there to deal with the issue.  I do not know why.A culture of "Yes Minister" operated.  I am not blaming the public service in the main because it comprises many hundreds of thousands of good, hard-working people.  With two eyes closed I saw what would happen when we introduced the pension levy two years ago.  Nobody, from the lowest paid to the top, escaped.  I thought there would be a sliding scale but there was not.Many stories circulated at the time that a paper was presented to the late Brian Lenihan in a hospital bed which was pushed onto him to sign.  Senior civil servants were not affected, including directors of services, county managers, superintendents and a wide range of other posts.  I tabled a motion to my party at the time calling on it to reverse the change.  When Brian Lenihan addressed the meeting he thanked me for tabling the motion.When Brian Lenihan researched the issue he found that instead of the 100 people he was told by faithful civil servants were involved, 860 were involved.  I said he was misled and he accepted that.  I came to the conclusion that night that there was a cosy cartel in the senior echelons of power in this country.  I wish the Minister well in trying to unshackle and break it.  I hope he gets full support from the Cabinet, parties and colleagues because it has to happen.  There is huge adversity and trauma in the country.The people want us to take action.  That is why they voted.  They also voted to reject the formation of all powerful committees, and rightly so.  I and my colleagues in the Technical Group opposed the referendum but the media, including RTE, were not interested.  The public are wise, prudent and sharp, and are fed up of the situation in the country.  They are fed up with what has happened since we gained our independence and the way our country has been hijacked by politicians and people in senior positions.  It is nothing short of naked corruption.  I do not say that lightly.Deputy Ross referred to judicial appointments.  They were not independent and were political appointments.  What happened in recent times was shameful.  I was at the mercy of one of these people in a court in my county.  The person was specially picked for my case.

It has been too protected.  I respect judges.  They have to be respected and 99% of them are fine.We should remember that judges are appointed for life.  There should be refresher courses for judges.  Life is a learning curve.  There are very good refresher courses for us when elections are called.  Every day is a learning course.  They are not independent.  Political cronyism has taken place.  The public knows that and is sick of it, which is why it voted the way it did.The Minister at the time and the Chief Justice asked judges to take a voluntary cut.  Most of them did but some did not, which is why a referendum had to be held.  Until tonight when I heard the previous speaker I was not aware that recent appointees will escape these provisions, which is not right.The situation regarding senior public servants and the pension levy sent out the wrong message to Joe Public and Seán Citizen working in any kind of job.  We undermined the process of fairness and equity.  We must have salary caps.  I fought for a long time to have a €200,000 cap imposed.  The Minister is going the right way about dealing with this issue, but we must ensure changes are implemented and there are no blockages.  We should not have a situation where papers are shoved under his nose and he is asked to sign such and such a document.  I accept that the Minister is intent on having a level playing field.  We have not had a situation like this for decades where salaries are going in a downward direction.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	500	Maith an tAire.  In a situation where everybody else is taking pain, it is high time that we got down and dirty with the so-called elite.  I respect these people's positions and their contribution, but my mantra is that there should be a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  With the gowns and wigs and so on, these people are put on pedestals.  In reality, they are ordinary people and they must always remain in touch with their peers over whom they adjudicate.  To go back to my situation, a jury of my peers saw, thankfully, that I was innocent.  This jury was selected from my own county, thank God.  I am glad of that outcome because without it, I, like other people, would be restricted now in terms of being excluded from public service, having difficulty in securing a passport and so on.There are too many skeletons in the cupboards in this State.  I wish the Government well, as we all did upon its appointment.  Its members were like a breath of fresh air back in the spring.  I voted in favour of their appointment.  However, they have started to slip and there is evidence of an emerging arrogance.  During the debate on the Smithwick tribunal, for example, the Minister for Justice and Equality attacked a colleague of mine, his constituency colleague.  It was apparently nothing at all to do with what had happened that morning; it was a total accident.  The Minister was vindictive enough to do that.  In addition, he was foolish in the comments he made at the time of the referendum in lecturing eminent people who gave advice.  These were not judges but former Attorneys General and people like that.There is no doubt that a degree of arrogance has crept in.  It took 12 or 13 years for that to happen to the last Government, and when it did, it did so in earnest and the parties involved ultimately paid the price.  That arrogance is already evident in abundance on the part of one or two of the Minister's colleagues.  It is damaging to the Government and to the body politic.  The Government made many promises when there was no need to do so.  The public was tired of the last lot and wanted change.  People voted for change but they have not got it.This proposal amounts to tinkering with the system.  I acknowledge that these people are probably in the Minister's way and in his company every day.  That is what happens.  There must be a greater separation and distance.  This can be achieved by employing private individuals to assist the Government.  I had expected several such appointments to the Cabinet.  We need their advice, wisdom, enthusiasm, passion, vigour and courage to lift this country out of the morass.  That will not be achieved at the hands of the same people who put us in the morass.  The shameful episode regarding Mr. Cardiff sends out entirely the wrong vibe to the public.  It is a case of "As you were" and jobs for the boys, protecting one of our own.  He is being sent out there where he might bring us all down.  As I said, there are too many skeletons in the cupboard.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I do not agree with everything that was said, but I agree that we should have more time to deal with these provisions.  I will strive in future to ensure sufficient time is available for debate.  The problem is that we are running into the budgetary timeframe and a great deal of legislation is backlogged.  This Bill is not controversial in and of itself.  We had an opportunity to discuss most of its provisions in the context of the debate on the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011, which has passed Second Stage.  Thus, we have already had one iteration of the issues involved.This is very unusual legislation, comprising financial emergency measures in the public interest.  In fact, it is only the fourth Bill of its kind.  It underscores, as I said in my opening remarks, the dire circumstances facing this country.  Notwithstanding Deputy Mattie McGrath's congratulations on implementing these measures, I would not have wished to be among the first Ministers, following my immediate predecessor, to bring in legislation to reduce people's pay.  Nobody wants to do that.  The legislation before us is part of the corpus of so-called FEMPI legislation.  It is not designed exclusively to secure a wodge of money that will solve our economic problems.  Rather, it is designed, as many of the Deputies outlined, to engender a sense of social solidarity, a sense that those with the broadest shoulders will carry the greatest burden.  People tend to be timid and the legal advice is often very robust in urging that these things should not be done.  One can be weighed down, as I am weighed down, with advices on contract law, that one cannot do this or that.  We want the measures we introduce to be as robust as possible.From the very minute we were elected we genuinely tried to inculcate a notion of fairness by capping the Taoiseach's salary at €200,000 and setting that as the pinnacle of public service pay.  That we have succeeded in only a few months in implementing that across the Civil Service is a remarkable achievement in itself.  If those concerned had told us to take a hike, there would have been nothing we could do contractually.  There is a crudeness about imposing a cap.  As I said bluntly at the time I introduced the cap in the commercial semi-State sector — and it might have been unfortunate that I did so — the chief executive officer of Bord na gCon does not have the same responsibilities as the chief executive officer of the ESB.  There must be some relativity if we are to attract people to do these jobs.Several Deputies opposite suggested that there be a general cap of €100,000.  There is a ready listening ear for such proposals on the part of the many people in this country who are badly hurting.  They might argue that €100,000 is a great deal of money.  In truth, however, if I were to introduce such a cap, we would not have cardiac surgeons, cancer specialists, research specialists, people who drive industry or people working in Departments who are of the highest quality.  Science Foundation Ireland would not attract research fellows into our universities.  We must be honest with people in this regard.  It is not only about a model of fairness, important as that is, but also a model of growth.  We must ensure the economy has the capacity to attract and retain people of ability, rather than driving them out of the country.Deputy Sean Fleming queried why the Bill does not apply the mandatory cut to all incumbent public servants.  The Bill deals with those public servants whose pay is set out in legislation.  Anybody with whom we can deal administratively has already been dealt with and those pay rates apply.  The Deputy also asked whether Secretaries General are still on the higher rates of pay.  On the day I announced the cap all Secretaries General volunteered to reduce their pay to the €200,000 threshold.  For the A1 Secretaries General, that represented a very significant reduction.  Two years ago they were earning an additional €85,000, which is a fair whack of a reduction.  They are still earning an awful lot of money, but when one has made lifestyle commitments and so on, agreeing voluntarily to forgo 30% of salary in one go is significant and should be acknowledged.  I am not saying we have already done enough.  This is a process and we will take further action.Deputy Fleming also raised the issue of high-level rates of pay in the National Treasury Management Agency.  I have raised that transparency issue and it is a matter to which we will return.  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald spoke about the President's pay.  That is set in the Constitution at 10% above the rate of pay of the Chief Justice.  Until we secured the constitutional change on the Chief Justice's pay, we could not adjust the pay of the President.  However, the President has taken a voluntary waiver of 23% of pay.There is a great deal more I would like to say but the Ceann Comhairle has indicated that my time is up.  Perhaps I will get a chance during the short Committee Stage to deal with some of the other valuable and important points made.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	504	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 4, line 7, before the word "Section" to insert the following subsection:"3.—(1) Section 1 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 is amended by the insertion of the following definition after the definition of "Civil Service":" ‘Contractor' means a person whose personal services are independently hired on a contract for services basis;".".I wish to raise this substantive issue although I covered some of the points on Second Stage.  The Minister referred to the crudeness of a cap.  Where I disagree with the Minister is that the cap should be for the chief executive of the ESB, while the pay of the Bord na gCon chief executive should be proportionately lower.  The cap was not intended to make all the semi-State companies equal but rather there was a maximum figure for the person on the highest salary.I am happy with the measures in the Bill regarding the Judiciary and members of the Government.  My amendments seek to broaden the measures in the Bill.  There is a general perception that chief executives of semi-State companies now earn below €250,000.  However, this only applies to future office-holders.  I acknowledge those who have accepted a 15% reduction in salary and I believe seven people are still at a higher rate.  The voluntary waiver by individual public servants is no way to run the country.  My amendment would see this waiver becoming statutory, which would copper-fasten the matter for the future.My amendments also include others than the usual list of semi-State companies.  I have included the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, formerly Anglo Irish Bank, an organisation wholly owned by the State.  It may have some form of a commercial mandate but it is not a semi-State body and it is not very commercial.Allied Irish Bank has a new chief executive.  Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure in the summer.  There was a world of difference between the presentations by the chief executives and chairpersons of the two banks to the committee.  The Bank of Ireland wants to reduce the State shareholding from 42% down to 15% and it is going about its banking business in the private sector. However, Allied Irish Bank was required to consult with the Minister for Finance, as its main shareholder, on any difficult question.  It became clear to me that AIB was an organisation subservient to the Department of Finance.  It cannot set its own policy nor can it make unilateral decisions on significant issues because the Minister for Finance is its main shareholder.  I cannot understand why a Secretary General of the Department of Finance earns €200,000 while the chief executive of a subsidiary organisation reporting to him earns much more.  I do not think AIB has a complicated job to do compared with a bank in the private sector because it is now a State body.  This is why I have included it in my amendment.I also include the National Treasury Management Agency.  I have been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts in the past and questions about salaries were not answered.  We have some figures to do with the salaries of the former and current chief executive but it is clear that many people in the NTMA earn salaries much higher than €200,000.  This agency is answerable to the Minister for Finance and I do not agree that underlings should earn more than their boss because he ultimately carries the can, both politically and financially.  There was a time when the NTMA was dealing with bond issues and the financing of the State but this work is now completed.  We were told these people were dealing with the most intricate, high finance matters but some of them must now be twiddling their thumbs because that business is finished.I compliment the Taoiseach and the Ministers for taking reduction in their pay by legislation and I support those measures.  However, I do not support a head of a university being paid more than the Taoiseach.  This is the situation in the case of several universities and third-level institutions.  Third-level research may in cases be co-funded by others, as in the case of the Irish soccer manager's salary where a benefactor is paying some of his salary.  I do not fully agree with this practice because it distorts the situation.  All such salaries should be benchmarked to the Taoiseach's salary.Some medical consultants earn more than the suggested figure.  They have escaped the net despite all the measures for capping pay in the public service.  There is no good reason for this.  Perhaps the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, must have a hold on his Cabinet colleagues and he has been able to exclude his people.  Perhaps we will hear an explanation some day.I refer to Secretaries General of Departments and others who have agreed to a voluntary waiver of part of their salaries.  Those voluntary reductions — for which I give them credit — amount to a reduction of 30% of income.  We all adjust our lifestyles to our income level.  I acknowledge the significant reduction in salary to which they have agreed voluntarily.  My question is whether the pension calculations for those current incumbents are based on the lower net figure as a result of the voluntary waiver.  I believe they are calculated on the higher figure which defeats the purpose.The Secretaries General should be treated as being in the same category as the Taoiseach, the Ministers and the Judiciary as regards pensions.  The Minister took action in this regard today because the issue of these pensions is what infuriates the public.  Pay is one issue and pensions are another.  I support the measures announced by the Minister today while others may say it is too little.  Every step is helpful and I will not be churlish.  The Minister is to be congratulated.  However, the same principle should apply in the case of Secretaries General.  They should not be earning a salary of €200,000 a year while their pension contributions are calculated on a figure of €280,000 a year.I hope the Minister will accept my amendments.  He may introduce his own amendments when the Bill goes before the Seanad before returning to the Dáil next week.  I am not satisfied with the manner in which the amendments are being treated but given that speaking time is limited, I will give other Deputies an opportunity to contribute.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I thank the Deputy for his considered and extensive amendment which seeks to expand the provisions of legislation introduced by his party in government, the first financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation of 2009, to encompass a range of individuals and services to which they cannot and currently should not apply.  The amendment would amend the structure so that instead of justifiable reductions in payment, for example, to health professionals imposed following a regular review, a ceiling on payments unrelated to the extensive medical care provided by health professionals would apply.The primary amendments tabled by the Deputy are amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, as amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are consequential to amendment No. 3.  Amendment No. 1 would include a definition of the word "contractor" in the original Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act.  While the Deputy did not refer to this issue, the purpose of the amendment is to extend the definition of the term "contractors for service", that is, people who provide services such as ICT, data and so forth on an ongoing basis to the State.  The Deputy seeks to impose an arbitrary cap on the sums paid to contractors in one accounting year of €200,000 and €250,000, respectively, by anybody concerned.  The cap does not take account of the amount of work done, which can be covered by commercial contracts of service, or the value of the work being provided.On the commercial semi-State bodies listed in the Schedule, let us take as an example CIE.  The Broadmeadow Estuary bridge was repaired at a cost of €4 million and reopening that important service for commuters was regarded as an imperative.  If we had informed the company in the CIE group charged with doing this work that all procurement activities would be subject to an arbitrary limit of €250,000 per contractor per accounting year, the work would never have been completed.  It would not have been practical to disaggregate the work to ensure no one received more than €250,000.Commercial procurement activities in most, if not all, bodies listed would at times exceed any arbitrary listed figure.  While the issue raised by the Deputy needs to be addressed, we must do so through a different approach, namely, procurement.  I do not have time to discuss this issue in detail this evening but may have time to address it tomorrow on Committee Stage.  I am interested in hearing the Deputy's views on breaking up contracts to make procurement more efficient.  Dealing with the matter by way of an amendment to financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation is not the correct approach.This legislation is extraordinarily special because it hangs together on the basis that it acknowledges the financial crisis in which the country finds itself.  As the previous Minister took great care to recognise, we cannot expand its scope in all directions.  He knew he was taking extraordinary measures by reducing the pay and pensions of individuals, as I am doing again tonight.  I am conscious of case law and clear legal opinions on what constitutes a pension.  Pensions are preserved property rights for which people have paid with a legitimate expectation of receiving them.  One must, therefore, have a very compelling reason to reduce them.  The argument is that there is an overwhelming necessity in the national interest to do so on the basis of this legislation.  If this argument fails, the constitutional safeguard for property will hold sway.  In truth, we must be very careful about how we try to expand the provisions of the Bill.  If some of the propositions in the first five amendments were accepted, I have no doubt they would collapse the entire edifice of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation we have put together, which is absolutely essential for the financial well-being of the State.I do not wish to take up the time of the House by referring to all the points in my speaking notes as I am conscious Deputies wish to contribute.  I wish to address specific issues but will not speak in detail.  In general terms, I will not accept the amendments.  The legislation was crafted to take those elements of pay that I had provided for in the pensions Bill which legislates for reductions to office holders and so forth and deal with the consequences of the overwhelming decision of the people in the referendum to seek to bring the Judiciary into the norms of pay reductions.  I have indicated that I intend to submit a further amendment in the other House to address the specific issue of a tiny group of people having extraordinary pensions.A number of current and former Fianna Fáil Party Deputies acknowledge the way in which these matters have developed in the past couple of decades.  Responding to Deputies opposite on a previous occasion, I indicated that I was not aware of what is known as the TELAC process which has apparently been doing the rounds here since 1987.  Under this process, Secretaries General could secure extraordinarily generous severance payments at the end of their seven year term.  We have ended this process but cannot do so retrospectively.Deputy Fleming is correct on the issue of contractual rights.  We have examined this matter carefully and I share the Deputy's view on the need to try to address these matters.  While we cannot dislodge people who were appointed on certain terms, we have asked them to accept certain changes voluntarily and all of them have done so.  The pensions of incumbents will be calculated on the pre-cut basis.  After February, however, the reduced salary will impact in the calculation of lump sums and pensions.I do not intend to broaden the provisions in the manner provided for in the amendments and I believe the Deputy, in his heart of hearts, knows that is the position.  We need to make progress on reforming all of these issues.  The first step is to introduce a ceiling to ensure this issue does not arise again and individuals will be dealt with differently in future.  For this reason, we have the basic, ground-breaking comprehensive legislation on pensions.  Subsequently, we need to dig away, if one likes, at and put right the most egregious unacceptable norms that have bedded down in the past couple of decades.

The net issues are that the Bill has been introduced as an emergency measure and the priority is the public interest.  The Bill does not meet either criterion.  While I understand Deputy Fleming's rationale for moving his amendments — he made a reasoned and well argued case — given that the pay level at which his proposed measure is pitched is too high, Sinn Féin will not be in a position to support them.  Notwithstanding that, I appreciate the gist of his argument.The purpose of my amendments is to address pay levels.  The Minister and Taoiseach earn too much.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	517	Technical reasons are always given to explain why people at the top cannot be brought into the net.  On the other hand, it is always possible to bring those at the bottom into the net.  I do not understand this and I do not accept that if there is a will, a way cannot be found.  The Government is arguing that it has the will to do this, but it is technically difficult to find a way.  It does not seem to be technically difficult to hit the people at the very bottom.  I disagree with the level at which the Fianna Fáil Party is pitching this.  There is a certain irony in its belated conversion to reducing the salaries of people at the top of the public service.  The basic principle underpinning what it is saying — that we should consider imposing caps on the earnings of anybody who is paid with public money, including people across the public service — is absolutely correct.  It is disappointing that the Minister is putting technical obstacles in the way of this proposal.  My response to all that has been said about retrospective legislation is that such legislation has been introduced in the UK.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	518	The UK does not have a constitution.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	519	We can change our Constitution.  The lesson to be extrapolated from the recent referendum on judicial pay is that people want the salaries of top earners who are paid with public money to be reduced.  The Minister knows that is the case.  It is why he proposed the referendum.  The people did not concern themselves with the detail.  They accepted the principle that the salaries of people at the top of the public service who are paid excessively should be reduced.  That is why they voted in favour of the proposal.  The people would have no problem voting in favour of a constitutional amendment that would open the way for similar reductions to be imposed on officials in semi-State companies and people who previously served in the public sector.  The Minister knows that people would back him if he had a serious intent to amend the Constitution in that regard.  The problem is that the will is not there.  I appeal to the Labour Party, in particular, to recognise the sense of injustice that is felt by people.  He should show some measure of willingness to extend——

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I do not disagree with much of what the Deputy has said, which is unusual.  It is not my normal position.  The principle I have brought to the job I have been given is that there needs to be a semblance of fairness.  I am not speaking in terms of saving an enormous amount of money.  The number of people at the top is small.  The quantum of money is not enormous.  When some people are seen to be given an extraordinary payment from the public purse when others are struggling to survive, it is more than aggravating.  I accept that it is damaging to the sense of solidarity.  The Deputy and I can debate the consequences of how far he would like to go in this regard.  Salaries of €500,000, €600,000 or €800,000 were the norm in some sectors until quite recently.  All of that has changed.  Since we came into office, nobody in the Civil Service has been paid more than €200,000.  That is a big change in a number of months.I agree entirely with Deputy Seán Fleming's suggestion that we should establish a hierarchy of commercial semi-States.  If one sets one's ceiling at €200,000, either one's base will be very low or one will have a very squashed scale.  The pay levels of the chief executives were evaluated independently as part of the Hay process.  I took what Hay determined in 2007 to be the appropriate level of pay for each of them.  I applied all the FEMPI impacts on them and I took another 10% off them on top of that.  That is how I determined the pay levels in semi-States.  As I recall it, just one official — the chief executive officer of the ESB — was receiving over €250,000.  To put it bluntly, people were screaming at me that such a level of pay would not attract somebody of the calibre required to run an organisation as complicated as the ESB.  If we accepted the argument of Deputies on the other side of the House that there should be a blanket ceiling of €100,000, we would kill social medicine.  We would have private medicine only.  With the exception of a few altruistic people from Deputy Higgins's school, all of our heart specialists, cancer specialists and child specialists would go into the private sector.  The vast majority of them would not work for €100,000.  They would choose to treat those who could afford to pay.

The Deputies know that in their hearts.  I have mentioned previously that Deputy Higgins and I soldiered together on these battles many moons ago.  I know where his ideology is anchored.  It is not anchored in the reality of today.  That is my personal judgment on it.  I know he is sincere in what he believes.  In my judgment, social provision would be destroyed if the approach he is advocating were adopted right now.  There is an understanding that senior administrators, such as high ranking gardaí, including chief superintendents, or the heads of public bodies, need remuneration that is sufficient to attract people into the public service.  However, it should not be egregiously large, as it was in recent times.  We need to value public service and public servants.  Wage levels should be analogous to what might be paid in the private sector.  I believe passionately that we should not destroy public service as an option for talented and able people.  We should not use the real hurt of people who are struggling to survive as a battering ram to denigrate the notion of public service.  We should not think we can slash and burn, or squeeze further, without that having consequences.  These matters——

That process, involving a full evaluation of the optimum approach to be taken to the sale of a minority stake, is being progressed by a group co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Group will report back to Government in the coming weeks.A separate Group, representing my Department and other relevant Departments and NewEra, and chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is evaluating the approaches to developing a programme of disposal of non-strategic State Assets.  The Group will also report back to Government in the coming weeks.The Government is continuing its discussions with the Troika of EU, IMF and ECB on the scope for utilising proceeds from any future disposal of assets to invest in economic renewal.  The Government will consider its approach to the divestment of State assets on receipt of the report of the inter Departmental Group.

I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.The CER, in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.This policy ensures that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Otherwise, uneconomic projects will increase costs for all energy consumers.Having regard to the CER policy on new towns connections, Bord Gáis Networks, and more recently Gaslink, have carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  In April 2010, Gaslink published its New Towns Analysis Phase 3 report.  The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting 11 towns in the West and North West region which are the focus of the Western Development Commission paper, "Why Invest in Gas".  However, the Gaslink report found that none of the towns qualified for connection on economic grounds.Nevertheless, Gaslink continues to review towns which did not qualify for connection under the Study and other towns on an ongoing basis.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, probably resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	547	I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 69 together.ESB has been operating a micro-generation feed-in-tariff scheme for the domestic sector for the past number of years, which has 387 customers signed up to date.  The available tariff is 19c kWh, made up of a 10 cent kWh, tariff offered by ESB Networks and a 9 cent kWh, tariff offered by ESB Electric Ireland (formerly Customer Supply).  Despite being invited to do so by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), no other supply companies have chosen to introduce a tariff to date, although in the fully liberalised market that now exists, it is open to them to do so.When the scheme was initially announced, ESB Networks announced that an import/export meter would also be provided to the first 4000 micro-generation installations countrywide over 3 years.The Programme for Government commits to the introduction of a microgeneration feed-in-tariff at a tariff rate that will not be significantly above single energy market (SEM) price for electricity.  The experience from the ESB tariff (at a combined tariff of 19c per Kilowatt hour) as well as from studies undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) are that a combined tariff not significantly above the SEM price (currently around 7.2 cent per Kilowatt hour) would be unlikely to stimulate take-up of microgeneration.I will shortly be considering advice from SEAI and my Department on fully costed options for encouraging microgeneration with a view to determining appropriate directions not least in the present budgetary circumstances.  I am acutely aware of the cost of electricity to both domestic and commercial customers and as any extension of the feed-in tariff support scheme would have a knock on effect on the retail price of electricity; this needs very careful consideration before it could take place.SEAI has been running a microgeneration awareness programme since 2009.  Ongoing monitored field trials are a significant component of the programme and provide robust data on the performance of installations and the actual levels of output the various technologies achieve in actual conditions, which will allow for better evidence based policy and regulation relating to small- and micro-scale generation.The traditional electricity meter is not capable of operating in reverse and as a result is incapable of giving credit for electricity exported to the grid.  A smart meter can measure the consumption of energy, and can transmit data using a form of electronic communication.  A key feature of a smart meter is the ability to provide bidirectional communication between the consumer and the supplier/operator.  Smart meters also facilitate greater energy efficiency by providing consumers with more detailed, accurate and timely information regarding their energy consumption and costs, thus helping consumers reduce any unnecessary energy usage and shift any discretionary electricity usage away from peak consumption times.The CER, is overseeing the national programme to develop smart meters working with my Department, ESB Networks and Bord Gáis Éireann.  Pilot trials are under way and a comprehensive cost benefit analysis has been completed, which quantifies the benefits for consumers and the energy system.Micro-scale electricity generators seeking to export excess generation to the grid would require smart meters. In the meantime, with regard to smart meters, I understand that the CER is shortly due to issue a public consultation seeking views on smart metering and a potential full national rollout.  There will be an opportunity for all those interested, including microgenerators, to make the case as part of that consultation as to their views on any future rollout programme.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	548	I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 62 together.Offshore wind is a rapidly maturing technology worldwide however it is still not commercially viable at the open wholesale market price of electricity and is dependant on high public subsidies to underpin a developers financial business case.The electricity sector, including the renewable energy sector, operates in an open liberalised market. European policy is to move towards a wider single electricity market by mid decade.  I have no intention to instruct ESB or any other State company operating in the electricity sector here to get involved in any particular technology.While the Hywind floating turbine technology referred to is very promising it is still not commercially operational and is only one of many promising developments in turbine technology for deeper water deployment.Recent years have seen a growing number of offshore wind turbines installed, particularly in European waters.  Every Member State of the European Union has a specific renewable energy target and these developments are being supported by Governments in order to achieve their own domestic targets.Countries that have seen installation of offshore wind in recent years have incentive schemes in place, which essentially subsidise offshore wind through a variety of support mechanisms such as tradeable renewable energy certificates or feed-in-tariff mechanisms.  These subsidise offshore wind for a fixed period of between 15 and 20 years in order to provide sufficient certainty to private developers to obtain the necessary finance for their projects. Offshore wind has a capital cost in the region of €3 million per megawatt to install.  By comparison, onshore wind would typically cost less than half of that.Ireland operates a feed-in-tariff support scheme for onshore wind generation, which is funded through the PSO levy on all electricity consumers, domestic and commercial.  Currently, the onshore wind feed-in-tariff is fairly close to the market price, so any subsidy required is relatively modest. International evidence, including from the UK, would suggest that offshore wind requires at least double the current market price (€72 MWh) for electricity, hence a feed-in tariff for offshore wind would require electricity consumers to fund a much larger subsidy.  In this context, the Government, while recognising that there may be industrial opportunities available, will need to decide from a policy perspective whether to pursue offshore wind for the domestic market. I am acutely aware of the impact of electricity prices on homes and businesses and I need to balance the wish to develop expensive new technologies with the cost effect on electricity consumers.There are however export market possibilities provided for in the Renewable Energy Directive whereby renewable generation produced on the territory of one country may be used (when a bilateral agreement is in place) to count towards the target of another country.  This ability to trade the renewable value of electricity between countries is enormously beneficial, as essentially the additional premium that may be required for offshore wind or other renewable generators is a reward for the renewable nature of the electricity.One of the key issues in this regard is whether electricity destined for export feeds into the national electricity grid or not.  If it does grid reinforcements and interconnectors and additional grid management tools to cope with increased intermittency would be required, which adds to costs in Ireland.  However, there are also possibilities particularly around offshore renewable developments for connecting directly from the offshore to another market without feeding into Ireland's grid.In the context of the British Irish Council, I have been speaking with my UK counterpart on renewable trade and we issued a Joint Communiqué in June on the islands working together in this field to explore the possibilities around maximising trade in renewable energy.  In such a scenario, any additional premium required by offshore wind would be paid for by British consumers, if it is their market which is gaining the renewable value.At present, there is no renewable cross border trade anywhere in the EU and we are actively working with the UK Government to be one of the first regions in Europe to introduce such a market.  The Irish market is a small electricity market by European standards and the key to being able to make use of the major renewable energy resource we have here is to be able to gain access to larger European renewable energy markets, starting with access to the UK market.Together with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Commission for Energy Regulation and EirGrid, my Department is involved in a study that has been commissioned on this topic which is exploring the viability, costs and benefits to Ireland of using the cooperation mechanisms in the Renewable Energy Directive to export renewable electricity.  My Department is also finalising an offshore renewable energy development plan, on which a strategic environmental assessment has been undertaken on low, medium and high development scenarios. This can help to inform coherent development of the sector going forward.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	550	As the Deputy will be aware, in June 2011, the Government agreed the introduction of general pay ceilings for future appointments to senior posts across the public service and for CEO posts in Commercial State Companies.  A general pay ceiling of €250,000 was agreed for future CEO appointments to Commercial State Companies.In capping the pay of new appointees, the Government's view was that applying a basic €250,000 cap would only affect pay rates above that figure.  Consequently, the Government also decided to reduce the salary ranges that apply to CEOs, the effect of which is to moderate salaries in a proportionate manner while maintaining the "weightings" between each Company.This approach has the effect of reducing the CEO starting salary for future appointments of all but one of the commercial bodies under the aegis of my Department to within the €250,000 salary ceiling.  In this context, the starting pay for a new appointment to the post of CEO of ESB was set at €318,083.The Government further recognised that there may be a small number of exceptions where the role is of substantial importance in the public service or a Commercial State Company and the person whose appointment is sought brings exceptional or scarce expertise and/or qualifications to the proposed role.  Any such exceptions will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Future recruitment will be managed within these parameters.I have not made any recommendations or sought permission to exceed the salary levels agreed by Government in respect of any commercial bodies under the aegis of my Department.

The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce which I convened earlier this year, has an important role to play in this regard.The Taskforce, which I chair, also comprises Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, and the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services. The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss and report on policy issues and proposals in relation to provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.The Taskforce, and four Working Groups reporting to it, are considering issues such as appropriate targets, spectrum policy, private sector investment plans, and the removal of barriers (for example local authority way leave processes) in order to facilitate investment.  I expect that the Taskforce will help to identify how best to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband generally and thereby assist in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government.The Taskforce, which had a further meeting yesterday, will conclude its deliberations shortly.  It is my intention to consider the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report of the Taskforce and to make a submission to Government in this regard.  It is my objective to move quickly thereafter to put in place the optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband.

It has however, directed that the proposal be critically reviewed and reported and reported on before mid 2012.In this context I intend to set up a Group to examine the feasibility or otherwise of this proposed merger.  The Group will be mandated to address both the policy and operational issues pertaining to a merged Body.  The Group will be established prior to the end of 2011 and its report will be presented to me in good time to enable the review to be completed within the timeframe set by Government.Matters for consideration in respect of this review will encompass a number of areas, chief among them being efficiency savings and related structural, funding, legislative and staffing issues.  It is particularly important that any new merged body would continue to encompass effective regulation of both the communications and broadcasting sectors. There are potential policy synergies in a new merged body.  The telecommunications and broadcasting sectors are experiencing increasing convergence, as content is delivered over the internet platform.  There is a need to maximise the opportunities this presents in the context of an increasingly digital society.  Any merger must also lead to organisational efficiencies and produce cost savings.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	553	I am responding to the Deputy's Question in so far as my own Department is concerned.The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is established as an independent statutory body under the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The Act also outlines the codes governing standards and practice to be observed by broadcasters.  The Compliance Committee of the BAI is charged under the Act with ensuring that all broadcasters, whether public or private, comply with their licence conditions and with the standards set out in the broadcasting codes and rules.With reference to the specific case cited by the Deputy, It was decided by Cabinet that there should be an independent inquiry to determine the facts and circumstances which led to the particular programme being broadcast by RTÉ.As the Deputy is aware, I have requested that the BAI Compliance Committee use its powers under the Broadcasting Act 2009 and to determine whether RTE has met its statutory responsibilities around objectivity, impartiality and fairness. I have asked that the Committee then report and make any recommendations in respect of this to the Authority.  The decision of Government requests that the Report be concluded within two months.It is my view that the approach being taken in the circumstances is the most appropriate and, in that regard, I can confirm that no consideration is being given to amending the Broadcasting Act 2009 as a result of the matter referred to by the Deputy.In relation to other settlement issues raised by the Deputy I can advise that my Department had an out of court settlement in 2007, for a sum of €35,000, with a company who carried out a software upgrade for the Department. The upgrade, in the Department's view, was unsatisfactory.  The Department refused to pay for the upgrade and the Company took legal action against the Department.Settlements made by the bodies under the aegis of my department are day to day matters for those bodies.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	554	I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.Ireland is critically dependent on imported fossil fuels, particularly oil and natural gas to meet its energy needs.  The Government is fully committed to enhancing energy security and to delivering national energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives, which are aimed at moving the economy away from reliance on imported, carbon intensive fossil fuels.Ireland's only oil refinery, which currently supplies approximately one-third of Ireland's oil product requirements, is at Whitegate in Cork and is operated by ConocoPhillips.In 2001, Whitegate Refinery and Bantry Terminal were bought from the State by Tosco Corporation.  Following various mergers and acquisitions, ConocoPhillips took over Tosco and are the current owners of the refinery at Whitegate and the oil storage terminal at Bantry.  The day to day operation of the refinery and terminal is a matter for ConocoPhillips.Under the terms of the sale, Whitegate Refinery and Bantry Terminal must continue to be operated until 2016.  This obligation applies also to ConocoPhillips and any subsequent owners.In view of the need to consider the role of the refinery post 2016 and to inform policy decisions on refining, my Department commissioned a review of the strategic case for oil refining requirements on the Island of Ireland in August 2011.This review which is currently ongoing will include a forecast of oil demand scenarios for the period to 2050 and an assessment of the strategic merits of appropriate refining capacity on the island of Ireland.I expect the final report, including conclusions and recommendations, to be received by my Department early next year.With regard to strategic storage, Ireland is required under EU and IEA obligations to hold 90 days of oil reserves.  The bulk of Ireland's oil stocks are held by the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), with the balance held by industry.Of the stocks held by NORA, 53% are held as physical stocks in Ireland, 42% as physical stocks abroad and 8% as stock tickets, which are contracts to purchase oil.  It is Government policy to increase the volume of strategic stocks held on the island of Ireland, subject to value for money considerations.NORA is working to develop new storage facilities, including two which were commissioned earlier this year in Ringsend and Kilroot, which have considerably enhanced oil security on the island of Ireland.

The petroleum authorisations granted in both jurisdictions are at a very early stage and the engagement between the respective authorities will continue should these authorisations proceed to the drilling stage.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	556	The electronic communications market is, and has been since its liberalisation, a commercial competitive market.  Thus, the provision of services, including broadband, is a matter for those private sector service providers, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  The Government only intervenes in cases of market failure.  Between the significant private and public sector investments over recent years all areas of the country now have access to at least a basic broadband service.The Government accepts that the widespread availability of next generation broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband customer access to every home and business in the State.In June of this year I established the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, which I chair and which also comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies currently operating in the Irish market and the CEOs of some Internet Service Provider companies.  The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss the optimal policy environment required to facilitate the investment in and provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.  The Taskforce is scheduled to complete its work in December next and I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals to Government in early 2012 aimed at ensuring the timely investment in next generation broadband networks.I understand the Deputy's reference to higher rural tariffs relates to instances where an individual accesses the Internet via a satellite connection. Satellite Internet connectivity is a feature in some rural areas and reflects the difficulty of connecting some rural premises by other means.Because of the technology involved satellite internet connectivity has tended to be more expensive than connectivity via cable or DSL.  Satellite bandwidth is also considerably more expensive than other technology platforms.However, with technological advances I am pleased to note that tariffs for satellite connectivity are falling, and are becoming increasingly competitive with other technologies.

The EPA is currently funding preliminary background research in the form of a study being carried out by Aberdeen University and a report in respect of this study is expected early in 2012The EPA proposes to commission a further and more extensive study in 2012 and are liaising with my Department in relation to the scope of same.  The final scope, which will be informed in part by the findings of the Aberdeen University study, will be determined by the EPA, which is an independent statutory body.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	559	The Government's energy policy, including the regulatory framework, seeks to deliver a secure, sustainable and competitive energy supply.  In achieving this objective, the regulatory framework must meet evolving energy policy challenges and also ensure compliance with the requirements of both EU and national legislation.The regulation of the electricity and gas market is the responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 provided for the establishment of the CER as an independent statutory regulator.  Since its establishment, there have been a number of changes to the regulatory framework, and the CER's functions, in line with the continually evolving energy policy landscape and partly as a result of EU obligations.Initially, the Commission was responsible for the regulation and reform of the electricity market only. In 2002, under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act, the Commission was additionally given statutory responsibility for the regulation of the natural gas market.  Since then its remit has been further extended to include additional responsibilities, for example for security of supply, upstream petroleum and downstream gas safety and customer protection matters.With a view to meeting policy objectives, the CER has played a pivotal role in the development of the Single Electricity Market (SEM), which has been operating in Ireland and Northern Ireland since November 2007.  It represents one of the first markets of its kind in the world, a fact that was been recognised by the EU Energy Commissioner at the time of the launch of the SEM .Building on the success of the SEM, the two regulators are currently working together to develop Common Arrangements for Gas (CAG) on the island, whereby all players in the gas market can buy, sell, transport and contribute to the development and planning of the natural gas market North and South on an all-island basis.In the immediate future, the regulatory regime for the Irish electricity and gas market, including consumer protection issues, is being enhanced by the obligations on Ireland of the EU's Third Energy Package aimed at developing an integrated EU energy market and improving competition to the benefit of consumers.The International Energy Agency (IEA) currently is conducting its periodic in-depth review of Irish energy policy.  The Agency reviews the energy policy of every member country every four to five years.  On this occasion, the IEA review, as part of its overall review of Ireland's energy policy, is providing its assessment of the efficiency of the Irish electricity and gas sectors, under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, to have such an independent assessment undertaken.Based on the results of that forthcoming assessment, I will consider what actions may require to be taken in order to strengthen the regulatory and market reform programme in consultation with European Commission Services, in line with the requirement in the updated EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.It is also my intention that a new energy policy framework will be published next year.  The new framework will take account of developments in economic and energy policy since 2007.  The new energy policy framework will also be informed by the outcome of the IEA review.

The latest text of the Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the Troika of the European Union (EU), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB) commits the State to an ambitious programme of state asset disposal.The Programme for Government includes an intention to finance investment from the proceeds of the sale of certain State assets.The issue of realising value from State assets including Bord Gáis Éireann is currently being explored by a high level Inter-Departmental Group chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Group will report shortly and its Report will inform the Government's consideration of the matter generally and in relation to specific State assets.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	561	My Department's goal is to maximise the benefits to Ireland from exploration for and production of our indigenous oil and gas resources, while ensuring that activities are conducted safely and with due regard to their impact on the environment and other land/sea users.Exploration for oil and gas in Ireland, in common with most other jurisdictions, is carried out under licence from the State.  Petroleum exploration authorisations are issued under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 and the oversight operational framework is set out in the Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration, Development & Production 2007,I am aware that there has been a good deal of public interest recently on the topic of onshore gas exploration with considerable focus on the possibility of the technology of hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") being used following the granting of authorisations by my Department in February.The authorisations which are called ‘licensing options' were granted for a term of two years each and provide for the carrying out of work programmes agreed with my Department.  These work programmes are primarily based on desktop studies of existing data and should be completed by February 2013.  They do not permit exploration drilling.  When they have completed their work programmes each company will then have to decide if it wishes to move to the next stage and apply for an exploration licence.Any application for an exploration licence that would involve exploration drilling, including drilling that proposed using hydraulic fracturing, would be subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) that would include a Public Consultation Phase.  My Department would also seek and be guided by the expert advice of other relevant statutory authorities such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Local Authorities.  The outcome of the EIA would determine whether or not an Exploration Licence would be granted.In the event that at some point in the future a commercial discovery of natural gas is made and an onshore gas extraction project is proposed then there is a comprehensive regulatory framework in place that would apply to any such proposal.  The development of such a project would require a number of statutory consents including a planning consent from An Bord Pleanála under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure Act) 2006, an Integrated Pollution Prevention Control Licence from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), along with a Petroleum Lease, a Plan of Development consent and a Gas Pipeline consent from myself as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  A core element of these consent processes would be to consider the potential environmental impact of any proposed development.It is too early to conclude at this point whether or not these licensing options will proceed to the exploration licence stage and much too early to anticipate a commercial discovery that could potentially lead to a natural gas production project.Notwithstanding the foregoing I have asked the EPA to examine the area and advise me and my colleagues in Government on the environmental implications of onshore drilling for gas.  The EPA has commenced research into the environmental considerations and impacts of shale gas exploration and extraction, in particular with regard to the use of hydraulic fracturing and investigation into the regulatory approaches of other countries, with a view to helping to establish best environmental practice.  The EPA proposes to commission a further and more extensive study in 2012 and is liaising with my Department in relation to the scope of same.

They asked President Van Rompuy, in close co-operation with the President of the Commission and the President of the Eurogroup, to identify possible steps to this end, including exploring the possibility of limited Treaty change.  A process of bilateral consultation at official level is under way.  President Van Rompuy will present an interim report on his work to the European Council on 9 December.  Senior Irish officials are actively participating in this process.  The Government looks forward to receiving the report and giving it careful consideration.  In all its contacts with its European colleagues, the Government has set out its position on Treaty change, as has been elaborated in the House on many occasions.  Given the potential length and uncertainty of the process of change which is provided for in the Treaties, we do not believe it can address the immediate crisis we face.  There is a great deal that can be done within the framework of the existing Treaties and that should be our immediate focus.  Obviously, other Member States take a different view.  The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, set out her strong view that Treaty change is required when she met with the Taoiseach in Berlin on 16 November.  The Taoiseach, the Minister of State for European Affairs and I will continue to engage proactively with our EU partners on this and every other issue where Ireland's interests are at stake.  It is not possible to say whether a referendum will be required should any changes to the Treaties emerge from the process that is under way.  As has been the case in the past, at the appropriate time the Government will seek the advice of the Attorney General on whether the proposed change is compatible with the Constitution, and will act accordingly.

The approval process was delayed by the necessity under the Passports Act 2008 to establish the applicant's entitlement to Irish citizenship but also, I understand, by an administrative error, which I very much regret.  I have asked the Embassy to write to the citizen concerned to explain the delay and to apologise for the inconvenience caused.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	570	The devastating earthquake which struck Haiti on 12 January 2010 killed more than 230,000 people and injured 300,000 others.  The earthquake destroyed much of Port-au-Prince and the surrounding areas, left approximately 1.5 million people homeless and caused losses and damage estimated at approximately €5.9 billion.  Nearly two years after the earthquake, the humanitarian situation in Haiti remains extremely fragile.  An estimated 550,000 people are still displaced within Haiti, living in nearly 900 tented camps in Port-au-Prince and other earthquake-affected areas.  While the number of people living in the displacement camps continues to decrease and steady progress has been made in clearing the 10 million cubic metres of debris generated by the quake, there is still a high level of humanitarian need across much of the country.  Ireland pledged funding of €13 million for the period 2010-12 at the Haiti Donor Conference that was held in New York in March 2010.  To date, €11.5 million of this has been committed and it is intended that the entire pledge will be met by early 2012.To date, Irish Aid has prioritised the needs of the most vulnerable populations, including women and children, as well as the basic humanitarian needs of the population more generally.  This follows the recommendations of an assessment mission following the earthquake, which advocated an Irish focus on protection, as well as clean water and sanitation, early recovery and shelter.  Support has been provided to UNICEF, Concern, Goal, Plan, World Vision and Haven in 2010 and 2011 for the provision of clean water, shelter and sanitation to the affected population.  Some €1 million was also provided to the Haiti Reconstruction Trust Fund for projects managed by the World Bank in line with priorities agreed with the Haitian authorities.  Since the earthquake, there have also been 17 deployments of the Irish Aid-administered Rapid Response Corps to Haiti to assist in areas such as logistics, engineering and water and sanitation. Volunteers have deployed to work with organisations such as the UN World Food Programme, Concern Worldwide, Goal and the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  A detailed breakdown of Irish Aid support is shown below.  Future funding to activities in Haiti will be based on the assessments of our key partners of ongoing needs.Irish Aid Support to Haiti 2010-2011IFRCEmergency Appeal (MDRHT008)250,000UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian AffairsHaiti Flash Appeal300,000UN World Food ProgrammeHaiti Flash Appeal-food assistance for earthquake affected populations300,000ConcernHaiti Earthquake Response537,000World Vision IrelandProvision of child friendly space-child protection200,000Haven Community FoundationEmergency latrine and sanitation provision in IDP camps100,000Christian AidSupport to earthquake affected communities127,500Plan IrelandRelief for earthquake affected communities249,994UNFAOImmediate support to urban & peri-urban agriculture for earthquake affected populations200,000UN Environmental ProgrammeTechnical Assistance Facility for Energy and Environment100,000UN-HabitatTechnical Support to Government and Municipal Recovery Coordination200,000GoalCash for work programme250,000ConcernERFS170,000GoalERFS250,000Nos Petits Frères et SoeursMicro project emergency grant3,516RRI stock disbursal No. 1 17/1/2010Value of stocks, estimated transport & handling  USD 947,927663,548RRI stock disbursal No. 2 27/1/2010Value of stocks, estimated transport & handling  USD 823,234584,496RR corps placements423,871UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian AffairsEmergency Relief Response Fund100,000Department of FinanceDebt Relief1,000,000World BankHaiti reconstruction trust fund1,000,000Plan IrelandCholera response250,000GoalERFS-Cholera response202,931RRI stock disbursal no 3 13/11/2010Value of stocks, estimated transport & handling  USD 231,543169,026Department of Agriculture, Fisheries & FoodFAO Trust Fund305,000Civil Society Section 2010MAPS & Misean Cara funding954,051Haven Community FoundationWASH Project200,000UNICEFProtection sector activities500,000GoalEmergency water and sanitation550,000Plan IrelandWASH Project450,000Civil Society Section 2011MAPS funding950,000

I assure the Deputy that this remains the case.  Certain discussions on the legal advice which has been obtained in this area have taken place between my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality, which is responsible for matters of citizenship and immigration.  However, it has been considered necessary to broaden these consultations to include officials from the Offices of the Attorney General and Chief State Solicitor.  A meeting of these parties has been arranged for Wednesday, 30 November.  As I have previously committed to in my earlier replies, I will revert directly to the Deputy with the outcome of those discussions in the context of the person's application for a passport as soon as a final position has been agreed.

There has been a substantial reduction in staff numbers in my Department, arising mainly from retirements, with some posts left unfilled because of restrictions on recruitment necessitated by the current budgetary pressures.YearNumber serving (based on full-time equivalents)20081,581.620091,523.5520101,492.652011 (numbers serving at 31 October 2011)1,456.8
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	574	The Conflict Resolution Unit was established in the Department in 2007 to enhance Ireland's engagement in conflict resolution internationally.  The work of the Unit builds on Ireland's tradition of UN peacekeeping, our commitment to overseas development aid, our experience of the peace process in Northern Ireland and our commitment to human rights and the international rule of law.  The unit is staffed by four officials: one Principal Officer; one Third Secretary; one Clerical Officer and one intern.  The unit disbursed €2,112,000 from the Department's Stability Fund in 2011.  One the unit's main areas of focus has been the development of a National Action Plan for the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325), in co-operation with other Government agencies and civil society representatives.  UNSCR 1325 emphasises the distinct position of women in conflict situations, calls for an increase in the participation of women in peacemaking and peace-building processes, the protection of women and girls in armed conflict, and the incorporation of a gender perspective into peacekeeping and peace-building processes.  I was delighted to mark the culmination of these efforts by officially launching Ireland's National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 on 25 November 2011.The Conflict Resolution Unit is also engaged in sharing the lessons of conflict resolution in Northern Ireland with other regions experiencing, or emerging from, conflict.  The unit also recognises that lesson-sharing is a two-way process, and there is much that Ireland can learn from others tackling the same issues.  In co-operation with non-governmental partners, the unit has welcomed a number of delegations to Ireland in the past three years, facilitating visits for peace-builders from Afghanistan, Haiti, Israel, Nepal and elsewhere.  The unit firmly supports and encourages international mediation initiatives and funds several mediation bodies and projects. Despite its proven cost-effectiveness, the practice of mediation has received insufficient attention or support internationally to date.  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the United Nations Mediation Support Unit within the UN Department of Political Affairs since its establishment in 2006.  The unit has also established relationships with a number of international non-governmental partners engaged in mediation.  I was pleased to attend a meeting of the UN Friends of Mediation group in the margins of the UN General Assembly in September of this year and look forward to contributing to its work.The Conflict Resolution Unit will seek to build on this range of expertise as Ireland assumes the chairmanship-in-office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in January 2012, for one calendar year.  Comprising 56 participating states from Europe, Central Asia and North America, the OSCE is the world's largest intergovernmental regional security organisation, dealing with a range of issues in the areas of democratisation, human rights, arms control and economic and environmental security.  Ireland's experience of the Northern Ireland Peace Process will be especially relevant when dealing with the OSCE's so-called "protracted conflicts".  Staff from the Conflict Resolution Unit and the OSCE Taskforce will work together during 2012, in order to ensure our work on conflict resolution in the OSCE benefits from the experience we have gained nationally.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I understand the draft legislation referred to by the Deputy has passed its first stage in the Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly.  While this draft legislation purports to protect young people, it could, in my view, result in further stigmatisation, and even criminalisation, of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) young people.  A senior official in my Department has been in contact with the Russian Embassy to express concern at this draft legislation.  In addition, the European Union plans to raise this matter with the Russian authorities at an EU-Russia human rights dialogue scheduled to be held in Moscow this week.  Ireland has been supportive in having this on the agenda of that meeting.I would hope that the draft legislation at present before the Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly will be either dropped or amended radically in such a manner that it fully protects the human rights of all lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the Saint Petersburg region.Ireland is strongly committed to combating discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.  Ireland believes that consensual, same-sex relationships should not be criminalised.  We support measures to ensure that the right to freedom of expression and association can be enjoyed effectively by all people.  Discriminatory legal or administrative provisions, which curtail the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are not acceptable.Ireland supports the promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity.  On Friday, 17 June 2011, a historic resolution on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity was adopted at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.  I was delighted to see the adoption of this resolution, which was the first time that a UN resolution explicitly acknowledged human rights protection as covering sexual orientation.  This demonstrates the increasing commitment across the international community to the promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity.  Ireland co-sponsored the resolution.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	576	Like many in the international community, Ireland has viewed with serious concern the widespread violence and deaths which has followed the resumption of pro-democracy demonstrations in Egypt in recent days.  These events have highlighted the degree to which real reform and change has taken place in the country, following last February's historic downfall of the Mubarak regime.  The situation will be discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at their meeting in Brussels on 1 December.  Elections to Egypt's new parliament, an important milestone in Egypt's democratic transition, began as scheduled on 28 November and it is encouraging that these appear to have passed relatively peacefully and fairly.  Ireland and the EU wholeheartedly support the Egyptian elections and emphasise the need for the process to comply with international standards.  I further call upon the Egyptian government to allow international election monitors at future elections as Egypt continues its transition towards democracy.While these elections are a vital step in the transition, it is clear that many in Egypt remain frustrated that the overthrow of former President Mubarak has not yet resulted in the installation of a fully civilian and democratically-elected government while widespread concern also exists over continuing violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Some partial steps to address these concerns have been taken by the ruling SCAF (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces), including bringing forward the date of the Presidential election to next June and the appointment of ex-prime minister Kamal Ganzouri on 24 November to form a new government.  However, it is doubtful that these steps will be sufficient to meet the Egyptian protestors' legitimate demands.  The SCAF and its head, Field Marshal Tantawi, must now seek a way forward based on a genuine and inclusive national dialogue that ensures the principles of democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms.  In particular, it must end anti-democratic provisions such as the thirty-year state of emergency and give a clear timetable for a transition to civilian rule.There must also be a credible, independent investigation into the recent widespread violence which it is estimated has claimed over forty lives so far, with a view to determining precise causes and responsibility for the deaths and escalation of violence.  I fully support the recent statements by EU High Representative Ashton, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon and Arab League Secretary General al-Araby expressing grave concern and condemnation of the violence and calling for calm, restraint and progress in the transition to democratic rule.  I also support the recent statement of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which expresses alarm at the degree of violence and deterioration of the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association which have led to loss of life in Egypt.

I announced the commencement of the incentive, via press release, with effect from 25 November 2011.  In view of the extended time frame that has been involved in achieving the approval of the European Commission, I have decided to allow for the EII and the existing Business Expansion Scheme (BES) to run concurrently until 31 December 2011, in order to maximise opportunities for small and medium-sized companies to raise investments in the current tax year.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	580	As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and extensions to existing ones.  The Deputy will also appreciate that I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.  I have no plan to introduce further tax reliefs on the lines you suggest.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	581	I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 130 together.A multinational company that is resident in Ireland is subject to tax on all profits of the company wherever arising.  To the extent that those profits arise from trading activities, they are taxed at 12.5%.  The profits of a company for tax purposes are the profits computed in accordance with standard accounting practice as adjusted by statute.Where in the course of its trade a company purchases goods, services or licensing rights from another company the cost of such goods, services or rights is deductible in computing profits for tax purposes.  Where these purchases are made with a group of companies they are subject to the normal arm's length pricing rules.  The amounts deductible are in respect of real purchases.  It is, of course, possible that goods and services that are not currently sourced in Ireland were previously sourced here.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the largest multinationals are dealt with in Revenue's Large Cases Division.  That Division closely monitors all companies within its remit.  Companies are obliged to file their returns in accordance with the self-assessment provisions and the Large Cases Division runs a compliance programme to follow up companies who fail to meet their filing obligations.  Tax returns, tax computations and accounts are assessed in accordance with the Division's risk assessment programme.  Interventions in the form of enquiry or audit are made where significant areas of risk of non-compliance are identified during this process.  The risk analysis takes into account the scale of a company's operations as well as the complexity involved.  Tax reduction expenditure falls within this risk assessment process.  Large Cases Division aims to ensure that all significant potential non-compliance is challenged and to keep advancing its effectiveness in this area.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	582	I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 99 together.Following a decision by the Government, I, along with my colleagues Mr Brendan Howlin, TD, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and Mr Fergus O'Dowd, TD, Minister of State for NewERA, announced on Thursday, 29 September, the establishment of NewERA and the Strategic Investment Fund under the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).The Strategic Investment Fund, which will be the forerunner of the Strategic Investment Bank, will, following appropriate legislative changes to the investment policy of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), channel commercial investment from the NPRF towards productive investment in the Irish economy. As well as money from the NPRF, the Fund will seek matching commercial investment from private investors and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy.  It will comprise a series of sub-funds targeted at commercial investment in critical areas of the Irish economy, including infrastructure, venture capital and provision of long-term capital for SMEs. The NPRF will take a lead role in the development and implementation of each sub-fund.In November 2011, the NPRF announced a significant commitment of €250 million to a new Irish infrastructure fund (the "Irish Infrastructure Trust").  This fund will seek to invest in assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises and also in new infrastructure projects in Ireland. The new fund, which will be an important source of new capital for infrastructure investment in Ireland, has been established by Irish Life Investment Managers while AMP Capital, a leading global infrastructure manager, will be the fund's discretionary investment manager.  The fund is seeking commitments of up to €1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and has already received commitments of €300 million, including the NPRF's €250 million.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	583	The European Commission published last month its proposal for a Financial Transactions Tax, or FTT, and its assessment of the impact of the measure.We are analysing the proposals contained in the draft Directive.  The measure will now be subject to detailed discussions at EU level and, as always, we will participate constructively in those discussions.  There is no consensus as yet among European Member States on this issue, either about whether an FTT should be introduced, or what precise form it should take.It is important that any proposal does not have the effect of encouraging relocation of activity or damaging the EU's competitiveness in financial services.  It is for this reason that there is an emerging view that the EU and other international groupings, such as the IMF and G20, should move in tandem in a global manner to avoid the danger of financial sector business gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions. Indeed the Commission has indicted that they see their proposal as part of a wider development in this area.In my view any tax would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres.  I also think it important that the proposed Directive would apply on an EU wide basis to prevent any distortion of activity within the European Union.The Commission is proposing that the FTT should be an "own resource" tax imposed centrally to fund the EU and will be developing proposals in the context of the future of the EU Budget.  However, we will need to assess the impact of this on our contribution vis-à-vis any system based on Gross National Income, as is the current system.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	584	The stamp duty levy of 0.6% applies to the market value, on the valuation date, of assets under management in pension funds and pension plans approved under Irish tax legislation.  The pension arrangements affected include funded retirement benefit schemes (i.e. occupational pension schemes), retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts (PRSAs — other than what are known as "vested" PRSAs).  Funded pension schemes sponsored by or put in place in respect of the employees of the companies to which the Deputy refers would have been approved by the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes and the levy therefore applies to the assets of such funded schemes.There is no general requirement for data on the value of Irish pension funds to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners.  I am not, therefore, in a position to provide the Deputy with data in relation to the value of the pension funds in the schemes operated by the companies referred to in the question.

The information sought by the Deputy, to the extent that it has been released publicly by the named covered institution, is available in its 2009 and 2010 Annual Reports which indicate that non-pensionable fees of €79,000 for 2009 and €90,000 for 2010 were paid to the named individual.

Its primary function would be to discourage at-risk levels of alcohol consumption.  A National Substance Misuse Strategy was established in 2009.  It is examining the development of policy to deal with a wide range of key issues relating to the supply, pricing, availability and marketing of alcohol — including the question of a minimum price for alcohol — along with measures for the policy areas of prevention strategies, treatment, rehabilitation and substance dependency, research and information.  The report of the Steering Group is close to completion.  The Minister for Health expects to receive proposals in the coming months and he will then brief his colleagues in Government on these.  The Deputy may be aware that Ireland's alcohol tax levels are already high in relation to other EU Member States.  At July 2011, we had the highest excise duty within the EU 27 for sparkling wine, the third-highest for still wine and spirits and the fourth-highest for beer.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	592	As the Deputy may be aware a publican who provides a bus exclusively for the purpose of taking patrons to and from the public house will be entitled to claim a deduction for the VAT on the cost of acquisition of the bus, but only if the bus has more than 16 seats.  Section 60 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 prohibits a deduction of tax to the extent that it relates to expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a motor vehicle, unless it is designed and constructed for the carriage of more than 16 persons, including the driver.  If he charges the passengers for the transport, the publican will not be entitled to any VAT deduction, regardless of the size of the bus.  This is because the carriage of passengers is exempt from VAT and no deduction can be claimed for tax charged on expenditure incurred in an exempt activity.  With regard to Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT), I have no plans to introduce an exemption of VRT charged on 7/9 seater mini-buses for publicans who wish to purchase same for the purpose of transporting customers.

Under EU and domestic VAT rules traders who are registered for VAT collect VAT on the goods and services that they sell.  In turn such traders are entitled to recover the VAT they incur on their business inputs used in the purchase or production of goods or delivery of services.  Consequently, if there is a decrease in value at any stage in the process the trader is entitled to a refund of the excess of VAT incurred over that collected.  In this regard, where a retailer is in a situation of net VAT gain as a result of below cost selling, this is not a loss to the Exchequer or an additional benefit to the retailer, it is merely how VAT is charged.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	596	This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  I am advised by Revenue that there are two tranches of debt with the sheriff for collection in the particular case.  One is comprised of income tax, including interest, based on returns and VAT, including interest, based primarily on estimates in the absence of returns being filed.  VAT returns were subsequently filed with Revenue reducing the overall debt.  Separately a PAYE/PRSI debt is also with the sheriff for collection.The overall debt now with the sheriff is €88,561.61 and the sheriff had been facilitating payment of the debt by way of a phased payment arrangement.Revenue has also informed me that PAYE/PRSI returns have not been filed in this case for the last 5 years and estimates, including interest, amounting to €123,574.71 have been raised.  A final request for payment of this amount was issued by Revenue on 25 October 2011.  This debt has not yet been enforced to the sheriff as, by arrangement with the agent for the person, Revenue has allowed a final opportunity up to 15 December 2011 for the submission of the outstanding returns.  Revenue has no desire to enforce debt based on estimates, but must do so in the absence of returns for such a prolonged period.  These returns should now be filed so that the final tax debt can be determined.The individual concerned or his agent should then make contact with Ms Ann Hegarty in the Collector General's Office, Government Offices, Nenagh, Co. Tipperary  (Tel. 067 63116) with a view to an agreed approach being put in place.  Revenue will have due regard to all of the circumstances including the health of the person concerned, in the context of finalising its approach.

A footnote was included in the MTFS to the effect that the USC is also expected to deliver an additional €0.4 billion in revenues in 2012 and that while this does not form part of the €3.8 billion consolidation package it is captured in the budgetary projections.  The reason it is captured in the tax revenue projection for 2012 is because income tax is expected to benefit in 2012 from these estimated additional receipts.  To not capture these receipts in the estimate of income tax for 2012 would be incorrect.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	599	A stamp duty levy of 0.6% applies to the market value, on the valuation date, of assets under management in pension funds and pension plans approved under Irish tax legislation.  The pension arrangements affected include funded retirement benefit schemes (i.e. occupational pension schemes), retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts (PRSAs — other than what are known as "vested" PRSAs).  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) responsible for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans and payment of the levy is due by 25 September in each of the four years from 2011-2014. State organisations,  per se, are not responsible for payment of pension fund levy.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that receipts from the temporary 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2011 amounted to €463 million by the end of October.  This compares to a projected annual yield from the levy of €470 million.I am also advised by the Commissioners that they are aware of a small number of pension schemes in respect of which the levy remained outstanding at end-October.  The amounts involved are, however, unlikely to make any significant difference to the latest yield figure mentioned above.I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that appropriate compliance measures are in place to ensure that all employers, including State organisations, meet their obligations for deduction and timely payment over to the Collector-General of the universal social charge.  For reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, Revenue does not disclose information on individual taxpayers or employers.  However, if the Deputy has specific information to indicate a particular incidence of non-compliance he should pass that information to Revenue.

The solicitors for the applicant were informed of the situation.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	601	The customer due diligence requirements set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 were repealed on the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 (the 2010 Act).  Section 33 of the 2010 Act requires designated persons (such as banks) to apply customer due diligence measures prior to establishing a business relationship with a customer e.g. opening a bank account.  The customer due diligence measures require that the designated person must identify and verify the customer's identity on the basis of documents or information that the designated person has reasonable grounds to believe can be relied upon to confirm the identity of the customer.  The 2010 Act does not limit the range of documents or information that a designated person may have reasonable grounds to believe can be relied upon to confirm the identity of the customer.  Draft guidelines, under the 2010 Act, which are being finalised by the financial services industry, in consultation with the Central Bank, provide guidance on the identification and verification procedures.  These guidelines specify a non-exhaustive range of documentation which the bank may choose to accept for the purposes of verifying identity.  The range of documentation includes utility bills but also many other types of documentation issued by Government Departments, state agencies and financial institutions.  In the event that an individual provides a plausible explanation as to why the suggested documentation cannot be provided, the bank may choose from an additional specified list of methods to assist in confirming the identity of the customer.  In the case of care homes or sheltered accommodation, the alternative forms of identification include a letter from the care home manager/manager of the sheltered accommodation confirming name and address of the care home and name and date of birth of the customer.Ultimately, it is up to each bank to decide, on a risk based approach, whether it accepts other forms of customer identification.  However, there is a clear statement in the draft guidelines to the effect that "where an individual is genuinely not in a position to provide standard evidence of identity it is important that he/she is not prevented from gaining access to the financial system solely due to not being able to produce particular documentation.”

If an airline company charges an intending passenger an amount corresponding to the air travel tax that would be payable by the company in respect of that passenger's departure and that person does not make the proposed journey, the question of a refund of the amount involved is a matter between the company and that person.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they would not, therefore, have any information on the amount of money retained by airline companies of foot of cancelled tickets or unfilled seats.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	603	Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief at the standard rate of income tax for qualifying fees paid by an individual in respect of a third level education course including a postgraduate course.  Qualifying fees means tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the "student contribution".  For the tax year 2011 and subsequent tax years, the maximum annual amount eligible for tax relief (including the student contribution of €2,000) is €7,000 per course.Currently, undergraduate college fees at public institutions are free in Ireland, apart from the student contribution.  The tax relief is confined to tuition fees only. Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, employer contribution or other means are to be deducted in arriving at the net fees qualifying for tax relief.An individual can claim tax relief on fees paid by him/her in respect of an approved third level course pursued by him/her and on fees paid by him/her in respect of an approved course pursued by other individuals (e.g. a son or daughter).A claim for relief may be in respect of a number of students — the maximum amount allowable (i.e. €7,000) applies per course rather than per claim. However:the first €2,000 of all fees claimed by an individual does not attract tax relief where any one of the students to whom the claim refers is a full time student;the first €1,000 of all fees claimed by an individual does not attract tax relief where all of the students to whom the claim refers are part-time students.These thresholds apply regardless of whether the student attends a private or public third-level institution.All tax reliefs and incentives are subject to regular review as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill planning process.  Any decisions taken by the Government in this regard are usually announced on Budget Day.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	605	I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 to 123, inclusive, together.The yield to the Exchequer in a full year where the VAT rates are increased by 1% and 2% are outlined in the following table:Rate1% increase2% increase9% Reduced rate+ €75m+ €150m13.5% Reduced rate+ €160m+ €320m21% Standard rate+ €335m+ €670mIf the current standard VAT rate of 21% was reduced by 1% to 20%, this would cost the Exchequer €335 million.Following the introduction of a second reduced VAT rate on 1 July 2011, Ireland's VAT rate structure is as follows:Standard rate of 21% — this applies to the majority of goods and services accounting for 51% of all goods and services, including cars, petrol, diesel, alcohol, tobacco, electrical equipment and CD/DVDs. Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may set the standard VAT rate not lower than 15% and there is political agreement that it does not exceed 25%.Reduced rate of 13.5% — this applies mainly to residential housing, labour intensive services and general repairs and maintenance.  Member States may have up to two reduced VAT rates of not less than 5% for a specified number of goods or services which are set out in Annex III of the VAT Directive.  Member States also have the option of maintaining, at a reduced rate of not less than 12%, any items not listed in Annex III, provided they carried a reduced rate on 1 January 1991.  These items are known as ‘parked' and Ireland's parked rate is 13.5%. Fuel used for heat or light, and commercial construction are examples of parked items.  All items at the 13.5% reduced rate and parked rate account for 25% of goods and services subject to VAT.Reduced rate of 9% — applies mainly to tourism services including hotel and holiday accommodation, restaurant services, and various entertainment services.  The rate was introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative and applies from 1 July 2011 until end December 2013.  It accounts for around 11% of all goods and services.Zero rate — this generally applies to most food, children's clothes and shoes, and oral medicines, and accounts for 13% of goods and services subject to VAT. While it is possible to retain the zero rating for goods and services that were in place on 1 January 1991, the zero rate cannot be applied to any new items.4.8% livestock rate — Ireland applies a VAT rate of 4.8% which is limited to livestock sold by VAT registered persons/firms.  As with the zero and parked rates, Ireland is entitled to maintain this rate for historic reasons.Exempt activities — services provided by charities, non-profit organisations and certain financial services are exempt from VAT, as are schools and hospitals etc.  Exempt suppliers do not generally charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot reclaim VAT incurred on the goods and services they purchase.

The Central Bank is of the view that the company was carrying out activities for which authorisation would have been required from the Central Bank.  It would appear to the Central Bank that the company was carrying on a ‘banking business' in the absence of a banking licence issued under the Central Bank Act 1971, as amended, and providing payment services in the absence of an appropriate authorisation under the European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 (SI No 383/2009). The Central Bank is independent in the carrying out of its functions and any further action with regard to the company is a matter for the Bank.  I have no indication that any issues arising in this case arose from any gaps in the legislative framework, but my officials and the Central Bank are, nonetheless, examining the current legislation to see if any part needs to be strengthened.  On completion of that examination, I will consider further with a view to bringing proposals to Government to provide for any necessary amendment to the current law or for the introduction of new legislation, where necessary.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total identifiable costs to the Exchequer of all income tax and corporation tax allowances, reliefs, exemptions and tax credits available are set out in the following tables for 2007 and 2008, the most recent year for which the necessary detailed historical information is available. Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.Index of Tables and Notesa) Note on the Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2007 & 2008b) Table IT 6 showing Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2007 & 2008c) Notes on Table IT 6d) Note on Green Paper on Pensionse) Estimate of cost of certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax for 2007 and 2008f) Note on reliefs in respect of which costs are not currently quantifiable or are negligible or are not identifiable within total aggregates.Estimates of the corresponding costs to the Exchequer for years 2009, 2010 and 2011 are not available.Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2007 and 2008The table IT 6 shows the estimated cost in terms of revenue forgone of the personal tax credits and the main reliefs and deductions allowable under the income tax system.  A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax.An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity.  The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate.  Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.However, it should be noted that the restriction of reliefs or horizontal measure seeks to restrict the capacity of high earners to reduce their income tax liability to very low levels, or to zero, through the cumulative use of various tax incentives. From the 2010 tax year, high earners that are subject to the full restriction now pay an effective rate of income tax of 30%, on average.  This is an addition to PRSI and the Universal Social Charge.In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits.  To this extent, the figures in the table of the "costs" of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a "loss of tax revenue" on profits.  To compute such "loss", regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply.  They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.The figures of cost are for 2008 and 2007 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available.  The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged.  It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures.  For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs.  Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits.  For instance, a person with €1,000 gross trading profits, €1,000 capital allowances and €1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on €1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn.  In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on €1,000.  Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.Apart from the artists exemption, these figures do not take account of the application of the restriction of reliefs originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006, which took effect from 1 January 2007.  The restriction was extended by Section 23 Finance Act 2010.Finally, the estimates shown in many cases are tentative and are subject to revision in the light of later information.Table IT6 — Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2007 and 2008Tax Relief Provision(1) Estimated Cost for20072008INCOME TAX€mNumbers€mNumbersExemption limits:General Exemption (2)0.000.00Child Addition (2)0.28000.3900Age Exemption (2)75.351,50090.857,700Married Person’s Credit (3)2,776.7834,9002,944.9853,100Single Person’s Credit (3)2,392.01,552,8002,406.81,503,300Widowed Person’s Credit (3)171.379,500184.381,100Additional Credit to Widowed Person in Year of Bereavement4.84,0004.94,000Additional Bereavement Credit to Widowed Parent6.62,4006.92,300Additional Personal Credit for Lone Parent199.0122,200197.4116,700Homecarer Credit68.592,20079.593,100Additional Credit for Incapacitated Child31.711,70039.012,300Employee (PAYE) Credit3,153.11,732,0003,253.81,710,200Dependent Relative Credit1.817,6002.018,700Person Taking Care of Incapacitated Taxpayer4.61,0705.81,260Age Credit33.782,90042.388,100Blind Person’s Credit2.01,2402.11,320Medical Insurance Premiums (4)300.31,195,300321.01,322,400Health Expenses225.7496,300266.8542,600Contributions Under Permanent Health Benefit Schemes, after Deduction of Tax on Benefits Received (5)3.626,3004.029,200Employees’ Contributions To Approved Superannuation Schemes (6)590.0708,500655.0792,600Employers’ Contributions To Approved Superannuation Schemes  (6)150.0364,700165.0362,700Exemption of Investment Income and Gains of Approved Superannuation Funds  (6) *900.0N/A685.0N/AExemption of employers’ contributions to Approved Superannuation Schemes from employee BIK540.0364,700595.0362,700Tax Relief on “tax free” lump sums (6)130.0N/A140.0N/ARetirement Annuity Premiums407.9121,300352.8116,000Personal Retirement Savings Accounts61.146,60073.853,900Interest paid:Loans relating to Principal Private Residence542.7720,000704.6778,100Other (7)46.95,30048.55,400Rent Paid in Private Tenancies82.1206,00096.5222,100Expenses Allowable to Employees under Schedule E69.8894,40075.2835,900Third Level Education Fees18.134,50019.936,000Exemption of Certain Earnings of Writers, Composers and Artists27.42,65021.82,630Dispositions (Including Maintenance Payments made to Separated Spouses)20.57,22022.37,820Exemption of Interest on Savings Certificates, National Instalment Savings & Index Linked Savings Bonds130.3N/A88.1N/ARent a Room4.73,1805.63,600Exemption of Income of Charities, Colleges, Hospitals, Schools, Friendly Societies, etc. (8) (10)30.7N/A35.8N/ARetirement Relief for certain Sports Persons (9)0.2200.217Exemption of Irish Government Securities where owner not ordinarily resident in Ireland (10) *240.8N/A320.8N/AExemption of Statutory Redundancy Payments87.625,00085.429,800Service Charges24.4413,10027.1455,200Top Slicing Relief — Reduced Tax Rate for Payments in Excess of Exemption Amounts Made as Compensation for Loss of Office27.83,02044.73,790Revenue Job Assist allowance0.33600.2330Allowance for seafarers0.31700.3160Trade Union Subscriptions20.7316,30026.4341,900Exemption From Tax of Certain Social Welfare Payments:Child benefit *355.0347,760435.3401,200Early childcare Supplement*84.3193,20098.3195,200Maternity allowance *15.220,95018.223,420Foster Care Payments29.43,33028.13,470Exemption of Income arising from the Provision of Childcare Services0.74000.8440Approved Profit Sharing Schemes *107.698,87099111,180Savings-Related Share Option Schemes *11.92,6001.32,800Approved Share Option Schemes *310000.08280Relief for New Shares Purchased by Employees0.22100.3280Investment in Corporate Trades (BES)17.51,90055.73,200Investment in Seed Capital2.3631.756Stock Relief *2N/A2.0N/ARelief for expenditure on significant buildings and gardens5.02105.9290Donation of Heritage items5.344.75Donation of Heritage property to the Irish Heritage Trust1.973.64

They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.(3) The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply.  They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.(4) Arising from the change over to Tax Relief at Source the figures relate to the number of policies issued.  These include policies where subscriptions were paid by businesses on behalf of their employees.(5) Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a "net pay" basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001.(6) See the following note on "Green Paper on Pensions" for background commentary on the basis of the cost figures.(7) "Other" relates to borrowings for purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership.(8) The income on which the cost of exemption for charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. from income tax is based includes repaid income tax that has been deducted at source on dividends, other investment income and payments received under covenant, donations and associated tax relief by the PAYE sector to approved bodies and donations by the self-employed and corporate sectors to approved bodies and approved sports bodies. Information is not available about other income received gross.(9) The cost figures for relief for donations to Approved Sports Bodies and for certain Sports Persons are based on self assessment returns.(10) In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be appropriate in many cases.(11) The costs included for corporation tax are by reference to accounting periods which ended in the years 2007 and 2008.(12) The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with "unused capital allowances", that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company's profits of that accounting period which are available for offset.  Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies.  It is estimated that €2820 million and €3587 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2007 and 2008 accounting periods respectively but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.(13) The tax cost shown for section 23 type relief is the estimated ultimate tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of claims made in 2007 and 2008 tax returns for the first time.  The cost shown is for income tax cases only.(14) The cost shown for manufacturing relief for 2008 is compiled using the basic data available but for technical reasons associated with a system redesign it is understood to be understated by at least €100m.(15) The costs shown for R&D is for claims for R&D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2007 and 2008.  However, the cost includes the cost associated with claims where the company was entitled to the credit but was unable to absorb it in that accounting year.Green Paper on Pensions — Review of Estimates of CostAs part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area.  The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.The review drew on newly available 2006 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality.  Estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision updated for 2007 and 2008 are included in table IT6.The breakdown and make-up of these estimated costs of reliefs differ from presentations of costs in this area for years prior to 2005 in a number of respects and are not directly comparable.  Further details on the cost of tax and other reliefs and the changes in the methodology are contained in pages 106 and 107 of the Green Paper on Pensions which is available at www.nationalpensionsframework.ie.Certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax — uptake and estimated potential cost to the Exchequer in terms of income tax and corporation tax forgone based on 2007 and 2008 tax returnsProvisions were included in the Finance Acts of 2003 and 2004 to enable new statistical data on the uptake of tax relief for certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax to be obtained from tax returns.  This information, derived from changes introduced by the Revenue Commissioners to income tax returns and corporation tax returns for 2007 and 2008, is set out in the following tables.The figures shown include the amounts claimed in the year but exclude amounts carried forward into the year either as losses or capital allowances, and include any amounts of unused losses and/or capital allowances which will be carried forward to subsequent years.2007 Tax Incentive/Income ExemptionAmount Claimed€mAssumed maximum tax cost€mNumber of claimantsUrban renewal280.0109.33,501Town Renewal86.134.61,128Seaside Resorts20.38.01,231Rural Renewal121.948.62,807Multi-storey car parks24.09.6147Living Over the shop8.03.093Enterprise Areas7.02.8137Park and Ride3.31.433Holiday Cottages30.712.4832Hotels307.1118.01,893Nursing Homes45.318.3687Housing for the Elderly/infirm6.32.6166Hostels1.80.7224Guest Houses0.10.028Convalescent Homes1.20.527Qualifying Private Hospitals29.612.1330Qualifying sports injury clinics4.31.859Buildings Used for certain childcare purposes24.29.8420Qualifying Mental Health Centres0.00.01Student Accommodation108.742.0941Exemption of profits or gains from Greyhounds0.40.113Exemption of profits or gains from Stallions59.611.2226Exemption of profits or gains from Woodlands21.88.51,886Exempt Patents (Section 234, TCA 1997)528.290.91,251Totals1,719.8546.517,8412008 Tax Incentive/Income ExemptionAmount Claimed€mAssumed maximum tax cost€mNumber of claimantsUrban renewal224.684.53,271Town Renewal60.523.7965Seaside Resorts14.55.71,051Rural Renewal84.634.22,634Multi-storey car parks16.86.6136Living Over the shop6.12.581Enterprise Areas6.22.5138Park and Ride1.70.719Holiday Cottages26.810.8833Hotels300.6114.71,966Nursing Homes47.619.4725Housing for the Elderly/infirm7.43.0179Hostels1.620.6621Guest Houses0.30.1110Convalescent Homes1.30.533Qualifying Private Hospitals30.212.3340Qualifying sports injury clinics3.71.558Buildings Used for certain childcare purposes29.912.0511Qualifying Mental Health Centres0.10.03Student Accommodation58.022.7790Caravan Camps1.50.610Mid Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure1.80.712Exemption of profits or gains from Greyhounds0.00.09Exemption of profits or gains from Stallions91.414.8183Exemption of profits or gains from Woodlands49.413.02,357Exempt Patents (section 234, TCA 1997)187.250.21,184Totals1,302.4455.018,089These figures do not take account of the application of the restriction of reliefs originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006 and which took effect from 1 January 2007.  The restriction was extended by Section 23 Finance Act 2010.Notes:The figures shown relate to the various reliefs/incentives and exemptions as specified in the 2007 and 2008 form 11 and CT1.There were concerns that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the Tax returns.  Revenue drew the attention of the relevant tax practitioner bodies to these deficiencies to rectify them in future returns and also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.The estimated costs have assumed tax foregone at the 41% rate in the case of income tax and 12.5% in the case of corporation tax.  This means the figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax.  However, the actual Exchequer cost could be lower, particularly in relation to the exempt income items, as the income could be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs thereby reducing the level of income that would be actually subject to tax.Some of the costs shown above are included in the costs shown for capital allowances and section 23 relief in Table IT6.  For example, exempt income included above is not part of capital allowances.Reliefs in respect of which costs are not currently quantifiable or are negligible or are not identifiable within total aggregates:Relief from averaging of farm profits;Exemption for income arising from payments in respect of personal injuries;Exemption of certain payments made by Haemophilia HIV Trust;Exemption of lump sum retirement payments;Relief for allowable motor expenses;Tapering relief allowable for taxation of car benefits in kind;Reduced tax rate for authorised unit trust schemes;Reduced tax rate for special investment schemes;Exemption of certain grants made by Údarás na Gaeltachta;Relief for investment income reserved for policy holders in life assurance companies;Relief for various business related expenses such as staff recruitment, rent, legal fees, and other general expenses;Exemption in certain circumstances on the interest on quoted bearer Eurobonds;Exemption of payments made as compensation for loss of office;Exemption of scholarship income.There are a number of different tax expenditures within the Irish taxation system.  These have been introduced for a number of different reasons: providing a basic level of income before taxation; correcting market failure or attracting mobile investment.  The Commission on Taxation in its 2009 report made a comprehensive study of all tax expenditures.  The full report is available on the Commission's website at www.commissionontaxation.ie.It should be noted that the data in the above tables includes costs for certain tax expenditures which have since been withdrawn (e.g. trade union subscriptions, relief for new shares purchased by employees) or restricted (e.g. health expenses, loans relating to principal private residence, tax relief on "tax free" lump sums).  "Legacy" property-based tax relief schemes, due to their nature, continue to impose ongoing costs on the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone.All tax reliefs and incentives are reviewed regularly, in line with the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	612	It is not be appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to become involved in the detailed mortgage position of an individual borrower and lender.  However, there are a number of public policy measures in place to assist people experiencing difficulties with the mortgage on their primary residence.  The Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears is the key framework that governs the relationship between lenders and borrowers who are in arrears, or facing arrears, on their mortgage.  The Code provides a number of protections to borrowers.  These include the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) to deal with mortgage customers who are in arrears or pre-arrears, the establishment of dedicated Arrears Support Units and a separate internal appeals process by lenders to deal with individuals on a case by case basis.  The Code also provides that a lender must not apply to the Courts to commence legal action for the repossession of a borrower's private residence until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative arrangement with the borrower and that, where a borrower co-operates with the lender, the lender must wait at least twelve months from the date the borrower is classified as a MARP case before applying to the Court to commence legal action for repossession of a borrower's primary residence.  This twelve month period does not include any time where the borrower is complying with the terms of any alternative arrangement agreed with the lender, or being processed by the internal Appeals Board, or any time during which a complaint against the lender against any aspect of the Mortgage Arrears Code is being processed by the Financial Services Ombudsman's Office.As the Deputy is aware, in addition to the provisions of the Mortgage Arrears Code, there are other public measures in place to assist eligible mortgage holders experiencing difficulty in respect of the mortgage on their primary home such as the Department of Social Protection Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme, and the provision of a free, confidential and independent financial advice service from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.The Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing arising from difficulty in meeting their mortgage commitments and, as the Deputy is aware, steps have already been taken to implement recommendations made in the report of the Inter Departmental Group on Mortgage Arrears.  In addition, following the conclusion of the Dáil debate on the report, I intend to formally put forward proposals to the Government on next steps, including an implementation mechanism to be driven by my Department.

Interest is applied on these products at maturity, which is after 5.5 years for Savings Certificates and after 3 years for Savings Bonds, or on encashment, which could be at any stage during the life of the product.  Bringing the products within the Deposit Interest Retention Tax regime would lead to an estimated yield of €45m, based on the estimated interest payout on Savings Certificates and Bonds in 2011.  The yield has been estimated on the basis of applying the higher DIRT rate of 30% — which applies to interest paid less frequently than annually, as is the case with Savings Certificates and Savings Bonds — rather than the standard DIRT rate of 27%, which applies to interest paid annually or more frequently than annually.

The site includes many residential properties located in Dublin City and County and, in each instance, information about the firm dealing with the insolvency and its contact details are provided. Potential purchasers are encouraged to contact the receivers to obtain additional information on specific properties and to submit expressions of their interest to purchase. In the case of property under the control of debtors, NAMA is precluded, under Section 202 of the NAMA Act 2009, from disclosing confidential information. Confidential information is specifically defined to include information relating to debtors. Furthermore, Section 99 of the Act provides that, on acquisition of a loan, NAMA takes over the obligations of the participating institution under the loan, one of which is the contractual duty of confidentiality which the debtor enjoyed while still a customer of the participating institution. Information about individual debtors or guarantors is also protected against disclosure by the Data Protection Acts with which NAMA must comply as a data controller. However, in cases where NAMA receives enquiries from potential purchasers about specific properties under the control of debtors, it can facilitate contact with debtors or receivers with a view to enabling sales transactions to take place.

I propose to consider the advice of a senior international banker who recently reported to me on NAMA before deciding whether to initiate any changes to the agency's operations.  As regards making properties available for social or community purposes, the NAMA Board has committed to giving first option to public bodies on the purchase of property which may be suitable for their purposes.For instance, NAMA concluded the sale of 58 social and affordable units to the Clúid Housing Association in July. In addition, it has recently encouraged and approved the sale by a debtor of residential units in Co. Cork to a housing association. I am informed that a number of NAMA debtors are in advanced negotiation with a number of housing associations for sales at various locations throughout the country.The agency has provided a list of over 1,000 other properties to the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, and I am informed that it is now in discussions with his officials and the Irish Council for Social Housing with a view to identifying properties which may be suitable for social housing.In addition, I am also aware that NAMA has approved the release of lands in Baldoyle to Fingal County Council for extra parkland; has accommodated the sale of a 13 acre site in Hansfield, West Dublin to the Department of Education; and has agreed to co-fund with Fingal County Council a link road through lands that NAMA has as security for loans in West Dublin, which will link the N2\N3.NAMA also advises me that it is willing to facilitate dialogue between debtors and third parties interested in acquiring property for social or public purposes.

The VAT Directive provides that VAT must be applied to all economic activity, including the supply of medical appliances to blind persons.  Separate from this, Ireland operates a VAT refund mechanism for disabled persons who have purchased medical appliances to which VAT has been applied.  While persons purchasing medical goods from the National Council for the Blind would likely be entitled to a VAT refund on those goods, under EU VAT law it is not possible for the NCB to exempt those products in advance.

These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2009 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2012. They are therefore provisional and may be revised.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the additional yield from reducing the thresholds for CAT to €250,000 for Group A and €25,000 for Group B, as compared with the current thresholds, is estimated to be of the order of €33 million.All estimates are based on transactions recorded in 2010.  Revenue do not receive information on gifts and inheritances which currently do not have to be declared so it is not possible to estimate the potential yield if such benefits were brought into the tax net.  The estimates are also determined by reference to the current CAT rate of 25% on amounts above the group tax-free thresholds.It should be noted that these estimates are based upon an assumption that there would be no behavioural impact of the suggested changes, which could lead to a less than expected result from a change to the tax base.  In addition, the realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets, such as are currently occurring in the economy.

However, these estimates assume no behavioural changes on the part of taxpayers, and large increases in rates such as are contemplated in the question may have a significant behavioural impact.  CGT is very dependent on individual behaviour and a change in rate may not produce a corresponding increase or decrease in tax yield.  In current economic conditions any estimate of additional yield must be treated with caution.  The realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets, as are currently occurring in the economy.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	624	With regard to comments made by the retail industry as regards VAT, I have announced that I will be proposing to Government an increase in the standard rate of VAT of 2 percentage points from 21% to 23%.  This change is being introduced as part of a general package of revenue-raising measures to contribute to Exchequer funding and is in line with commitments made in the Programme for Government and in the EU/IMF Programme.  With regard to the industry's concerns that the VAT increase will encourage cross-border shopping, studies have shown that the key driver of cross border shopping is the currency exchange rate and not VAT rates.  In this respect, the current exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro should provide less incentive for people to shop outside the State, despite the proposed increase in the Irish VAT rate.Furthermore, it must be pointed out that for the majority of the last two decades there was a differential of 3.5 percentage points between the VAT rates of Ireland and the UK, with Ireland at 21% and the UK at 17.5%.  With the proposed increase in the Irish standard VAT rate to 23% as compared to the current 20% UK rate, the differential is narrower than has generally been the case.

These statistics are based on aggregate information collected from financial institutions and do not contain the demographic details which would enable such a breakdown of the statistics.  I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no statistical basis for compiling estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax.  It is therefore not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy on the potential return from a wealth tax.  Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) are, in effect, taxes on wealth, in that they are levied on an individual or company on the disposal of an asset (CGT) or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance (CAT).  The rate of both these taxes is currently 25%.  However, they are not annual taxes on an individual's wealth, which is presumably what the Deputy has in mind.While I do not propose at this time to introduce a wealth tax, all taxes and potential taxation measures are constantly reviewed in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill.

The objective of this request to tender was to establish a Panel of Qualified Trainers, from which companies will be selected to participate in mini competitions for contracts awarded for delivery of various training programmes on behalf of FÁS. FÁS envisages that this new replacement Panel will be fully operational in January 2012.  The detail of SOLAS involvement in the area of Contracted Training has not yet been fully decided.

Earlier this year I also published details of new procedures and criteria for the establishment of new second level schools and of the process for determining the patronage of such new schools. I also announced details of 20 new second level schools that would need to be established between 2012 and 2017 to meet our increasing demographics. As the Deputy will be aware, Maynooth is one of the areas where a new 1,000 pupil second level school is to be established.  Applications for patronage of any of the new second level schools, including the new school in Maynooth, would need to relate to the provision of a full curriculum through from first year to sixth year.  This is one of the key requirements of the process.  In the case of the Maynooth school the main medium of instruction will be English. The closing date for receipt of applications for patronage of the new second level schools is Friday, 13th January 2012.Both new school buildings will be located on one campus and responsibility for the delivery of the buildings has been devolved to County Kildare Vocational Education Committee.  I understand the VEC is in the process of appointing a Design Team.

My Department has requested the VEC to ensure that the club referred to by the Deputy continues to have use of the sports complex following execution of the lease. I understand that the club and the VEC have held a number of meetings to discuss the content of a user agreement and I am advised that good progress has been made to date.  The VEC has confirmed to my Department that it is facilitating the club's continued use of the sports complex.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) which is administered and paid for by NEPS.In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention.This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.I have checked on the matter with the NEPS service and the student in question has not been brought to the attention of the assigned psychologist by current school authorities in relation to his formal assessment or review. I would suggest that an approach be made to the relevant school principal in the first instance in this connection.

The PPP programme endeavours to achieve this in two ways.Firstly, and most importantly, by providing each of the schools with a bank of 350 hours usage outside of the normal school day (8.00 to 18.00 Monday to Friday).  This is done in recognition of schools existing commitments to community usage, including adult education and school sport activities, extra curricular activities undertaken by the schools and additional school usage including Parents nights and home school liaison. There is scope within these parameters to facilitate local arrangements with voluntary organisation.Secondly, the Project Agreement provides that the PPP Operator may use the facilities in the schools to generate income, such income to be shared with the schools. However, this can only be done outside normal school hours and outside the 350 bank hours and in agreement with the schools' authorities.

The programme has been designed to include group participation and discussion with the use of fact based case studies and exercises to facilitate learning. I understand from FÁS that, originally, the minimum number of candidates attending the course was set at ten and the maximum number at twenty and that after an independent review of the programme, the minimum number was reduced to eight.To facilitate workers gaining access to training, FÁS has offered to search its course notification data base and to advise workers of the nearest available course and to put them directly in contact with an approved Safe Pass Tutor so that they can be scheduled for training.FÁS also advises that any workers experiencing difficulty in gaining access to a Safe Pass Course should contact the FÁS Safe Pass Operations Unit at 01 6070500 for assistance.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	635	At its meeting on 11 April 2011, the Government approved the preparation of a new capital investment framework for the period from 2012, to be prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That Department wrote to my Secretary General on 28 April 2011 requesting a report on my Department's proposed overall capital investment programme for the period 2012-2016, to facilitate the preparation of the revised framework.My Department made a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform setting out a range of scenarios for expenditure depending on the levels of funding available.  The number of pupil places required was determined by the Forward Planning Section whose primary function is to anticipate and plan for school accommodation provision thereby ensuring that there are sufficient pupil places available in first and second level schools throughout the State.  The Department is using a Geographical Information System (GIS) for this purpose.  The GIS utilises data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the General Registers Office, the Department of Social Protection and Local Authorities, in addition to the Department's own databases.  The most recent forecasts indicate that the overall level of primary enrolments will increase from the current enrolment of circa 509,652 pupils to a total of circa 554,700 pupils by 2018 and that at post-primary level enrolment numbers will rise from approximately 317,432 pupils in 2010/11 to approximately 343,900 pupils by 2018 depending on which migration and fertility rates prevail within that period.I announced on 27 June last that 20 new primary schools and 20 new post primary schools are to be established in the next six years and indicated the general areas in which these schools are to be established.  As well as these new schools, places will be provided either through large scale extensions or through the delivery of extra classrooms under the additional accommodation scheme.  These developments are based on the detailed projections in individual areas and the capacity of the existing school stock for expansion.The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published its report on Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016 on 10 November 2011.  The investment includes an allocation for education capital of just over €2.2bn over the five years of the plan.  I intend to publish details of the school building programme for 2012 next month and early next year I intend to publish a five year plan outlining the projects to be constructed over that period.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.The NCSE has now advised all mainstream schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, of their SNA allocation for the current school year, taking into account the care needs of qualifying pupils attending the school. The NCSE recently published statistical information on SNA allocations on a county by county and school by school basis on its website www.ncse.ie. I have arranged for Deputy’s question regarding an individual application for SNA support to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.

The total capital allocation for my Department under the Government's Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework as announced on 10 November 2011 amounts to just over €2.2bn.  While the estimated cost is €380m, not all of this will be payable in the five years 2012 to 2016 as it is expected that some of the new schools will be delivered by Public Private Partnerships.

Subject to the conditions of the student grant scheme, grants are available where students are progressing to a course at a higher level.  The objective of this policy is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining one qualification at each level of study.Eligibility for, and the payment structure for any social welfare payment is determined and administered by the Department of Social Protection and is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.The student to which the Deputy refers may, however, be eligible for tax relief for his/her tuition fees.  Details in relation to this are available on www.revenue.ie.In addition, the student may be able to avail of support under the Student Assistance Fund which helps students in exceptional financial circumstances.  Information on the Fund is available through the access offices of third-level institutions.  The access offices themselves also provide support and advice to students to enable them to continue with their studies.

This practice note sets out the duties of the Contractor and the Employer’s Representative (usually the Project Architect) under the relevant contract used for individual school building projects.In the event that complaints regarding compliance with employment rights legislation arise, the appropriate statutory body for investigating such complaints is the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA). Its remit includes both inspection and enforcement (and prosecution) services.  NERA's website is http://www.employmentrights.ie.The Deputy may be interested to know that I have asked the relevant officials in my Department to discuss a proposal suggested by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which may lead to a higher level of compliance on all school building projects funded by the state. Discussions on this will continue in the coming period.

All post primary schools were requested to participate in the survey and there were 422 valid responses. The results of the survey shows that 66.4% of maths teachers are fully qualified to do so, 31.1% have undergone some studies in maths and only 2.5% of teachers teaching maths have no third level qualification/studies in maths.  These results are consistent with and underpin the earlier data published on the 12 September last, and they help us to get a clearer picture of what is actually happening in schools and to plan to meet the training needs of teachers.  The survey is now complete.Minister Sherlock announced on September 12 proposals to introduce a course for teachers of Mathematics who may not have a qualification in the subject to upskill to the recognised levels.  The competition to identify providers of the course is about to go to the market and an outcome is expected early in the New Year.The Deputy may wish also to note that the Council is shortly due to publish a consultation document setting out proposed revised degree entry requirements for post-primary post graduate initial teacher education programmes relating to the teaching of 35 curricular subjects.  The revised requirements will include the subject of mathematics.

Of this sum, FÁS estimates that training interventions of the order of €5.5m and interventions for redundant apprentices, mainly involving on-the-job training supports, of the order of €15m have been provided; this is still being verified by FÁS.  The off-the-job supports for this cohort are still being costed as are a number of relevant supports in the further education and third level education areas.Information on the cohort encompassed by the EGF applications has been provided to the relevant service providers as appropriate.  It is estimated that nationally at least 4,500 interventions have been commenced in the areas of guidance, training and third level education.  The Department does not at this time have a disaggregated breakdown of the supports provided per redundant worker.  This data will be compiled with the assistance of the new EGF coordination and data control structures being put in place for the reporting of relevant activity and expenditure to the Department.It is intended that a number of new EGF co-financed interventions will be announced later this month by the Department and details notified to eligible persons.

The staffing schedule is the mechanism used for allocating mainstream teaching posts to all schools.  It currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils.The number of teaching posts that we can afford to fund in schools is a matter that I will have to consider with my colleagues in Cabinet in the context of the forthcoming budget and meeting our obligations under the EU/IMF Programme.The Government will endeavour to protect front-line education services as best as possible.  However, this must be done within the context of bringing our overall public expenditure into line with what we can afford as a country.  All areas of Government will have to manage on a reduced level of resources.  The challenge will be to ensure that the resources that can be provided are used to maximum effect to achieve the best possible outcome for pupils.

This second element will restrict school transport eligibility for those pupils entering in September 2012, to pupils who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school.An analysis by Bus Éireann on the most up to date information available on current school transport usage patterns for schools served with transport under the CSR is advancing. As this second element of the change is not due to be implemented until September 2012 I will carefully examine the likely affects of this change well in advance of the implementation date.It is essential to stress that the wider context within which these changes are taking place, is a situation of the most serious financial difficulties. Under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of €17 million on the school transport budget and these measures, including the ceasing of the closed school rule, are an integral part of this.

In this regard 2 projects at Cork Institute of Technology — the repatriation of apprentices and the passive retrofit of the demonstration area of the 1974 building — constitute binding contractual commitments for which funding is available.Resources are not available to my Department to enable it fund progression of the library project which had been in planning for delivery through the Public Private Partnership process.  Officials from my Department will however be in touch with the National Development Finance Agency to discuss and consider next steps in relation to the work that has been completed to date on this project. The Institute will be advised of the outcome in this matter in due course.

Following consideration of this advice it is my intention to publish the designation criteria and the process arrangements so that Institutes of Technology which are considering proposals for merger and designation can do so on an informed basis.  I expect to be in a position to do this very shortly.  Any proposals for Technological University status will have to be considered in a rigorous fashion against the performance criteria and within the bounds of the agreed process.

It represents the difference between the average cost of a teaching post allocated at a ratio of 19: 1 as against the average cost at a ratio of 20:1, which is estimated at €168.42 per pupil per annum.Grants are not paid by my Department in respect of pupils enrolled in fee-charging schools. A student enrolled in a school in the Free Education scheme would attract per capita grants totalling €661 per annum.  The cost therefore in respect of an individual pupil transfer raised by Deputy is estimated at €829.42 per annum.

My Department does, however, have some relevant information to hand as compiled recently for other purposes. The information in question relates to the following expenditure by my Department and is outlined on four separate tables as follows: a) Expenditure on Consultants in 2010; b) Overall procurement expenditure in 2010; c) Amounts paid to the Department's top 30 suppliers in 2010; and d) Amounts paid to companies that supplied external professional services in 2010 (excluding consultants or contractors engaged in relation to school building projects).It should be noted that the individual tables are not mutually exclusive so that they each may include expenditure that is comprehended within the other tables. While expenditure under different categories can vary from year to year the overall expenditure for 2010 is indicative of the levels of expenditure incurred by my Department annually.  Should the Deputy have a particular interest regarding any of the items listed in these tables or in relation to any other specific category of expenditure, my officials will endeavour to supply further details as far as possible.With regard to the agencies under the aegis of my Department the information requested by the Deputy is not held centrally by my Department. As the information requested is substantial it would take an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	663	I should point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act 2001 and that I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, have no function in this regard.The basis of rateable valuation for all building property is net annual value and is set out in Part 11 of the Valuation Act 2001. Net annual value is the rental for which one year with another, the building might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes and charges (if any) payable by or under any enactment in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant of the property.Various methodologies may be used in estimating the net annual value (NAV/rental value) of a building. The most common methodology used is the comparative method which, as the name implies, employs direct comparison with other similar buildings in the same rating area.In the absence of direct comparative evidence of value two other methods may be used.  The first of these is what is known as the receipts and expenditure method of valuation, where trading accounts are analysed to arrive at the surplus available for rent and rates.  Another method of valuation used from time to time, depending on the particular circumstances and type of building involved, is the contractor's method, which relies on the notional cost of constructing a building and the rental of that building will be related to the annual equivalent of the cost of construction, allowing for depreciation as appropriate, and the value of the site, to arrive at the net annual value.There is also provision in the Act to allow for the valuation of buildings occupied by a public utility undertaking, e.g. an electricity or telecommunication company, to be valued on a global basis, whereby the valuation of all buildings are not valued on an individual basis but are taken as a whole on a nationwide basis and the valuation thus produced is known as a global valuation.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	664	The Heritage Service of the Office of Public Works is responsible for the conservation, care and management of approximately seven-hundred and eighty (780) national monuments that are in State ownership or guardianship. Of these, some fifty (50) monuments and twenty (20) historic properties are presented to the public by way of a dedicated guide service. Many of the sites are open year round, while others open on a seasonal basis. These can be visited by prior arrangement or by contacting an OPW appointed key holder. Information on opening times and the open season at staffed monuments and heritage properties is available on www.heritageireland.com. Many other national monuments that do not have a guide service are freely accessible to the public. Some monuments, however, are situated on privately owned land and do not have public right of access unless with the permission of the landowner. A number of monuments may be closed for a period for the purposes of conservation works.   It is the policy of the Office of Public Works to ensure that as many of the monuments under its care are accessible to the public. A recent initiative to offer free access on one day each month to all monuments at which a charge normally applies has raised public awareness of these sites and has resulted in a significant increase in visitor numbers. With the exception of Cormac's Chapel on the Rock of Cashel and Boyle Abbey where conservation works are in progress and Dublin Castle where improvements to visitor facilities are taking place, it is understood that there have been no further incidents of reduced access to heritage sites.

As an interim arrangement, the Government has decided to extend the current licence held by An Post National Lottery Company by eighteen months to mid-2013 in order to allow time for the holding of a competition for the award of a new licence.It is the Government's intention to use some of the proceeds from any up-front payment to contribute towards the costs of the National Children's Hospital.  The Troika, in the context of regular technical discussions as part of the Programme of Financial Support, have been informed by my officials of the Government's intent on this matter.I intend to present a range of options for the licence to the Government in the New Year.  A decision will then be made about the precise terms and basis on which a competition for the licence will proceed.

These measures include the modelling of the Santry River.Following an assessment of the application, funding of €135,000 for these measures, has been approved.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	668	The work of the Valuation Office is underpinned by The Valuation Act 2001 which provides for the valuation of all commercial and industrial property. The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations for local authority rating is his sole prerogative.  Under the 2001 Act, which came into force on 2nd May, 2002, the basis of valuation for all commercial property is net annual value, i.e. the rental value of the property.A national programme is being rolled out progressively for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties in the country. It aims to provide up-to-date valuations for properties that are subject to local authority rates. It is an important programme, especially given the significant changes in values and rents following the economic downturn of recent years. The revaluation process is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists and in individual ratepayers' rates liabilities.  The purpose of a revaluation is to redistribute commercial rates liabilities among ratepayers based on up-to-date values. Following revaluation, there will be a much closer relationship between rental value and commercial rates liability. Some ratepayers will gain while others will lose from the process of redistribution but, overall, there will be a fairer distribution of the rates burden.The revaluation programme, which has been completed in three County Council areas in Dublin, began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed in 2009 and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown was completed in 2010.  The revaluation of Dublin City Council area was launched on the 5th May 2011 and the Commissioner is currently concluding consultations with local authorities in Waterford and expects to sign valuation orders extending the revaluation programmes to Co. Waterford soon. He has also initiated consultations with the two local authorities in Limerick about extending the revaluation programme to these areas.While the extension of the project to Dublin City earlier this year represents an important advance, after an enforced delay caused by conditions in the property market, the Commissioner has expressed his concern that the present rate of progress may not allow the Office to complete the job nationally within the ten years from 2008 to which the Office previously committed.To address the problem the Valuation Office is taking steps to improve productivity and is looking at new ways and methodologies to accelerate the revaluation.The Commissioner has indicated that, following detailed examination of various possibilities over the past few months, it may be feasible to introduce a Self Assessment approach, accompanied by appropriate controls, and that it might be possible also to outsource some of the work. As well as helping to speed up the national programme, an element of outsourcing, if it proves practicable, would allow comparison of the Valuation Office productivity and costs with those in the private sector.  The enabling provisions to allow for these changes are included in proposals for amending legislation made to me by the Commissioner. Preparatory work is continuing and, subject to the enactment of the legislation and availability of the necessary resources, the intention would be to initiate pilot revaluations in two local authority areas. The Valuation Office is also looking at ways of speeding up the capture of data on properties throughout the country in advance of revaluation in particular areas.My Departmental officials are reviewing the various proposals for modernising and streamlining the valuation process, including the appeal provisions, in the interests of both ratepayers and the local authorities and the speeding up of the revaluation programme. A significant amount of work has already been undertaken and preliminary Heads of Bill have been drafted in conjunction with the Valuation Office and the Attorney General which I hope to bring to Government for approval shortly.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	669	The Valuation Act 2001 provides for the valuation of all commercial and industrial property and the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations for rating is his sole prerogative.  Under the 2001 Act, the basis of valuation for all commercial property is net annual value, i.e. the rental value of the property.  To ensure equity and uniformity, valuation revisions which are set for modified or new properties are determined by references to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list.Under section 28 (4) of the Act, a Revision Officer of the Commissioner may carry out a revision of valuation in relation to a particular property only if a material change of circumstances has occurred such as a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.  The definition does not allow for a revision of valuation where the change in value is due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as roads or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property.Revaluation is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists and in individual ratepayers' rates liabilities.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency to the local authority rating system.  Ideally, occupiers of properties of similar value in the same rating area should have a similar rates liability and, following revaluation, there will be a much closer relationship between rental value and commercial rates liability and this relationship will thereafter be maintained by means of recurring revaluations provided for in the Act.It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally, are deeply embedded in the local government system. Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  All rates collected within a local authority area are spent exclusively in delivering the public services which are required locally to create the environment in which businesses can prosper.  Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation they consider necessary in order to provide the required services.  Rates are a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.  A system having regard to economic factors on an ongoing basis would create uncertainty by providing for continuous change to the valuation base.  Such a system would not provide a stable basis for funding local government and would require significant additional resources to operate.Local authorities have been asked by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to exercise restraint in setting the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) in this and previous years and they have responded positively in this regard.  The Government recognises that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration and is determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency, and contain and reduce costs in the local government sector.My Department is reviewing various provisions of the Valuation Act 2001, including the appeal procedures, with a view to modernising and streamlining the valuation process in the interests of both the ratepayers and the local authorities.  In conjunction with the Valuation Office and the Attorney General, preliminary Heads of Bill have been drafted which I hope to bring to Government shortly for approval.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	670	Prior to an election, it is a statutory requirement that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform prepare a scale of maximum charges for returning officers setting out the approved levels of fees and permissible expenditure in connection with election work.  This includes the fees payable to staff working in polling centres and on the election count.  Once this order is signed, Dáil and Local Returning Officers' can draw down advances for their expenses and, post election, they submit detailed accounts.Local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referendums, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station and count staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law.  It is the responsibility of Returning Officers, who undertake the disbursement of public funds at elections/referendums, to achieve value for money for the services and expenses incurred and to comply with Public Procurement Guidelines as appropriate.The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, whose primary role in electoral matters is to provide an appropriate policy and legislative framework for a modern and efficient electoral system, assists returning officers, by issuing guidance to them in advance of each election and referendum.  The guidance emphasises that the smooth conduct of polls is dependent on maintaining a cadre of sufficiently skilled and experienced people.  Having regard to that overall objective, returning officers are advised to employ competent and efficient persons as polling staff and asked to give consideration, where possible, to employing suitable persons who are unemployed.

Nevertheless, as the Deputy points out, the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the EU/ECB/IMF Funding Programme commits the Government to considering options for an ambitious programme of asset disposals, based on the Programme for Government and the report of the Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities.  In this context, a draft programme of asset disposals must be prepared and submitted to the EU/IMF by end 2011 for discussion with the Troika in 2012 in advance of final decisions being taken by the Government on how to proceed.Once the Government's plans are finalised, the House will be fully briefed on the matter.

However, the moratorium allows for certain limited exceptions to its provisions where it has been established that the skills sought are not available within the public service.  Taking account of the merits a business case submitted to my Department, sanction may be given for the recruitment of outside experts.

In general, there is currently no central agreement to allow Technical and Professional Grades to compete for General Service positions, and vice versa, but access to recruitment competitions is open to all suitably qualified candidates.I am in favour of providing the widest possible candidate pool for posts in the Civil Service and it is my intention to seek progress in this area under the provisions of the Croke Park Agreement.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	679	On 17 November last, I announced several key developments relating to Public Service Reform and published the Government's Public Service Reform Plan which sets the basis for the comprehensive and strategic reform of the Public Service in the coming years.  The challenging fiscal position which we face means that far-reaching reform of the Public Service is essential in order to ensure it is customer-focused, leaner, more efficient, better integrated and delivering maximum value for money.The most significant element of the savings that will be realised from the Reform Plan is the preservation of critical front line services in tandem with a very significant reduction in Public Service numbers over the coming years.  By 2015, we expect to achieve a planned reduction of 37,500 staff, or 12%, since 2008.  In total, the Government are expecting the gross Public Service pay bill to reduce by some €2.5 billion to €14.5 billion (i.e. a 15% drop since 2008).  Detailed Employment Control Frameworks for the coming years, including for 2012, will be announced next week.  A key aspect of the reform programme is that it will enable us to continue to provide quality services notwithstanding the substantial reduction in Public Service numbers and resources.While the reduction in Public Service numbers will reduce costs significantly, it will also necessitate major reform in all sectors. In this context, the effective implementation of the Croke Park Agreement, and in particular the redeployment arrangements, will be crucial to the success of the reform initiative.  This will allow increasingly limited staff resources to be directed to the areas of most strategic importance. At the same time, the envisaged re-engineering of structures, systems and services will mean that the Public Service will be able to continue to deliver quality services with reduced numbers.Other examples of elements of the Reform Plan where cost savings will be achieved include the increased use of shared services in all sectors which will mean that fewer staff and financial resources are required to perform common business functions as duplication is eliminated.  The innovative use of ICTs across the Public Service will improve service delivery and reduce costs, particularly when combined with business process improvement.  The analysis and improvement of business processes will be important to reduce the human and other resources required by organisations to undertake certain functions and provide services.  Procurement reform is also a key target for cost savings.  Framework arrangements that are already in place have maximised volume discounts and provided for reductions in administrative and transaction costs for suppliers and for State bodies.  Procurement savings amounted to €30 million in 2009, €40 million in 2010 with €50 million targeted for 2011.  Ongoing savings are projected for future years including 2012.  I also announced details of a new and expanded programme of State Agency rationalisation which will deliver enhanced service efficiencies, together with ensuring a more focused and democratically accountable Public Service.  Rationalisation and effective management of the State's property portfolio, done in a strategic and integrated manner, will also allow the Public Service to maximise value-for-money from its footprint.These are just some of the main areas where savings will be achieved and they will help ensure that Departments stay within the 2012 allocations, which I will announce next Monday, 5 December.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	686	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest relevant sector-based information available on employees taxed under the PAYE system is derived from income tax returns filed for the income tax year 2009 and represents about 96 per cent of all returns expected at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes.  The figures include PAYE taxpayers who are required to return an income tax return Form 11 where non-PAYE income is greater than €3,174, and do not segregate earnings from public sources and those from other sources.  Therefore, the earnings figures shown may include income from non-public-sector sources.The data also include various forms of income from public sources to groups that would not normally be regarded as being employed within the public service, e.g. those receiving fees, those on State Boards etc.  On the basis of the available tax-based data it is not possible to identify and exclude income from public sources to groups that would not normally be regarded as employed within the public service or to distinguish the earnings of employees associated with atypical work patterns.  Accordingly, it is likely that the number of lower paid public servants is overstated.  On this basis the total numbers of public sector employees, and the breakdown of those numbers by income ranges, is set out as follows:Income Tax Year 2009 Range of Gross incomePublic Sector Employees Total Number€0 — €20,000105,745€20,001 — €40,000143,919€40,001 — €60,000102,676€60,001 — €80,00040,941€80,001 — €100,00018,117Over €100,00017,447Totals428,845The earnings data in the table relate to 2009 and do not reflect the pay reduction introduced for public servants from January 2010 (ranging from 5% to 20%) or the subsequent measures introduced by the current Government further reducing the pay of Office Holders and introducing a general pay ceiling of €200,000 for future appointments to higher positions across the public service, a general pay ceiling of €250,000 for future appointments to CEO posts within Commercial State Companies and a voluntary waiver system of up to 15% for current post holders who have salaries in excess of the relevant pay ceiling.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	687	Since 2009, the National Procurement Service (NPS) has been responsible for producing annual statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold procurement activity by the Irish public sector and providing these statistics to the European Commission.  Current thresholds (valid from January 2010 to December 2011) above which tenders must be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) are as follows:Works:Contract Notice€4,845,000Threshold applies to Government Departments and Offices, Local and Regional Authorities and other public bodies.Supplies and Services:Contract Notice€125,000Threshold applies to Government Departments and OfficesContract Notice€193,000Threshold applies to Local and Regional Authorities and public bodies outside the Utilities sector.Utilities:Works Contracts / Prior Indicative Notice€4,845,000For entities in Utilities sectors covered by GPASupplies and Services€387,000For entities in Utilities sectors covered by GPAInformation on contract placement is available currently for the years 2008-2010 relates to above-EU threshold contracts only and is contained in the tabular statement below. Data in respect of 2011 will not be available until the third quarter 2012 as this data is collated a year in arrears.  The Deputy should be aware that the figures contained in the table relates to the number of contracts placed which were above the EU Threshold for the year in question and must not be interpreted as indicative statistics for the overall procurement spend.  It must also be borne in mind that these statistics relate only to above threshold procurements, where contract award notices were published, and where the nationality of the winning tenderer was disclosed.For example, when considering the year 2009, €2.8 billion worth of expenditure was advertised in the Official Journal, out of the €15 billion public procurement spend in that year.  The NPS estimates that less than 5% of the overall spend went to non-domestic suppliers, as a significant proportion of the overall procurement spend is below the EU threshold and is also below the threshold for advertising on eTenders (the eTenders threshold was €50,000 in 2009).It should be noted also that all the statistics relating to non-domestic suppliers relate to suppliers with an address in countries other than Ireland and do not distinguish between European and non-European suppliers.201020092008No. of ContractsValue€000No. of ContractsValue€000No. of ContractsValue€000Irish Suppliers6903,001,2187772,537,62210164,217,564Non-Domestic Suppliers102285,183170347,137296568,338Total7923,286,4019472,884,75913124,785,902

The nineteenth century church is located within the boundary of the thirteenth century church. Both churches are situated within a walled graveyard. The thirteenth century church is a national monument in State ownership, and is under the care of the Office of Public Works. The nineteenth century church building and graveyard are in private ownership. There is no public access to either the church or the graveyard. OPW has access to the thirteenth century church for the purpose of carrying out maintenance and repair work.A caretaker is paid by OPW whose primary duty is to report damage or interference to the national monument at St Mary's, Thomastown. The role of the caretaker did not include the provision of public access. At present, there is no access for visitors except by arrangement with the owner. The site was last inspected by OPW on 26 May 2011. Routine maintenance was carried out on 26 and 30 May 2011. The site was inspected by OPW prior to response given to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to the planning application to convert the nineteenth century church into a private dwelling.

Additionally, CMOD has put in place a number of central systems, infrastructures and drawdown facilities. All of these arrangements have resulted in significantly lower costs for public bodies (ranging from 20% to 70% of prevailing prices) and considerably reduced the administrative burdens that would otherwise arise with individual procurement efforts.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21443	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	691	I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 216 together.My Department provides funding to the enterprise development agencies under its aegis, including Enterprise Ireland and the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.Enterprise Ireland is always available to support new innovative business propositions that have the potential to generate employment and grow sales on international markets.  Enterprise Ireland has a structured series of supports to assist the new entrepreneur to:Validate the business proposition.  The agency gives advice to promoters to help them to formulate an outline plan for a business that has the potential to develop to a significant scale.Get to investment-ready. The agency provides feasibility grants and mentor supports to assist new businesses to get to the initial funding round.Raise the initial investment required.  The agency makes equity investments into new businesses by co-investing with the promoters and the private sector in the initial funding round.Full details of the supports available are on the Enterprise Ireland website at: www.enterprise-ireland.com/en
I understand that the project referred to by the Deputy is located in South Cork.  In this region the South Cork Enterprise Board is available to provide a source of support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing micro-enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of priming, expansion/development and feasibility/innovation grants.  Whilst not all businesses will be eligible for financial assistance, the CEBs also deliver non-financial supports such as one-to-one mentoring and a range of business advice and training programmes to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow, which may be available as appropriate to the needs of the promoter's business.Specifically in relation to the project referred to by the Deputy, I am informed that the South Cork Enterprise Board met with the promoter in 2010 to discuss the project invention. The Board did offer mentoring assistance with the view that the promoters might develop the concept into a full application for CEB support.  However, this offer was not taken up and the promoters have not been in contact with the Board since.  I would therefore suggest that the promoters maintain contact with their local CEB as appropriate to explore the options available to assist their business as it develops.  The contact details for the South Cork Enterprise Board which is located at Unit 6a, South Ring Business Park, Kinsale Road, Cork are as follows:  Phone No: 021-497 5281;   Fax No: 021-497 5287;   E-mail: enterprise@sceb.ie;   Website: www.sceb.ie.

Several of these submissions contained legal arguments in regard to the issue as well as comments in respect of the draft statutory instrument which was published as part of the consultation process.  These comments were forwarded by my Department to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration.I consider that there is further work to be done on the issue between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General and I want to give this matter the fullest consideration.  It is an issue on which there is interaction between rights holders, the internet service providers (ISPS) and the end users, of whom there are millions.  We must ensure that we get the balance right and that the legislation is correct in this area.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21443	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I am aware of the issues raised by the Deputy.  As mentioned in previous replies on this matter, and following targeted enforcement campaigns in relation to friendly societies and trade unions, the Registry of Friendly Societies intends to instigate a similar programme in respect of Industrial and Provident societies.The reference by the Deputy to Rule 16(e) relates to the model rules for co-operative societies set down by the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society.  The role of the Registry of Friendly Societies is to register the rules of societies.  Enforcement of an individual society's rules is a matter for that society, not for the Registrar.Section 14 of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893 provides for the filing of annual returns, while Section 9 of the same Act provides for the cancellation of societies in certain circumstances, including wilful violation of the provisions of the Act.  While Ministerial approval is required in certain circumstances for the cancellation of societies, the power of initiation of such cancellation rests with the Registrar of Friendly Societies.Cancellation of the registration of a society is a serious matter, and the legislation provides that any appeal must be made to the High Court (which can involve significant cost).  In this regard, in the context of consultations on reform of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, I indicated earlier this year that I propose to bring forward legislation aimed at addressing particular issues which have been identified in the co-operative sector, including the issue of restoration of cancelled societies to the register.  This draft legislation is currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, and I hope to publish a Bill in 2012.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21443	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	695	While individual contracts fall within the area of private law, in general a contract of employment may not be set aside without the agreement of the parties involved.  In most circumstances, parties to a contract of employment irrespective of the length of employment, are required to negotiate and agree changes to that contract before it can be binding on both parties.  (Exceptions can arise, however, in the cases of employees covered by Registered Employment Agreements which have been negotiated and agreed between employer and employee representative bodies.  Once agreed, the terms and conditions are binding on those that are party to such agreements.   However, there is nothing in the information provided to suggest that the issue of concern to the Deputy falls within the scope of a Registered Employment Agreement).In the case of agency workers the contract of employment is between the agency and the worker, other than for the purpose of the Unfair Dismissals Act.  The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973-2001 prescribes minimum terms of notice as set out on the schedule included with this reply.An employee who has not received the minimum statutory notice is entitled to make a complaint to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Davitt House, 65A Adelaide Road, Dublin 2.The Redundancy Payments Act, 1967-2007 also provides that in order to qualify for statutory redundancy an employee must have been employed in insurable employment for a minimum period of two years.  Access to redress under the Unfair Dismissal Act, 1977-2007 requires that the employee be employed for a minimum one year.Period of ServiceMinimum Notice Required13 weeks but  less than 2 years serviceone week noticetwo years but less than five yearstwo weeks noticefive years but less than ten yearsfour weeks noticeten years but less than  fifteen yearssix weeks noticemore than fifteen yearseight weeks notice
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21443	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	696	The primary responsibility for preventing the sale of event tickets at prices above their face value rests with the ticket agents and promoters.  The terms and conditions governing the sale of such tickets commonly provide that, if the ticket is resold for profit, it is voidable and the holder may be refused entry to the venue. Ticket agents also typically reserve the right to cancel tickets advertised or published in a manner consistent with the intent to resell them for profit. Effective enforcement of these terms and conditions would go a long way towards stopping the resale of event tickets at the exorbitant prices referred to by the Deputy.Though legislative intervention should not be entirely ruled out if other approaches prove ineffective, such legislation would give rise to a number of issues.  A significant proportion of ticket resales appear to be undertaken by private sellers through online auction platforms.  It is open to question if criminalising the activities of such individuals would represent an appropriate or proportionate policy response, or would constitute an effective use of the limited resources available for the enforcement of consumer protection provisions. Though this consideration does not apply to the activities of businesses engaged in secondary ticket resale, the online nature of these activities means that a legislative prohibition in one jurisdiction may simply lead such businesses to relocate elsewhere.

The availability of these incubator spaces is of particular relevance to those Irish companies establishing a sales presence on the West Coast of the US.Enterprise Ireland is interested in all proposals that can add value to Irish companies on the US West Coast.  In this context EI continue to evaluate the services of Plug & Play and direct EI clients to their facilities if they can help the client through accelerating their time to market, commercialisation or acquisition of VC Funding.Through its office in Mountain View, the agency has an ongoing relationship with the Plug & Play organisation and has, for a number of years, recommended that Irish companies looking to incubate or source funding from Silicon Valley sources meet with them, among others.Plug & Play's offer is highly sophisticated, and it is the largest incubator player in Silicon Valley.  Plug & Play is also a significant investor in current and past tenants and I understand that its proposal is aimed at nations or regions that do not have either a Trade Office or an Embassy Trade Attaché function in Silicon Valley.  Enterprise Ireland already provide a significant amount of the commercialisation, mentoring, signposting and VC connections that would otherwise be part of the Plug & Play Proposal.US venture capital participation can be demanding, and may require a company placing its CEO or CIO into the US for an extended period, something Irish companies can rarely afford or want.  Plug & Play has a vested interest in identifying, mentoring, fostering and ultimately investing in Irish Software companies that it would take into an International Programme.  Therefore, the Plug & Play proposal may not be appropriate for all Irish companies.I know that Deputy Murphy has already been in contact with Enterprise Ireland's office in Silicon Valley and they would be happy to engage further with him as appropriate on this matter.

The Committee has met to consider comments and suggestions which were received as a result of the public consultation on the proposed new Irish Standard.Subject to final considerations, it is expected that the new standard will be ready for publication during Q1 2012 at which stage it is intended that public awareness of window blind safety will be raised again.While standards alone cannot save lives, they provide requirements and information to manufacturers and suppliers on safety requirements of blind cords and chains and  provide guidance for parents and householders on the retrofitting of safety devices in their homes. Such actions taken together can contribute to increased safety. The buy-in of manufacturers and suppliers is important and the fact that a number were represented on the National Committee is expected to contribute towards this objective.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21443	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	702	In seeking to provide the Deputy with the information requested, the assumption has been made that the question relates to civil proceedings taken by or against the Department or one of its offices.The Deputy should be aware that a number of Offices within my Department's remit institute proceedings against companies and individuals in the exercise of their statutory functions and these are carried out on my behalf.  For instance, the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) engages in civil enforcement cases where a person has either a determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal or a decision from the Rights Commissioner that has not been honoured and, NERA will pursue the debt for the individual to whom it is owed. NERA would have approximately 60-70 of these type of cases annually of which approximately 10-15 would proceed through the Court System.  It would not be usual that a confidentially clause would attach in such cases.  Similarly, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement initiates judicial proceedings in pursuance of the exercise of its statutory functions.In the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions, the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) hears both parties to an employment dispute e.g. Unfair Dismissal and issues a determination following the hearing.  Depending on the legislation involved in the claim, it is possible for either party to the original EAT case to appeal either to the Circuit Court or to the High Court on a point of law.  It is also possible for either party to apply to judicially review a decision.  In such instances, the cases would normally run their course through the appeals process and be subject to a decision of the relevant Court which may overturn the original EAT decision and involve an award of costs against the EAT.In terms of in and out of courts settlements made by my Department or its offices in the last 10 years, records indicate that eight such settlements were made in that period.  In the time available, it has not been possible to obtain the details of one case settled in 2005.  In the case of the other seven cases, all bar one had a confidentiality clause attached.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to release details of the settlement costs in these cases but they were in the nature of legal costs.  The settlement in the case that had no confidentiality clause was for an amount of €344,175.A further area in which there may be some information of interest to the Deputy is in relation to cases against the Department in respect of Health and Safety claims.   Under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000, the management of personal injury and property damage claims against the State, including this Department, and of the underlying risks was delegated to the NTMA. When performing these functions, the NTMA is known as the State Claims Agency.The Agency has resolved approximately 10,650 claims since its inception; however, claims-specific data for my Department is not, within the time constraints for reply, available.  The SCA has been asked to provide this detailed information as soon as possible and, if this is of interest to the Deputy, this information can be passed to him.The number of court settlements made by the Agencies of my Department is a day-to-day matter for the Agencies concerned for which I have no responsibility. In this connection, I have asked that the relevant information be provided to you directly.

IDA Ireland's Head Office is located in Dublin and the Agency has a number of regional offices throughout the country as well as a network of marketing offices globally.  IDA Ireland decides where it needs its resources in order that it can meet its strategic goals.I am informed by IDA Ireland that the Agency continues to retain an office in Cavan, with one full time employee concentrating on client facing activities.The North East Region has one Gateway location at Dundalk and two Hub locations at Cavan and Monaghan, and as such will continue to be a key location of focus for the winning of FDI. The North East Region has 34 IDA supported companies, employing approximately 2,781 people. Of these:—  Cavan has 5 IDA supported companies, employing approximately 1,119 people; and—  Monaghan has 6 IDA supported companies employing approximately 418 people.I have every confidence in the abilities of IDA Ireland's Board and senior management team to manage the resources available to it so as to enable the Agency to continue to win FDI for this country even in the face of the most difficult economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.

Notwithstanding the positions of the Department in rejecting that liability for these costs falls to be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department, and the unions representing CE supervisors.  In the event that funding was required from FÁS, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and ongoing fiscal environment and the requirement to contain and reduce public expenditure.  The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of €3m per annum with retrospective costs of the order of at least €30m.The Deputy should also note that FÁS is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants.  Neither was FÁS a party to the Labour Court dispute on this matter.  The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations and the individuals concerned must also be recognised when considering pension provision arrangements.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	706	The Pensions Act sets out the order in which the assets of a pension scheme must be applied in the event of a scheme wind-up.  The statutory order of priority is of no consequence where a scheme winds up with sufficient assets to meet all of its liabilities.  In a wind-up situation, all benefits to pensioners except provision for post retirement increases are given the highest priority after wind-up expenses and additional voluntary contributions made by individuals.  Any remaining assets are then divided according to the accrued liabilities amongst active and deferred scheme members.  However, if a scheme is under-funded, the remaining assets may not be sufficient to meet the liabilities of the active and deferred members.    In some cases they may receive little or nothing after the commitments to existing pensioners have been satisfied.  In this context a scheme member who is close to retirement age could have their expected benefits significantly reduced.  The change being brought forward by Government is designed to provide for a more equitable distribution of scheme assets where an under-funded pension scheme winds-up.Subject to further detailed drafting considerations, the proposed amendment to the Pensions Act will:Continue to prioritise existing pensions and ensure that they receive their benefits, but only up to a level of €30,000, or 75% of expected benefits whichever is the lower.Assets in the scheme would then be distributed among active and deferred members to the same limits.Pensioners would then get priority in the distribution of the remaining assets before any further assets are distributed to active and deferred scheme members.All schemes are different and applying these priorities will have different impacts.  In the case of most pension schemes, where pensions are integrated with social welfare pensions, the effect of a percentage reduction in pensioner benefits will not have the effect of reducing their total remuneration by that same percentage.  For example, in a situation where the State contributory pension is worth €12,000 and a pensioner receives €15,000 from the occupational pension, the effect of a 25% reduction of the occupational pension would be as follows:Full pension  : €12,000 + €15,000 = €27,00075% pension  : €12,000 + €11,250 = €23,250 (86% of full pension)In this regard, capping pensions at 75% of benefits does not translate into a 25% reduction in pension payable, given the effect of integration of the State pensionThe approach that will be adopted will ensure that in the event of a scheme winding up in deficit, the current balance will be tilted so that active and deferred members will receive a greater proportion of their expected benefit that they would otherwise, while ensuring that pensioners are still protected.

A 1% increase in the rate of employer PRSI would yield approximately €535 million.An equivalent 0.5% increase in the rate of PRSI paid by employees from 4% to 4.5% would yield an additional €206 million in a full year.  The estimated yield for the Social Insurance fund of a 1% rate increase in employees' PRSI is €413 million.

However, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.The figure of €483m refers to the Department's control savings in 2010 while the figure of €25.9 million refers to fraud or suspected fraud overpayments in 2010.Control savings are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment.  These savings represent an estimate of the value of prevented expenditure on fraudulent claims over a future period.  Control savings are not actual monies recovered by the Department but are a good indication of the increase in social welfare expenditure that would occur without these activities taking place.  These savings arise as a result of control activity on claims in payment, which result in claims being reduced or stopped, and from inspections of employers.  These activities also have deterrent or knock-on effects, which are not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.Actual monies recovered arise where the Department assesses overpayments in individual cases and subsequently recovers those debts.  Where, following a review of a claim in payment, it is confirmed that the customer had been receiving a payment to which they were not entitled, or were receiving a payment at a higher rate than they were entitled, a deciding officer makes a revised decision on the entitlement.  Deciding officers decide the effective date of a revised decision having regard to the new facts or new evidence and the circumstances of the case.  This can result in the assessment of an overpayment.Fraud overpayment cases arise mainly on foot of false declarations by customers concerning their employment, income or family status.  In 2010, total overpayments amounted to €83.4m representing 0.41% of total Departmental expenditure.  Overpayments arising from activity suspected as fraudulent amounted to €25.9m in 2010.The Department is fully committed to recovering 100% of overpayments arising as a result of suspected fraud or error.  Effective debt recovery is seen as an integral part of the deterrent to fraudulent claiming.  Debt holders should be aware that a debt owing to my Department will remain on their records until fully recovered.  This will result in a reduction of all future entitlements up to and including state pension.  Following the death of a customer who owes a debt, the Department has a claim on any estate remaining. Persons who have a debt and who are no longer dependent on social welfare are required to repay this debt as quickly as possible. The Department actively pursues the recovery of all overpayments including the initiation of civil proceedings where appropriate.The Deputy should note that I recently launched a new Fraud Initiative (2011-2013) which is aimed at putting in place a range of actions to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to ensure there is public confidence and trust in the system.  As Minister, I am very conscious of the need to protect public money and I am determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.

While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work over the course of the next few years.  The measures referred to encourage young jobseeker's to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.The €100 rate of jobseeker's allowance was introduced for claimants aged under 20 in April 2009 and this rate was applied to claimants aged up to 21, with a €150 rate applying to claimants aged 22-24, from 31 December, 2009.  The extension of the measures reflected the need to encourage more young jobseeker's to improve their skills by either pursuing further study or accessing a labour market programme.There are a wide range of education and training opportunities available to jobseeker's through my Department and the Department of Education and Skills to support them in strengthening their qualifications and skills base and thereby maximising their chances of meeting the requirements of the modern labour market and gaining employment.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	722	The question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay (SSP)  is being considered as a means of bringing Ireland's approach to the management of  illness related work absences into line with the rest of Europe and other OECD countries.  Studies undertaken by the OECD indicate that Ireland is one of the very few countries that does not oblige employers to cover some element of sick absence pay notwithstanding that our employer PRSI contribution rates are also among the lowest in Western economies.  SSP is also one of a range of options being examined with a view to addressing the significant deficit in the social insurance fund and meeting the commitments which this country has entered into with the EU/IMF/ECB to achieve substantial reductions in current spending.The Deputy should note that experience of SSP in countries where it has been introduced indicates that it has a positive role to play in reducing absenteeism rates and the transition of employees from short term sick absence to longer term disability absence.  These outcomes are positive for the individuals concerned, their employers and society.A preliminary analysis based on estimates of absenteeism indicates that if a sick pay scheme with a duration of four weeks were to be introduced, it would add an average of between €1- €2 per employee per week to the costs of employment.I am, of course, deeply conscious of the pressures faced by many employers, including those in the retail sector, and any statutory sick pay scheme would seek to take account of those concerns to the greatest extent possible.

For example many of the constituent programmes and functions have already transferred to the Department; the Rural Social Scheme and Community Services Programme has transferred from the Department of Community, Equality and the Gaeltacht; the Redundancy and Insolvency Schemes have transferred from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation; the Community Welfare Service (CWS) formally transferred to the Department on the 1st of October; and the Employment Services and Community Employment Programmes of FÁS will transfer on schedule on the 1st of January 2012.I  am determined that progress to transform the combined operations of the organisations outlined above into a new integrated service will be made in the most expeditious manner possible and my officials are already actively engaged in a programme of work towards this end.As the Deputy will be aware a major transformation programme is now under way following the approval by the Government of a detailed project plan for the development of the NEES in July and the publication of this plan in August.  The project plan outlines key tasks, milestones and a detailed schedule of work from now until 2014.  This project plan is available on the Department's website at www.welfare.ie.It should be noted that policy responsibility for skills training undertaken by FÁS currently resides with the Department of Education and Skills.  The future development of the training and skills services of FÁS is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.

Expenditure on child benefit for 2011 is estimated at €2.08 billion in respect of some 1.133 million children.  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment.  The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment.  Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household's income situation.I have announced no plans to implement means-testing or income-testing of child benefit at this time.  If the Government decided in principle to progress on these lines, there are many policy, legislative and administrative issues that would have to be addressed. These include:From a policy perspective, detailed assessment would have to be given to a number of key questions such as the appropriate treatment of different types of income, cut-off points for family income and rates of benefit withdrawal;Furthermore, consideration would also need to be given to the likely consequences of income or means-testing child benefit, as there is the potential for very significant disincentive effects for income earners as it would add to reduce the return from higher earnings;Means testing of child benefit would address only one of the main child income support payments and a clear policy direction would have to be considered to ensure a consistent approach with other income-related payments; andFrom an administrative perspective, a new mechanism for assembling household income would have to be put in place with very considerable administrative consequences.  These would include ensuring that systems are in place to ensure that households only claimed benefits to which they were entitled, as the scale of means testing approximately 600,000 families would be significantly greater than anything required by the current social protection system in terms of means tested payments.This raises complex issues about the purpose and effectiveness of the full range of income supports provided through the social protection system.  In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established in June of this year an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to consider issues around these and a number of other matters.  The issue of family and child income supports is currently being examined by the Group which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes.In the circumstances, any reforms in this area should comprehensively address the broader range of issues raised before the Government decides on how to proceed for the future.

The Partial Capacity Benefit scheme will be open to people who are in receipt of Invalidity Pension (IP) or who have been in receipt of Illness Benefit (IB) for a minimum of six months.  Participation in the scheme will be voluntary and the scheme is designed in particular to respond to the needs of people who currently seek to avail of ‘exemptions' in order to take up employment opportunities.  The limitations on hours worked which apply under the existing ‘exemptions' arrangements will not apply to the new scheme.The introduction of the Partial Capacity scheme will mark a key development of the social welfare system.  The scheme recognises that the current structure of the welfare system, which categorises people as ‘fit to work' or ‘unfit to work', does not reflect the reality for many existing welfare customers.  It will provide an opportunity for people with disabilities, and assessed to have an employment capacity which is restricted when compared to the norm, to avail of employment opportunities while continuing to receive an income support payment.Full details of the scheme will be set out when the scheme is being formally launched before the end of this year.

However, once the child reaches 16 years old and no longer qualifies for domiciliary care allowance, the carer's allowance application is reviewed to ensure that the person continues to satisfy all the conditions for the receipt of carer's allowance.In this regard, the person in question has been requested to submit up-to-date medical evidence relating to the care recipient in order that her application may be reviewed.  Once the medical evidence has been received and the person's continuing entitlement has been reviewed by a deciding officer, a decision will be made and the person will be notified directly of the outcome.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	741	Issues associated with the creation of employment opportunities are for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the first instance. However, as part of the overall Government approach to unemployment, the Department of Social Protection operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.These include the back to education allowance scheme, employer job (PRSI) incentive scheme, Tús — the new community work placement initiative, JobBridge — the National Internship Scheme, and a network of Facilitators at a local level who work with social welfare recipients to identify appropriate training or development programmes for them. In addition, from July 2, the rate of employers PRSI on jobs paying up to €356 per week has been halved to 4.25%, up to end 2013. These measures support people who are unemployed in acquiring the education and skills and work experience that will assist them in returning to employment while measures such as the PRSI reduction will encourage employers to new employment.In this context it may be noted that, despite the rise in the number of long-term unemployed, for many unemployed people unemployment is a short-term experience. Significant numbers of people leave the live register for work and for other reasons. For example, 58,813 people left the live register in September 2011 with 22,694 of these leaving to take up employment.The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the live register.  It provides an opportunity to explore and access, under professional guidance, a full range of employment and training services.  Development of the NEAP is central to ongoing development in the labour market policy area and will be progressed within the framework of a new National Employment and Entitlements Service which, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is being established by the Department.  The new service will integrate employment and benefit payment services, currently delivered by FÁS and the Department, respectively,  within the Department and will be based on a case management approach with the objective of providing a more customised and personal service to customers, at regional and local level.The introduction of further measures with regard to unemployment would be for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.

This initiative is being delivered through the network of local development companies nationally and by Údarás na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas — referred to as Implementing Bodies.Expressions of interest and applications from community organisations wishing to offer work placement opportunities are managed at local level with the relevant Implementing Body.  I have had enquires made with respect to this matter and I am advised that the community group concerned has made a request for a Tús participant to North East Mayo LEADER Partnership Company.  Unfortunately, due the particular skill set requested by the group, the Implementing Body has not been able to identify a person with the requisite skill set.  The Implementing Body has informed me that it will maintain contact with the group to support its operations.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The average time taken to award a claim for carer's allowance to end Sept 2011 was 14 weeks.  A total of 15,514 applications were registered to end Oct 2011 and 11,684 were processed in the same period. Some 7,935 applications are awaiting a decision at present. Approximately 51,000 carer's allowance claims are in payment.  I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer's allowance claims is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate steps to resolve the situation.In particular, a major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme.  This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation. It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer. Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department, which has had, however, a short-term negative impact on claim processing times. The first tranche of new carer's allowance claims began to be processed under the new system in August 2011. While the new systems and processes will facilitate a significant improvement in overall processing times, it should be noted that the intake of new carer's allowance applications continues to increase and that individual claims may continue to take some time to process. Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on satisfying medical, means and residency conditions. In determining entitlement to the allowance, in certain cases unavoidable time lags are involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made. Delays can also arise if those applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed with regard to the workload. The Department monitors available resources against workload on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring claims are processed as quickly as possible. The action taken may include providing for flexibility in the application of staff resources in accordance with seasonal or temporary fluctuations in workload and using overtime where appropriate. The position is being kept under continuous review. In the meantime, if a person's means are insufficient to meet his or her needs while awaiting a decision on a claim, he or she can apply for a means tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from his or her community welfare officer.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	753	The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the country. It is essential to ensure that state support for rent supplement tenants, who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices with particular negative impact on those tenants on lower incomes, including those who are in low paid employment.Staff administering rent supplement have the authority to set levels lower than those provided for in the regulations, in respect of sub-divisions of their functional areas, where this is appropriate. This allows for lower rent levels to apply in certain locations within counties reflecting local market conditions. Under normal circumstances rent supplement is not paid where the rent charged for the accommodation is above the relevant maximum rent limit. However, staff do have some flexibility around making payment above these limits.The most recent rent limit review established new maximum rent limits from June 2010 and I am satisfied that the rent limits are sufficient to enable eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation.The current rent limits will remain in force until December 2011 and will be reviewed later this year with a view to establishing new rent limits. The review will be based on analysis of data sets available to the Department on private rental prices within the state. This will include information supplied by the Central Statistics Office, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and other publicly available data sources.The person who is living in County Meath, is in receipt of Supplementary Welfare Allowance, and is claiming rent supplement.  The maximum rate of rent in respect of which a rent supplement is payable for a couple with two children living in County Meath is €700 per month.  Taking account of the minimum contribution applicable to a person in receipt of Supplementary Welfare Allowance, the maximum rate of rent supplement payable in this case is €137.50 per week.  However, as an exceptional measure, the person has been awarded rent supplement of €170.15 per week for a period of 13 weeks, to allow time for the person to find alternative accommodation at a rent that does not exceed the maximum rate allowable, or to re-negotiate the rent with the landlord.  The maximum rent limits for each county is set in legislation (Statutory Instrument Number 295/2010).  The limits are set in accordance with county boundaries, and not postal districts.

Basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance has the lowest maximum personal primary payment rate in the social welfare system, currently €186.00 per week.  The maximum personal rate in other schemes ranges from €188.00 to €239.00.  These payments include weekly paid income support schemes such as state pensions, jobseeker's payments, illness, and disability and caring payments.Some 1.4 million people receive a primary weekly social welfare payment.  When qualified adults and qualified children are included, almost 2.1 million people benefit from these weekly payments.The Department pays out a range of other payments on a weekly or less frequent basis.  These are paid in addition to the primary income support payments mentioned above at levels that are below the lowest maximum personal payment rate.  Accordingly, those payments are considered secondary, or non-primary, in nature.

This will benefit some 390,000 people on household benefits and 375,000 on the fuel allowance compared with 2005 when there were 325,000 people on household benefits and 265,000 on the fuel allowance at a cost of €280 million.  The costs have almost doubled in six years while the number of customers has risen by more than 20%.  The Department is covering the cost of the price increases in electricity which came into effect from 1st October.  The electricity allowance, which was €35.80 per month, has increased to €39.40.  These price increases will cost the Department over €4 million in 2011 and €17.3 million in a full year.Difficult decisions had to be made in light of the existing economic situation and commitments made by the previous government.  A number of measures for savings in 2011 and future years were specified as part of Budget 2011 but were not announced by the Government at the time.  These included a saving of €30 million in the energy and telephone elements of the household benefits package in 2011 and subsequent years.  They also included the abolition of the smokeless fuel allowance with a saving of €7.7 million in 2011 and €17.5 million in subsequent years.  The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance were reduced from 2,400 to 1,800 with a view to generating savings of €17 million in 2011 and €65 million annually.The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources published Warmer Homes: A Strategy for Affordable Energy this week setting out a vision for improving the affordability of energy for low-income households.  The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty is to reduce consumption of energy through improving the home's thermal efficiency.  Sustainable Energy Ireland has administered the Warmer Homes programme for privately owned low-income households since 2001, benefitting 65,000 households, with a further 15,000 to receive upgrades this year.  A similar programme is in place for local authority houses.All schemes of the Department of Social Protection are being examined in the context of the forthcoming Budget and no final decisions have been made in relation to welfare expenditure for next year.  These decisions will be made, after full consideration, by the Government and will be announced on Budget day.

The calculation of such value is based on the level of parental net income.  Parental income is calculated as gross income less tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge, superannuation and union dues.  Rent or mortgage repayments are disregarded, where appropriate, and a parental allowance of €600 per week per couple plus €50 per week in respect of other dependent children applies.  The balance is assessed at 34% and this constitutes the weekly value of benefit and privilege.Once the person concerned reaches 25 years of age, the value of any benefit and privilege will no longer be regarded as means.  Any changes to the current arrangements will be considered in the context of budget 2012 and subsequent Budgets.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	769	The question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay (SSP) is being considered as a means of bringing Ireland's approach to the management of illness related work absences into line with the rest of Europe and other OECD countries.  Studies undertaken by the OECD indicate that Ireland is one of the very few countries that does not oblige employers to cover some element of sick absence pay notwithstanding that our employer PRSI contribution rates are also among the lowest in Western economies.  SSP is also one of a range of options being examined with a view to addressing the significant deficit in the social insurance fund and meeting the commitments which this country has entered into with the EU/IMF/ECB to achieve substantial reductions in current spending.The Deputy should note that experience of SSP in countries where it has been introduced indicates that it has a positive role to play in reducing absenteeism rates and the transition of employees from short term sick absence to longer term disability absence.  These outcomes are positive for the individuals concerned, their employers and society.I am, of course, deeply conscious of the pressures faced by many employers, including those in the retail sector, and any statutory sick pay scheme would seek to take account of those concerns to the greatest extent possible.

Processing of applications on hand has been slower than anticipated due to capacity constraints in undertaking the conveyance work involved.On 15 of April this year, the Government made a number of decisions in relation to turf cutting in Ireland, including the putting in place of a compensation package for those who are required to cease cutting, the establishment of a Peatlands Council and the drawing up of a national strategy on peatland conservation and management.  In the context of the national strategy, the position regarding raised bog Natural Heritage Areas, which are protected under national legislation, and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive will be examined in advance of the 2014 cutting season.The land referred to by the Deputy was designated in 2004 but the sale of the land has not yet been finalised.  The 10-year derogation, which allows for the continuation of domestic turf cutting in this area, will not expire until 2014.  The issue of purchase of land/rights in NHA bogs is being kept under review in light of the decision to review the approach to these areas more generally.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	775	I propose to take Questions Nos. 303 and 304 together.Earlier this year, the Government announced a compensation package for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting in 53 raised bog special areas of conservation (SACs).  The package offers qualifying turf cutters the option of a financial payment of €1,000 per year, index linked, for a period of 15 years or, where feasible, relocation to a non-designated bog where they can continue to cut turf.  Qualifying applicants awaiting relocation can avail of the annual €1,000 payment or will be able to avail of an annual delivery of turf to their homes.My Department is currently processing more than 520 applications received to date under this Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme.  Following a reminder issued from my Department, there was an increased interest in the scheme with the vast majority of applications, and requests for application forms, being received in the week preceding the closing date for the scheme (31 October 2011).  I have decided to extend the deadline for the receipt of applications until 31 December 2011 to allow potential applicants the time to gather the necessary legal documents.Work on processing these applications is ongoing with a view to commencing payments before the end of this year.In 2010 an interim payment scheme was operated and this scheme paid a once-off amount of €1,000 to those who could not continue to cut turf on designated sites in 2010.  My Department received over 280 applications under this scheme and has paid a total of €177,000 to applicants.My Department estimates that about 1,500 active turf cutters are affected by the requirement to cease cutting turf on raised bog SACs.  Of these approximately 750 relate to the bogs designated before 1999 on which cutting was to cease in 2010 and an additional 750 relate to the 24 bogs on which cutting will cease from the end of this year.  The number of applicants for the various compensation schemes will increase further as applications are received in relation to these 24 bogs.It should also be noted that since 1999 my Department has operated a voluntary bog purchase scheme under which sites in designated bogs have been purchased by the Department at agreed rates.  In May 2010, this scheme was closed to new applicants. My Department has completed sales for over 1,050 applicants and, to date, in the region of €26 million has been paid to applicants under this scheme.My Department will be writing to all remaining applicants under the voluntary bog purchase scheme in the coming weeks to outline their options in light of recent policy decisions regarding the availability of alternative compensation arrangements.

I am continuing to work towards this goal in my Department and with the agencies under its remit.  I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding for the arts sector.The State appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  Within the current economic constraints, that investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of the sector and their potential for assisting with cultural tourism initiatives.  In the context of the 2012 estimates, I will be endeavouring to maximise continuing Government support for the arts and culture sector.Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council, which is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following:to stimulate public interest in the arts;to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts; andto assist in improving standards in the arts.The Arts Council is a statutorily independent body funded by my Department and is independent in its day-to-day operations, including in relation to its funding decisions. For 2011, the Exchequer allocation to the Arts Council is €65.127m.

The Strategy promotes a holistic, integrated approach to the Irish language which is consistent with international best practice.  The Strategy sets out a comprehensive approach to the preservation and promotion of the Irish language over a 20-year period from 2010 to 2030. The Strategy sets out nine areas for action, including education, the Gaeltacht, the family, public services, the media, the economy, legislation and various cross-cutting initiatives.The Programme for Government 2011-2016   states that the Government will support the Strategy and will deliver the achievable goals proposed therein. The Government took a number of policy decisions on 31 May 2011 regarding the implementation structures for the Strategy and the new linguistic definition envisaged for the Gaeltacht. These decisions will be given statutory effect, as required, in the Gaeltacht Bill which is to be published in 2012, in accordance with the Government’s Legislation Programme.Since my Department has overarching responsibility for the Strategy, its implementation plan for 2011 has been published and its 2012-2014 implementation plan will be published following consultation with key stakeholders. In addition, a number of high-level working groups have been established with key stakeholders in order to progress the implementation of the Strategy.

I understand that details of the relevant buildings protected in this Record are available from Kildare County Council.Details of archaeological monuments in County Kildare are contained in the Record of Monuments and Places, which may be viewed in my Department's Dublin offices. Copies are also available countrywide in planning authority offices, public libraries and county and city/town museums.  In addition, details can be accessed on the website www.archaeology.ie, which my Department also maintains.In relation to protected structures, section 59 of the 2000 Act provides for a planning authority to serve notice to require works to be carried out in relation to endangerment of such structures.  On the basis of information submitted by the planning authorities to my Department, there were 19 such notices served nationwide in 2008, 27 in 2009 and 10 in 2010. On the basis of information provided by Kildare County Council, no such notices were served in 2008, 1 in 2009 and 1 in 2010.My Department has limited resources to assist protected structures which may be endangered. In 2011, I am providing €650,000 through a "Structures at Risk Fund" to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts.

The hunting season for deer is regulated by the Open Seasons Order, which prescribes the periods for the hunting of various deer species; these periods vary depending on the gender and age of the deer. The hunting of red male deer is prohibited in the county of Kerry during the open season. There is a 12-month open season for Muntjac deer, as it is considered to be an invasive species.The type and calibre of firearms and ammunition which may be used to shoot deer species is regulated by the Wildlife Act 1976 (Firearms and Ammunition) Regulations, 1977. These Regulations stipulate that rifles with a calibre of not less than .22 calibre may be used. In recent years, deer numbers have been increasing and deer have spread to areas where they were not previously found.  Consequently, I do not consider, having regard to the scientific conservation advice available to me, that the number of current deer licences is excessive.

Amending legislation will be required in order to enable the merger to take place.  The radical streamlining of State bodies is a key deliverable of the Government's public sector reform programme and will lead to a more transparent, accountable and efficient public service. Accordingly, the Government decision should not be viewed solely as a cost saving exercise.

The application related to the construction of a new vehicular roundabout, above the remains, which the developer was required to construct as a condition of planning permission granted by Galway County Council for an adjacent housing development.The application was approved by the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in October 2010.  I understand that the possibility of relocating the proposed roundabout so as to avoid any unnecessary impact on the archaeological remains was examined by the Minister as part of the consent process but was not considered feasible, for traffic safety reasons, following consultation with the local authority and the Department of Transport.  A condition was, however, included in the Minister's consent requiring an information plaque to be erected in the vicinity of the site.However, since the consent issued I understand that Galway Co Council have subsequently given consideration to the construction of a smaller roundabout at the site. My Department is awaiting their proposals on the matter, including the implications for the national monument. It should be noted that my Department has no role in progressing the development for which planning permission was granted.

I am advised that my Department has, since 2 June 2011, paid compensation in one case. This related to a commercial turf-cutting case, where payment of €154,855 was made in an out-of-court settlement on 28 July 2011. The payment was made from my Department's Vote and there was no confidentiality agreement associated with this settlement.With regard to bodies within my Department's ambit, the Deputy will appreciate that such matters are part of the day-to-day operational responsibilities of the bodies in question.  I am arranging, therefore, for the terms of the Deputy's Question to be transmitted to the heads of relevant bodies with a request that they provide information, to the extent feasible, directly to the Deputy.

In the case of commercial radio broadcasters, in submitting their initial licensing applications to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), they put forward commitments in regard to how they will deal with a range of broadcast issues including public service commitments and, where appropriate, more specific commitments, for instance, in regard to the playing of Irish music.  If they are successful in their applications, these commitments form part of the terms and conditions of their actual licence.In the case of the public service broadcasters, these corporations publish detailed commitments on an annual basis setting out how they intend to meet their public service obligations and objects as set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009.  These include a specific object in regard to ensuring that programmes reflect "the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the island of Ireland, and have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language".  The extent to which the commitments entered into by our two public service broadcast corporations are complied with is reviewed annually by the BAI.This policy approach is seen as the most appropriate in dealing with the differing requirements of commercial and public service broadcasting.  The introduction of specific quotas can lead to a position of strict adherence to the minimum by those on whom they are imposed and renewed lobbying by those that they are supposed to favour for further increases in the relevant quota.  In this context, I am aware that there is ongoing engagement between the Irish Music Rights Organisation (IMRO) and the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland (IBI) with a view to developing further opportunities for Irish music within the context of the current licensing framework.

NewERA has been established on a non-statutory basis as a Shareholder Executive within the NTMA.  NewERA will carry out the corporate governance function, from a shareholder perspective, of ESB, Bord Gáis, EirGrid, Bord na Móna and Coillte, reporting to the relevant Ministers.  Its operation will be overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Infrastructure.In this capacity, NewERA will have responsibility for reviewing capital investment plans of these commercial semi state companies from a shareholder perspective and will identify possible synergies between investment programmes of different State companies.NewERA will work with Departments to develop and implement proposals for investment in line with NewERA Programme for Government commitments across the Energy, Water and Next Generation Telecommunications areas.  The Government has made clear its intention to ensure that State Companies play a full role in Ireland's economic recovery.The Energy State Companies are already engaged in significant programmes of infrastructure investment including in the renewable energy sector.  We must ensure that all the investment programmes of the State Companies are cost effective, strategic and subject to rigorous shareholder scrutiny.  NewERA will have a key role to play in this regard on behalf of the Government's shareholder interests in the State Companies, where appropriate regulatory oversight will also continue to be a fundamental requirement.  NewERA will also work with the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) to bring forward proposals for investment of available resources, each such investment to be on a commercial basis.  In this context, the Programme for Government commits to investment of €2bn from the sale of non strategic assets to fund NewERA investment.  Now that the Authority has been formally established, I am confident that progress can be made on necessary investment under the aegis of New ERA with consequential positive direct and indirect jobs impact.

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Prices in the retail electricity market are now fully deregulated since 4 April 2011.Prices in the electricity market are wholly a commercial and operational matter for the suppliers. Ireland's electricity and gas markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by vigorous competition regulated by the CER.  ESB Electric Ireland offer a number of different price plan options to existing and potential customers, however, none of these plans offer different unit rates based on urban or rural locations and I am not aware that  rates offered by other suppliers differentiate on such a basis either.

The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors.  The measures installed include attic and cavity wall insulation, draught proofing, hot water cylinder lagging jacket and CFLs.  Homeowners are also given energy advice.  To date, energy efficiency improvements in over 75,000 homes have been made under Better Energy: Warmer Homes.  In 2010, 24,291 homes benefitted from the scheme, including 762 homes in County Kerry.  A total of 16,400 homes have received energy efficiency improvements to the end of October 2011, including 510 homes in County Kerry.There has been a significant uptake in applications for the scheme over the last three years, the success of the scheme having led to increased awareness and demand.  There are currently 9,220 homes nationwide on the Better Energy: Warmer Homes' waiting list, of which 461 are in County Kerry.  The SEAI is working towards a six-month timeframe for service delivery.  This scheme remains open and eligible homeowners can register for the scheme by calling the dedicated hotline number at 1800 250 204. In publishing the Affordable Energy Strategy on 27 November, I reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the Warmer Homes Scheme, funding for which in 2012 will be finalised in the context of overall budgetary decisions.

Its target is to have 201 public charge points, of which 14 will be fast charge points, rolled out by the end of 2011.  The overall target of 1,500 public charge points related to progress on sales of electric vehicles, where take-up has been very low.  This is partially due to the later than expected arrival into the Irish market of some domestic models and some light commercial vehicle models, which will now be in the Irish market from 2012.The location of the public infrastructure points has been planned to give a nationwide coverage, particularly alongside the main road networks.  Full locations of all the charging points are available on the ESB website.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has so far provided grants for 46 Battery Electric Vehicles.  It currently has no grant applications on hand.  SEAI expects the number of applications to increase in quarter 1 of 2012 as this is the traditional new car purchasing period.  Demand will also be affected by the availability of new additional models on the Irish market.  Decisions in relation to the allocation for the electric vehicle grant scheme for 2012 will be made in the context of decisions on the breakdown of my Department's overall capital allocation for 2012.

The concept of "same number — same service" envisages a specific socially important service accessible through the same 116 number regardless of which Member State the caller is in.  The number 116123 has been designated for use for emotional support helplines.The European Commission decision imposes obligations on the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as manager of the National Numbering Plan, to reserve the six-digit number range 116xyz, for harmonised services of social value and to advertise when a number is available for allocation and to invite applications from appropriate organisations to provide the service.  The role of ComReg is limited to assignment of the number to an appropriate service provider. Once the number has been assigned, it is a matter for the service provider to provide the service.  Furthermore, it should be noted that neither ComReg nor my Department has any policy remit in the provision of such services.I am advised by ComReg that the number 116123 was assigned to the Samaritans in 2008 following consultation with the relevant Government Department, in this instance the Department of Health.  I am further advised that the latest information available is that the Samaritans plan to make the 116123 number operational in early 2012.  The Deputy may wish to note that the latest information on the status of all 116 numbers is available on ComReg's website at www.comreg.ie/116.

Part 3 of the 2009 Act also outlines the codes governing standards and practice to be observed by broadcasters.  The Compliance Committee of the BAI is charged under the Act with ensuring that all broadcasters, whether public or private, comply with their licence conditions and with the standards set out in the broadcasting codes and rules.With reference to the specific case cited by the Deputy, It was decided by Cabinet that there should be an independent inquiry to determine the true facts and circumstances which led to the Prime Time programme on Fr. Reynolds being broadcast on RTÉ in May of this year.As the Deputy is aware, I have accordingly requested that the BAI Compliance Committee uses its powers under section 53 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 to determine whether RTE has met its statutory responsibilities around objectivity, impartiality and fairness.  I have asked that the Committee then report and make any recommendations in respect of this to the Authority.  The decision of Government requests that the Report be concluded within two months.It is my view that this is the most appropriate approach in the circumstances.  The question of amending the Broadcasting Act 2009 as a result of the matter referred to by the Deputy is not under consideration.

The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce which I convened earlier this year, has an important role to play in this regard.The Taskforce, which I chair, also comprises Minister of State, Fergus O'Dowd, T.D., the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.  The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss and report on policy issues and proposals in relation to provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.The Taskforce, and four Working Groups reporting to it, are considering issues such as appropriate targets, spectrum policy, private sector investment plans, and the removal of barriers (for example local authority way leave processes) in order to facilitate investment.  I expect that the Taskforce will help to identify how best to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband generally and thereby assist in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government.The Taskforce, which had a further meeting yesterday, will conclude its deliberations shortly.  It is my intention to consider the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report of the Taskforce and to make a submission to Government in this regard.  It is my objective to move quickly thereafter to put in place the optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband.

ComReg's website www.callcosts.ie provides detailed information on the various private sector telecommunications products and services available on a county by county basis. In line with State Aid rules, the Government can only intervene in cases where the market has failed to deliver and the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is an example of such an intervention.  The rollout of the NBS network was completed in October 2010 and broadband services are now available to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in each of the 1,028 designated electoral divisions (EDs) of the NBS Coverage Area.The Government's other intervention, namely the Rural Broadband Scheme, which will be rolled out next year, is aimed at making broadband services available to individual un-served premises in rural non-NBS areas.The significant investments which continue to be made by the many private operators in Ireland, together with the targeted State intervention, means that Ireland will reach the EU Commission's "Digital Agenda for Europe" target of having basic broadband available to everybody in advance of the 2013 deadline.The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now available across Ireland, the challenge now is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband customer access to every home and business in the State.In June of this year I established the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, which I chair and which also comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies currently operating in the Irish market and the CEOs of some Internet Service Provider companies.  The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss the optimal policy environment required to facilitate the investment in and provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.The Taskforce, and four Working Groups reporting to it, are considering issues such as appropriate targets in terms of speed and service, potential barriers to investment, spectrum policy issues and possible demand stimulation measures aimed at increasing overall Internet usage.The Taskforce, which had a meeting yesterday, will conclude its deliberations shortly.  It is my intention to consider the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report and subject to Government consideration to move quickly thereafter to put in place the optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband.

ComReg is in regular contact with my Department.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	803	Energy policy objectives for Ireland and the European Union are delivering security of supply and reducing the impact of competitive energy costs for consumers and business, through the development of renewable energy resources, enhanced energy efficiency and greater competition.  National and EU energy policy objectives are also informed by the critical work of the International Energy Agency (IEA) on all aspects of energy supply.The Government's energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes including the Biofuels Obligation are aimed at moving Ireland's economy away from reliance on imported, carbon intensive fossil fuels, which are subject to price volatility.The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.  There is no price control on petroleum products and it has been the policy objective of successive Governments to promote price competition and consumer choice.Previous surveys have shown that prices which Irish retailers charge for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  The refinery price for oil products varies with demand and does not always move in line with crude oil prices.  There is a time lag between movements in crude prices and refined prices.  Prices at the pump reflect global market price, which is fluctuating, transportation costs, euro/dollar fluctuations and other operating costs as well as the impact of taxes on oil products. The differentials, up or down, between the price of diesel and petrol is a function of supply and demand at various times in the market.  The extent to which speculation in the global oil markets has played a part in driving up the cost of oil, is difficult to quantify but a number of informed analysts point to it being a factor.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	804	Directive 2009/28/EC imposes a legally binding target on Ireland for the share of renewable energy in all energy consumed by 2020. Ireland's target is for 16% of all energy to be from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland has set targets of 40% electricity, 12% heating/cooling and 10% transport fuel to be from renewables by 2020.  The combined effect of these sectoral targets is commensurate with the achievement of the overall 16% of all energy target.Currently about 15% of electricity is generated from renewable energy sources, primarily wind.  Ireland's National Renewable Energy Action Plan, which was submitted to the European Commission last year and which is published on the Department's website, sets out the plans for achieving Ireland's renewable energy targets by 2020.The Gate 3 grid connection process was designed by CER, the energy regulator, to ensure that the 40% target could be reached.  EirGrid estimates that 4750MW of renewable generation will be required on the system to deliver the 2020 renewable electricity target. Currently we have 1850MW of renewable generation on the grid, another 1100MW with signed grid connection agreements and around 4,000MW of capacity in the Gate 3 process.  EirGrid's Grid 25 strategy and implementation plans are designed to deliver the necessary grid developments and grid reinforcements to underpin the new renewable generating capacity, as well as regional economic development.

No confidentiality clauses were attached to the agreements.An out of court settlement in 2007, for a sum of €35,000, was made with a company which carried out a software upgrade for the Department.  In 2010 a sum of €75,000 was paid in a settlement relating to the amount of grant aid due to a company for the provision of cable broadband infrastructure.  The settlement costs settled a dispute over the amount of grant aid due to a company under a 2002 project, undertaken as part of an EU Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme.  Agreement was reached on the case in 2010 after protracted engagement over a number of years.In October 2011 settlement terms were agreed with respect to 2 sets of Judicial Review proceedings, related to the Corrib Gas project, instigated in the High Court.  It was agreed that the State respondents, including my Department, would make a contribution towards the applicants' costs.  The contribution made by my Department, in this regard was €231,916.67.In the case of Removal of the Clondulane Weir, Lismore, County Waterford, a settlement has very recently been reached in advance of the hearing of the court case.

Work is now under way to implement key elements of the report and I will shortly launch two mortgage-to-rent schemes in line with the report's recommendations.These schemes will operate on a pilot basis initially, subject to prompt review ahead of wider implementation.  Under each scheme, households in extreme mortgage distress who are eligible for social housing will be able to remain in their homes as social housing tenants with either the lending institution or a housing association taking ownership of the property.  My Department's Housing Division is now well advanced in its preparatory work with a lender and an approved housing body to make the pilot schemes operational as soon as possible.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	809	Motor tax receipts for the calendar year 2010 were €1,023m.  Accordingly, an increase of 2% would yield total receipts of €1,043.5m, an increase of €20.5m.Motor tax yields are falling as the yield from new cars, where tax is based on carbon emissions, is lower than from cars where the tax is calculated on the basis of engine capacity.  Motor tax income to the end of October 2011 was €861m and it is expected that the final take for the year will be in the order of €998m.  An increase of 2% on that estimate would yield approximately €20m.Subject to the overall number of vehicles taxed and consumer choices in relation to car purchasing decisions, increases in rates do not necessarily translate into equivalent increases in overall yield.

The most important exemption under the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 is for a person's sole or main residence.  However, any one individual can have only one such residence.In a situation where a person owns a property in which he or she does not live as his or her sole or main residence, there would be a liability for the charge in respect of the property owned by the person, unless it is otherwise exempted under the provisions of the Act.  However, the Deputy should consult with the local authority in this case and establish if there is a basis for amelioration of the charge.

Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referenda, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station and count staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law.To assist returning officers, my Department issues guidance to them in advance of each election and referendum. The guidance emphasises that the smooth conduct of polls is dependent on maintaining a cadre of sufficiently skilled and experienced people. Having regard to that overall objective, returning officers are advised to employ competent and efficient persons as polling staff and asked to give consideration, where possible, to employing suitable persons who are unemployed.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	812	Local authorities have long led the way in dealing proactively and sympathetically with mortgage arrears. They can, and do, exercise the powers available to them and endeavour, in all arrears cases, to engage proactively and constructively with a distressed borrower with the aim of enabling a household remain in their home. The available data strongly bear this out and suggest that repossession, where it occurs, is always a last resort.Local authority borrowers have received considerable protection from the worst effects of the downturn in terms of their borrowing costs. The effective rate for borrowers has come down by over 2% since end November 2008, standing now at just 3.25% and falling further to 3% as of 1 December. These rates represent exceptional value by comparison to rates charged by commercial lenders; as of now, the local authority rate is more than 1% lower than the average market variable rate. Provisions regarding lending by local authorities for the purposes of house purchase are set out in section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. Where a loan stands in default section 11(10), and, more recently, section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provide that a local authority may make such monetary arrangements with a borrower as the authority considers equitable to take account of the particular circumstances of the borrower.In addition, and to support consistency of approach and ensure best practice across all local authority areas, my Department issued guidance in 2010, based on the Regulator's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. I am arranging to have a copy of this guidance circulated with the official record.  Also, to reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct — which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt — my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the City and County Managers Association.The single most important advice for any borrower facing difficulties in meeting repayments — whether their mortgage is with a local authority or private institution — is to engage early, proactively and constructively with their lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution.To date in 2011, as indicated in the table below, there have been 80 repossessions by local authorities. 40 of these were by means of voluntary surrender and 40 by means of court order.Local AuthorityForcedVoluntaryTotalLaois178Kildare1414Westmeath336Cork Co Co77Meath11Nth Tipp11Dublin City12214Wexford22Sth Tipp11Wicklow11Kilkenny22Waterford City55Sth Dublin44Longford T.C.1414

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	814	The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency (HSCA) was established on an administrative basis in May, 2010. Its remit is to work with and support local authorities, approved housing bodies and my Department in the delivery of housing and housing services. The Agency brings together under one body a broad range of support and advisory services in relation to housing and other construction related matters.As the Agency was established on an administrative basis, it cannot at this time employ its own staff. There are currently 28 staff working in the Agency of which 5 have contracts with my Department, 6 are on secondment from local authorities and 17 are on secondment from the National Building Agency (NBA). All staff are covered by the provisions of the Croke Park Agreement.HSCA will be given statutory underpinning as early as possible in 2012 through an order which will be made under the Local Government (Corporate Bodies) Bill as soon as this legislation is enacted. A Housing Bill will need to be enacted thereafter to give the Agency full legislative underpinning in its own right, to enable the Agency to carry out its full range of functions and to facilitate the statutory closure of the NBA.

I understand that the Council has also applied to the Agency for wastewater discharge licences for the Foxford and Charlestown plants.  As the discharge licences are matters to be dealt with between the Council and the Agency, further information on progress with those applications may be had from the Council.Mayo County Council must await the grant of the foreshore and discharge licences before it can issue the certificate of completion of planning for the proposed contract and progress the appropriate contract documentation.My Department expects to issue a decision on Mayo County Council's design brief for the appointment of consultants to advance the procurement of the three wastewater treatment plants and associated works under a single Design Build Operate (DBO) contract early in 2012.  This decision will also assist the Council to determine the scale and scope of the works to be carried out on the collection systems at the three locations, and whether to incorporate those works into the DBO contract or to procure them under separate contracts.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	816	The Government's approach to radon, which is similar to that of the majority of EU Member States, is to concentrate efforts on increasing public awareness of the risks posed by radon in the home.  In this context, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) operates a radon advice and testing service in line with its statutory function to make the public aware of the hazards of ionising radiation including radon gas.  Through support for the RPII's radon advice and awareness work, my Department is supporting efforts to raise public awareness of the risks posed by radon, particularly in the home.Householders, particularly those in known high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary.  Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department: Radon in Buildings — Corrective Options.  The RPII can also offer specific advice and recommendations and has issued the guidance document: Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householder's Guide, while their website provides a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service.In addition to these measures, Part C of the Building Regulations requires all new buildings, including new dwellings, built since 1 July 1998 to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of their construction.  This includes the fitting of an inactive radon sump, which can be activated at a later stage to reduce radon concentrations if this is found to be necessary.  In addition to the radon sump, in high risk areas, a fully sealed membrane of low permeability over the entire footprint of the dwelling is specified.There are currently no proposals within my Department to consider testing for radon gas as part of the Building Energy Rating (BER) scheme introduced under the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006-2008,which give effect to the relevant EU Directive (2002/91/EC)  Every BER Certificate is accompanied by an advisory report detailing further energy efficiency improvements that should be considered for the building in question.  The advisory report highlights radon gas risks where relevant and advises homeowners and practitioners where further guidance can be obtained.

In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by my Department.Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.Members of the public with an interest in this matter should contact the Planning Section in Kilkenny County Council with regard to obtaining information on conditions attached to specific planning permissions.

It is also a matter for the manager, when requested, to furnish any relevant information in his possession to the elected council.The Local Government Audit Service is responsible for external audits of local authorities and gives an audit opinion on the annual financial statement as prepared by an authority.  The auditor, who is independent in the exercise of professional functions, may also issue a separate report on any matter or matters arising from the statutory audit. Issues highlighted in audit reports are brought to the attention of the manager, the elected members and also the audit committee. I also receive copies of audit reports on the annual financial statements of local authorities.

Mr Jim Miley ,  former chairperson of Concern Worldwide and company director is Chairperson of the Steering Group. The other members are —Dr. Patricia O'Hara — regional policy expert and Adjunct Professor at the National Institute for Regional Spatial Analysis;Mr Liam Keane — former HSE South Regional Co-ordinator;Ms Martina Moloney — Galway County Manager;Mr Gerry Kearney — former Secretary General of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs;Ms Geraldine Tallon — Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.Consultation with stakeholders is an important element of the work of the Steering Group and, to this end, a consultation process has already begun with key stakeholders in the local government and local development sectors, representative organisations within the Community and Voluntary sector and service users.I expect the Final Report from the Steering Group by end January 2012.

A large number of responses were received from a broad spectrum of interests. All of the responses received, in addition to a summary document, will be published on my Department's website shortly.The responses are currently being examined and I intend to conclude examination of the issue in the coming weeks.

Following public consultations, Meath County Council submitted design layout proposals to my Department in May 2011. Following further discussions, my Department approved these proposals in September 2011, raising no objection to the project proceeding to the Part VIII planning stage. The Council was also requested to respond to a number of outstanding queries, and the Department is now awaiting further correspondence from the Council with regard to this project.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	824	Under planning legislation, an extension of planning permission is given, on application, in a case where substantial works have been carried out within the original duration (subject only to the condition that an application complying with the relevant Regulations was made before the expiration of the initial period). An amendment to these provisions was introduced in section 28 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that the duration of a planning permission may be extended where substantial works have not been carried out, or where the development has not even commenced, in cases where the planning authority is satisfied that there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission, again provided that an application complying with the relevant Regulations was made before the expiration of the initial period.  The new provision is subject to a number of qualifications, including that:the planning authority is satisfied that there have been no significant changes in the development objectives in the development plan or in regional development objectives in the Regional Planning Guidelines for the area of the planning authority since the date of the permission such that the development would no longer be consistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area,the planning authority is satisfied that the development would not be inconsistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to any guidelines issued by the Minister under section 28, notwithstanding that they were so issued after the date of the grant of permission in relation to which an application is made under this section.I consider that the new provision strikes an appropriate balance and that it is right that, in cases where substantial works have not been carried out, or the development has not even commenced, the duration of permission should not be extended in respect of developments for which the planning authority would now refuse permission in respect of current applications.

Accordingly, the question of whether the voluntary fire service referred to in the question should be replaced is a matter for the Kerry fire authority.Kerry County Council's fire services are provided through a retained staffing system. Retained fire-fighters are employees of fire authorities, and are organised to provide a full professional fire service throughout the county, including Castlegregory and its hinterland.The retained fires services are appropriately trained, equipped, supervised and operate to proper procedures. Volunteer fire units operate in a relatively small number of areas, but outside the direct control of the fire authority. The volunteer unit in question does not have the requisite training to attend certain types of incidents. While it has received some training, equipment and funding from the Council in the past, it does not report to and is not under the control of the Council's Fire Section.I would again like to re-iterate that the most effective measure to protect the lives of persons in Castlegregory, as in all communities, is to ensure that each dwelling is fitted with proper smoke alarms. I encourage all households in Kerry, as throughout the country, to ensure that this is the case.

Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007 provides for the registration of persons permitted to use the title of Architect.  The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) has been designated as the registration body for the purposes of Part 3 of the Act.  Section 22 of the Act makes specific provision for a category of practically trained persons who had already been providing architectural services in Ireland commensurate with those understood as being provided by Architects for the purpose of the Building Control Act 2007 for a period of ten years at the time the Act became law.  This provision is transitional in nature and enables this category of persons to become registered once they have been assessed as eligible for registration by the Technical Assessment Board in accordance with the practical experience assessment procedure — a process which assesses work submitted by the applicant and which does not involve any requirement to sit an examination.The RIAI has advised my Department that eight applications for technical assessment have been received to date.  Of these, seven applications have been fully considered by the Technical Assessment Board with five applicants being deemed eligible for registration and two applicants being deemed unsuccessful.

Enforcement of the building regulations is the responsibility of the 37 local building control authorities. The authorities are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings where considered necessary.  Building control authorities can take proceedings for alleged breaches of the Building Regulations on a summary basis before the District Courts or on indictment before the High Court where circumstances so warrant.In the case referred to in the question, I understand that Fingal County Council issued an enforcement notice and on foot of undertakings given in the District Court, the developer has now carried out the required works and they have been certified by a competent professional who supervised the works.  Fingal County Council is now satisfied that the substance of the enforcement notice has been complied with and no further action is  contemplated.

However, in general the liquidation of a company is the process under which assets are collected and disposed of and the resulting proceeds are applied, if there are sufficient funds, in discharging the company's liabilities.  The balance, if any, which remains after paying the costs and expenses of a liquidation is distributed among the members of the company according to their rights and interests or as set out in the company's constitutional documents.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	835	The EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland commits the Government to the introduction of a property tax for 2012.  The Programme reflects the need, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.  In light of the complex issues involved, a property tax, requiring a comprehensive property valuation system, would take time to introduce and accordingly, to meet the requirements in the EU/IMF Programme, the Government has decided to introduce a household charge in 2012. The household charge is an interim measure and proposals for a full property tax will be considered by the Government in due course.The household charge is being set at a modest amount of €100 for 2012 and provision will be made for the payment of the charge by instalments.  While there will be a small number of exemptions and waivers, it is not proposed to provide an exemption from the charge in respect of those who paid stamp duty in recent years.  The legislation to underpin the household charge will contain the precise details of the charge and will be published and brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly.

The system is being developed in close consultation with the various local authorities who have responsibility for the supply of the required information to my Department's specification.  The overall project has an overall budget of €150,000 of which some €82,645 has been spent to date.  It is being developed by three staff in the Planning and Housing Division of my Department and is scheduled for completion by the end of this year.I anticipate that when complete the system will be used by NAMA in co-ordinating its information on the location of lands and buildings associated with loans held by the agency and by other agencies including, inter alia, the National Transport Authority.  I do not have specific details as yet regarding the ongoing operational costs but it is envisaged that the agencies using the system will contribute to the costs associated with its ongoing operation and further development.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	838	Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each county and city manager is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authority for which he or she is responsible. Accordingly, the question raised is a matter for Meath County Council. I understand from the Council, however, that no fire-fighter panel is currently being maintained by the fire authority.  My Department considers all staffing sanction requests on a case by case basis, having due regard to the continued delivery of key services and the need to further reduce overall staffing levels and expenditure in the local authority sector.The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981.  My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance, and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances and equipment.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	842	The draft retail planning guidelines referred to are aimed at ensuring that the planning system plays a key role in ensuring competitiveness in the retail sector, advancing choice for the consumer while promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of city and town centres, contributing to a high standard of urban design, and encouraging a greater use of sustainable transport.The draft Guidelines take into account the recommendations of a Forfás Study Review of the Economic Impact of the Retail Cap   prepared for the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and my Department.  This Study was undertaken in 2010 as part of the terms of the EU-IMF programme of Financial Support for Ireland and presents an evidence-based robust economic analysis of the potential impact on competition and consumer prices of eliminating or relaxing the floor-space cap on retail premises.The Forfás research clearly indicates that the previous caps on store size have not significantly deterred competition and new entrants in the retail sector.  In fact, even more significantly, it found that the maximum size of store allowed has only been reached in a small number of cases indicating that the issue is not a significant one for the sector.Notwithstanding this, considering the national and regional strategic importance of the larger cities, it was considered that the review of the guidelines should embrace a modest increase in the caps applying to these locations, bearing in mind that these include locations where a small number of stores have reached the previous maxima and that larger stores in such city contexts would not be likely to give rise to local monopolies.  By retaining previous caps in less populated areas and smaller towns, the draft guidelines recognise the findings of the Forfás research which concluded that an increase in store sizes could create local monopolies in these locations which would be detrimental to competition.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	843	Based on the tender costs received in my Department, the current average unit cost is now in the order of €125,000, approximately 21% lower than was the case at the height of the boom.  Given that there have been a limited number of construction tenders in the recent past, the sample used is very small and the results therefore need to be interpreted with caution.This figure does not include additional costs such as design team fees, public utility charges or site costs which add on average 15% to the construction costs. Site costs are not included as these may vary significantly, depending on whether the land used was already in the possession of the local authority, or if and when it was purchased by the local authority.

By the end of October 2011 local authorities had transferred a total of 36,579 households from Rent Supplement.  Of these, 21,173 were housed directly under RAS and a further 15,406 were accommodated under other social housing options.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	846	As part of my Department's Local and Community Development Programme's (the LCDP) overall goals, the LCDP supports individuals into employment and self-employment through education, training, work experience, job placement, enterprise and the social economy in both urban and rural areas.  Funding of €63.4m has been made available in 2011 for the Programme.The Programme, which is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department, aims to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government/agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.  Two of the key Programme goals are focussed on education and training, particularly vocational training, and employment and self-employment supports. 80% of LCDP funding is allocated to those measures.The Programme is implemented across the country through 51 Local Development Companies (LDCs), and prioritises the most disadvantaged communities, including RAPID areas, and individuals. The LDCs provide a range of employment services delivered to those who are identified as furthest from the labour market. Importantly, the services provided by LDCs are flexible, independent, locally based and non-bureaucratic. Knowledge and understanding of the local organisational landscape, and the development of networks and relationships, has led over the years to key successes in the provision of training, employment and self-employment supports.Given the current economic crisis and the high level of unemployment, the Programme is more relevant than ever .  In 2012, the target under the Programme for individuals engaging in labour market training will be in excess of 8,000 and the target for the number of individuals supported into employment and self employment will be 4,000.RAPID (Revitalising Areas by Planning, Investment and Development) aims to improve quality of life for residents living in 51 designated disadvantaged areas, through the improved planning and co-ordination of state services, and, through the delivery of new investment in services and facilities. RAPID areas are prioritised within the strategic plans of the LDCs, in implementing the LCDP. This Programme is currently implemented at a local level by an inter-agency structure, the Area Implementation Team. The Programme is implemented on the basis of local area planning which is needs-based. It identifies a series of projects and services which need to be developed or improved in the RAPID area. These services/projects are implemented through prioritisation of national and local agency funding streams and more effective co-ordination of services at a local level. In common with the LCDP, community participation is one of the core principles that underpin all work undertaken within the RAPID Programme.Pobal also delivers a range of publicly funded programmes for the community and voluntary sector, on behalf of other Government Departments and agencies, and questions in relation to these programmes should be directed to the relevant Minister(s).
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	847	I am satisfied that Ireland can and will meet its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for the period 2013-2020.The target in question requires a 20% reduction on 2005 levels in the sectors of the economy not covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS). This reduction must be achieved along a legally binding trajectory, beginning in 2013 at the average emissions for 2008-2010, with annual targets up to 2020. This poses a very significant challenge and, even under the most optimistic scenario, a compliance gap will need to be bridged. This gap will be addressed through domestic policy development, complemented as necessary by use of the flexibilities provided in decision 406/2009/EC of 23 April 2009.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	848	On 16 June 2011, the then Minister for Housing and Planning, Mr. Willie Penrose, T.D., launched the Government's new housing policy statement which will serve as a framework for a sequence of legislative and policy initiatives in the short to medium term. Based on a number of fundamental principles and goals that will form the foundation of a substantial reform programme, the new framework for housing policy responds to current and emerging conditions in the housing sector, taking account of the dramatic cycle of rapid growth and sudden collapse in the residential property market. It will chart a way forward for housing policy in Ireland by placing greater emphasis on:choice;equity across housing tenures; anddelivering quality outcomes for the resources invested.There is clear potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's policy objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). I have been engaging, with my Department, very directly with NAMA to discuss options for bringing unsold suitable residential stock controlled by NAMA into productive use for social housing purposes. The first scheme of this nature, with property held by NAMA being purchased by an approved housing body through loan finance from the Housing Finance Agency, was launched in July 2011. Other proposals are currently being examined and I met recently with the Chairman and CEO of NAMA further to encourage NAMA to become involved in leasing options as well as the sale of units.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	849	It has been decided that funding from the Department to People with Disabilities in Ireland (PwDI) must cease at the end of 2011.On the basis of a value for money review it has been clearly established that the vast majority of the money allocated to PwDI is being spent disproportionately. The largest proportion of PwDI'S annual budget has been spent over the last number of years on the operation of its office headquarters and on administration rather than on the creation of programmes and services which would directly benefit people with disabilities. This was an untenable situation that could not be allowed to continue, as people with disabilities were not benefiting sufficiently from the allocation in real terms. However, there is no reason why the local PwDI networks around the country should not continue to be active as volunteer bodies and continue their work with people with disabilities.It is my wish to ensure that people with disabilities directly benefit from any money allocated to this sector. With this in mind, I am currently overseeing the finalisation of a major Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in the Department of Health to ensure that existing funding allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect.  I am also interested to hear what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them. I have recently set up and will  chair a new Implementation Group to develop and progress the National Disability Strategy. This new group will hold its inaugural meeting on 30 November. It will include representation from a number of disability stakeholder organisations and also a number of people with disabilities who will be able to bring their lived experience directly to bear on the very important work of this high level group. This will ensure the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost effective way.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	852	The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision.  Direct provision allows asylum seekers to be provided with full board accommodation and certain ancillary services while their applications for international protection are being processed. Today, RIA has contracted to it 39 accommodation centres around the country where just over 5,420 persons now reside.In fulfilling its general accommodation responsibilities, RIA does not lease or rent premises from commercial contractors. Rather, it ‘contracts-in' a comprehensive range of services and facilities, which include accommodation, housekeeping etc., for a fixed sum over the period of the contract. http://www.ria.gov.ie/Published on RIA’s website — www.ria.gov.ie — are its Annual Reports for the years 2007 to 2010 inclusive. These reports include details of spending for those years, showing total payments for contracts in respect of State owned, commercial and self catering centres; for transport costs; for utility costs in State owned centres; and for miscellaneous payments.Although there are standard service obligations — food, accommodation, etc. — on each of the centres, the per diem  rate paid in each case by RIA is based on an individually negotiated contract. The rates differ from one contract to another depending on the facilities available in the centres, the differing functions of some of the centres, the location of the centres, the length of the contracts and so on.  Negotiations take place with a number of commercial entities on an ongoing basis and RIA endeavours to achieve the best value for money in respect of each contract.  It is not in the interests of the taxpayer that details of current individual contracts are known to the public or to other parties who are, or may be in the future, engaged in negotiations with the RIA. Therefore, details of current contract rates are not provided. This policy has been upheld by the Office of the Information Commissioner.The Deputy should be aware that a copy of the Value For Money (VFM) review in respect of spending by RIA on asylum seeker accommodation was completed in May 2010 and is available in the Oireachtas Library.  It can also be viewed on the aforementioned RIA website. This report made a detailed examination of RIA's procurement function and acknowledged some of the unique challenges in this particular area of procurement — unpredictability of demand, dispersal, local opposition, children settled in schools and so on. The VFM report also made a detailed analysis of rates and occupancy achieved by RIA in providing accommodation for asylum seekers. The RIA has advised me that it is active in following the recommendations of the VFM report and continuously measures achievements by reference to the targets set.In the context of these cost containment measures, it should be noted that there is a continuing decline in the cost of the direct provision system in recent years, as illustrated by the following table, viz.:YearCost (Outturn)2008€91 million2009€86 million2010€79 million2011€67.5 million (estimate)
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	853	With regard to my plans for the regulation of gambling events, the Deputy may be aware that, some months ago, I obtained the Government's approval for the preparation of new legislation. The new legislation will update and consolidate the law on both gaming and betting. I hope to be in a position to present a draft Scheme of a new Bill to the Government in the first half of 2012, for its approval.On the more specific point of card games in licensed premises, Section 9 of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956-2003 represents the current law on this subject. Subsection (1) contains a general ban on gaming on licensed premises. However, subsections (2) and (3) make certain exceptions for card games. Subsection (2) concerns the playing of cards for stakes; there is no prohibition on a licensee or his private friends playing such games where the game is played in a part of the premises away from where the sale of intoxicating liquor generally takes place and the friends are being entertained at the licensee's own expense. The second situation concerns card games where there is no stake (other than, perhaps, a single charge for the right to take part). In that case, subsection (3) states that the general prohibition does not, subject to observance of certain matters mentioned in the subsection, apply.I would point out that enforcement of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts is a matter for An Garda Síochána.

The person concerned was informed by letter dated 31 May 2011 that I have decided to defer making a final decision on his case until May 2013. I should add that the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The person concerned did not attend for interview on this date, nor did she furnish an explanation for her failure to attend. Consequently, she was informed, by letter dated 25th August, 2004, that the Refugee Applications Commissioner was recommending to the then Minister that she should not be declared to be a refugee, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended). The person concerned was also informed that there was no appeal against such a recommendation.

Section 111 of the Act provides that in any proceedings in which a child is found guilty of an offence, the court may make an order for the supervision of the child's parents where it is satisfied that a wilful failure of the child's parents to take care of or control the child contributed to the child's criminal behaviour.Section 113 of the Act provides that where a court is satisfied of the guilt of a child and that the appropriate way of dealing with the case is to make a compensation order, it may order that the compensation be paid by the parent or guardian of the child instead of the child.  Section 114 of the Act provides that a parent or guardian may be ordered by the court to enter into a recognisance to exercise proper and adequate control over their child.  If the child is found guilty of another offence as a result of said parent or guardian failing to exercise such control, the parent or guardian would forfeit the recognisance.  It should be noted, however, that the imposition of any particular sanction referred to above on the parents or guardians of an offending child is a matter for the courts.  There are, currently, no proposals for additional measures in this regard.

The Authority is an independent body under the aegis of my Department and so the processing of licence applications is a matter solely for the Authority.As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (DJEI) is the body authorised to issue employment permits in accordance with the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006.   The monitoring of individuals and employers for compliance with the relevant work permit legislation is also a matter for that Department.  The issuing of a PSA licence does not of itself confer a right to work in the State and it is a matter for the licence holder and employer to ensure that work permit requirements are met.

The asylum application refers solely to the individual mentioned.  He states in that application that no other family member accompanied him to the State.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State. The individual concerned has remained in the State in breach of his Deportation Order since that date.Representations were received from the person's legal representative asking that his Deportation Order be revoked, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). Following consideration of those representations, the Deportation Order was affirmed on 25th March 2009. Following this decision, the individual concerned remained in the State in breach of his Deportation Order.

In this regard, consideration will be given to the level of service provided in 2011, the outputs and outcomes achieved, and the level of service and related issues outlined in the business plan for 2012.  All funding is of course subject to available resources.The Probation Service has worked with and supported the Coolmine Therapeutic Community since its foundation by providing funding for the services available to Probation Service clients.  The funding agreement for 2011 provides for the provision of the following core services:Outreach and Day Programme services to support Probation Service clients to access treatment at their level of identified need and choice:A full-time residential programme in Coolmine Lodge for male Probation Service clients;A supportive residential rehabilitation programme in Ashleigh House for female Probation Service clients who are drug free; andIntegration and aftercare services to provide transitional support following residential treatment.In 2011, the Department of Justice and Equality through the Probation Service allocated funding in the region of €10m to 48 community based organisations working primarily with adult offenders engaged with the Probation Service.  The provision of such funding is subject to a Funding Agreement with each organisation that details the services to be provided linked to measurable outputs.  In consultation with the community organisations involved, the Probation Service is continuing to revise and restructure these agreements to provide additional services and prioritise deliverables within the context of available resources.

I am informed by the Garda authorities that section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, as amended, provides for the detention, removal, storage and subsequent release or disposal of a mechanically propelled vehicle.  A vehicle shall not be disposed of before the expiration of a period three weeks from the date of its detention or two weeks after notice of the intended disposal has been given in the prescribed manner, whichever is longer.The Road Traffic Act 1994 (Detention of Vehicles) Regulations 2011, made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, set out the charges payable by the person claiming the vehicle.  In the case of a vehicle with a design gross weight not exceeding 3,500 kg, a charge of €125 applies in respect of its detention, removal and storage for one day or a part of a day and €35 in respect of each further day or part of a day that it is stored.  In the case of a vehicle with a design gross weight exceeding 3,500kg, a charge of €250 applies in respect of its detention, removal and storage for one day or a part of a day and €50 in respect of each further day or part of a day that it is stored.The owner or driver of a vehicle detained under the provisions of section 41 may be subject to further criminal proceedings in respect of the principal offence for which the vehicle was detained.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	877	The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, 2008 came into effect on 7 June 2008. It created offences in relation to trafficking of persons for the purposes of labour exploitation, as well as trafficking of persons for the purposes of sexual exploitation or exploitation consisting of the removal of a person's organs. Section 1 of the 2008 Act defines labour exploitation in relation to a person (including a child) as follows:(a) subjecting  the person to forced labour(b) forcing him or her to render services to another, or(c) enslavement of the person or subjecting him or her to servitude or a similar condition or state.Since 7 June 2008, the number of cases of alleged human trafficking for labour exploitation that have been investigated by An Garda Síochána are as follows: 2009 — 19 cases; 2010 — 19 cases; 2011 — 9 cases (up to September 2011).To date no proceedings for the offence of human trafficking for labour exploitation have been commenced, with three Investigation Files having been submitted to the Law Officers. Directions for no prosecution have been received in two of these cases, while additional information has been sought and provided in respect of the third Investigation File. The decision in such matters rests with the Law Officers. In order for proceedings to be commenced against an individual for any criminal offence, including human trafficking, there must be evidence of the crime against the individual. At the very least, a prima facie   case must be established. In a number of the cases under investigation by An Garda Síochána insufficient evidence of human trafficking has been established to allow proceedings be commenced.  In some of these cases there are alleged breaches of employment legislation and in this regard An Garda Síochána works closely with the National Employment Rights Authority.

While the overall time limit for which non-EEA nationals are permitted to reside in the State on a student permission is seven years, students who have been accepted on a PhD or doctoral programme will be granted an extension on that period.  Permission will be renewed to facilitate completion of PhD and doctoral programmes where the appropriate academic supervisor provides confirmation of satisfactory progress on the programme.Furthermore, PhD students are exempted from the general prohibition on family reunification for non-EEA students and, once graduated, may avail of the post study pathway which permits non-EEA students to remain in the State for one year in order to secure employment on a work permit, a green card or indeed as a scientific researcher under the  administrative scheme that is currently in place.

On the basis of a value for money review, it has been clearly established that the vast majority of the money allocated to PwDI is being spent disproportionately. The largest proportion of PwDI's annual budget has been spent over the last number of years on the operation of its office headquarters and on administration rather than on the creation of programmes and services which would directly benefit people with disabilities. This was an untenable situation that could not be allowed to continue as people with disabilities were benefiting very little from the allocation in real terms. However, there is no reason why the local PwDI networks around the country should not continue to be active as volunteer bodies and continue their work with people with disabilities.It is my wish to ensure that people with disabilities directly benefit from any money allocated to this sector. With this in mind, I am currently overseeing the finalisation of a major Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in the Department of Health to ensure that existing funding allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect. I am also interested in hearing what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them. I have just set up and am personally chairing a new National Disability Strategy Implementation Group to develop and progress disability strategy. The new group will include representation from a number of disability stakeholder organisations and also a number of people with disabilities who will be able to bring their lived experience directly to bear on the very important work of this high level group. This will ensure the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost effective way.The Government must ensure that in 2012, and continuing thereafter, that funding is allocated for maximum provision of services for people with disabilities, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time. As can be seen from the attached table, due to a general decline in Network activity around the country,  PwDI as an organisation were unable to spend their allocation in the last few years. Over €1 million euro allocated to PwDI since 2007 was returned to the Exchequer.  Government funding for the years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011* is set out in the table. * Figure at Sept 2011 PwDI funding 2007-2010YearAllocationDrawdown2007€1,400,000€1,400,0002008€1,465,000€1,465,0002009€1,465,000€1,088,4232010€1,465,000€895,2902011€900,000€577,403Totals€6,695,000€5,426,116

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	885	I am already aware of the issues raised by Retail Excellence Ireland in relation to commercial rents.  As I indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 486 and 487 on 22 November, I hope that I will shortly be in a position to provide some additional clarity as to the subject matter of the letter.  The other issues raised in the Retail Excellence Ireland letter come within the remits of the Ministers for Finance, Social Protection and Environment, Community and Local Government, and I note that the Deputy has also posed this question to them.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	886	As I have said previously annual savings in respect of utilities, security duty allowances and maintenance amount to approximately €1.3 million per annum in respect of the four barracks that are being closed.  In relation to Kickham Barracks, Clonmel these savings amount to approximately €0.42m based on the most recent figures available.  In addition to the cost of utilities each barracks requires a security detail and additional further personnel are tied up on purely administrative duties connected to the management of the particular barracks. Because maintaining barrack security can require around the clock cover, a much larger pool of personnel is required. Therefore, several hundred additional man years will become available for operational duties.At a minimum, the value of this efficiency gain across the four locations will exceed €5 million per year.   The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme and has been recommended in many reports over the past number of years.  This was a key consideration of Government in addressing this issue as releasing personnel from security and support functions enables the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to be maintained.There are no plans for providing extra accommodation in Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, however it is expected that there will be a requirement for the provision of additional locker facilities at an estimated cost of €50,000.  In the last ten years approximately €3.8m has been spent on maintenance and refurbishment works and includes the procurement of professional, technical services in connection with building and engineering projects at Kickham Barracks.Since the announcement of the Government decision on barrack closures my Department has written to each Government Department and various agencies and local authorities seeking expressions of interest in acquiring any of the properties to benefit the local community as a whole but with particular emphasis on job creation measures.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	887	The Military Authorities have informed me that the General Officer Commanding the 1st Southern Brigade was away from the Brigade on official military duty when the announcement on the consolidation of Defence Forces barracks was made by the Government.   In the absence of the General Officer Commanding, and in order to ensure that the information concerning the closure of Kickham Barracks was delivered directly to the personnel affected, the Second-In-Command of the 1st Southern Brigade travelled to Clonmel at the earliest opportunity on the day the closure of the Barracks was announced and addressed personnel on the matter.I am advised by the military authorities that the following day, the General Officer Commanding spoke to the personnel from Kickham Barracks deploying overseas prior to their deployment.  I am also informed that, since then, he has also conducted comprehensive briefings with all personnel stationed at Kickham Barracks who will be impacted by the decision to close the Barracks.  I am aware of the General Officer Commanding the 1st Southern Brigade's attendance at a football match much later that night.  However, this does not obviate the fact that, on the day in question, he was away from the Brigade on official duties which were entirely unconnected with the football match.

In cases where the State is considered liable or which involve an apportionment of liability as between the State and the claimant, I am informed that both the State Claims Agency and Chief State Solicitor's Office approach is to settle such cases expeditiously in so far as it is possible and to do so on reasonable terms.  In cases where liability is fully disputed by the State, all necessary resources are applied to defending such claims robustly.Confidentiality clauses may be attached on a case by case basis depending on various factors.  The Department does not hold separate statistics in relation to cases involving confidentiality clauses and each case file would have to be individually examined in order to ascertain this information.  As this task would involve inordinate effort, it is not possible to supply the Deputy with this information.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	897	I propose to take Questions Nos. 442 and 443 together.The funding available to my Department for schemes and services in 2012 will be determined by the Government in the context of the prevailing economic and budgetary situation while having regard to the Comprehensive Expenditure Review and the 2012 Estimates process. The National Recovery Plan, 2011-2014, requires the Department to reduce total expenditure from €1.647 billion in 2011 to €1.286 billion in 2012. The reduced level of funding provided for will inevitably mean substantial cuts in expenditure in 2012 and subsequent years, and will impact on the schemes and services delivered by the Department.However, I am acutely aware of the importance of grant and scheme payments to the incomes and cash-flow of farm families. I have given the highest priority to the processing and payment of all scheme payments and to the elimination of all unnecessary delays. I can confirm that further substantial payments will issue between now and year end under the Single Payment Scheme and the Rural Environment Protection Scheme and AEOS.Insofar as the 2012 Estimate is concerned, my priorities are to ensure that my Department provides a cost-effective and efficient service while maintaining support for the productive farmers and that available resources are directed towards the investment opportunities which have been identified in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and the Government's Programme for Recovery.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	898	Coillte Teoranta was established as a private company under the Forestry Act, 1988, and its Board of Directors is collectively responsible for leading and directing the company's activities, including monitoring the activities and effectiveness of management.In accordance with Section 39 of the Forestry Act, 1988, the bulk of the State's forestry estate was vested in Coillte upon its establishment.  In the years following its establishment, the company acquired land for afforestation thereby increasing the estate.  Since its establishment, it has also sold lands, some of which was for infrastructural purposes.  I understand that the properties sold are those considered by the company not to be of strategic importance to the company's forestry business and that the net effect is that the area of land currently being managed by Coillte is in excess of that vested in the company upon its establishment in 1989.The company's performance, and the activities engaged in by the company, is outlined in the Coillte Annual Report 2010, which is accessible on the company's website.  Copies are also available in the Oireachtas Library.  As the Deputy will note, Coillte raises revenue from a number of sources; in addition to its core forestry business and the manufacture and export of panel products, the company is also engaged in the provision of telecommunications infrastructure and the renewable energy area.

No. 34973/11 refers: The person named commenced REPS 4 in May 2009 and received payments for the first year of the contract.  In addition, 75% of the year 2 payment issued on 21 April 2011 for the amount of €5581.69.Following an inspection in June 2010, a 25% penalty was imposed for bovines "not excluded from watercourses" and a 35% penalty for "a water well which was unfenced".

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	908	The Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), which records details of all land declared under all the area-based schemes, must be fully accurate and up to date, given the fact that it underpins total expenditure under these schemes of in excess of €1.8 billion annually. Consequently the system must be updated to take account of changes to areas submitted by farmers. Any failings or shortcomings in the LPIS would constitute a breach of the Integrated Administrative and Control System provided for under European Union legislation and would leave my Department open to the very real risk of significant EU fines. Such a risk cannot be countenanced as it could compromise the value of direct payments to farmers.Farmers submit maps to my Department to facilitate re-digitising, in order to have various ineligible features, such as buildings, roadways, farmyards, etc, properly recorded on the LPIS. The changes made to the LPIS on foot of the maps submitted by farmers is one of the three main methods used to update the spatial data, the other two being changes identified during ground and remote sensing inspections and changes identified during my Department's internal review of ortho-photography.  It is essential that the necessary amendments identified be made, on an ongoing basis, to accurately reflect the position on the ground.It must also be remembered that under EU rules, the earliest permissible date for payment under the Single Payment Scheme is actually the 1st of December. This year I made a special case to the European Commission securing agreement to make an advance payment of 50% from 17 October. This is the sixth successive year that Ireland had paid an advance of the Single Farm Payment, an achievement, which is unprecedented. There is no doubt that Ireland is one of the first Member States to release Single Payment funding and the record of my Department in processing applications since the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme in 2005 and making advance payments is equal to the best record of any Member State.It is not possible under legislation governing the payment of aid under the area based schemes to make payments to any cases that are not fully processed and clear. That said, however, payments of the 50% advance of the SFP as well as payments under all other area based schemes are continuing apace.Since payments under the Single Payment Scheme started on 17 October, over €576 million has issued to over 114,000 amounting to some 93% of all eligible applicants. In addition, payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme commenced, on target, on 22 September and, to date, payments worth €208 million have issued to over 94,000 farmers, representing 94% of eligible applicants. Every effort continues to be made to maximise the numbers of payments being made and, in this regard, I would again urge any farmer who has been written to regarding an issue which is delaying payment, to respond without delay. I can also confirm that arrangements are well advanced to allow balancing payments under the Single Payment Scheme commence issuing on target, as and from 1 December.

During 2010, Ireland reviewed its Nitrates Action programme putting in place a second Action Programme. As part of this process, Ireland's request to extend the derogation was granted by the Commission and this new derogation runs to the end of 2013, coinciding with the end of the second Nitrates Action Programme.The renewal of the derogation underpins the efforts of Ireland's agri-food sector to meet its targets under the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. It sets additional requirements on those farming at higher stocking rates to ensure their farming systems are sustainable and environmentally sound including a requirement for full nutrient management planning for the unit. My Department is committed to the proper implementation of the national derogation to ensure its continuance and to environmentally responsible farming.  There is, of course, a continuing need to improve water quality, and Teagasc has indicated that recent research has demonstrated that it is possible to achieve high water quality and high productivity from grass based dairying by increasing Nitrates use efficiency.The expansion targets in Food Harvest 2020 are contingent on a range of actions at all levels of the supply chain, including actions to improve productivity at farm level. These include measures to improve grassland management, to encourage the use of genetics to improve breed quality and productivity per animal and to encourage collaborative business models such as partnership and contract rearing, which have the potential to provide dairy farmers with access to additional land. These kinds of initiative have the potential to lead to a significant increase in production while mitigating any impact on the environment.

It carries out this remit through service contracts with my Department and other agencies including the Health Service Executive (HSE), Local Authority Veterinary Service and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.The remit of the FSAI did not extend to monitoring of controls in animal feed.  However following a recommendation of the Inter Agency Review of the Pork Dioxin incident it is intended that the role of the FSAI will be extended formally to include animal feed. The legal basis for extending the service contract system to this area is being examined at present.In the meantime, since the pork dioxin incident, my Department has in practice been working closely with the FSAI on animal feed control matters. Once the formal change to the service contract is effected, the FSAI will have overall monitoring responsibility for both feed and food, consistent with the EU Hygiene legislation.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	920	As you are aware, the Single Payment Scheme is fully funded by the European Union and the relevant Competent Authorities in each Member State are obliged to ensure that the requirements of the governing EU Regulations are observed. In that regard payments may only be made under the Single Payment Scheme in respect of eligible areas of land. The administration of the Scheme in each Member State is subjected to close scrutiny by officials of the EU Commission and the EU Court of Auditors to ensure that the regulatory requirements are met and that the Schemes are applied in a uniform manner across the European Union.Since payments under the Single Payment Scheme may be made only in respect of eligible land applicants under the Scheme are obliged annually to declare the land parcels available to them. Details of the eligible area of the land parcels are recorded on the Department's Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS).While the rules governing land eligibility are defined in EU Regulations (which, for ease of reference, are detailed in the Scheme Terms and Conditions booklet that issues to all applicants), it is the responsibility of all applicants to ensure that the details in each year's application are accurate. Therefore, applicants are advised of the need to confirm their right to declare such parcels and to make the appropriate deductions (e.g. in respect of houses, farm buildings, roadways, scrub, etc.) to the area of eligible parcels, as necessary.For land to be eligible a number of further conditions have to be complied with.  The land must be used and managed by the applicant. The land must be suitable for and compatible with the farming enterprise.  There must be independent access for animals and/or machinery. Independent access means access by public or private roadway or by a defined right of way. Access over adjoining landowners land is not acceptable.  There must be appropriate fencing for the farming enterprise. Appropriate fencing means stock-proof fencing that will control the applicant's animals and also the neighbouring farmer's animals. In mountain/hill areas this generally means sheep fencing.  There must be defined external boundaries except in the case of commonage.  If, at inspection, the applicant claims to be farming the land with animals then the type of animals must be appropriate to the land and there must be handling facilities available to meet the animals' welfare requirements.Practically all agricultural land is now eligible for SPS payments with the exception of land under permanent crops, forestry that was planted prior to 2009 with the exception of Forestry Set-aside, forestry planted on ineligible land, or any land used for non-agricultural purposes (golf courses, etc.).Where commonage land applied on by applicants under the Single Payment Scheme meets the criteria set out above payments will be made under that Scheme.

The group which comprised both public and private stakeholders worked to a target that was both ambitious and timely. It was chaired by Sean O'Donoghue, current Chairman of Killybegs Fisherman's Organisation Ltd.This High Level Group reported back to me on the 23  November and I can confirm that I made their report available on the following day.  The report sets out how a target of 250 jobs in a number of diverse areas can be achieved for the Killybegs region by 2014.  Achieving the jobs target will require the co-operation and involvement of many stakeholders.  I look forward to seeing the actions identified in the report being completed and the benefits that they will bring to the Killybegs region.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	935	The project referred to by the Deputy is currently in receipt of funding under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme and the 2011 allocation to the project is €114,649.  Funding is administered to the project by the City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB).  In determining allocations to initiatives and schemes in 2011, as in previous years, my Department has made every effort to minimise the impact of the reduction in the Youth Affairs budget on front line youth work services.  In light of continuing budgetary constraints, the Youth Affairs budget in 2012 will again require careful management with a focus on prioritising existing youth service provision in so far as is possible.  Officials from my Department are in contact with representatives of the youth sector, including City of Dublin Youth Service Board, on an ongoing basis to ascertain the sector's views on how best to minimise the impact of these budgetary constraints.  Every effort will be made to notify the various youth work organisations and administering agencies, in this instance, CDYSB, of their 2012 allocations as speedily as possible.  My Department has also asked all the national youth organisations and vocational education committees to revisit their level of expenditure to determine where cost savings can be achieved.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	937	I propose to take Questions Nos. 484 to 487, inclusive, together.Preschool services, including child-minding services, are currently regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act,1991.Under the Regulations childminders taking care of more than 3 preschool children from different families in the childminder's home are required to notify the Health Service Executive (HSE) of their services.  Childminders taking care of not more than 3 preschool children from different families are exempt from this requirement under Section 58 of the Child Care Act, 1991.  All preschool services which come within the scope of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 are subject to inspection by the Pre-School Inspectorate which operates under the HSE.The National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee (NCCC), which oversees the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country, compiled national guidelines to assist childminders by providing them with guidance for good practice.  These guidelines, which were published by the Child-care Directorate which now forms part of my Department, assist childminders in deciding if they are subject to the Regulations along with providing other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of child care services.There are no regulatory requirements in relation to the qualifications held by childminders or preschool staff generally.  However, childminders and other preschool services participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme must satisfy certain qualification requirements.  From September 2012 the preschool leader in services providing the free preschool year under the ECCE programme must hold a full Fetac Level 5 qualification under the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).Childminders taking care of 3 or fewer children in their own home can avail of a tax exemption if their annual child-minding income does not exceed €15,000. If the child-minding income exceeds this amount then the total income will be taxable in the normal way under self assessment.The National Child-care Investment Programme (NCIP) is implemented by my Department.  This programme provided for capital grant funding for community and commercial child care providers, including child-minding services, for the development of child care facilities.  However, due to the economic downturn, and following a review of capital expenditure, the previous Government decided to close the programme to new grant applications.  There is therefore no capital funding to assist with the setting up of new creche or child-minding facilities currently available to my Department.

The current value of the applications from individuals, groups and organisations amounts to just over €2.4 million.  The Deputy might wish to note that the applications for grant support this year far exceed the available resources so it may not be possible, unfortunately, to assist all applications.  The assessment of applications is at an advanced stage of finalisation and all applicants, including the organisation referred to by the Deputy, will be informed of the outcome of their application as soon as a final decision has been made. It will also be open to projects to apply for funding in 2012 under the National Lottery allocation made available to this Department. Details of this will be made available on my Department's website www.dcya.gov.ie in due course.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	939	Adoptions from Ethiopia, effected under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Adoption Act 2010, are ongoing and are currently being examined, and recognised, by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI).  These transitional arrangements may lead to adoptions from Ethiopia taking place up to the end of October 2013.Adoptions from Ethiopia which are not covered by the transitional arrangements referred to above require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on inter-country adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State".Ethiopia, as it is not a signatory of the Hague Convention, is covered by Section 73 of the Adoption Act, 2010. The opening of negotiations on such a bilateral would require an analysis of:the current situation regarding adoptions in Ethiopia;issues regarding the compatibility of the laws between the two countries; andthe plans of that jurisdiction vis-à-vis the Hague Convention.The AAI have indicated that certain issues could arise that would require detailed consideration especially issues relating to the effect of Ethiopian adoptions in the context of the Adoption Act 2010.  I will seek an update on Ethiopia from the AAI and the Irish Embassy in Ethiopia in order to assess possible next steps vis-à-vis that jurisdiction.  However further action will have to have regard for the wider work programme of the AAI and agreed priorities.As the Hague Convention is designed to ensure a minimum set of standards in inter-country adoption, the Adoption Authority of Ireland have indicated that their first priority is to reach agreements on arrangements with other Hague countries. The AAI have recently returned from the USA and now intend to develop an administrative arrangement with the USA for inter-country adoption. In the coming weeks the AAI intends to visit Mexico and Vietnam in the context of entering into administrative arrangements with both those jurisdictions, the latter being dependent on the entering into force of the Hague convention in Vietnam on 1 February 2012.I am extremely conscious that the Authority have a full work programme in the terms of these countries as well as the important upcoming priority of our engagement with Vietnam.  In addition, the Authority and my officials will be undertaking exploratory meetings with the Russian authorities in the coming weeks.The Authority must also prioritise checks of legal compatibility with a wide range of jurisdictions in order to process applications for the recognition of the adoptions of children already adopted from abroad by Irish citizens. These are desktop reviews requiring legal advices but are urgently required to regulate the status of children already adopted.

The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.  As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.

The recommendations contained in the report address each of the current issues and campaign priorities listed by the organisation referred to by the Deputy.In particular, the Review Group researched and developed a national model for newborn hearing screening.  The first phase of the roll out of the newborn hearing screening programme commenced in Cork University Hospital on 26th April last and was extended to Waterford and Wexford Maternity Hospitals in November.  It is expected that the service will be extended to Kerry by the end of this year and the remainder of HSE South Maternity Hospitals by early 2012.  This covers approximately 19,384 births (including home births) or slightly over 25% of all births.  The aim of the programme is to ensure that children identified as suffering from permanent hearing impairment will have access to audiological services by six months of age.  The HSE is committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the Report on a phased basis over the next number of years.

I might add that no formal FOI request was included in the correspondence attached to this Parliamentary Question and that on the substantive issue, i.e. the care provided to the individual concerned, I have been advised by the HSE that the individual concerned has been provided with the highest level of care and that his solicitor has been fully appraised of all decisions made in relation to his client.

Also under the contract, the GP must make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with him / her or his / her locum / deputy outside normal hours for urgent cases.  The use of an appointments system in a GP's practice, that does not discriminate between public and private patients and that fulfils the terms of the GP's contract in terms of availability for consultation by the GP's patients, is acceptable to the HSE.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	958	Under the former Eastern Health Board, it was the practice to provide psychiatric medicines free to all patients who attended an outpatient clinic for services regardless of their eligibility status.  Such arrangements were unique to the greater Dublin area. In all other former Health Board Areas, patients used either their medical card or Drug Payment Scheme card to access psychiatric medicines.In 2009, the HSE decided to bring the arrangements for the supply of medicines to patients attending mental health outpatient clinics in the greater Dublin area into line with those operating in the rest of the country.  These changes were introduced on a phased basis, starting on 1 October 2010 when medical card holders in the HSE Dublin North East area requiring psychiatric medicines were referred to their own GP for a GMS prescription.  This arrangement is being extended to the Dublin Mid Leinster area from 1 November 2011.  At the same time, Drug Payment Scheme cardholders will be required to pay for their prescription up to the co-payment threshold of €120 per month.  Medical card holders will continue to receive their medication free of charge, subject to any applicable prescription charge.  These arrangements will be kept under review.People affected by these changes who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive will take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family, including the cost of medication.

This is a complicated process with long term implications.  The HSE has written to all GMS doctors and community pharmacy contractors to clarify the position in relation to Pradaxa.  The HSE will continue to update healthcare professionals in relation to the matter.The HSE does not intend to disturb established therapeutic regimens for patients whose treatment with Pradaxa for the prevention of stroke was initiated prior to the recent clarification.

Of this figure €1,670m over the five year period or €334m per year is allocated to building, equipping and furnishing of health facilities.  The remaining €200m over the period or €40m per year is allocated to the HSE ICT infrastructure.  Minister Howlin also announced that additional capital funding would be made available from a special lottery initiative.  This is tangible evidence, in a time of fiscal consolidation, that the Government remains committed to supporting crucial health infrastructure development and delivering on its Programme for Government commitment which states that "health capital spending will be a priority".Following the publication of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework, the Health Service Executive will commence drawing up its capital programme for the multi-annual period 2012-2016.

This programme includes work across hospital, primary care and community settings involving geriatricians, services for older people, primary care and health promotion specialists.  All of the above have implied responsibility for prevention, treatment and care. Services provided range from bone density scanning to falls prevention programmes and the issue has been identified as a key priority by all regions in the last 4 years and again for 2012.From a disease prevention and management perspective, the Health Promotion Services incorporate this specific topic across all its programmes.  Specifically these are Dietetic treatment and education programmes (72 Community Dietitians are employed), smoking cessation (as smokers are at greater risk of developing this disease), physical activity programmes (as exercise strengthens bone and muscle thus prevention development of osteoporosis), women's health programmes as this population group are most at risk and many other community programmes across the spectrum of risk factors for Osteoporosis.Finally, I have requested my officials and the HSE to meet with the Irish Osteoporosis Society. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss further the issues and concerns that have arisen in relation to funding.

This decision followed consultation with the Attorney General, and was dependent on the powers that had been proposed under the 30th Amendment of the Constitution.As it was not possible to proceed as proposed I will be giving consideration to how best to deal with the issues involved in the Michael Shine case. My Department is currently exploring the options in this regard including the possibility of a Commission of Investigation under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  I also intend to consult with the Attorney General in view of the complex legal issues involved.

Access to GP care without fees will be extended in 2012 to persons covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme and in the following year to patients who receive medicines under the High Tech Drugs Scheme. Access to subsidised GP care will be extended to all in the next phase and universal access to GP care without fees will occur in the final phase.The Long Term Illness Scheme provides, through community pharmacy contractors, free medicines and appliances to persons who are suffering from a specified illness. At present Long Term Illness card holders do not receive free GP care unless they are also holders of medical cards.  Extension of free GP care to all claimants of medicines under the Long Term Illness will require primary legislation.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	986	I propose to take Questions Nos. 540 and 541 together.There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme.  However, the terms of the scheme will be reviewed in the context of the Government's proposals for Universal Health Insurance and free GP care at the point of delivery.Under the Drug Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than €120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.

I will arrange to have it forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available to me.Funding in relation to 2012 for community based drugs initiatives, such as Coolmine Therapeutic Community, will be determined in the context of the Estimates process, taking into account the need to protect front line service provision.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	993	Firstly, a National Substance Misuse Strategy was established in 2009. It is examining the development of policy to deal with a wide range of key issues relating to the supply, pricing, availability and marketing of alcohol — including the question of a minimum price for alcohol — along with measures for the policy areas of prevention strategies, treatment, rehabilitation and substance dependency, research and information. The report of the Steering Group is close to completion. I expect to receive proposals in the coming months and I will then brief my colleagues in Government on these.In the meantime, the health promotion services of the Health Service Executive (HSE) are undertaking key activities nationally to address the issue of alcohol misuse. In the Education setting, current activities include support for the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme; alcohol and drug awareness training for teachers/staff and parents; the development of a substance use policy; and the current development of materials for young people on alcohol by — among others — HSE staff and representatives from a variety of organisations.In the community setting, the health promotion services are engaged in a number of programmes and projects. These include the Putting the Pieces Together programme that targets youth between the ages of 10 to 18 years, parents and communities of mixed abilities in literacy skills for the purpose of tackling substance use in the community; the Strengthening Families programme that is an evidence based parenting skills, children’s life skills and family life skills training programme aimed at preventing and reducing alcohol and drug misuse; a community training programme that provides scheduled and on-demand training to community groups on alcohol awareness; a social marketing programme made up of national media campaigns using information websites such as www.drugs.ie, www.yourdrinking.ie and www.healthpromotion.ie — along with regional awareness raising events such as Drug Awareness week; club projects that are developed on a partnership basis for the purpose of working with the owners and staff of licensed premises to identify and address issues arising from alcohol and drug misuse in their venues and local areas.In the health setting, the HSE is developing a Brief Interventions/Skills health training programme for HSE staff to include a module for addressing alcohol related risk behaviours. A report on the work of "Towards a Framework for Implementing Evidence Based Alcohol Interventions" and the results of a feasibility test for screening and brief interventions in four hospital emergency departments was completed in July 2011. The results show that there was good cooperation from the public with only 6% declining to be screened.  The screening tool detected 36% requiring brief advice and 9% required referral to specialist services. In total 49% required no further intervention.Following from the report's recommendations, the project has finalised A Guiding Framework for Education and Training in Screening and Brief Intervention for Problem Alcohol Use for Nurses and Midwives in Acute, Primary and Community Care Settings. This framework has been developed in partnership with the Office of Nursing and Midwifery Services Director. It aims to provide a standardised approach for the education and training of Nurses, Midwives and Allied Health Professionals who undertake screening and brief intervention. The framework supports safe, quality and effective care for service users who access healthcare across the HSE and promotes the effective management of problem alcohol use in acute, primary and community care settings. In partnership with drugs.ie, the project is at an advanced stage in the development of an online alcohol self-assessment tool and video-based brief interventions. This will initially be rolled out on drugs.ie and on the drugs.ie FaceBook page. HSE staff will have access to an online alcohol self assessment tool both as a patient resource and for personal use. The aim of the online intervention is to identify "at risk" individuals among the general population. Those whose alcohol use is likely to be harming their health or increasing their risk of future harm are the main target group intended to benefit from this initiative.Finally, the HSE has provided funding to a number of organisations in 2011, such as Alcohol Action Ireland, the Coombe Hospital, Crosscare, GAA, Northwest Alcohol Forum, Trinity College, and No Name clubs for various initiatives, activities and research in the area of alcohol and drugs misuse.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	996	I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.

The review will serve as a platform for discussion and will inform the development of an overall strategy on how the HSE should continue to provide this service in future in view of current budgetary and other pressures.

The current annual rural practice allowance is €17,530.89 and there are over 190 GPs in receipt of the allowance.Under the Programme for Government, it is intended to develop a new contractual framework for GPs which will be more suited to current needs and will facilitate the planned development of Primary Care Services.  Mechanisms for encouraging GPs to set up practices in rural and urban disadvantaged areas will be considered, as appropriate, in the context of this review of the GMS GP Contract.

Works on those roads and bridges are funded from local authorities own resources and are supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.I understand that the estimated cost to replace the bridge over the Tramore River on the Kinsale Road is approximately €1.1 million. Cork County Council has been provided with a total of €160,955 for this project between 2007 and 2010. The Council was allocated a grant of €837,000 for this project at the beginning of 2011. I understand that most of the monies allocated for this project in 2011 will not be drawn down due to a delay in the project proceeding. I am not in a position to say when the cause of the delay will be resolved by Cork County Council.

In most cases, drivers improve as they gain experience. Unfortunately, not all licensed drivers behave responsibly. It is therefore necessary to have in place legal mechanisms whereby drivers who behave in a seriously irresponsible way may have sanctions imposed on them, including the withdrawal of their licences for a period. These sanctions would have little effect if we allowed drivers whose licences had been withdrawn because of serious violations of the law to continue to drive on our roads.While we can often learn valuable lessons from other jurisdictions, I do not propose to follow the example cited by the Deputy in this particular case. It is worth adding that, in Australia, driver licensing is a matter for the individual States rather than the national Government, and I understand than not all States follow the practice referred to by the Deputy.

The next policy priority was to support projects which would add value and maximise the return from existing infrastructure. Given the overall Exchequer funding position, affordability of new projects was a key factor. If a project cannot be afforded, the arguments pertaining to economic return are irrelevant.Cost benefit analyses are carried out for projects as required under the Government's Capital Appraisal Guidelines. In the case of the major public transport projects in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) these are independently reviewed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) and published on their website.The two large public transport projects for the GDA, Metro North and Dart Underground were planned as  PPP projects which in addition to requiring private funding also required large Exchequer contributions. In my review I concluded that these projects were not affordable during the new plan period. In addition to the uncertainties relating to the capital markets it was clear that Exchequer funds of the magnitude required would not be available unless at the expense of essential maintenance.Luas BXD which will be fully Exchequer funded and constructed on a phased basis has been prioritised as it has a strong business case, is affordable and will create a Luas network through linking the two existing Luas lines, serve areas of the North city such as Grangegorman, Phibsborough and Cabra and integrate with rail services on the Maynooth and Dunboyne lines as well as Quality Bus Corridor cross city/city centre bus services. Luas BXD will result in up to 10 million extra trips on the Luas network, exploiting the value in the investment made to date in Luas infrastructure.

Moreover, Fáilte Ireland provides a range of training and support programmes for tourism industry personnel, including in the area of customer service.Tourism Ireland also capitalises on accolades such as ‘Europe's Friendliest City' -which was awarded to Dublin last year by users of popular travel website TripAdvisor — to promote Ireland overseas.The Tourism Agencies and the tourism industry across Ireland have worked closely together to reinvigorate the traditional Irish welcome offered to overseas visitors. For example, a recent pilot initiative called ‘SHINE TOWN' involved collaboration between Tourism Ireland, Fáilte Ireland and Athy to ensure that tourists visiting Athy experience the best possible service. The roll-out of the SHINE TOWN programme in Athy included:training programmes for all front-line staff, run by Fáilte Ireland;competitions for schools to get the local children involved and thinking about the project;promotions and competitions on local radio to help raise awareness;the local council putting up signs saying "Athy — Ireland's First SHINE TOWN"; and the creation of a special SHINE map in conjunction with Fáilte Ireland, listing the top ten things to do in and around the town.Tourism Ireland's 2012 strategy will see the roll-out of a new brand advertising campaign which will capture the essence of a holiday here and play to our strengths — our people and icons. I look forward to launching Tourism Ireland's 2012 Marketing Plans on 30 November.Finally, at the recent Global Irish Economic Forum, I launched proposals for the biggest tourism initiative ever staged in Ireland — "The Gathering" — which will be a year-long event in 2013 where people at home and abroad can play a part in the country's recovery, potentially bringing 325,000 extra visitors and providing a major economic stimulus.

The processing of individual applications within these criteria is a matter for the IWA and the DDAI. My Department has no role in processing such applications.The IWA and DDAI are not State agencies and, as such, are not subject to the governance of my Department.However, as part of the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme, the IWA and DDAI both have an appeals process in cases where applications are rejected. I would advise the applicant to whom the Deputy's Question refers to avail of the appeal process of whichever of the two organisations has rejected his application. I would expect that the organisation would make clear its grounds for refusing the application in the context of the appeal, if it has not already done so, in notifying the individual of its refusal.

No. 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for the delivery of the National Car Test (NCT). The award of the contract for carrying out the NCT and the criteria applying thereto is a matter for the RSA.Analysis of test outcomes by age of vehicle indicates that older cars are less likely to pass the NCT. It is also the case that the average age of cars in Ireland has increased since the introduction of the NCT, resulting in slightly lower overall pass rates in recent years. This is a trend that will accelerate later in 2012 as the effect of annual testing of older vehicles impacts the statistics. However, I am informed that this effect, and the associated increase in overall testing volumes, was anticipated when the competition for the National Car Testing Service (2010-2019) was held in 2008. As a result, the impact was reflected in the tendered price for the test and retest at the time of the competition.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1025	The RSA acted swiftly and proactively to address the issues raised in the programme to which the Deputy refers. Seven staff were suspended immediately, of which three were subsequently dismissed. Further investigations resulted in the dismissal of three additional members of staff. Whilst any process that results in loss of employment is disappointing, it demonstrates that, given evidence of wrongdoing, NCTS will act quickly and decisively. The volume of internal and independent inspections of NCTS has been stepped up in the last few months. This includes an increased number of focused reviews based on risk factors and more targeted test re-inspections.I am informed that there has been an increased focus on reducing the opportunity for fraud and improving the focus on specific investigations, while ensuring that staff are fully aware of their obligations and of the consequences of a failure to meet those standards. The goal is to reduce further the potential for fraudulent activities or incorrect test results in the future, although it must be recognised that no supervision and inspection process, no-matter how robust, can completely eradicate instances of fraudulent activity where human judgment and discretion is integral to the accepted process. I am assured that the RSA will continue to take every possible action to tackle these issues.The related criminal investigation is ongoing and is a matter for An Garda Síochána.

I have no plans to allow motorcyclists access to bus lanes. Under Action 100 of the Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012, the Road Safety Authority (RSA) and other stakeholders created a Working Group to examine the case for allowing motorcyclists to use bus lanes from a road safety perspective. The report of this Group was submitted by the RSA to my Department in July 2008. It concluded that there was no case on a road safety basis nor on environmental or congestion grounds to allow motorcyclists access to bus lanes.

The current laws only provide for clamping by local authorities, or those acting as their agents, on public streets and in local authority car parks. This leaves unregulated the whole area of clamping on private property.I have given careful consideration to the issues inherent in regulating the clamping industry and, from the concerns expressed to me by the general public, it is evident that regulation of the industry will require getting a number of details correct, not least of which will be to ensure the provision of an appropriate and fit for purpose appeals mechanism in order to offer redress against perceived or alleged clamping malfeasance.To this end I propose, in the near future, to present a discussion document to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and Gaeltacht on the issues involved in regulating the industry, together with my proposals on the shape of appropriate legislation. When I have received a response from the Joint Committee, I will submit draft legislation to the Government for approval and hope to  bring a Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas in 2012.
