#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18960	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Within the next half hour the International Monitoring Commission will publish its report. When will the Government give its official reaction to the report? I understand the Government has had advance sight of the report and the House would like to be party to whatever comments and reaction the Government might make in this regard.Today will also see publication of a report into the sad death of Róisín Ruddle. The Order Paper contains a Nurses (Amendment) Bill. It is a sad reflection on our health service to plan for a known shortage in intensive care nursing. I understand the report will indicate that the Department of Health and Children was aware for years of this growing problem. What changes will be made to address these shortages? We read in the newspapers this week that the national task force on medical staffing has been abandoned by the Government. What does the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children propose to do to allow a proper debate on this matter in the context of greatly needed reform in the nursing area.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I call Deputy McManus on the second issue raised by Deputy Bruton.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	12	We all feel great sympathy for the family of Róisín Ruddle on a terrible tragedy. I hope that at least some good can come of the matter. Will the Tánaiste finally recognise the serious deficiencies in the flow of nurses into our hospitals? We have a major problem in retaining nurses, particularly in the Dublin hospitals, even though a sufficient number of them is being trained. When the report is published will the Tánaiste allow a full debate in this House? We are all extremely concerned, particularly as no new nurses will graduate or qualify this year due to changes in the training scheme. I urge the Tánaiste to agree to a debate on the report and the issues relating to it in the House at the earliest opportunity.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Does the Tánaiste agree that the sad and tragic death of Róisín Ruddle is symptomatic of the crisis in our health service? We do not seek the world-class health service the Tánaiste has promised. Instead, we would like a simple assurance. Can she promise the House that she will speedily implement the health strategy? That is all we are looking for. We do not expect the fantastic health service the Tánaiste has promised at this stage, but simply a basic health service.

I join other Deputies in appealing to the Tánaiste, who is responsible for this area as Minister for Health and Children, to consider the report into the death of Róisín Ruddle, which will be published today, and subsequently to take a proactive approach to the critical needs within the acute hospital services system. I emphasise the importance of tackling the shortage of front-line health care workers.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Deputy Bruton asked about the report of the monitoring committee. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will make a statement when the report is published.Our thoughts today are with the parents of the late Róisín Ruddle, Helen and Ger Ruddle, who have had to come to terms with the tragedy of the unexpected death of their daughter at the age of two. The publication today of the report on her death will cause them to recall in stark detail the trauma they suffered at that time. We have to learn lessons from what happened in this case. Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin has taken corrective action on foot of many of the report's recommendations. Earlier this week, I met the new manager and director of nursing who have been appointed. A number of the report's recommendations on the management of the hospital have been taken on board. In particular, a person has been appointed to take charge of the recruitment and retention of nurses.We are changing the requirements for entry into the nursing profession. Deputy McManus has acknowledged that a graduate programme is being put in place. Some 1,640 nursing students were recruited this year. We need to establish a graduate programme for midwifery and paediatrics to shorten the timeframe for training in such areas. It can take up to eight years to become an ICU paediatric nurse. There is a worldwide shortage of such workers. Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin has been given the resources to help it to engage in international recruitment. I discussed the hospital's plans to recruit overseas with its officials the other day.There are more nurses in the Irish health service, proportionately, than in almost any other country in Europe. We have substantially more nurses than the UK. We need to ensure that the particular shortages of nurses in intensive care, paediatrics and other areas are addressed. There is substantial interest in the new education programme for nursing. The number of students who applied for nursing last year was eight times greater than the number of places. It is clear that we have to resolve some of the issues relating to retention. I have had discussions with the nursing authorities in that regard.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	16	The simple solution is to make more training places available.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Nurses from Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and many European countries are going overseas as well. The report into the death of Róisín Ruddle contains recommendations about gaps, particularly in ICU, which affect cardiac and other serious forms of surgery. We need to ensure that intensive care units are staffed at all times so they can deal with patients who require surgery.

However, there are questions on this matter that require a legislative response. Do we genuinely seek to remove welfare traps from our welfare code? Will the Social Welfare Bill address this?

As I stated previously, it contains the most important legislative proposals on policing ever to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Bill is comprehensive in that it will replace, with only a couple of exceptions, all of the Garda Síochána Acts dating back to 1924. It will act as a modern constitution for a modern and even more professional police force at the beginning of a new century.Since I decided to publish the general scheme of the Bill with detailed explanatory notes in July 2003, I have been receptive to the comments and observations of interested parties and the public in general on the Bill's provisions. Submissions were invited on the general scheme and approximately 15 individuals and bodies took the opportunity to correspond on the Bill. In September 2003, I participated in a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to discuss the draft proposals and hear the views of committee members. Consultations continue with Garda management and the Garda associations. I am grateful to everyone who expressed views on the original proposals, including the Human Rights Commission which raised several points but broadly welcomed the Bill. This input contributed to my deliberations since the original proposals were published and the Bill reflects my Department's detailed consideration of every view conveyed to it.I remain receptive to suggestions from Deputies that may further improve the Bill, which aims to support the efficient and effective operation and administration of a 21st century police force; promote a good relationship between the Garda Síochána, Government and the Oireachtas; provide appropriate independent inspection and complaints investigation mechanisms; and command and maintain the confidence and respect of the public and members of the Garda Síochána in equal measure.The Bill was introduced in the Seanad in February 2003 where there were full, lengthy and robust exchanges during the three Second Stage sittings on 2, 4, and 11 March 2004, and the six sittings on Committee Stage on 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 and 15 December 2004. Overall, the Bill was well received and the changes made as it progressed through the Seanad have sharpened its focus in some areas.In the time allowed and given the extent of the Bill I can provide only an overview of some of its main provisions, highlighting key aspects as I go. I will be interested to hear the initial views of Deputies.Most of the changes made in the Seanad were technical and do not warrant significant attention in this House. The key amendments however concern sections 31 and 32, dealing with the establishment and composition of joint policing committees with local authorities, and sections 105-112 where a new Part 5 was inserted to provide for the establishment of a Garda Síochána inspectorate.The Bill as initiated has two main objectives. One is to reform the legislative structure under which the Garda Síochána is managed. This involves clarifying the role and objectives of the force and redefining its relationship with the Minister, the Government and the Oireachtas. It also provides for a new mechanism to deal with complaints by members of the public against members of the Garda Síochána.Both objectives aim to meet key commitments in the programme for Government. I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad to provide a third objective for the Bill, namely, the establishment of an independent Garda Síochána inspectorate which will provide independent advice to the Minister in respect of the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations and administration of the Garda Síochána.During the debates in the Seanad there were references to the policing function in the United Kingdom and the establishment of the Office of the Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland. Circumstances here are quite different from those in the United Kingdom and in many other jurisdictions. In countries where there are several separate police forces, different structures are required from those in countries such as Ireland where there is a single, national police force. In the United Kingdom, for example, there are 43 regional police constabularies and several related but separate national law enforcement agencies, including the intelligence and security services, colloquially known as MI5 and MI6.Here, the Garda Síochána is responsible for all policing matters and the intelligence and security functions relating to the security of the State. The structures as proposed in the Bill reflect this and are designed to meet our policing and security needs. Police complaints system models were examined in several jurisdictions, not just Northern Ireland, as a basis for the proposals in the Bill. We have learnt from and adapted the experience elsewhere to our needs and circumstances in the Bill.The proposals in Part 2 of the Bill reflect the outcome of the review of the Garda Síochána carried out under the Government's strategic management initiative which set down some fundamental principles namely, the roles and functions of the Minister and the Garda Síochána should be clear; the management of the force should be responsible for operations, including finances; and the level of democratic accountability should be enhanced.The provisions of the Bill covering the management of the Garda Síochána set out for the first time in legislation the functions and objectives of the force. The practice of gardaí initiating prosecutions in the name of the Director of Public Prosecutions is placed on a statutory footing.While existing legislation is silent on the relationship between the Minister and the Garda Commissioner, which has changed substantially, this Bill openly defines their roles and relationship. Provision is made for the Minister to set policing priorities and to issue directives to the Garda Commissioner on a policing matter.These measures attracted some criticism in the Seanad where it was suggested that some provisions may politicise policing or have the effect of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform controlling the operation of the police force. This is far from the truth, these provisions aim to clarify the separate roles of the Minister and the Garda Commissioner and to provide a transparent accountability structure.The outbreak of foot and mouth disease is an example of a case in which a directive might be issued. Should such a situation arise again, the Garda Síochána might be required to close the Border immediately. There should be provision in law for such directives to issue. It should not be a matter for the judgment of the Garda Commissioner because it entails other issues such as governmental competence.One can never foretell when the State's capacity to respond decisively and effectively to a significant event will be tested. This type of legislative provision will help support the State in responding efficiently to unforeseen events and as such it is an essential feature of the Bill.There will be nothing secretive about this as the Bill contains inbuilt safeguards. Provision is made for every directive to be approved by Government and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, unless that would prejudice national security and even where it would, the fact that a directive had issued must be disclosed to both Houses.No directive could ever interfere with the independence of the Garda Síochána in prosecutions. These safeguards provide the necessary openness and transparency to assure everyone that the process of issuing directives will not be abused and the requirements of democratic accountability will be met.The Garda Commissioner is to be assigned new powers and responsibilities for the deployment of the force, financial matters and civilian support staff. The Garda Commissioner will take over responsibility as accounting officer for the Garda Síochána from the Secretary General of my Department and will appear before the Committee of Public Accounts in that capacity.Other Oireachtas committees are not mentioned because the Garda Commissioner is required under other legislation to appear before them. The new powers and responsibilities assigned to the Garda Commissioner will be accompanied and balanced by more comprehensive accountability measures including the establishment of a statutory audit committee with independent members.The Bill also provides for the establishment of joint policing committees. These will provide fora on which the Garda Síochána and local authorities can co-operate and work together to address local policing and other related issues managed by the local authorities, and where the gardaí can press for their interests to be taken into account. This is a significant innovation which will strengthen policing at local level. Shortly after my appointment as Minister, Deputy Rabbitte pressed upon me the importance of making this provision and this measure is in part a response to that proposal.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	182	While the establishment of policing committees has been broadly welcomed there was much debate about the provisions in the Bill as initiated on Committee Stage in the Seanad. This transcended political lines and party ideologies. The key points raised were primacy at local level of elected representatives and town councillors who had a mandate, the involvement of Members of the Seanad and the Dáil on the committees and the appropriateness of the committees operating within the framework of city and county development boards as was the original model.In the light of the debates, changes were made in section 30 to introduce representation on the committees at town council level and I have moved away completely from the county and city development boards model. A number of changes were also made to section 31(2) on making the guidelines governing the establishment of the committees which have been expanded to include points raised in the Seanad concerning, for example, Members of the Oireachtas, not just the Dáil, being on the committee, nomination of members by local authorities, the appointment of a chairperson from the local authority members, nomination by the Garda Commissioner of gardaí of adequate rank and seniority, the establishment of sub-committees, the term of office of the committee, the application of qualified privilege, the attendance of bodies and persons before the committee, an enabling type of provision to allow for guidelines to facilitate the attendance of Members of the Oireachtas and the circumstances in which meetings of the committee may be held other than in public.In framing those proposals, I have taken into account the views and recommendations of the National Crime Council. I have explained to the chairman of the council, Mr. Padraic White, whom I met earlier this week, the reasons the provisions in the Bill differ in some respects from those favoured by the council. I am considering further points made to me by Mr. White and I may bring forward further amendments to these provisions on Committee Stage. He is particularly anxious that voluntary and community bodies should have some recognition on the committee. Naturally, I will be very interested to hear the views of Members on these important and novel measures.Significant provisions are included in the Bill in regard to upholding and protecting human rights. The Garda Síochána must have regard to this important new element in performing its functions. The revised solemn declaration new members of the Garda Síochána must make will also contain a specific reference to upholding human rights, and this will be underpinned by a provision in the Bill for drawing up a new code of ethics for the Garda.

This provision attracted much comment during the debates in the Seanad. As I stated last week, this is entirely separate from the business of increasing the strength of the force to 14,000 members, and I make it clear that in no way do I consider a Garda reserve to be a substitute for a professional full-time police force in the community. In the light of recent ill-informed comment on the subject, I emphasise that the provision is contingent on the making of specific proposals to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by the Garda Commissioner on the training issue and the making of regulations dealing with that matter, as well as recruitment and terms and conditions of service.The intention would be that committed members of the public could volunteer to provide a reserve of part-time personnel to support the work of the Garda Síochána. Legislation has existed since the 19th century in the United Kingdom providing for the appointment of special constables who to this day provide a valuable and unsalaried role involving members of the community in policing. Almost every common law country with a system similar to ours has some form of police reserve of that kind.The confidentiality of information provisions, set out in section 55, were amended slightly on Committee Stage in the Seanad. The effect of the changes was to expand the circumstances in which a person may disclose information which may have a harmful effect. The original provisions were perhaps a little too restrictive and the changes made allowed a little more latitude to persons performing duties coming within the ambit of section 55. For consistency, a similar change was made in section 73 which deals with confidentiality of information provisions to be applied to persons performing duties in the ombudsman commission.As I stated earlier, the second objective to be achieved under the Bill is establishment of an independent Garda Síochána ombudsman commission to investigate complaints by members of the public against members of the Garda. The new body will replace the existing Garda Síochána Complaints Board. While the existing board has performed well given the limitations of the existing legislation, it is clear the present system does not command full public confidence and the complaints board itself, to be fair, has identified the problems it has encountered. Therefore, change is necessary and a new mechanism must be put in place to ensure openness and transparency if public confidence in the investigation of complaints against members of the Garda Síochána is to be reclaimed.A significant development is that the new body will not require the catalyst of a complaint being made by a member of the public before it can initiate an investigation. Provisions are included in the Bill which will enable the ombudsman commission to investigate Garda conduct even where no complaint has been made, but where an investigation is clearly called for in the particular circumstances. The commission will be able to act on its own initiative in such cases or on a referral from the Garda Commissioner or the Minister.As regards its membership, the commission will consist of three persons, one of whom must be a man and one of whom must be a woman. The provision is made for the possible appointment of a superior court judge to one of the positions. The appointments will be to full-time positions for a term of between three and six years and the members will be appointed by the President on the nomination of the Government and on the recommendation of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The ombudsman commission will be independent in its composition and its investigations. None of its members can be a current or former member of the Garda Síochána.As regards the investigation of complaints, every complaint will be either made to or referred to the ombudsman commission. In the case of the most serious complaints, involving death or serious injury, provision is made for the ombudsman commission to investigate, which will satisfy a requirement under the European Convention on Human Rights. In the event of any other complaint, it will be a matter for the commission, exercising its — I stress "its"— independent judgment, to decide whether it should investigate the matter or refer it to the Garda Commissioner for investigation. In cases where complaints are referred to the Garda Commissioner, the commission can decide whether to supervise the investigation. If the commission is not satisfied with the progress or even the outcome of an investigation, whether supervised or not, it can take over the investigation itself at any time. Therefore, the commission will retain ultimate independent control over every investigation. In that respect, the statutory powers of the ombudsman commission are the same as those in Northern Ireland.It was stated in the Seanad on a number of occasions, and I am sure I will hear it again in this House, that the Bill provides for gardaí to investigate gardaí. In no way do I accept that the Bill provides for gardaí to investigate gardaí as a matter of course. No matter what route is chosen by the ombudsman to investigate complaints, ranging from the most serious allegations including possible criminal offences to those at the lower end of the scale including breaches of discipline, the commission retains control and direction over the whole proceedings. I cannot emphasise this point strongly enough.As regards more minor complaints, and when I say that I am talking in relative terms as every complaint is important to the person making it, I hope many of them will be amenable to the informal resolution or mediation processes provided for in the Bill. While the existing system has provision for informal resolution, it simply has not worked. The provisions of the Bill are directed at promoting informal resolution in cases where the ombudsman commission considers it appropriate and where all parties concerned agree.The ombudsman commission will be able, at the Minister's request or following the Minister's approval of a recommendation of the commission itself, to examine Garda practices, policies or procedures with a view to preventing or reducing the future incidence of complaints arising from those practices, policies or procedures. Therefore, the system proposed will have the capacity to deal with systemic problems which give rise to complaints.The staff of the ombudsman commission, both administrative and investigative, will have civil servant status. The commission will also be able to enter into arrangements with the Garda Síochána or other police forces, or any other body, to engage police officers or other persons on a temporary basis to assist it in carrying out its investigations. Similar provisions exist in Northern Ireland. In the early days of the commission's operation, time will be required for its staff to gain experience and get up to speed in carrying out civil and criminal investigations. It therefore makes sense to empower the commission at its own discretion to make use of such expertise.The commission's investigative staff will have comprehensive powers of criminal and civil investigation. When I published the details of the general scheme, I deliberately omitted the detail of the investigative powers to be given to the commission as I wanted time to consider what would be required to ensure we got it right. I concluded that, where criminal offences are involved, the commission must be capable of conducting an investigation to the same standard as the Garda Síochána. Therefore, its investigating officers must essentially have the same powers as members of the Garda Síochána, frightening though this may be for those who see it in print for the first time. The Bill confers on designated officers of the ombudsman commission all the powers and immunities and all the duties imposed on any member of the Garda Síochána by or under any enactment or the common law. There are two exceptions to this: powers under the Offences Against the State Acts and powers under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, other than the power to gain access to call-related information, known as telephonic data.An aspect of the powers to be conferred on the commission which attracted considerable attention in the Seanad and the media is the special provision for the search of Garda stations, in recognition of the position of the Garda as a security service and the fact that information relating to national security could be held in some stations. As there has been much misunderstanding about these provisions, I will explain precisely what the Bill provides for in this regard. There have been inaccurate suggestions that the special provisions dealing with Garda stations holding information relating to national security apply to searches of Garda stations generally. This is not the case.Section 91 deals with the search of Garda stations. Designated officers will have power to enter and search any Garda station for the purpose of investigating complaints which may involve offences. Such searches must be authorised by a member of the ombudsman commission. Where the station which is the subject of a search holds sensitive security information, subsection (3) provides that the commission must notify the Minister and the Garda Commissioner of the intended search. It does not provide for a period of one, three, 12 or 24 hours, as has been canvassed. That is not provided for in the Bill. The Garda Commissioner may object to a search, but only on grounds relating to national security and for no other reason. In such circumstances, provision is made for the Minister to issue directions excluding from the search any part of the premises in question or any storage facility containing information or documentation or to impose the necessary conditions relating to the security of the State.So that there will be no confusion about the stations likely to be involved, provision is made for regulations to be made designating Garda stations where information or documentation relating to the security of the State is held and which shall not be subject to search except to the extent that the Minister so directs. Regulations may also be made designating information or documentation relating to the security of the State which must not be disclosed, except to the extent that the Minister so directs.These exceptional limitations, which are exceptions to a general rule, are reasonable and essential having regard to the fact that the Garda Síochána is not just a regional constabulary but a national security service. No other security service in the world would allow people to walk in off the street and start rooting through its files and records. I will not introduce such a rule into Irish law. I am sensitive to the concerns expressed in some quarters that the exceptions might be too readily invoked. As I explained in the Seanad, this is the reason I included a counter-balancing safeguard in the Bill. Provision is made for a judge of the High Court to have oversight of the operation of the provisions of the Bill authorising the withholding of, or denial of access to, information on grounds of State security. This will be a sufficient deterrent against potential abuse of these provisions. I reiterate that a judge of the High Court will have the function of examining every time that particular immunity is invoked, supervising it and being in a position to give an objective view as to whether it has been abused on any occasion.As I mention judicial oversight, I should also mention that provision is made for judicial oversight of the conduct of designated officers of the ombudsman commission. This is in recognition of the extensive powers being granted to them under the Bill. The phrase, quis custodiet ipsos custodes, immediately comes to mind. It was a key concern of the Garda associations when I met them. A superior court judge, nominated by the Chief Justice, will be able to conduct an inquiry into any allegations that the ombudsman commission’s officers may have abused their powers or position.It might be recalled that the Director of Public Prosecutions commented previously on the impact of the normal six-month time limit for summary prosecutions in cases dealt with under the present complaints system. The DPP pointed out that investigation files on complaints can be almost date-expired when they reach his office, thereby making prosecution decisions impossible, no matter how strong the evidence may be. While one response to this would obviously be speedier investigations, which I favour, I also think it right to take the opportunity to provide that the normal time limit of six months, which was originally set down in the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851, should be 12 months for summary proceedings relating to an offence reported to the DPP under the Bill. The Bill provides accordingly in section 96.The most significant addition to the Bill, which was brought forward on Committee Stage in the Seanad, involves the inclusion of a new Part 5 providing for the establishment of a new body to be called the Garda Síochána inspectorate. My decision to establish the inspectorate had its origins in the first report of the tribunal established under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Frederick Morris to inquire into allegations of Garda corruption in Donegal. Specifically, the proposal is brought forward in light of recommendation 13.96 on page 489 of the tribunal's report that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in line with its statutory oversight role in regard to the Garda Síochána, must be empowered by knowledge. Therefore, the main functions of the inspectorate will be to ensure that the Minister and the Department have objective information on matters relevant to the functioning of the force in line with the aims of the Bill to make further and better provisions in regard to the Garda Síochána. There is no point being accountable to this House if one does not know what is going on.The inspectorate will be a three-person body, one of whom will be known as the chief inspector. The inspectorate will examine thematic policy issues with standards, practice and performance benchmarked to comparable international policing experience. The key objectives will be to ensure and promote advice and support to the Minister and the Department. I am confident this body will ensure that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day will be better informed on particular aspects of the policing function and will be in a position to give up-to-date and accurate information to the Members of this House and the other House as required and in accordance with his or her constitutional and statutory obligations.Section 122 deals with the exercise of special powers by security officers. There was confusion over this provision in the Seanad. This is an enabling provision allowing the head of any of the bodies listed in subsection (1), for example, the Courts Service, the Office of the Attorney General, the National Gallery, a Department etc., to take on private security staff in certain well defined and regulated situations. The intention underlying these provisions is to facilitate the release of highly qualified members of the force for duties for which they were trained. It is certainly not the intention that private security personnel will replace the Garda security presence at all locations.Special mention was made in the Seanad of the position regarding the courts and these Houses. In this regard, there will continue to be a need for a Garda presence in both cases. It will be a question of finding the right balance as to the Garda presence required in association with the security presence. With regard to the recent announcement by the Courts Service about new security arrangements which will operate in the Four Courts complex, these arrangements, which have been put in place independently of this Bill, are not linked with the special powers provisions of section 122.There was also much concern in the Seanad that the Bill was providing for police powers to be given to these security officers. I stress that security officers will not have general police powers. Their powers are set out in subsection (4). In the main they relate to what might be regarded as normal checking of identity, examination and seizure of articles, refusal of entry and use of reasonable force where necessary. Their capacity to search a person is limited and there is no mention in the section of their being given a power of arrest. In the latter regard, security officers will be no different from other members of the public who decide to make an arrest under section 4 of the Criminal Law Act 1997 which provides for what is colloquially termed a "citizen's arrest".I reiterate the importance the Government attaches to the significant reforms set out in the Bill. They have been carefully crafted and I advocate them in a spirit of support for the Garda Síochána. I have no doubt that the provisions contained in the Bill will underpin the sterling work of the Garda Síochána in protecting our freedom as individuals and as a society. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the force for the success of Operation Crossover as set out in today's newspapers. It is a pleasure on occasion to see that the forces of law and order, in an organised and systematic way, take on the threat to the security of society which exists in some quarters in an effective way which yields results.As I said in the Seanad, we must never forget the sacrifices individual members of the force have made for our protection. I want to reiterate this because they are criticised on many occasions, but very few of us would or could do their job for a week. I will not go into the detail of what they do, but it includes staying with bodies found dead, informing relatives, looking after victims of crime, preserving scenes of crime, standing up to thuggery and all the things most gardaí hope they will not have to do on a given day but expect they may have to do. When one considers what they do and are expected to do for us, some of their critics would not last a day in the job without cracking up.The task of the force has always been difficult, but challenging. Our society, which is policed by the Garda Síochána, is more questioning, sometimes more aggressive and less respectful of authority. The changing nature of our society with increased urbanisation, a decline in traditional authority structures and the like, all require a different form of policing. The Garda Síochána has to change to meet the changing Ireland.The force has been subjected to a fair deal of criticism in the recent past. It should accept criticism when failures are evident and where that criticism is fair. Nonetheless, when passing judgment on the force we should never forget the courage and good character which, for the most part, characterise daily policing. In my experience such qualities are much more constantly prevalent than any, or all, of the infrequent failures.We should never lose sight of the fact that the Garda Síochána is made up of ordinary men and women performing extraordinary tasks to whom we entrust the most challenging, demanding and difficult tasks in our community. There is goodwill, support, respect and trust for and in the Garda Síochána. My intention in the Bill is to build on those reserves and, as such, I commend this Bill to the House.

We in Fine Gael want the Garda Síochána to be the best police force in the world. That means a range of things. It means being the best resourced, best trained and best motivated force. It means having adequate numbers and being best managed. It also means being equipped with cutting edge technology and having decent modern accommodation and equipment. I am convinced that we have highly motivated new recruits coming into the force but they are coming into a system that is in major need of reform. The Bill does not provide for that reform.From the commissioner down to the newest recruit, there is a desire by members of the force to achieve their potential to provide the best they can in the interests of the force and that of the country, but they are trapped in an archaic system. It is archaic in regard to deployment, management and many other factors. This Bill will not change that to any great degree.I note the transfer of accountability to the commissioner, but the emphasis is on accountability and that is not enough. Our aim in regard to the public service generally must be that of achieving excellence. That is a principal policy priority for Fine Gael and very much one in regard to the Garda Síochána. We want to support the Garda Síochána to achieve that aim of excellence. This Bill does not do much towards achieving that objective.I have examined developments in this area in other countries, in particular the introduction of the CompStat approach in New York and the consequences of the influence of the former Mayor Giuliani. I have examined developments in the UK and the other part of this island in Northern Ireland as a consequence of the Patton reform. Are we giving the Garda Síochána the best chance from the point of view of allowing them to produce their best to achieve their full potential in doing their job? The Minister has not provided for that. That is a major reservation I have about the Bill.The Minister's objectives are far more limited than mine. His main objectives are designed to reform the legislative structure and, in particular, to clarify the role of the Minister as opposed to that of the commissioner. Another main objective relates to the complaints procedure. His third main objective relates to the inspectorate. In so far as they go, I go along with the Minister, and Fine Gael can support the Bill, in principle, with reservations on the details.The provisions as outlined by the Minister have to be examined against the backdrop of current realities in many areas, particularly that of resources, which are not provided for in the Bill. Day in day out our gardaí are at the coalface of the darker side of society. When the Minister and I are sleeping in our beds the gardaí are confronting dangerous situations and fighting crime. They deserve the best to match their willingness to put themselves on the line. From that point of view, the Minister has failed to win the battle for resources for the Garda.

I accept there is a limit to what a Bill, when enacted, can achieve. I am aware of the Minister's penchant for legislation and his belief that legislation is some kind of panacea, but more law does not necessarily mean more order. He can put in place structures here and make announcements there, but that is all abstract. What is happening on the ground in reality land is a different matter. I fear that the basic needs of gardaí are not being met and that limits their effectiveness in the fight against crime.I wish to deal with a few issues before I go into the detail of the Bill. An issue that concerns me is the annual haemorrhage of gardaí from the force. Those numbers are increasing. Up to a few years ago it was running at 400 a year and last year the number increased to 460. Early retirement seems to becoming more a feature of the force. I wish to make two points in that regard. First, an assessment should be carried out as to why there are early retirements and whether steps can be taken to ensure there is not that haemorrhage of experienced members from the force. Second, we have to bear in mind that Garda retirements, particularly the retirement of experienced members, puts more pressure on serving gardaí.I want to refer briefly to Garda numbers. They have not kept pace with the massive increase in population in recent years. The Minister will tell us that we now have the highest number of gardaí in the force. That is true, but a number of points can be made in that respect. The level of crime is up 25% on the 2000 figures. The Minister quotes selective statistics when he talks about reductions in crime. Following the rainbow Government period in office, crime figures were down to 90,000 in 1997, 85,000 in 1998——

He can give the impression that he is on top of the problem, but that just proves he is in denial. There are enormous problems of crime in our society. The crime figure have increased from 73,000 in 2000 to nearly 100,000 in 2004. The Minister tells us the problem is in hand and the crime figure is decreasing. There is also the youth problem of anti-social behaviour in our society. We do not have a sufficient number of gardaí to deal with these problems.I want to deal with the Minister's reference to 14,000 gardaí. That number of gardaí will not be on our streets in the near future. We need them now, but they are not there. They will not be on the streets during the Government's term of office. In spite of the Minister's spin, all we have had is an average increase of approximately 80 extra gardaí each year for the past three years while the Minister has been in office.

Some 373 gardaí are doing desk work. Why has the civilianisation programme not been implemented? Subject to medical examination, I take the view that there is major need for experienced supervisory gardaí. Why do we not consider allowing or encouraging sergeants and inspectors to stay in the force beyond the age of 57? I am in favour of initiatives such as the panel of retired gardaí in each division to stand in for gardaí who are on maternity leave or prolonged sick leave. Such ingenuity overcomes the problems that arise because the promise of the extra gardaí will not result in their being on the street for some time.We cannot even provide the gardaí with basic communications equipment. The radio system is obsolete. Gardaí must use their own mobile telephones to get in touch with the station. That is not good enough in this day and age. Also, some of the stations are in an appalling condition. Stations that have been on the priority list for years are becoming more dilapidated. This problem is not just limited to Finglas, where there has been justified publicity. The story is the same throughout the country. If we expect a modern, well equipped Garda force, we must provide it with decent stations.Some €60 million was spent developing PULSE but of the 703 stations in the country, only 181 have the system installed. This gives rise to the farcical situation of gardaí having to drive to a station with PULSE to input data. It is no wonder gardaí are not available when they are needed. They are off typing up reports. It is beyond belief in the technological age that this problem has not been overcome.The Bill is limited, it does not deal with the Garda Síochána in the way it deserves. Section 14 covers the Garda volunteer force. It enables the Minister to appoint volunteer members to the force, a tacit acknowledgement that he has not provided the 2,000 full-time members he promised. There is a case for a reserve force but volunteer members will have to be trained and the Minister does not appear to have addressed this. Section 14 states that volunteer members are to have the same immunities, privileges and duties as permanent members of the force. Volunteer members can only have the same powers as permanent members if they have the same training. It takes two years to train a member of the Garda Síochána. I am not happy with the notion of volunteer members having powers of search and arrest without having the training required by a full-time member of the force.

I have no problem with reserve members under the control and supervision of existing members of the Garda Síochána operating in crowd marshalling on All Ireland Final day. Depending on the degree of training, they could even form part of a visible presence in the community. I do not want, however, inadequately trained people to have the power of search and arrest, the basic power of the Garda Síochána.Some people have suggested that the additional powers granted to the Minister in the Bill turn him into the chief of police. At the moment, the Minister and the Garda Commissioner liaise and consult on an informal basis. The Minister has no statutory role of influence over the operations or focus of the day to day activities of the Garda Síochána and this Bill radically changes that. The Minster will have a substantive role in directing the gardaí and must approve substantive aspects of policing.The setting of Garda priorities, the Garda strategy statement and the annual policing plan must be submitted to the Minister for approval and the Minister can issue directives. The Minister mentioned a directive on foot and mouth disease in his speech, something to which no one would object, but how far will these directives go? Does this power offer the potential to politicise the activities of the Garda Síochána? The Minister may say that is not his intent but laws are not the Minister's intentions, they are the contents of the legislation. Is there a danger that the gardaí could be made act at the whim of a political master?The Minister was good enough to refer to the fact that I have some experience in this area when I resumed my role as Fine Gael spokesman on justice. I recall a Taoiseach and a Minister for Justice, Charles Haughey and Seán Doherty, and the activities that occurred at that time, the difficulties with various Garda files and phone tapping. I must bear that in mind when I look at the powers being granted to a Minister under this Bill. I have many criticisms of the Minister but I do not question his basic integrity when it comes to administrating the powers in the Bill, and I would have no difficulty in discharging those powers. We are not inserting powers for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, however, or for Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, we are inserting powers for whomever may in future be Minister. There was an abuse of this position in the past and we must bear that in mind when considering these powers.For the first time, the Bill will place the involvement of local authorities in policing matters on a statutory basis. Interaction between local authorities and the Garda Síochána is long overdue and Fine Gael has advocated it for some time. If communities are to experience a long-term reduction in crime, local authorities must take on a dedicated oversight role in policing matters, providing a forum for gardaí and local authorities to exchange views and co-ordinate their activities to bring real benefits to local communities. It will provide an opportunity for real interaction to bring back a sense of ownership to a public that has become dissatisfied with and distant from the criminal justice system. There is a rift in the relationship between the public and the Garda Síochána and I hope this provision will reverse that trend, a trend that arises from the fact that people do not even bother reporting crime in many cases any longer. My only criticism is that this process does not go far enough. It should extend below local authority level and involve local communities with the Garda Síochána.With regard to disclosure to journalists, I accept that the Minister has made substantial changes from the original head 26 of the scheme to the Bill. The offence of disclosure now only arises where the information disclosed has harmful effect and the Minister's definition of harmful effect is broad. The change is an improvement but it may not have gone far enough. I will go deeper into this on Committee Stage but there should not be a free flow of information between the gardaí and journalists. As a lawyer, I was used to the notion of confidentiality and, in general, the gardaí should treat matters arising in the course of their jobs as confidential. On the other hand, a free flow of information between the Garda Síochána and journalists could be of advantage to the Garda because journalists turn up information or leads that might be of use in Garda inquiries. I would not, therefore, want to preclude discussions between the Garda and journalists. There needs to be a balance and a middle line between allowing discussions that may be of benefit to the Garda Síochána in carrying out its job and ensuring that serious confidential matters are not disclosed. I would like the Minister to consider a new approach involving a code of ethics by which members of the Garda would be bound, rather than the creation of a criminal offence that could lead to 12 months in prison on summary conviction or seven years on indictment. One would also need to provide for a breach of such code of ethics, which could be dealt with under the Garda Síochána disciplinary regulations. That would not be such a heavy-handed approach but would cover the position even better than the amended approach now proposed by the Minister.The Garda complaints board has been the focus of consistent criticism for some time and does not now enjoy the confidence of the public. This is in no way intended to reflect negatively on the members or staff of the board. They performed as best they could under the regime under which they had to operate.Their hands were tied to a great extent and consequently the body failed to function as an effective, independent arbiter.The case for appointing an ombudsman has been well made and I do not propose to go over that. I have had an opportunity to examine the Garda complaints board's annual report for 2002. In that year the board received 1,405 complaints and at the end of the year it had 841 cases on hand and only 13 cases had been finalised by the tribunal. These figures do not reflect well on its operations. I am, therefore, all for a new approach and I favour the ombudsman model.The Minister is proposing an ombudsman commission composed of three persons to be appointed by the Dáil. The example of a police ombudsman of which we are most aware on this island is the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman, Ms Nuala O'Loan, a single ombudsman. I have been to see her in her office and have met some of her staff. I have seen the manner in which she operates and it seems to be very effective. Why do we need three ombudsmen when Ms Nuala O'Loan does the job very effectively on her own? That is an issue to which I would like to return.I particularly welcome the power of the ombudsman commission in section 94(4) to initiate an investigation on its own initiative. However, I would like to see the scope of such investigations widened considerably so that the commission could examine more general policing practices.There is a provision to allow the transfer of all the staff of the existing Garda complaints board to the ombudsman commission. Would this not tie the hands of the commission unduly? I am aware that many of the staff are very good at their jobs and very experienced, but is it fair to the new ombudsman commission to have no say in selecting its staff?In the context of the commission employing gardaí, not alone must justice be done, it must be seen to be done. The lack of independence and failure of the Garda complaints board to adhere to the fundamental principle of nemo iudex has ultimately led to its downfall. Is there not a danger of repeating that mistake? It is not acceptable that members of the Garda be brought into the ombudsman commission to investigate other gardaí. That is an issue we must tease out in more detail on Committee Stage. The people who investigate our gardaí are policemen. If it is not appropriate to have gardaí investigating other gardaí. Can we not look beyond our own boundaries to the UK, specifically Northern Ireland where there is now a very fine police force in the PSNI? I intend to revert on Committee Stage to a discussion on what might best be done in this regard.The Minister referred to the search of Garda stations but not in sufficient detail. I am not entirely happy with how he dealt with the requirement to give notice or the issue of security files. The Bill had provided that the inspectorate could search a Garda station on giving 48 hours' notice to the Garda Commissioner. In section 91, this has now been changed and the ombudsman commission must notify the commissioner and the Minister of its intent to search. Has the Minister achieved the right balance in the Bill as it is now amended? It is an issue that needs further teasing out. I understand that in the Seanad reference was made to a telephone call five minutes before an inspection. What would be the practicality of that? The Minister is now talking about judicial oversight. Is this before, during or after the telephone call five minutes before? The Minister has not dealt adequately with this issue and it is one with which we will have to deal in more detail on Committee Stage.The Minister has made the point ad nauseam that the Garda serves two roles here. It polices the State but also acts as our intelligence service. I accept there is no separate MI5 and MI6 here. If the Garda’s role in intelligence matters is of such a high level and is of such gravity, should we not establish a separate intelligence service? The issue is one to which we should return on Committee Stage.The inspectorate is a late addition to the Bill and my initial reaction is to support the establishment of some form of inspectorate. It could help to bring about improvements in the Garda and will be appreciated by gardaí as time goes on. An issue that arises is whether we need two separate bodies, an ombudsman commission with three persons on it and an inspectorate. Is there not a case to be made for one outside body that would perform all the functions? Is there not a danger of duplication of effort? The issue has not been fully thought through or fully debated. The ombudsman commission will consist of three persons. The inspectorate will also be a three-person body, one of whom will be known as the chief inspector. It will look at and examine thematic policy issues, standards, practice and performance, benchmarking and comparable international policing experience. I raise the possibility of having one outside body to deal with the various functions.There is a range of issues and much detail within and outside the Bill regarding the Garda Síochána that I would like to go into in more detail. We will have the opportunity of doing that on Committee Stage.One aspect of the Bill I heartily commend is the provision regarding the annual report. It has annoyed me as a Member of this House over the years to see various official bodies producing annual reports often more than a year after the period they cover, when the information is historical and out of date. Annual reports are useful in so far as they give a reasonably current assessment of the state of operations. They allow for informed and constructive criticism. However, a report that is more than a year out of date is historical and is virtually a waste of time. I recollect at one stage tabling questions to all Ministers as to when the annual reports of the State bodies under their aegis were produced. There are still some appalling examples of annual reports being years out of date. I am glad the Bill provides for an annual report to be furnished quickly. The optimum would be that an annual report should be furnished before the end of the first quarter following the year it covers. The Bill provides that it be furnished four months after the year's end. I can go along with that. Much complex detail goes into that report which is very useful. I support that heartily.Since assuming office the Minister has made provisional statistics available. That is a good practice but it is not much good when it is confused with the issue of an annual report a day later that contrasts with the figures in the provisional statistics. Hopefully the new provision will change that.The Fine Gael Party will support the Bill. It does not go anywhere near tackling the broad objectives I have outlined. The objectives of Fine Gael for the Garda Síochána would be far more ambitious. We have a dedicated body of men and women in the force, new recruits coming in with enormous potential and we have people who are highly motivated. They are operating in an archaic system that is in need of radical reform from the point of view of employment, management and so on. This Bill will not achieve that objective. There are improvements and advances in the Bill but it does not cover the essential problems of the force, such as lack of resources, the lack of input to modern technology and the kind of things that will allow us to have what I want for the Garda Síochána, namely, the best police force in the world. This Bill is but a modest advance towards that objective and in so far as it is I am prepared to support it.

It appears he prefers to spend most of his time making statements outside the House. When we are dealing with such a fundamental issue as the restructuring of the Garda Síochána, and fundamental legislation, I would have thought he would be present to hear what Deputies on the other side of the House have to say but, instead, he disappeared half way through Deputy O'Keeffe's presentation.The Garda Síochána has served the country well throughout most of the 20th century. However, at the beginning of the 21st century there is need to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of the force in a modern, urban, rapidly changing and complex society. Serious questions have been posed of the Garda Síochána in recent times ranging from harsh criticism by Judge Morris of misbehaviour and mismanagement by certain gardaí in Donegal, to the failure to tackle the spread of drugs nationwide, to the declining crime prevention and detection rate, to a rising clamour of public discontent regarding Garda professionalism and Garda commitment. The time has come for a root and branch review of the culture, role, structures and operations of the Garda. Unfortunately, this is not what we have here.It is time to establish an independent commission on policing in Ireland. It would be similar to that Independent Commission on Policing which was set up under the Good Friday Agreement in 1999 under the chairmanship of Chris Patten to create, in the words of the Agreement, "a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole".The terms of reference of the commission would require the identification and setting up of new structures to ensure accountability, independent scrutiny and, above all, partnership with the community. Its methodology, if the Minister wants to set it up, would involve a comprehensive consultative process. A wide-ranging public debate on policing in the 21st century would be initiated. The commission would take that debate to the highways and byways. It would engage local communities in local parish halls, the length and breadth of Ireland. Equally, those professionally involved in policing practice and theory including the Garda would be consulted and best international practice would be ascertained.In this context it is interesting to explore the thinking and methodology of the Patten Commission. The commissioners started out by rejecting Lord Denning's view — he of the "appalling vista"— that "the police officer is not a servant of anyone but of the law itself" and went on to quote with approval the first commissioners of the Metropolitan Police, Rowan and Maguire, who wrote as early as 1829 that:Every member of the force must remember that his duty is to protect and help members of the public, no less than to apprehend guilty persons. Consequently, whilst prompt to prevent crime and to arrest criminals he must look upon himself as the servant and guardian of the general public and treat all law abiding citizens, irrespective of their social positions, with unfailing patience, courtesy and good humour.Is not this what we would like to see all the time from the Garda Síochána? These sentiments mirror the statement of the first Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, Michael Staines, whose grandson is one of our chief criminal lawyers, who said in 1922 that, "the Garda Síochána will succeed not by force of arms or numbers but by their moral authority as servants of the people". These were brave sentiments in 1922 when the Civil War had just started and armed men were roaming the country. Even more than creating an unarmed police force, the founders of the State had got to the core of the issue. The police would be the servants of the people, no longer policing the community like the RIC it had replaced, but serving the community. In Northern Ireland the RUC had become a hopelessly polarised body. They were perceived as defenders of the Union from the Unionist perspective and oppressors of the people from the Nationalist perspective. The Patten commissioners asserted that "the police do not serve the State or any interest group, they serve the people by upholding the law that protects the rights and liberties of every individual citizen". The Minister would do well to reflect on these basic fundamental principles that were the starting point for the Patten Commission and the Garda Síochána in 1922 to the point of establishing our own independent commission to see the way forward. It would be valuable to look at the extraordinary, comprehensive methodology that was used. They set out on a course of informing and briefing their members by examining the existing policing arrangements in Northern Ireland, studying best practice worldwide and inviting written submissions from the general public and all political parties, churches, non-governmental organisations and bodies with a particular interest in policing. They held numerous private meetings with politicians, civil liberty groups, youth workers, editors and academics. They visited every police subdivision, every police station, police headquarters and spoke to individual police officers. They held oral meetings and hearings with political parties, businesses and trade unions. They held public meetings in every district council area in Northern Ireland. They employed consultants to conduct focus group studies and other consultants to conduct a cultural audit of the RUC. They carried out a survey on public attitudes to policing and the commission visited the Garda Síochána and a number of police services in Britain, Canada, South Africa, Spain and the United States.A more exhaustive process or methodology could hardly be envisaged. The findings of the Patten Commission constitute a valuable reservoir and resource of methodology and material to be drawn from and adapted.This was completed in a 12 to 15 month period. A new commission in the Republic could complete its work in six to nine months. A comprehensive and inclusive process is crucial. A lasting new police culture of service can only be delivered if a strong sense of participation, responsibility and ownership is first engendered through the consultative process. The Minister has missed a golden opportunity by failing to establish such a commission. The excellent proposals on community policing could now be jeopardised by a lack of an open, wide-ranging debate and consultative process prior to radically changing the future policing role of the Garda. It may not be possible to do it without having the background of a consultative process.The view of the Labour Party is that there is a need for a Garda authority to oversee operation of the Garda Síochána at national level, to set objectives and priorities, to adopt policing strategies and annual plans with the Garda Commissioner, to conduct interviews and make promotional appraisals, to negotiate the annual policing budget with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to monitor and evaluate Garda performance and to produce an annual report for the Minister. The Garda authority would be answerable to and appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and the Committee of Public Accounts as required.The Government has rejected the proposal for a new Garda authority made up of representatives of the community. Such an authority would be the only way to introduce full public accountability into the operations of the force.As an example of the direct relation being retained, section 18 provides that the civilian member of the force, whether transferred from the Department or newly appointed, is to be a civil servant of the Government. Why can he or she not be a civil servant of the State?Will the ombudsman have the power to investigate misbehaviour prior to the establishment of the office? Will the commission have the power of prior review? The lack of such an authority to act as a bulwark between the Commissioner and the Government means that there will continue to be an inappropriate degree of political interference in senior Garda appointments at every level above those of Garda sergeant and inspector. This remains a serious matter. A Garda authority would have the function of conducting the interviews and making promotional appraisals but this will not now be the case.The failure to legislate for a Garda authority represents another missed opportunity. The umbilical cord between the Minister and the Commissioner gave rise to Mr. Justice Morris's conclusion that, "The Department of Justice is now utterly isolated from Garda headquarters. The Minister is obliged to take everything on trust." He is utterly isolated in terms of knowing what is happening. Mr. Justice Morris recommended that headquarters should take a more active role in the management of Garda divisions etc. The Minister has now admitted to the House that the reason he has introduced an amendment to set up a Garda inspectorate is as a result of this criticism in Mr. Justice Morris's report. If the Minister establishes an independent Garda authority, he would not need to set up his own eyes and ears body to determine what is happening in the Garda. This is essentially what the inspectorate is. The poor Minister is now setting up this body so that he will have an eyes and ears structure to monitor the Garda. If the authority was in place this would not be necessary. This is another missed opportunity.However, the relationship between the Commissioner and the Minister is being placed on a formal basis, even if not an entirely open and transparent one. The Commissioner has direction and control of the force. He is the accounting officer of the Garda Vote and has power to enter into contracts. He is accountable to the Minister for his functions. According to the Act the Minister may issue written directives concerning any matter relating to the Garda Síochána, but the directives must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 22 envisages that the contents of a directive might be kept secret and instead the fact that it had been made would be disclosed. That information of itself would be entirely inadequate. Such lack of transparency must be addressed on Committee Stage.It goes without saying that a police force constituted to serve the people should be accountable to the people. Therefore, the discredited in-house Garda complaints machinery should be dismantled immediately. An independent Garda ombudsman should be established to ensure that Garda behaviour in the course of duty is above reproach at all times.The Irish Times -TNS MRBI opinion poll in February 2004, at the time when the establishment of an ombudsman was mooted, asked the following pertinent question:The Government is proposing to establish an Ombudsman and /or independent inspectorate to investigate complaints against the Gardaí. Do you believe that the independent inspectorate should or should not have full powers of search and arrest in the initiation of investigations against the Gardaí?An incredible 86% of those surveyed responded that the ombudsman should have full powers of search and arrest in the initiation of investigations against the Garda. Clearly the public have no faith in the existing Garda complaints machinery and they would support robust measures that would ensure Garda accountability.As the title Garda ombudsman commission suggests, the Bill provides for a compromise, half-way house proposal. On one hand, the three-member commission is to be appointed on the nomination of both Houses and can only be removed by joint resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Its independence is guaranteed. It will have power to conduct investigations on its own initiative and to examine and report on Garda policies, practices and procedures, even if the conduct of individual members is not culpable. When investigating complaints that may involve offences its officers will have the powers of gardaí, including powers of entry, search, seizure and arrest. This is to be welcomed.On the other hand, while the ombudsman commission will have power to appoint its own staff and will inherit the staff of the former Garda Complaints Board, it will also have power to engage the temporary services of serving members of the Garda Síochána. Those members' services as officers of the ombudsman commission will count as continuing service in the Garda Síochána for purposes such as pension, seniority and promotion. These seconded officers will have power to act as investigating officers in respect of complaints against their former and future colleagues.This enabling provision, set out in section 66, has the potential to undermine completely the real and perceived independence of the commission. It should be abandoned and removed from the Bill. The initial step on receipt of a valid complaint of obtaining and preserving all relevant evidence is entrusted under section 81 to Garda members. This function should instead be vested in the officers of the ombudsman commission. In the absence of a complaint by or on behalf of a specific and identified individual who claims to have been directly affected by the conduct to be investigated, the commission has no power to investigate a matter if it suspects a Garda may have committed a criminal offence or breached discipline. I have already referred to the investigative role of the ombudsman and whether that office will have the power of prior review of cases. These matters require to be addressed on Committee Stage.The provision on joint policing committees is one of the central areas of the legislation. Chapter 4 dealing with co-operation between the force and local authorities and with arrangements for obtaining the views of the public is welcome as a considerable strengthening of the Minister's original two short sentences in the general scheme published in 2003. It goes a long way towards the Labour Party's proposals for policing liaison committees which, in turn, were drawn from the Patten Commission report. Those important sections of the Garda Síochána which specifically relate to working with people in the community context, namely, community policing and neighbourhood watch, remain Cinderellas of the force decades after their establishment. These programmes are underresourced, understaffed, underpromoted and underappreciated, to coin a few words. New structures of policing and community participation must be developed and allowed to evolve to reflect the new ethos that the Garda Síochána's role is not to police the community but to police with the community.To be effective, community policing requires new structures to be anchored at local level. These structures must reflect a partnership between the police and the community. Local government administered by local authority officials and local public representatives is the obvious choice of location for new partnership structures. Local level requires co-operation at far more immediate level than having, for example, a single policing committee to deal with Fingal County Council which covers an area of approximately 173 sq. m. and has a population of 168,000.

There should not be a single model of community policing. Urban and rural areas and towns and cities have different policing needs. Flexibility is required to ensure that whichever model is chosen, it meets the policing needs of the community in question.I noted the discussion on the county and city development boards in the Seanad and the decision of the other House to remove them as suitable models. I am inclined to agree with its decision and strongly favour the inclusion in the structures of community policing of an operational model consisting of a strategic policy committee based on the county council or county borough. This would bring together local public representatives, local authority officials, senior gardaí, representatives of State agencies and community and business interests. Together and in consultation with a new Garda authority, these committees would prepare a county or city policing development plan. As matters stand — we do not yet have a Garda authority — this plan would be prepared with the Garda Commissioner.Area committees in the local authorities, based on Dáil constituency boundaries, would then prepare a constituency policing plan. This would be agreed by local public representatives, senior Garda officers from each Garda station, community and business interests and local authority officials for the area. It would be approved by a Garda authority.The community policing forum would be the basic unit of interface between the public and the Garda. It could operate within a geographical remit of one Garda station or more or a local electoral area or part thereof. Local needs would determine time and place. It would be a forum in which public representatives, local Garda officers, residents' associations, community groups, members of the public and local authority officials could assemble in committee or open forum as circumstances warranted. Residents would articulate their concerns, observations and experiences of crime in their communities. Crimes against the person or property, alcohol and drug abuse, vandalism and anti-social behaviour would be discussed and noted. Factors giving rise to these criminal activities and strategies to tackle them would be identified. Allocation of policing work would be agreed within the forum. In some instances the local authority would be asked to take action through such means as improved lighting, extinguishment of rights of way over laneways and issuing warnings to or evicting tenants. A community co-ordinator would liaise with the Garda, local authority and community and business groups to ensure the agreed policing work and other delegated work was carried out and the various groups and individuals were kept informed on a regular basis of progress.Incidentally, the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights recently approved my appointment as rapporteur to draw up models of best practice for community policing structures. The joint committee will shortly place advertisements in the national media inviting oral and written submissions. We will hold a series of oral hearings at the beginning of March which we have asked TG4 to televise live. We will invite in the main players, including the Minister, the Department, the Garda Commissioner, the Judiciary, the Courts Service, existing pilot models of community policing, the Northern Ireland Policing Authority, the Lord Mayor's commission, local authorities etc. It is intended that our report will include model schemes which are sufficiently flexible to be adaptable to rural and urban community policing needs.The power of the Garda to prosecute summary offences in the District Court as "common informers", effectively as ordinary members of the public mounting a private prosecution, is to be abolished. In future the Garda may prosecute only in the name of the Director of Public Prosecutions and will be subject to his direction. This reflects recent practice and is a major step towards the establishment of a unified prosecution service. However, section 8(6)(b) then provides that nothing done by a member of the Garda Síochána in instituting or conducting a prosecution is invalid by reason only of the member’s failure to comply with a direction given by the DPP. What is the thinking behind this proviso which runs the risk of making the reforms irrelevant?While one can understand that there may be circumstances in which it is necessary to appoint a person from outside the force to be commissioner, as section 9 permits, why is the same wording repeated in following sections to permit non-gardaí to be appointed to every rank? This provision needs to be tidied up.The Minister attracted considerable publicity when he announced his intention to abolish unauthorised communications between gardaí and journalists. In particular, he alleged that what amounted to institutionalised bribery was taking place. His proposals in section 55 represent a more measured response. Nonetheless, we will submit amendments to the section to ensure that unauthorised disclosure of information can be defended on overriding public interest grounds, such as whistleblowing.With regard to the legal status of members of the Garda Síochána, the intention behind the Bill is to repeal all the Garda Síochána Acts other than those dealing with Garda compensation and the acquisition of premises. The Bill continues the existing force in being and, for the first time, sets out the statutory functions of the force. It then provides, however, that nothing in the Bill affects the common law powers, immunities, privileges and duties of members of the Garda Síochána. This naturally raises the question as to what exactly is the status of an individual member of the force at common law. Is a member of the Garda Síochána a "constable" enjoying common law powers and immunities? The word has never been used in any of the Garda Síochána Acts. If the member has common law powers, the term used in the other jurisdiction on the island, is he or she subject to control in their exercise? Is the commissioner, the Minister or the State liable for their wrongful exercise?When statutory powers are conferred on a member of the force, are they exercisable by him or her at personal discretion, as an individual garda or is the member subject to the direction and control of a superior officer as a member of the Garda Síochána? If, for example, a superior directs a member to arrest someone and the member does not have any grounds for suspecting that the individual is guilty of an offence, is the arrest lawful? Although this is a fundamentally important question, the answer is uncertain and is the subject of a Supreme Court appeal. It is regrettable the Minister did not take the opportunity to provide clarification.Education and training of Garda recruits has been carried out in Templemore College, County Tipperary, since the foundation of the force. Templemore College has served the country well and is internationally respected for the quality of its work. It is located in an idyllic rural setting which is conducive to tranquil learning. The Minister recently decided to provide a four storey extension to enable the extra 2,000 gardaí to be recruited and trained over the next couple of years. It is time we reviewed the role of Templemore as the sole centre for training and education for the gardaí.A historic opportunity exists to locate a second Garda education and training centre in Grangegorman on the north side of Dublin. The Dublin Institute of Technology is building the largest third level college in the country on the site. The enabling legislation is currently going through the Oireachtas. A Garda Síochána college or a police academy could easily become the seventh faculty in the DIT. The 65 acre site has 30 acres of playing fields and will have other sporting facilities.It is located in an inner city urban setting and reflects the general context where most policing work is carried out in a modern Ireland that has rapidly changed from rural to urban in character. Garda students would mix and interact with their peers in other third level disciplines and not only with their trainee colleagues as at present. It is ideally located for in-service courses and for further education research studies in such areas as policing methods, crime statistics and criminology, and an international policing dimension could easily be added. It should be possible to share some facilities with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and to establish an exchange link with the new police college in Northern Ireland.A Garda college in Dublin would not replace Templemore but would add an extra dimension which would make the Garda Síochána a thoroughly modern and professional force in tune with the best policing practice anywhere in the world.The thinking behind the proposal in section 14 to admit unpaid but trained volunteers to the rank of garda in the force "to assist it in exercising its functions" is not explained. It requires further elaboration and justification. The section does not even state that volunteer gardaí are to be unpaid, part-time, or both.Section 15, as published, requires a newly appointed garda to "declare before God" that he or she will, among other things, have regard for human rights. The religious stipulation is itself a disregard for human rights. Thank God it is now optional.This is a case of what I term a "Patten lite" version. It is a missed opportunity to open a nationwide debate on the role and function of the Garda and to put in place structures appropriate to a modern police in the 21st century. The Garda Síochána, as well as the citizens, deserve that.

In ainneoin go bhfuil ceann de na rátaí póilíneachta is airde againn ar domhan, níl an Garda Síochána éifeachtach, agus tá súil agam agus ag mo pháirtí go gcuideoidh an Bille seo é sin a dhéanamh le go mbeadh an Garda Síochána ní b'éifeachtaí agus é ag déanamh a chuid oibre agus le go mbeadh muinín ag an phobal sa Stát seo as an fhórsa póilíneachta ar an chuid seo den oileán.It is a disgrace that this is the first major reform since the establishment of the Garda Síochána. I welcome the fact the Minister has undertaken this reform and recognise that he has accepted submissions on this issue, including recommendations from Sinn Féin. Moreover, he has proved somewhat more flexible than usual in shifting from his original position and considerably weaker proposals in this regard.I also welcome the recommendations of the Dublin City Council mayor's commission on crime and policing published last week. I urge the Minister to take on board the findings of that document to see whether amendments, based on those findings, would be appropriate on Committee Stage, and I will table some amendments. Sinn Féin councillors Christy Burke and Nicky Keogh made submissions to the commission which were taken on board. It is good there is an all-party approach to amending this legislation to ensure it is the best possible. We have a chance to undo the problems we have had with the Garda Síochána in this State over the past 80 years.Many people in working class communities experience higher levels of anti-social crime in particular. They have stopped reporting those crimes to the Garda Síochána and have stopped co-operating actively with it because they have come to believe the Garda Síochána does not serve their families or communities. That must change and the Garda Síochána must, once again, win the trust of every community in this State so that crime levels might be reduced rather than playing around with statistics through the PULSE system which does not reflect what is happening.The onus for change is on the Minister. The key to this reform is some element of oversight and accountability, although the Minister does not go far enough. Much work needs to be done on Committee Stage to ensure effective oversight of the Garda Síochána and real accountability to communities. I welcome the Minister's move as a first step towards local accountability but it does not go far enough. If his lack of support for the existing local policing fora in my area of Rialto in the south-west inner city is anything to go by, then the Minister's joint policing committees will struggle to have any effect. I hope they have an effect because that is the way forward and we should go further than his recommendations.The change in focus to a more accountable Garda Síochána is particularly welcome from a Minister who has until now done very little to increase the security of working class communities in this State, particularly in my area of which I have most experience. Only yesterday joy-riders were driving around Ballyfermot when school children were returning home from school. When one of our councillors rang the Garda Síochána, the councillor was told the only car available to Ballyfermot Garda station was busy transferring a prisoner. It is a scandal in this day and age that there was one police car available to Ballyfermot Garda station. The same is probably the case throughout the city. I would say Deputies Gregory and Finian McGrath could cite other instances where the Garda has been unable to use resources properly and where resources have not been allocated to local Garda stations.The demand for greater community accountability dates back as far as 1925. In the Dáil debate on the Police Forces Amalgamation (Amendment) Bill 1925, Major Brian Cooper proposed the establishment of a police advisory council for Dublin, but that did not happen. The Labour Party's Tom Johnson called for greater local control. Some 80 years later we are only getting to grips with it, which is welcome.I agree with the Minister who stated that we should never lose sight of the fact that the Garda Síochána is made up of ordinary men and women to whom we entrust the most challenging, demanding and difficult tasks in our community. They should be praised for doing that work. However, the abuse of power and privilege by a minority of gardaí has tainted the force as a whole and has led to mistrust and a loss of confidence and faith in the organisation on the part of a significant sector of society. A culture of impunity has evolved and senior management has been implicated in a number of serious incidents.Sinn Féin does not put the Garda Síochána in the same category as the RUC or PSNI. However, the history of the Garda Síochána is not unblemished and it points to the urgent reform needed. Elements of the Garda have been involved in aggressive, undemocratic, unlawful action. Its special branch has been used as a political force against republicans over the years and must be changed from the unaccountable force within a force it has become. I would go so far as to say that the special branch in its present formation should be disbanded.There are two ongoing tribunals into alleged Garda misconduct and a documented failure on the part of the force to co-operate with Garda Complaints Board investigations regarding, for instance, claims of excessive force against Reclaim the Streets protestors in May 2002. It is not just a case of a few bad apples. In the past there was the heavy gang, now there is an inquiry into the actions of gardaí in County Donegal. Misconduct by the Garda has included killings in disputed circumstances, torture, rape, breaking and entering, lying under oath, falsifying evidence, misappropriation of funds and drug dealing. This is an indictment of a Garda management which has not managed to deal effectively with these types of incidents on an ongoing basis and has not prevented this type of culture emerging within the force.If I were to list all the incidents involving special branch dealings with republicans, I would be here until tomorrow and beyond. Some of the high-profile cases include the Sallins train robbery and the abuse of power by the heavy gang at that stage. The Garda totally failed to properly investigate the killing of a Sinn Féin councillor, Mr. Eddie Fullerton, in County Donegal. Proper professional standards were not adhered to in this instance, yet there was no investigation into the circumstances and no garda was called to book in this regard. Others mentioned illegal tapping of telephones. No action has been taken in regard to Garda collusion with British Intelligence.The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture found, in 1993, 1998 and 2002, that persons held in certain Garda stations ran the risk of being physically ill-treated and called for greater action to prevent such occurrences. Certain stations in this city are renowned for abuse by gardaí. There have been instances of perjured evidence, assaults and stitch-ups. The victims of such behaviour have no confidence in the Garda Complaints Board and fear further intimidation by the Garda on the basis of other spurious charges.Críochnóidh méá rá go bhfuil mé sásta tacú leis an Bhille seo ag an phointe seo, ach muna nglactar le leasuithe, beidh mé ag cur ina choinne níos deireannaí sa phróiseas.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Earlier this week, I attended a public meeting in St. Finbar's school in west Cabra in my Dublin Central constituency. The hall was packed to capacity with 300 to 400 local residents concerned about the increasingly serious cocaine problem, an issue that affects working class areas across the city. The national drugs unit had recently seized €1.5 million worth of cocaine in one operation in the area. It is generally accepted that the amount of drugs seized usually represents a small percentage of the quantity of drugs in circulation.The point of relevance to this Bill is that there are only two community gardaí to patrol this area of west Cabra, the largest single working class area in the Dublin Central constituency, along with the adjoining Navan Road estates. Senior Garda management has stated that the resources are not available now or in the foreseeable future to provide the necessary additional gardaí. There is an irony in debating the role and functions of the Garda Síochána, as set out in this Bill, while this incredible lack of resources exists. Although the Minister is not here, I hope he gets the message and ensures that additional community gardaí are provided for this part of Dublin Central.In regard to the section of the Bill providing for reform of the existing mechanism for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda Síochána, I refer to another meeting in my constituency. This took place last Friday in the office of senior Garda management in Store Street Garda station. Along with two other members of the management of the local community policing forum, I conveyed a detailed written complaint which we had received from a young man who had been given a severe beating by gardaí from that station.Senior Garda management told us that the complainant had three options. These were to go to the Garda Complaints Board, seek an internal Garda investigation by a Garda Inspector, or find a solicitor who would take his case through the courts. The Garda Complaints Board is long since discredited among people in this part of Dublin and, by its own admission, never had the resources to do the job in any event. An internal inquiry by a Garda inspector would not even be contemplated. This left the complainant with the option of securing the services of a solicitor. Undoubtedly, we would not have been in Store Street Garda station last Friday and this young person would not be in a dilemma as to which course of action he must take if there were a Garda ombudsman.On the issue of internal inquiries, I take this opportunity to put on record my disgust at the Minister's recent decision not to allow an inquiry into the Garda handling of the Grangegorman murders and the interviewing and charging of Mr. Dean Lyons. I have no doubt that if Mr. Lyons were a person of affluence instead of an unfortunate heroin addict, there would have been an inquiry. This case, above all, clearly demonstrates the need for a Garda ombudsman. It is a black mark against the Minister that he did not face up to his responsibilities in this regard. We saw a man wrongly charged with a most horrific double murder, the experience of which probably contributed to his subsequently untimely death, and it seems that nobody else can now be charged with the crime. If this does not deserve an independent inquiry, I do not know what case does.This clearly demonstrates the urgency of this legislation. There is a litany of cases where people who get the wrong end of the stick from the gardaí have no confidence in getting justice other than through costly legal proceedings. All these experiences demonstrate the long overdue importance of the section of this Bill dealing with the Garda Síochána ombudsman commission and make it all the more disappointing that the proposal in this regard is flawed. It will not generate the confidence of the public as presumably intended.I am convinced of this, having a read a critique by Professor Dermot Walsh of the University of Limerick. He states:The ombudsman commission is intended to play the central role in generating confidence among gardaí, complainants and the public that complaints against gardaí will be dealt with fairly and efficiently, and that public concerns about policing policies, practices and incidents will be addressed seriously when they arise.He argues that this will be dependent on its composition, on the expertise of the persons involved, on its independence of Government and on it having the necessary powers and resources to employ and train investigators independent of the Garda with the necessary powers to investigate complaints against gardaí robustly fairly and swiftly. He points out that the office of ombudsman is almost invariably a single individual because it is vital that the complainant and the public have full confidence in his or her independence of the body under investigation.The office of ombudsman must be filled by someone who enjoys a public reputation for independence and impartiality with the necessary qualifications and expertise to pursue the types of grievances that will be brought before him or her. Even if the three proposed members are wholly independent and impartial, it will be very difficult for them to generate the sort of public reputation or profile associated with a single ombudsman. With the ombudsman, the complainant and public can put a name and a face on the person upon whom they are depending to deliver justice for them. The significance of this human dimension in generating public confidence in the system should not be underestimated. However, with the multi-member commission as proposed, the complainant and the public will almost invariably be expected to place their trust in a faceless impersonal body, whose offices are on a particular floor of an office block somewhere in the city.With an ombudsman, unlike the commission, the buck would stop with a single publicly identifiable individual. The individual could attract the necessary public recognition for independence, impartiality, integrity, expertise and commitment. It is much more difficult for an impersonal multi-member commission, which will inevitably function in a committee-like manner, to cultivate and retain these attributes. Professor Walsh argues that even the use of the term "ombudsman" alongside that of "commission" is merely window dressing.I wish to refer to the community policing structures. While I welcome that public representatives will be on community policing boards, it is interesting that we have just passed legislation precluding public representatives from being on health boards. The change in the health boards was media-driven and a sign of a knee-jerk response from the Government, which does not seem to have a consistent policy on public representatives being members of such bodies. Clearly the community sector is not represented on the community policing boards, which is a vital error. While the Bill provides for the establishment of fora, who will set these up? This will be done by gardaí and city council officials. However, a wealth of experience exists at local level, certainly in my area, which should be fully utilised. People from the community sector involved in community policing fora should be elected to the city-wide structures and should have a role in establishing the local community forum. The Lord Mayor's commission met the local community policing forum in my area, gathered a number of ideas and put them into its report, but failed to acknowledge that it had spoken to this group and failed to acknowledge its expertise.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	212	The Green Party welcomes the Bill. Any measure designed to drag the police force, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century is long overdue. Confidence in the Garda Síochána must be restored. The drip feeding of revelations from the Morris tribunal remind us on a daily basis of the need to reform radically the way the force recruits, promotes and goes about its business.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has often stated that one must be radical or redundant. I am disappointed that the Bill is cautious and restrained. We need radical reform of the Garda Síochána. The measures in the Bill are not as radical as necessary. While we recognise the positive move to establish the Garda ombudsman commission, other issues need to be addressed such as training, the political accountability of the Garda Síochána, the recruitment process and the reporting of crime. On the independence of the police service, we are concerned that the Bill largely retains the existing system of political appointment of senior officers in the Garda Síochána. The relationship between the Government and senior figures in the Garda must be at arms length and there must be transparency in this process.Several sections in the Bill provide broad discretionary powers to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Section 23(2)(c) directs the Garda Commissioner to have regard to “any relevant policies of the Minister or the Government”. The independence of the police service is central to its credibility and people’s perceptions of it. Therefore it is imperative that the Bill be transparent and allow for full accountability within the police service.Some of the Green Party's concerns are as follows. Section 7(4) states: "In performing its functions, the Garda Síochána shall have regard to the importance of upholding human rights." We suggest that we should insert "and ensure fair and equal treatment and respect for all". Simply referring to human rights gives too broad a remit. We need to be specific and ensure that equality is mentioned in the Bill. This section covers the functions of the Garda Síochána and its objectives in preventing crime and preserving peace. While upholding human rights is covered in the section, we feel it warrants expansion to incorporate the prevention of discrimination.Section 55 outlines 11 different circumstances in which the disclosure of information can be reasonably considered to be harmful. Section 55(2)(j) states: “affects adversely the international relations or interests abroad of the State, including those with Northern Ireland”. Again this wording is too broad and is open to interpretation as the concept of the “interests abroad of the State” might encompass diplomatic or economic effects, which might be difficult to foresee or quantify.Section 14(1) states: "The Garda Commissioner may, subject to subsection (4) and the regulations, appoint persons as volunteer members of the Garda Síochána to assist it in exercising its functions." I am concerned about the "Dad's Army" aspect of this provision. I am concerned that we will have a second grade of people with very strong policing functions who perhaps do not have the training or background to use those powers correctly. I urge the Minister to ensure that volunteers are given the same training as other gardaí before exercising Garda functions. In particular they need to receive human rights training.Section 122 relates to the exercise of special powers by security officers. Section 122(2)(b) states that the head of an authorised body may:(b) designate a person as a security officer in relation to those premises if satisfied that——(i) the person is a suitable person to exercise the powers of a security officer under this section in relation to specified premises,(ii) the person has received adequate training for that purpose,After "training" we need to insert: "including human rights training", which must be seminal to the Bill and cannot be included in an à la carte fashion. I am concerned how these volunteers will work. Will they have a parallel rank structure to the current Garda service? Will these volunteers need to subscribe to the solemn declaration and the code of ethics? They too must be held accountable.Section 58 refers to the appointment of three members to make up the Garda ombudsman commission. We are very concerned about dilution of powers to a three-person commission. As in many other areas, there should be one person as the ombudsman to oversee the Garda. Having three people gives rise to the danger of buck passing and losing personal accountability. If three persons are to be appointed to the Garda ombudsman commission, we recommend that the positions should be publicly advertised and an independent advisory body should make the appointments.Section 86(3) states:The Ombudsman Commission may decide, either on referring the complaint under section 84(a) or at any time during the investigation, to supervise the investigation of a complaint if it considers it desirable in the public interest to do so.While this provision is of significant importance, the involvement of the ombudsman commission in a supervisory function should be mandatory in all cases, rather than discretionary. The staffing of the commission should be completely independent. I appreciate that Ireland is a small country, but I would be worried if the commission were to be staffed by people who are on secondment from the Garda. If we are to ensure that there is full independence in such circumstances, we have to break that link.I have concerns about section 91, which restricts the right of the ombudsman commission to direct an investigation or search of a designated Garda station. The European Court of Human Rights considers national security to be a legitimate ground for restricting accountability and transparency. The investigating staff of the commission will be bound by the Official Secrets Act 1963. Any warrant will be confined to material relevant to a specific complaint. Restriction of the powers of the ombudsman commission seems somewhat anomalous, given that investigators from international bodies like the Council of Europe's committee on the prevention on torture already have the power to enter any police station on demand. We recommend that section 91 should not restrict the ombudsman commission's general right of access, on demand, to Garda stations.I remind the House of what the Council of Europe's committee on the prevention of torture found when it came to Ireland. Its most recent annual report stated that the allegations of ill-treatment heard by its delegation were given some credibility by their number and consistency. A person who was interviewed in Cork Prison alleged that four or five police officers had dragged him down the stairs of Anglesea Street Garda station the previous day. He said the gardaí had repeatedly struck him with batons. A person interviewed in Clover Hill Prison alleged that the police had twisted his wrist a few days earlier, at the time of his arrest. He said that several baton blows were subsequently delivered in the direction of his head by a police officer at Store Street Garda station. He had to deflect the blows with his left arm.Another person who was interviewed by the committee's delegation in Dublin alleged that the police treated him roughly at the time of his arrest a week previously. He said he was subsequently assaulted many times by police officers at Store Street Garda station. He said that an officer hit him six or seven times on the thigh with a baton on one occasion, while he was being restrained. It is easy to be sanctimonious in the Dáil Chamber, but we have to admit that the allegations have some credibility. We need to ensure that the ombudsman commission will be allowed to enter any Garda station at any time. Such a provision is needed in the Bill.Section 98 allows the ombudsman commission to engage in a review of practice and policy procedure. As the Bill stands, the commission will need the authorisation of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform before it can engage in such a review, but we believe it should have the power to instigate such reviews.Section 76 provides that "a complaint must be made within the period of 6 months beginning on the date of the conduct giving rise to the complaint". Regardless of the provision that allows for the extension of that time limit in exceptional circumstances, we think the current timeframe provided for in the Bill is inadequate. Logically, the timeframe is not practical because books of evidence in criminal proceedings are often not served within six months. We think it would be a reasonable compromise to extend the relevant timeframe to 12 months.We welcome the establishment of joint policing committees. We would like the members of the committees to be people who are broadly representative of the community. The committees should represent those with specific policing needs and groups which experience high levels of contact with the police. We can follow the model in Northern Ireland in this regard.The Green Party is disappointed that the Bill does not deal in detail with the issue of recruitment. Garda recruits should be trained in how to liaise with the public and respond to people's needs. They should be given the opportunity to give feedback on Garda operations. We would like positive steps to be taken to recruit ethnic minorities, including members of the Traveller community. We are concerned that the current entrance criteria make it difficult, if not impossible, for ethnic minorities to enter the force, with very few notable exceptions.I am concerned that gardaí who are doing good work in the community are being removed from community policing roles. Such officers should be allowed to stay in the same place for two years. I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Costello's suggestion that an urban police training institute be established. A wonderful old woman in the Liberties once asked me if a decent garda from Crumlin could be assigned to the area. While it could be said that she had a prejudice or bias in respect of gardaí from certain places, she had genuine concerns about the arrival into her local area of gardaí with no link to it. It would make absolute sense to locate part of a police college in Dublin, for example in Dun Laoghaire. The suggestion should be accepted.

The Government is responsible for ensuring that the Garda is accountable and changing the way it acts and is managed. Successive Governments did not take action in that regard until this Government decided to do so. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy McDowell, for taking such action by introducing a Bill that will serve us well for the 21st century.The Garda Commissioner, Noel Conroy, has always been most co-operative and helpful in his dealings with the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. When the committee contacts him he is immediately co-operative and receptive, without hesitation, to the suggestion that he should attend a meeting to discuss any specific or general matter. I thank him for his co-operation with the committee. The Commissioner immediately agreed to appear before the sub-committee on the Barron report recently. He agreed to put in place a liaison officer for the victims of the bombings of the early 1970s, so they can examine the Garda's files in situ with the liaison officer. That will help the victims to achieve some closure in respect of their problems.There are approximately 12,000 gardaí. They are noble people who do a good job. Instances of officers doing certain things have been highlighted, but all gardaí are not proud of such events. The officers in question deeply regret their actions. The number of gardaí involved in such matters is a minimal proportion of the total of 12,000 gardaí.I reject Deputy Ó Snodaigh's suggestion that there is a general broad-brush approach of perjured evidence, assaults and stitch-ups, as if all 12,000 gardaí were involved in such matters. That suggestion is totally at odds with the experience of law-abiding citizens. Those who respect this country's laws and the Garda Síochána also respect the way in which the Garda serves those who respect our laws and the force. I hope that in the not too distant future, all the people of this country, including members of all the political parties in this House, will be in a position to respect fully the laws of this country and the gardaí who try to uphold those laws in our name.

I am not trying to blame anybody. I am seeking to increase the level of respect for the law and the Garda Síochána.I thank the Minister for appearing before the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in September 2003 to discuss his proposals on this Bill. I believe both Deputies Costello and Ó Snodaigh were present. We found the meeting very helpful and it afforded the committee an opportunity to express its view that it would prefer the use of the term "ombudsman" to that of "inspectorate". We felt the latter would create the impression that there would be another internal body examining the Garda.On human rights, both Deputies Cuffe and Costello highlighted the need for an urban training institute for gardaí. I have given thought to this and I understand where they are coming from. St. Brendan's is in Deputy Costello's constituency and Deputy Cuffe obviously has a site in mind in Dún Laoghaire. However, there is a fine site in Templemore. It is reckoned that the population of Ireland will increase from approximately 4 million to 4.8 in the not too distant future. I would like to see a mingling of Garda trainees and the general student body which represents both urban and rural people.

Although the number of priests has declined, the opening of the college to general students has helped those who have gone through the system to become more open to and knowledgeable and accepting of the needs of individuals. I am sure the Garda will state its training course is not characterised by a macho ethos involving drills, marching and physical education, all in the same barracks, yet one cannot think of any other ethos applying. If Templemore were opened up and transformed into a third level institution in which students of other disciplines could train academically, it would be very helpful.I agree with Deputy Cuffe that members of the Garda reserve force should be given full training similar to that of gardaí. They should have to abide by the same ethics and rules and take the same oath.The Bill provides for the establishment by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of a code of ethics for the Garda Síochána which will be incorporated into the disciplinary framework for the Garda Síochána. The code is to make gardaí aware of their obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. We have noted at meetings of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights that the principles of the convention are becoming more pertinent to the laws of the State and those of all other EU states. I refer in particular to Article 2, which protects the right to life. There is an obligation to vindicate the right to life. If a crime, particularly a murder or a serious assault, is committed, it should be fully investigated. The articles of the convention will help to make Ireland a more responsible and better nation. An awareness of our obligations under the convention must be instilled into the minds of all trainee gardaí.Section 26 provides a statutory basis for the provision of police services by the Garda Commissioner in circumstances where it is consistent with the functions of the Garda Síochána to provide such services and the commissioner is satisfied that the recipient of the services has paid or will pay for the services. Certain sports organisations avail of the services of the Garda. The prices of tickets to their events are so high and the gate receipts are so numerous that I would expect such organisations to pay in full for the services provided to them by the Garda. The same applies to banks which should pay fully for the services provided by the Garda in the transfer of cash.I was taken by the heading to Chapter 4 which reads: "Co-operation with Local Authorities and Arrangements for Obtaining Views of the Public". I was always under the impression that this chapter would cover a wider area and that it would be intended to implement some of the suggestions of the public.

I am delighted to follow up on Deputy Costello's remark that the justice committee will prepare a report on co-operation with local authorities and arrangements for obtaining the views of the public. The Deputy is the rapporteur of that report. We hope to have persons before the committee in early March who will be able to make an input into the legislation in this area. I hope the Minister, the Garda Commissioner, members of the public and perhaps relevant representatives of the Independent Commission for Policing for Northern Ireland will be able to attend.I am interested to note that the joint policing committee may include elected representatives such as Members of Dáil Éireann. This is the first little chink in the armour surrounding the abolition of the dual mandate in that a Member of Dáil Éireann is now regarded as competent enough to become a member of that committee.Deputy Costello mentioned the north inner-city policing forum. Deputy Ó Snodaigh mentioned the Rialto policing forum and I share some of his reservations thereon. I hope that at the end of our discussions we will have a template that can be used to assist local authorities and communities in adopting this chapter of the legislation. The Rialto policing forum has met the Minister to try to secure funding of only a few thousand euro to maintain its administration. Unfortunately, the forum is no longer operating because it does not have the necessary resources. This is a great loss to the area in which it operated. I hope the Minister can provide in the Bill for local authorities, the Garda Síochána or the State to help fund the local police fora.Section 33 places a duty on local authorities to take steps to prevent disorder, crime and anti-social behaviour in their areas of responsibility. Recent good practice guidelines gave local authorities the power to evict people engaged in anti-social behaviour from local authority tenancies. That has helped reduce the amount of anti-social behaviour in the Dublin area and improve the quality of life in these areas.Section 34 states:(1) The Garda Commissioner shall make arrangements for obtaining the views of the public about matters concerning policing and the state of crime.(2) Before making any arrangements under this section, the Garda Commissioner shall consult with the Minister about the proposed arrangements and the Minister may approve the arrangements-(a) as proposed, or(b) with such revisions as the Minister, after consulting with the Commissioner, may determine.

Not only is this onerous for the Minister but it somewhat diminishes the Garda Commissioner's authority and his responsibility for such a programme. The Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the local authorities and the communities, would be able to devise programmes which would present no problem to the Minister. Amendment of that section would reduce the Minister's responsibilities and workload.I am delighted to see that under chapter 5 which deals with accountability, the Garda Commissioner will be the accounting officer. This is significant for the Committee of Public Accounts and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. Someone who is effectively the chief executive officer of an organisation, whether the Garda Síochána or a health board, should come before an Oireachtas committee to explain and account for work done.It will be useful for those of us on the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to have before us the person who is fully responsible for the Garda Síochána. Previously, the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has many other responsibilities, was the accounting officer for the Garda Síochána. The new arrangement will be more efficient.It is a good idea to set up an audit committee but while that works closely with the Garda Commissioner, it should be independent of office. People who work to the audit committee, as well as the internal auditors, should work for the Garda Commissioner but report also, fully and openly, to the audit committee.The presence of a deputy Garda Commissioner on this committee could constrain the discussion that might take place between an independent audit committee and the internal auditor. A deputy Garda Commissioner should attend audit committee meetings to help the committee in its dealings, but as a member of the committee he or she would be primus inter pares with extra clout that would not be good for corporate governance.The audit committee should look not only at the financial affairs of the Garda Síochána as set out in the section but also at the management structures and information systems within the force. Recent events, particularly in Donegal, show that, while the structures operate well in many cases, they are too reliant on one person. Layers of management would be more fluid and responsive and would be better able to deal with problems.I am concerned that this Bill does not address the question of management of the Garda Síochána at all levels. It addresses well matters of leadership and accountability, but middle management needs more attention. There is an opportunity to address this as the Bill goes through the House.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill and, in general, I welcome the Bill. The issues that concern me most are those things which were promised in the past but have not happened, for example, an extra 2,000 gardaí on the beat. The Garda service in the Border area, especially following recent threats from the IRA, worries me. Several barracks are closed for all but a few hours a day and the distance between those that are open is unacceptable in the new situation we may face. We cannot ignore these issues.A previous speaker said that almost 400 gardaí are involved in ordinary desk duty. They could be out on the beat. If the Government is serious about having people out and visible, that is not justified. A great deal of Garda time is spent in court. My colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who is a solicitor, and the Minister might not agree because the legal profession likes people to spend as much time in court as possible, for various reasons. For gardaí to spend time in court is not in people's best interests. They may be on call for court attendance on one day but if the case is not dealt with and is put back to another day they will be on call again. They could be released from this duty to do what they should do.It is crazy to employ Garda personnel in the collection of fines. To get around that problem, my party proposed a Bill that could have dealt with fines by way of attachment to earnings or social welfare. While the Minister stated he had other ideas, the Bill does not deal with this. It is a means of freeing up more personnel to do the work we want them to do.The Minister will appreciate that I and my party, more than any other in the House apart from the Minister's, support the Garda Síochána and want it to work in the best interests of the public. I do not like Members to state in the House that, as public representatives, they could not advise supporters to provide information to gardaí. That is not my attitude, which is that we work with and deal with the Garda as the force of law and order.Community policing is often overlooked but provides a tremendous service. As an example, one need only look at my town of Monaghan, where a community garda dealt with an ongoing problem in a housing estate. He did a tremendous job and worked at all hours, far beyond the call of duty, to supply, with the aid of outside organisations, a community building to allow for sport and other recreational activities. This will lead to better education, better facilities for young mothers and better control. This is the type of positive activity we want.I welcome increased Garda involvement with local authorities. The more gardaí who can become involved with local people, the better. While I question the need to get permission from the Minister to hold meetings and so on, this is possibly only legal jargon in the Bill. However, any such involvement must be as near the ground as possible to ensure that communities feel involved and trust is built up with the Garda. Gone are the days when a local garda travelled by bicycle or on foot, knew every person and could keep tabs on people.Many years ago, two eminent clerics contacted senior Garda personnel to have a sergeant removed from a town because they felt he was not hard enough in closing pubs at night. However, it was less than a year before the clerics were begging for the same officer to be moved back to the town because he was in touch with everything and knew exactly what was happening. He did not try to impose the law in a negative way, although he could have done better in the view of some. However, he was on the beat and knew what was happening. When the local bank was robbed, he was able to arrest the perpetrators within hours because he had been watching events unfold.While I welcome this aspect of the Bill, it is not certain who pays for this involvement by local authorities. As one who spent almost 30 years on a local authority, I know that over the years it was given an increasing number of roles to play but less and less funds with which to play them. It must be made clear that local authorities are not being asked to take on additional responsibilities or personnel and that they will be funded as necessary.While I am not sure it is covered in the Bill, I wish to refer to the issue of traffic wardens. As all politics is local, I will use the example of my town, Monaghan, which has had a welcome increase in the number of traffic wardens from one to three, as well as the introduction of pay parking. Despite some initial complications, the traffic wardens are doing a good job. However, a technicality arises in that while a traffic warden can deal with parked cars, he or she cannot play any role in directing traffic but must call the Garda. If traffic wardens are able to control car parking, they should have a role in traffic management. Although Monaghan is awaiting a bypass, it has not yet been built and one or two vehicles in the centre of town can cause chaos. Traffic wardens are usually available and should have a role to play in this regard.I welcome the proposed increase in liaison with the policing authorities in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. As a representative of a Border area, whatever build-up of trust can be achieved with the police forces North and South is extremely important. There have been good relationships in the past but questions arise at times as to how well the system works on the ground. It is no harm for the personnel to be interchanged and for this new format to be used to build better relationships.I referred in another recent debate to the events at Omagh and the fact that at that stage nobody had been arrested. Little did I know that somebody from this State was arrested 24 hours earlier and held awaiting trial for related offences. I hope this is just the beginning of a resolution to this investigation.With regard to the Garda volunteer force, I am conscious that the 2,000 full-time gardaí have not been delivered. It is intended that the 1,400 members of the new volunteer force would have the same powers as full-time gardaí. How will this work? Will they have full Garda training? Will they be paid? To whom are they answerable? Under what structures will they work? What role will they play? The Minister referred to this but his contribution does not make us much the wiser. It is a matter that will need to clarified on Committee Stage for us to be able to support the measure fully.There is a need, to which I referred earlier in regard to county council structures, for every format to be used to make more personnel available to enforce the law. This will provide peace of mind to the public in their homes, in particular at night, so that drunks, not all of them young, outside chip shops and pubs can be watched. Towns such as Cootehill, County Cavan, and Ballybay, County Monaghan, are a long way from a Garda headquarters which is open at night, and much can happen in a few minutes or hours if gardaí are not available. However, I question the granting of additional powers in this regard. If one individual takes on too much power, serious problems can arise. We will have to reconsider this matter on Committee Stage.I welcome that the annual report will now be published within four months. I hope this great improvement is realised because in the past the report has not been published for at least a year. When one considers how quickly we can obtain figures from banks and so on, one must ask why has a vital structure like the Garda Síochána not got a computer system that would provide instant information, not just on reports but in other areas.The decision to dissolve the Garda Complaints Board is vital. I welcome the ombudsman commission proposal. It has been the focus of consistent queries, and I will bring one such query to the Minister's attention in a few minutes. It appears that the ombudsman commission will comprise three people to be appointed by the Dáil. Why has the Minister decided on three people rather than one person, as is the case in Northern Ireland?I welcome any improvement in this area, but it is not acceptable that, under section 66, the ombudsman will employ gardaí. Is it acceptable that gardaí should be involved in investigating complaints against their colleagues? For instance should advice be sought, from Canada, France, the UK or wherever? I recall the abuse my former Dáil colleague, and now MEP, Jim Higgins, got from the media and so on when he tried to highlight what was happening in Donegal. The gardaí were supposed to be above reproach. I want to put on record once again my commitment and that of my party to the Garda Síochána. However, we must recognise that there are bad eggs everywhere, and a completely independent body must deal with these people.I raise a case with which I am familiar. I am sure the couple concerned visited the Minister's offices. They met with me in regard to their treatment by the Garda, particularly the Garda Complaints Board. I have a letter dated 12 May 2003, addressed to the Chief Executive of the Garda Complaints Board, Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1. Before coming to this House, I checked if the case had been dealt with. I was told that there has been no word to date, which is totally unacceptable. There may be questions as to what a case is all about because people may have over-reacted and so on, but surely a body such as this should have the courtesy to get back to people and hear their complaint. I have many queries relating to this issue. I have gone through the boxes of files with a fine tooth comb. My interest in the case is that the wife comes from my constituency, and I know the family extremely well. Cases such as this must be examined and dealt with. They may involve a bit of bother or hassle, but these people have certainly been harassed. I am very concerned that they have not been given the full benefit of the law. I do not normally complain about the gardaí, but when one examines this file, as I am sure the Minister has, it raises major questions about how the existing Garda Complaints Board and a number of very senior personnel within the Garda deal with individuals. These people are not criminals. They are not the type of people one would want to see living the hell they have lived. The man involved has lost a good position in public life. He lost his career because of what has gone on.Another issue about which I am concerned happened along the Border. A young man was left for dead after being beaten with shovels and spades. The windows in his house were broken and his car and tractor were damaged, yet no one has been held responsible. There is ongoing racketeering in that area. This is not happening on a cross-religious basis, it is happening within one group of people. Questions must be asked, as this is extremely serious. I have met senior Garda personnel in the matter but I am not satisfied with the response. Summonses arrive late and many other things happen, which should not happen. I would like to see this matter cleared up, therefore, the setting up of the ombudsman commission is very important.There appears to be some concern about searching Garda stations without authorisation. I would question why. I highlighted at the agriculture committee yesterday that inspectors from the Department of Agriculture and Food can walk into a farm without notice and carry out a full inspection. Farmers may not end up going to court, but they could lose thousands of euro if everything is not perfect on the day. However, there is a different attitude to the Garda who have a serious responsibility to the State. If the ombudsman commission is to work, Garda stations should be as open to inspection as anywhere else.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	228	There appears to be a broad welcome for the general reforms to the Garda force. There has been a long consultation period in this regard. The Minister has allowed all interest groups to make submissions. He invited groups to come to see him. The Fianna Fáil parliamentary party had a meeting on the issue. It has allowed the Bill to develop in the Seanad and I hope it will develop again as a result of the contributions of Members of this House.I will begin by commenting on the ombudsman commission proposal in Part 3. I want to set out the background to all of this. The gardaí are not ordinary members of the workforce, they operate in very stressful and often very dangerous circumstances. As such, motivation and morale is a key issue in carrying out the job successfully on behalf of the people. When they put themselves in harm's way, they must feel they are doing so for a good reason, that they will have the support of the State and that they are appreciated to a certain extent. It is sometimes too easy for people to criticise the entire force when the problem may lie only with the misdemeanours of a few people.Having made that general point, we should remember this aspect in the context of the proposals on the ombudsman commission. Its primary function will be to deal with complaints by members of the public relating to the conduct of members of the Garda. It will replace the existing Garda Complaints Board established in 1987. The public did not perceive the board, rightly or wrongly, as being transparent, impartial and fair in all its dealings. In some circumstances that may well have been the case. The example to which Deputy Crawford alluded identifies that there are shortcomings in the operation of the board.The appointment of Nuala O'Loan in the North has inspired a certain amount of impetus in this area. The events of May Day were also influential. It would be unfortunate to think the events in Donegal would be used to piggyback reforms of the Garda. I am not sure if that is entirely the case, but there has been an upswell of interest in reform of the Garda in the last while.Deputy Howlin published a Bill in 2001 on the question of an ombudsman, proposing a single individual as ombudsman. I do not have a problem with the appointment of three individuals as opposed to one. That indicates we would be dealing with three full-time individuals who would be applying their minds to this issue. As we now have a larger population, inevitably we will need more people dealing with complaints that will be made to the commission.It is important the three people who will be appointed will be of the highest calibre, held in high regard throughout the community and that they will operate independent of the State and the Government. They will have to inspire confidence not only among gardaí but among members of the public. Nuala O'Loan has confidently taken on that role in the North in recent years. We need people of that calibre for those appointments.The Bill seems to suggest that judges of the superior courts might be appointed. There is a need for more judges of the superior courts as opposed to seconding them to do full-time jobs elsewhere. We need to look elsewhere to appoint members to the commission.It is also important that the Minister puts his mind to ensuring there is wide publicity of the existence of the office. It is essential that members of the public are aware that this complaints procedure is available to them, is straightforward, that there is no intimidation and they would be able to approach a Garda station or the ombudsman commission directly to make such a complaint.I wish to briefly deal with the sections. Under section 75, if a complainant approaches a Garda station directly and makes a complaint, which in normal circumstances would be an appropriate complaint for the ombudsman commission, it appears the complainant may have to indicate to the garda that he or she wished to have the complaint forwarded to the ombudsman commission. Section 75(2) states that the complaint may be made directly to the ombudsman commission or by stating, giving or sending it to any member of the Garda Síochána at a Garda station, or to a member at or above the rank of chief superintendent at a place other than a Garda station, for forwarding under section 77 to the ombudsman commission. In other words, a member of the public may not be aware of this and I am concerned that a garda may simply take the complaint and it may wither because the member of the public failed to indicate that it was for forwarding to the ombudsman commission. If he or she fails to use that language or to make that clear, the complaint could wither and the 12 months period during which summary prosecution can be brought might have elapsed. My reading of that subsection might be incorrect, but that is an observation with which the Minister might deal with if he can.Under section 81, in regard to informing the person complained of, the Garda Commissioner must make sure that evidence has been preserved. This is a good measure. However, a time limit for informing the person complained of should be inserted. Natural justice would require that the person complained about would be informed with all due dispatch in a reasonable time. Inevitably, these matters will come before the courts and a judge will decide on a case by case basis what is a reasonable period of time. However, we should set down clearly that the Garda Commissioner has a specific period of, say, two to four weeks to ensure that evidence is preserved before the person concerned is entitled to have the complaint about him or her explained.I have a concern regarding section 86 which appears to provide for a circular type of lengthening of the complaints procedure. Section 86(10) states that following a review of the matter, the ombudsman commission may request the Garda Commissioner to review the investigation of the complaint and to report back to it concerning any further action that he or she proposes to take in the matter. We do not want complaint procedures hanging over members of the Garda Síochána for long periods — they should have a beginning, middle and end. That subsection appears to allow for an investigation to drag on indefinitely. We must have confidence that the complaints procedure system will work well and that it will not be allowed to operate in an open-ended way.When I heard Deputy Crawford's comments, I recalled that a complaint brought to the Garda Complaints Board in May 2003 has not yet been dealt with. We must properly resource the ombudsman commission and, thereby, demonstrate that we are serious about its role. A long-drawn out investigation does nothing to instil public confidence in the complaints procedure, to build morale among members of the Garda Síochána or in regard to the specific complaint.The Garda Complaints Board has a staff of 20 and a budget of €1.5 million. Section 64 provides for the transfer of such staff to the ombudsman commission. However, we need more staff and more funding. This Bill provides for the commission to have extensive powers. Section 66 provides for the employment of outside assistance. If a serious complaint is made, as in the Donegal case currently being dealt with, there is a potential that somebody from outside the jurisdiction would be called in to oversee a long investigation. Such a long investigation could put a serious dent in a budget as small as €1.5 million.When Michael Mills was Ombudsman he made complaints regularly that he could not discharge his functions properly with the funding and resources he had to hand. If we are serious about this legislation and if we want to restore public confidence in the Garda — some Members have complained of a lack of confidence — and to restore Garda morale, funding is an absolute prerequisite for the successful operation of the Bill when enacted.I favour the six month window in which to make a complaint. That allows for a cooling off period if a complaint has arisen due to a clash of personalities, which is often the case. It allows sufficient time for the person concerned to reflect on the matter and consider whether he or she wishes to go through with making a complaint. There are mediation facilities under the Bill, which are welcome. The Bill provides that this period can be extended by the ombudsman commission. I would have thought it was necessary to set an upper limit on that time extension. Given that under section 96 one has only 12 months to bring summary proceedings, the upper time limit that applies is six months because there is no point in making a complaint if the time allowed for bringing summary proceedings has elapsed, although my reading of that section may be incorrect.Section 91 is worthy of comment. It provides for powers to search a Garda station. It does not seem to restrict what parts of a Garda station can be searched nor does it provide that anyone must be informed what the search is for. The section refers to an authorisation to search rather than to a search warrant but all judicial rules and rulings on search warrants should still apply.At a meeting of the justice policy group of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party views were mixed on the volunteer members of the Garda Síochána but I welcome the idea. The existing neighbourhood watch and community policing models are inadequate for localised, low level anti-social behaviour. Everyone in the House has had regular complaints from people in suburban areas about low level crime and the incidence of anti-social behaviour, almost all of which takes place on weekend nights between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. It happens all the time and affects people's quality of life. It is at least a nuisance, if not worse, and if we are to be serious about a voluntary force, that is the area in which it can be used. This type of crime does not require high level policing.The Garda Commissioner will make proposals on the volunteer force training but I understand it will have the same powers as the gardaí. Is that necessary? Why is it necessary for a volunteer member to be able to take intimate samples in the way a professional garda can do? Why is it necessary for them to be able to discharge an arrest or search warrant? Their powers should be at a lower level.The Lord Mayor of Dublin, Councillor Michael Conaghan, produced a report this week on policing in which he referred to community policing fora. Deputy Gregory expanded on the issue and highlighted some of the weaknesses of those types of fora and I echo his comments. There should be something more serious than these fora for low level anti-social behaviour and the volunteer force would be ideally suited for that purpose.The Minister should have an influence over what the Garda Commissioner does because that will lead to greater democratic accountability. There are malpractices, particularly in rural areas, where gardaí do other jobs such as farming and rarely investigate small-scale crimes or complete their shifts. Such problems must be addressed. There is no point talking about extra resources or gardaí if the existing resources are not efficiently used. The Committee of Public Accounts will now also have the power to talk to the Garda Commissioner as the Accounting Officer for the Garda and that will be helpful.The court presenter system must be expanded. I did not do much criminal work as a barrister. Most of my work was in the District Court, but I was always struck by the large number of gardaí standing around on a routine basis in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court and the waste of time and resources involved. The system should be expanded because there is no need for these gardaí to come in, claim overtime and waste resources waiting for a traffic fine or a minor offence that does not require the high level of expertise of a fully trained garda.The joint policing committees, a recommendation in the Lord Mayor's report, are to be welcomed, although it is not necessarily a good idea for Members of the Oireachtas to serve on them. That is not a proper function as we move away from serving on health boards and local authorities. Also, many local authorities do not overlap with Garda divisions. The fire in St. Brendan's school in Bray occurred in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county area which is covered by the gardaí in Bray and County Wicklow. It is a technical difficulty and the Minister will be able to address it.I hope the Minister's detailed consultations will continue and I look forward to Committee Stage of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. When Bills of this nature come before the House, Members should be encouraged to speak their minds freely and I hope the editor of Garda News notes this. There was a time when Deputies had gardaí shifted but now the gardaí seem to think it is their job to get Deputies shifted. Neither is right and since we have ended the process of Deputies moving gardaí, it is time the Garda Representative Association ended some of its less mature activities and inability to take criticism. It should grow up and realise this House exists to examine and oversee the role of the Executive and some of its agencies.I pay tribute to Assistant Garda Commissioner Tony Hickey and Superintendent Kevin O'Donoghue for the way they handled the situation in Midleton. I have no intention of raising this ongoing issue other than to say it would restore the faith of anyone who doubted the professionalism and compassion of the Garda Síochána. They handled it in a sensitive manner and, despite the publicity, they did their job without letting it influencing them.I am concerned that every time we introduce a measure in this House to look at Garda ethics and accountability, the machinery we put in place is often pro forma and does not work. When we raise this issue, it is like talking about the press council where the media owners get protective. It would help the Garda Síochána if a fair complaints procedure were in place. Vexatious complaints should not be entertained but the Garda should not be able to decide what is vexatious. An independent person must do that.The office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland has established itself as a fair, independent and reasonable oversight body. I am increasingly concerned at our partitionism, where we change from miles to kilometres seemingly to ensure the Republic is somehow different from Northern Ireland, instead of looking at ways we could be the same. Should there not just be one ombudsman, North and South, to hear complaints about the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda Síochána, who would be totally independent and act without fear or favour? Is it necessary to establish an entirely different complaints machinery?I instigated the proposal that the Garda Commissioner become the Accounting Officer for the force and I welcome that development. I am glad that the Commissioner will have to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to account for expenditure, efficiency and effectiveness in carrying out policy. He will not be there to be questioned on policy. Local policing committees would be very welcome, but I hope they will not be like what we had in the past when the assistant commissioner came and, with the press present, councillors made outrageous statements and no real work was done. I do not know what is provided in the legislation — I could not pick it out on my first reading of it — but there is a case for providing that those bodies meet in private if they are to be taken seriously. The question of who chairs the committees is also important. A committee is only as good as its chairperson. If it has a good chairperson and the committee meets in private, some work will be done.I was the instigator of policing fora. I drafted the first motion on behalf of the policing forum in Rialto and got the Dáil Deputies at the time from Dublin Central and Dublin South-Central to sign it. On behalf of the Rialto network I arranged a meeting with the Garda Commissioner. The Deputies from both constituencies who were available met the Commissioner in Garda Headquarters in the Phoenix Park and fora were set up. That was approximately five years ago. Some of them have worked well while others have not.I am glad the committees are being put on a statutory footing. However, it has been argued by the policing forum with which I am most familiar that there are no resources for the forum. I do not believe it needs a full-time secretary but there should be an independent resource who would be available to keep minutes, ensure that what is agreed is followed up between meetings and help the chairman to ensure there is an orderly meeting of the forum and that it does not meet three or six months after the previous meeting and merely discuss issues it discussed previously. There needs to be a follow-up process. That would assist the Garda Síochána as well as the local community.When we started the process in Rialto, the atmosphere was so hostile that it was difficult for the public representatives to sit in the room with the gardaí and the local community at the same time. The gardaí, middle ranking Garda management who were there, felt badly done by. To some extent they had a case because some of the activities going on were for covert political purposes — gardaí were being used in a propagandist way. The community felt, also with a great deal of justification, that they had been let down by the State. I was a Minister of State at the time and one day I stated that we, the State, had let these people down. At the time there was an open supermarket of drugs in Dolphin's Barn in my constituency. Despite the fact that the local community, including local business people, wrote down the registration numbers of the vehicles coming to collect the drugs, nothing was done. The judges let them down. The Garda let them down. We, the public representatives, let them down. The Government, of which I was a member at the time, let them down. I said that and was denounced for it by the spokesman on behalf of the Garda representative organisations and even by Garda management. A retired judge also got in on the act. However, what I had said was true.I am glad to see there have been changes. In many cases now community gardaí in my constituency are known by their first names to local youths in the inner city flats complexes. That is a great change. That sort of turnaround in a community cannot be bought. It is, therefore, very important that the gardaí engage with the community and that the community engages with the gardaí for the morale of the gardaí and their self-fulfilment but also for the good of the community. These fora could be made to work and could be beneficial to both sides.Reference has been made to the Lord Mayor's commission. This is the second Lord Mayor's commission. I set up the first one, and I did not get the same co-operation from the then Minister for Justice as the current Minister is giving to this Lord Mayor's commission. I salute the Minister for that. It is right that national Government should co-operate with local government. In my case the commission was not chaired by me, nor did it include politicians. It was chaired by Mr. Justice Moriarty who compiled a very good report. I ask the Minister to examine that report and see what outstanding issues there are that he might address in the context of Dublin. Much of it dealt with street furniture, ensuring there were no dark dank stairwells and matters of that kind, which is part of the policing environment but not, strictly speaking, a policing issue.On the issue of training, I ask the Minister to take the opportunity at some stage to report to the House on the training procedures used for gardaí and what sort of testing there is of the people who sign up for the Garda Síochána. Do they receive any training in communicating with the public? Quite a while ago I had a constituent who was a great supporter of the Garda. When his bicycle was stolen one day, he went to the station and the garda on duty told him the book was not there and to come back in six hours when somebody else was on duty. From being a great supporter of the Garda, this man was completely turned off. All the garda needed to do was take the details and that man would have continued to be a fan of the Garda forever. How gardaí engage with the public is important, particularly for the gardaí themselves. People think highly of the Garda Síochána. There is nothing people like to see more than a garda on the beat.Will the Minister examine what ethical training is given to garda officers regarding the importance of the oath in court cases and the criminality of perjury? That needs to be re-emphasised, given the flippant way in which some cases have, allegedly, been referred to in the past.I have a further criticism regarding the management of the Garda Síochána. It is sometimes amusing, even for gardaí, to hear that the Garda Síochána is investigating a leak. One senior garda told me the Garda Síochána was the leakiest organisation in town. That must stop. If a citizen, whether he or she is a public figure, is pulled in by the Garda Síochána, his or her details and telephone number should not be supplied to the nearest press office or media contact even before the person gets home. Unfortunately, that has happened in the past. It is all very well for this Bill to provide that a garda cannot be a member of a political party, but gardaí should be banned from all political activity, not just party-political activity. It is wrong for gardaí to involve themselves as players, for whatever reason, in communicating information to the press, whether it is done officially through the press office or by individual gardaí. It should be a serious disciplinary matter to breach confidence or be involved in currying favour with the media by passing on private information about citizens.I am concerned about access to telephone records. I understand that, without any oversight, the Garda can go to Éircom or one of the other providers and obtain details of people's telephone calls, for example, a Member of the House talking to a journalist or two journalists talking to each other. Details of the fact that they made a call, not the content of the call, can be obtained. I see heads nodding. Perhaps that has been changed. If it has not been changed I would like the Minister to tell the House what oversight is in place to ensure that is not abused, that somebody does not go to their favourite uncle to get information that would be of assistance to them and that the rights of journalists, public representatives and other citizens are not interfered with.

When most people thought I was going to take up the time of the House talking about local issues, I spent a considerable amount of time talking about crime statistics. Many years ago I published a Private Members' Bill, the Bureau of Crime Statistics Bill because I have held the view for a very long time that if something cannot be measured it cannot be dealt with. If we do not know which areas are successful, we will end up putting resources into areas that are not. There has been some improvement in the compilation of statistics, but the compilation of statistics and the independent measurement of crime will lead to greater accountability.I went through this issue in considerable detail and quoted at length CompStat in New York, the experience of Mayor Giuliani, and how they had changed the whole process by providing for accountability. Those who were successful were praised and those who were not, called to account. Will the Minister tell the House how this independent measurement of crime statistics will operate under the new legislation and if he is happy that the concerns I raised in some detail on the last occasion are being dealt with?Many in this House probably would not see me as a great civil libertarian, although I hold myself to be one who stands up for the rule of law and would be concerned about any abuses of the law. I am concerned about growing infringements of the rights of citizens. There is passport control at Dublin Airport and ports generally. If I am not correct, perhaps the Minister will say so but I believe there is no obligation whatsoever on the part of an Irish citizen to show his or her passport to anybody within Ireland. If one is on an Aer Lingus flight, one will be asked to show one's passport, not for verification but to ensure it is up to date and that on arrival at one's destination one will be allowed to access the country in question. I do not have my passport in my pocket but the preamble states the Minister for Foreign Affairs asks other friendly nations to assist the bearer who is a citizen. I ask the Minister to confirm that if Irish citizens arrive at an Irish airport or port and have some form of identification to show that, say, one is a Member of the Oireachtas, it is not necessary to show one's passport to anybody within the State.It is easy to show one's passport and walk through. Some do this as a matter of convenience but it should not become a right and we should know this. That people do it as a matter of convenience should not erode their right to independently decide they have a clear form of identification which shows they are not a foreign person who does not have the right to access the country. This may seem a trivial point but it is not. All of these safeguards and rights in place for citizens should not be easily thrown away. I do not say any necessary law should not be in place but if a law needs to be put in place, put it in place without eroding the rights of citizens. I hope the Bill has the effect that the Minister——

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I have seen people getting off aeroplanes from outside the country and showing an identity card. They are not Irish. I have seen Irish people in the same queue having to show a passport. People will do it as a matter of convenience but it should not be a right. No Irish citizen should be asked for or have to show a passport within Ireland. The simplest thing to do would be to show a passport as it saves everybody a great deal of trouble but it should not become the right of anybody to ask a citizen to show his or her passport. One is not required to show one's passport anywhere within the country. Once the garda at passport control is satisfied that a person is an Irish citizen, he or she should not seek from him or her, as a right, his or her passport.I hope the Bill has the success for which the Minister hopes. I would like to see a strong and vibrant Garda Síochána where morale is high and it is confident enough to take constructive criticism and knows its friends who are not necessarily those who smile at the force and tell it what it wants to hear. I want to see a force that is effective in policing and has the career structure and level of morale that members will want if they are to be fulfilled in their work.
#CeciliaKeaveney	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-party	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-dob	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	236	This Bill has the potential to bring the justice process and the Garda closer to the community. I hope it will do this. Sometimes it is not right to mention the Judiciary specifically in the House but we cannot deal with a Garda Síochána Bill without looking at all the factions involved. Coming from County Donegal where the Garda Síochána has received one of its greatest batterings in the history of the State, through the tribunals, this is a time when not only the people of the county but the Garda are getting a bad name and are being tarred with the one brush unnecessarily. This Bill is a move in the right direction to send a positive message about the Garda. In that respect I am pleased it is before the House, particularly the elements dealing with joint policing and the concept of working with people on the ground, those with an electoral mandate and, I hope, health and other services which are obvious partners in engaging with issues that arise daily.When I became a Member, few Garda stations in County Donegal had a fax machine, a computer and a printer. I came from a school in Derry that had everything from photocopying facilities through to a fund of €40,000 for instruments. I also found that Members did not have a telephone with an answering machine or fax machine. Thankfully, we have moved on.

I am not a Member for very long but discovered that Garda stations did not have such basic equipment and that if they bought their own typewriter, head office refused to supply replacement ribbons. That was one of the issues about which I had a vendetta. It took a while but I got there and the facilities are now much better. However, they may not give me credit for this, probably because a politician should not have intervened in the first place.I fought a battle also in regard to Muff Garda station, an area in which there was a lot of petty crime and some more serious. I thank the Minister and the Department for eventually resolving the issue. Burnfoot Garda station is being upgraded. I would also like to see progress on Buncrana Garda station on the basis that it needs to be relocated on a greenfield site. This could be done easily under the decentralisation programme but it must be done as a matter of urgency. One cannot turn around in Carndonagh Garda station.Why do I raise this issue in the context of a Garda Síochána Bill? The answer is simple — if the Garda does not have a right to solve these issues, there is no point in us bashing it. There are small stations with relatively insignificant difficulties and others with major difficulties. These are facilities that have been included in plans for decades and need to be advanced. Where there is an opportunity to look for a simple solution, it should be sought. In other words, if there is decentralisation, let us roll the two together. For example, when the Carndonagh council offices were being decentralised, the concept of Carndonagh Garda station should have been progressed but the opportunity was missed.In the age of computerisation I do not understand the reason gardaí have to leave every station to head to Buncrana to input information. That is a complete waste of resources. There are only two gardaí at Malin Garda station. In this age of fax machines and e-mails, it does not make sense that gardaí have to leave for Buncana to input information. There has to be a better way. I am looking at the matter in the context of those who say one can never find a garda or when one telephones the Garda station, there is no response.The Garda gives quite legitimate reasons for not dealing with such cases. The national perception is that people's admiration for the Garda is in decline. I am very worried about the lack of continuity at the highest levels. For instance, a school cannot afford to change its principal on a whim because both teachers and students would enjoy too much freedom.In my area there were six Garda superintendents in five years, or five superintendents in six years. If a superintendent's tour of duty is only a year or 18 months, this is not conducive to ensuring the outstanding facilities are in the charge of one person to follow through from beginning to end. It often means they do not live in the area. This is not intended as a reflection on the current staff because the current superintendent is one of the longer-serving in the area, having being there for two or three years.I ask parliamentary questions regularly about Garda numbers in my area. I am always given the stock reply that everybody is happy with the number of gardaí in Inishowen and in Donegal. However, the local people are not as satisfied. It is considered that post the Good Friday Agreement, my region is a wonderful place to live, which is true. The region is the hinterland of the fourth largest city in the country and as such the city has the same difficulties as all the other cities, such as illegal drugs. People from the city socialise in our area, which is to be welcomed. However, the follow-on effect is social problems such as rowdiness outside discos, window-breaking, joy-riding and petty crimes such as smash and grab. My region could be said to be hidden by being in the hinterland of the city. For instance, there are no road direction signs for Donegal because Derry is regarded as the end of the road but when we lobby for a motorway to Donegal, the end of the road is regarded as being in Aughnacloy.We are told Donegal is well-served in Garda numbers. This cannot be the case when there were twice as many gardaí in Donegal a few years ago. Deputy Ó Snodaigh was very upset about human rights violations. When the so-called Troubles were at their height, robbing, illegal drugs and anti-social behaviour seemed to be dealt with, which does not seem to be happening now. There has been a rise in the amount of cross-Border crime.The use of police horses in Letterkenny was welcome but it is unfortunate that was necessary. There are very few police forces in the world which are able to deal with such a situation without being armed. Horses, not weapons, are all that is needed in quite a rowdy, drunken, after-disco scene in Letterkenny. It is to be welcomed that this is a country where that level of unarmed intervention still works.One is not permitted to refer to the Judiciary but I have some comments. I am aware of gardaí who work very hard to assemble a case for court. The accused is usually an habitual offender and not necessarily a first-time criminal. The accused has often been involved in a number of crimes or has a criminal record. It can be very frustrating for these gardaí when the criminals leave the court with tears of laughter and the gardaí leave with tears of frustration. The consistency of sentencing should be examined as should the relevance of the sentence in a particular case. There seems to be much inconsistency. Some people are regularly before the courts and the judge does not seem to take account of this regularity. This makes it very difficult for the gardaí to explain to the community affected by the crimes that the criminal must be taken to court again. The community is often as disillusioned as the gardaí.I am not in favour of the "lock them up and throw away the key" attitude. In the case of juvenile crime, I favour the approach that they should pay recompense to the community in a practical way such as repairing the windows they smashed or other forms of community service. Repeated offending must be taken into account in the response to it.The Garda in my area is solving crime but this message needs to be more publicised. The proposed policing board might supply a mechanism for this. People complain to me that the Garda is not doing enough to solve crime. However, the gardaí in the area will inform me when asked whether a case is pending or in hand and if a definite line of inquiry is being pursued. Often good news messages, which act as a form of deterrent to crime rather than people assuming nothing every happens, are not being publicised. One must be cautious in avoiding information being made public and so jeopardising a future case. The annual Garda report is probably not the best forum for information, which should be made available at local level.Towns in my region were reduced to no-go areas this time last year. It was a local election year and this may have had something to do with it. People did not feel safe in their beds in towns. Windows were being smashed all around them and little boy racers were stopping to change their burned-out tyres in the middle of towns before taking off again. This situation seems to have improved significantly. I suggest the reasons for this change should be food for thought for the Minister. He could inquire as to the reason for the difference between last year and this year. The perception of many people is that there is no point in reporting crime. A mechanism is necessary to deal with deficiencies in the system or with members who are not pulling their weight, whichever is the reality. Local committees may provide local solutions to local problems. At the very least, the issues can be laid before a number of different bodies which should not be talking shops but have teeth. They must be able to give any support needed such as passing the information on to a higher level or even financial support. This needs to be dealt with.I am Chairman of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which completed a report on volunteering. One of the key recommendations concerned vetting procedures which is a significant problem in respect of sporting and other organisations. There is a need for gardaí to be freed up so they are visible. I want the Bill to achieve this. I often wonder if a change in the speed limit would be necessary if more speed cameras were used on the roads, or if volunteers would be needed if Garda administrative support was available. Perhaps the volunteers need to provide the administrative support. Are volunteers required to organise traffic management in towns? Those of us familiar with small country towns know the chaos that can be caused by double and treble parking and dangerous parking. It can be a frustration not only for the pedestrian but also for car owners. The solution is often a proposal for a huge roundabout or money is spent on traffic surveys to allow for the installation of traffic lights when all that is needed is a man or woman volunteer or a garda to direct traffic.If the Minister does not favour the Garda support system in a volunteer capacity, the Army is an available resource. Could the role of the Army not be expanded? It is not often engaged in war and is almost always involved in peacekeeping. Most of the problems we have involve, for instance, gangs emerging from discos and becoming rowdy in towns with perhaps just two gardaí on duty. It should be possible to call in the Army or, if that is not possible, the FCA? Is it not possible to expand the role of existing trained organisations and remunerate them accordingly?On the issue of volunteering, I wonder what person would voluntarily give up his or her time to be a law enforcer. Perhaps my doubts are related to the geographical area in which I live. I am aware that the issue of volunteering has been studied and it has been found that people give up their time for genuine reasons so I may be wrong in this regard. Sometimes gardaí do not want to deal with a problem in case they fall out with their neighbours. Would a volunteer be prepared to take action in circumstances in which a person paid to intervene is not prepared to do so?In my area, we have received offers on voluntary policing which I would not advocate. These may be effective in the short term but they are not the types of policing I want in future. While the legislation provides for a vetting procedure, the role of volunteers in law enforcement needs to be considered with care.With regard to the role of juvenile liaison officers, under the current system recommendations on whether to prosecute a juvenile or deal with him or her under the juvenile liaison officer system are frequently made to the Director of Public Prosecutions who must then make a decision on the matter. Local sergeants should be able take such decisions because, having dealt with the juvenile in question at local level, they will know whether he or she has been given a fair chance. It is important that decisions on this matter are taken locally.The Minister stated that he does not want a perception to emerge that investigations into complaints about the Garda are not independent. Most people want justice to be done and to be seen to be done. Whether Garda investigations of gardaí will work remains open to question.Is it not self-defeating for the ombudsman commission to notify the Garda Commissioner and Minister in advance of a search of a police station? If notification is issued before the event, will evidence not be concealed?I welcome the proposed changes on policing committees. If, however, in the case of County Donegal only one of the councils, Bundoran Town Council, Letterkenny Town Council or Buncrana Urban Council, is represented on the County Donegal policing committee, it will cause problems. For example, if Buncrana was represented, the people of Bundoran, which is nearly 90 miles away from parts of Inishowen, would feel they are not represented and vice versa. I am not sure this issue has been fully resolved.The provision to allow personnel of the Garda Complaints Board to transfer to the ombudsman commission creates a problem of perception, although the recent problems have been related to the structures of the board rather than its personnel involved.Residents' associations should be included on policing committees, even if it is only at sub-committee level. While this could prove unwieldy, it is important that those involved in neighbourhood watch schemes or various other fora at community level are engaged in the process. In my region, various development groups have, on an ad hoc basis, asked the local superintendent, chief inspector or sergeant to attend development meetings. The information exchanged has been positive and useful to both sides and this approach should be expanded. This issue is the crux of the Bill.Many other questions arise. For example, should there be three ombudsmen and what would be their gender make-up? Other issues arise regarding civilian support for the Garda. The Bill has the potential to make positive change. I hope worthwhile suggestions raised in the debate will be listened to with the same care as those raised in debates in the Seanad. The legislation is overdue and will significantly improve society as a whole if implemented in the manner I anticipate.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The main outcome I would like it to deliver is greater visibility of police on the ground. The most common complaint I receive from constituents, particularly the elderly, relates to the lack of a police presence and the small number of gardaí on patrol, which is unnerving. To be fair, however, people also point out that when the police come, they are helpful, considerate and co-operative. Nevertheless, people need reassurance that gardaí are available and will respond to calls. The outcome I most wish to see is greater visibility and availability of police to control and contain what is often low level crime, to use the term employed by the Lord Mayor of Dublin yesterday.Arising from this concern, I welcome the proposal on volunteer gardaí. Although it is a positive step, it requires considerable elaboration and detail. My colleague, Deputy Costello, commented on the issue. It is not clear, for instance, whether the volunteers will be part-time or full-time, paid or unpaid. Deputies would welcome the involvement of more volunteers in many areas.By their nature, volunteers do not, as a rule, expect to be paid. As I stated yesterday in the debate on the Finance Bill, perhaps there is scope for introducing a tax credit to encourage people to volunteer. While policing is clearly much wider than the issue of volunteers, this aspect of the Bill is to be welcomed as it will create more policing facilities in many areas.One of the issues I wish to address is not covered in the Bill. It is an incident I had to deal with in my constituency which concerns the relationship between planning and crime. The Ceann Comhairle kindly allowed me to raise the matter, a controversial planning application for a super-pub in the Ballyfermot area, on the Adjournment recently.I will elaborate on the significance of the application. When it was made there were already 11 alcohol outlets within 200 metres of the proposed site. The professional planning advice of Dublin City Council and the inspector of An Bord Pleanála was that permission should be refused for the development, largely on the grounds of crime and anti-social behaviour. Complaints had been made about such problems in the area and the residents were concerned about the risk of further anti-social behaviour evolving if another super-pub was opened in the area. The members of the board of An Bord Pleanála, as opposed to its professional staff, overturned the professional planning advice of both bodies and granted approval for the development. In their determination, the members made a policy statement indicating that crime and anti-social behaviour were not part of the planning code. This was in spite of the wide berth given to the planning code in section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.The Oireachtas must give An Bord Pleanála clearer direction on assessing future applications, with a view to preventing crime and anti-social behaviour. I ask the Minster to consider this in the legislation. Given that anti-social behaviour and the risk of crime are key factors in any new planning development, to ignore them is to show scant regard for the concerns of residents.

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I thank the Minister. I would appreciate if that could be looked at again.A number of policing fora have been set up in my constituency and they were working quite well and there was quite good co-operation between the gardaí, local community activists and public representatives. I would have liked to have seen wider involvement by people from the Department of Education and Science, the health boards and so on. The policing fora need an assurance of continuity and sustainability. In the absence of any substantial funding — in the case of Rialto, no funding at all — it is difficult for them to be sustained and they cannot deliver for the community. They find it difficult to meet the conventional administrative costs associated with writing up a small report, even communicating with their local representatives and so on. While the policing fora have been positive in getting the community and the gardaí together and have made great strides, they will not continue to be successful unless there is a structure in place to ensure they are sustained and that basically means substantial funding for them.In regard to the administrative areas, if the boundaries of the Garda districts and the Dáil constituencies were similar, it would probably make life a little easier from an administrative point of view. I would also include in that the former health board areas. One finds oneself in a Dáil constituency dealing with a Garda district which is perhaps outside one's own area. I appreciate that, in the context of this Bill, this cannot be done but it would make life much simpler from an administrative and a public representative's point of view if those two areas coincided.My colleague, Deputy Costello, addressed the issues of training and education. When I was chairman of the NCEA, one of the responsibilities I was honoured to perform was to confer certificates and diplomas on gardaí graduating from Templemore. It is great there is an opportunity for progression to a third level qualification. Deputy Costello made the point strongly that it would be useful to have a training college in an urban area. Dublin would be a particularly suitable area and he identified a place in his constituency he considers to be particularly appropriate.

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I agree with Deputy Costello that the training facility in Templemore in a rural area might provide a different training than that which one might hope could be provided in an urban area where those being trained would have an opportunity to work in the same district.One sector of society which suffers most in terms of lack of visibility of policing is the elderly. The community police are to be congratulated but they have particularly difficult jobs to do much of the time. Much of the work they do is not fully appreciated. I welcome councillor Michael Conaghan's commentary on that. He has emphasised the issue of community policing. I particularly support the recommendation of the Lord Mayor's commission on an assistant commissioner with responsibility for community policing. It is important the status of community policing is recognised and that there is a reward for it. It seems the opportunities for promotion for gardaí who make a considerable commitment to the local community, often above and beyond the call of duty, are rather limited compared with other responsibilities within the policing area.I often hear complaints from communities that gardaí seem too distant. The one group of police which they see as very much accessible and available are the community police. For that reason, their role should be strengthened and they should be recognised. In areas where there are many elderly people or perhaps in poorer communities, it is important for people to have that one to one connection with their local community Garda sergeant.I welcome the provisions in Part 4 which provide for co-operation between local gardaí, the public, local authorities and Members of the Oireachtas. Again, that will build on the structure of the policing fora. As I said, there have been quite successful outcomes in terms of the policing fora in Rialto, Inchicore and in the inner city in my constituency and it needs to be developed.Above all else, I would like to see increased visibility of gardaí on the street. While people occasionally have complaints about gardaí, when the gardaí finally connect with them, they are very happy with the outcome. People's biggest fear is the lack of policing. I hear constant complaints and concerns from elderly people, in particular, about the slowness of the response. That will only be covered by increasing the number of gardaí and by a commitment to the volunteer gardaí.
#FionnaOMalleyPD	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I am glad to speak on this Bill which is long overdue and which, in keeping with the Minister's style, consolidates and reforms much of the legislation for which he is responsible. However, the Minister undersells himself because he only said the Bill would improve relations between the Garda and the Government. I would like to think it will improve relations between the Government, the Garda and the communities it serves. It is a brave attempt to bring the legislation governing the members of the Garda Síochána up to date.The Bill is important for a number of reasons but largely because it is an attempt to reform the management of the Garda Síochána. It is the first time in 80 years that this has been done. Trust in law enforcement is vital in any properly functioning democracy. This Bill also acknowledges that there has been a decline in that trust of late and it seeks to restore it, particularly through the establishment of the Garda Síochána ombudsman commission in place of the Garda complaints board. The purpose of this commission is to ensure openness, transparency and accountability in the process by which complaints against the Garda are investigated.The commission will be an independent body, which is tremendously important, and this is in line with the Government's commitment to establish a new body with the power of an ombudsman to investigate complaints. This move is welcome and timely. There have been many justified complaints about the existing mechanism and the way in which complaints against gardaí are dealt with. There is a perception that many complaints are not investigated properly and that breaches of discipline are not adequately dealt with. This has contributed to the breakdown in trust between the Garda and the public and it must be restored. Trust is both a fragile and precious commodity and it can easily be broken. The establishment of this Garda ombudsman commission will fully repair that trust and restore public confidence in the force.The important element in the establishment of the Garda ombudsman commission is that it will be fully independent and a three-person body. This is to maintain full independence from the Garda. No person serving on that body will be a garda or a former garda. That is fundamental because criticisms of the current complaints procedure have centred on the inadequacies of gardaí investigating other gardaí which has resulted in an absence of confidence. The independence of the new commission is an important gesture.Deputy Cuffe criticised the fact it will be a three-person board. He felt that was diluting the responsibilities. I beg to differ because one vital aspect of the commission is that there must be no sense of a personal vendetta on the part of a commission member against, for example, the Garda Commissioner. This is what happened in Northern Ireland in that it became a stand-off between personalities. This was not good for the force. This aspect of the legislation is somewhat protected by the provision of a three-person commission.In general, the commission may decide whether it will conduct its own investigations or investigate specific complaints brought to it by the Garda Síochána. However, complaints involving death or serious physical injury must be investigated by the commission's investigators. When reading about this, I was prompted to think of the ongoing Abbeylara inquiry. The measures proposed in regard to the commission will be more satisfactory because I am not sure there is anybody who is satisfied to date with the Abbeylara inquiry, which seems to go on interminably. I doubt if the family of Mr. John Carthy are satisfied because it has not had closure and the satisfaction of a swift inquiry into the events surrounding his death.I hope the new commission will obviate the necessity for inquiries such as that into the Abbeylara incident and will permit the conduct of the Garda to be investigated swiftly. I welcome the fact that there will be a staff of 80 people on the commission. This is an indication of the seriousness with which the Minister views the issue. It is important the commission is properly resourced, and the annual budget of €7 million is positive in this regard.The commission will also examine Garda practices and procedures and, within two years of its establishment, will report to the Oireachtas on its effectiveness and the adequacy of its functions. This is important because responsibility rests ultimately with this House. We are representatives of the people and new initiatives must be checked. There is no point establishing a body and allowing it to go in the wrong direction by not performing its functions as intended. There is no better place than this House to set things right in such instances. The commission will do a great deal for morale among the force and, therefore, engender a greater level of trust among the public.Another significant reform measure in the Bill is the establishment of an independent Garda Síochána inspectorate, in a bid to improve democratic accountability for the actions of the force. A healthy democracy is based on the principles of civil obedience, law and order. This requires a properly functioning police force which commands the trust, support and respect of the public. The Garda Síochána inspectorate will introduce the concept of benchmarking to the force, with standards, practice and performance benchmarked to comparable international policing experiences. The key objectives will be to ensure trust, promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda and provide independent and objective advice to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the operation and administration of the force.I also welcome the provision that Garda recruits must make a declaration to indicate their regard for human rights. However, I was somewhat astonished to observe this is a new measure. One imagines that members of the Garda Síochána would have respect for human rights when carrying out their policing duties, but it is an important measure to include. It recognises the need for members of the force to have well-developed interpersonal and communications skills, which are just as important as their ability to perform their duties competently and efficiently as officers of the law.The Garda Síochána has its critics and must take fair criticism for the failures that have taken place in the past. We must form judgments on the force and its members but we would do well to remember the simple, spontaneous acts of bravery demonstrated by our unarmed gardaí on a daily basis. An incident took place last year, for example, whereby an unarmed female garda managed to apprehend a violent, armed and dangerous gangland criminal who was well-known to the Garda. The bravery of this garda in doing her job by confronting this menacing figure brought a great sense of pride to the force. We must remember that gardaí are unarmed in this increasingly violent and dangerous society. Time and again, there is evidence of the spontaneous bravery of the force.A further reason to welcome this Bill is that it embodies the principle of community involvement. Deputy Upton referred to this week's report by the Lord Mayor into policing and crime in the Dublin area. It is timely that this report was issued when this Bill is before the House. The Bill provides for the establishment of joint policing committees with local elected representatives whereby the latter will be able to make recommendations about local policing matters. It is always good to have matters of this nature dealt with as closely as possible to where people have responsibility for the conduct in question.The committees will also allow local gardaí to make recommendations to local authorities about steps the latter can take to reduce crime. This measure establishes on a formal basis the partnership between community and the Garda which is currently enjoyed by many communities. My area of Dún Laoghaire enjoys a tremendous service from its community gardaí. A common item at resident association meetings throughout the constituency is the report from the community garda. Great tribute is always paid to these gardaí because of the close co-operation they have with the local residents, who feel they know those who are looking after them by name and regularly see them on the beat.Tackling crime on a local level is very much a two-way street. Councillors and local community representatives cannot fairly blame the Garda if they have failed to play their own part. Local authorities cannot criticise local gardaí for a rise in incidents of joyriding if they fail to put in place an appropriate infrastructure to deal with the problem. Nor can they fairly criticise an increase in mugging incidents if proper street lighting and other facilities are not provided by the local authority. They cannot criticise a rise in youth crime in areas that have been badly planned with no recreational services for local residents.This part of the Bill was subject to a number of amendments in the Seanad and it has emerged stronger as a consequence. A Bill going through both Houses should change in its passage because we see things about our society which need to be changed. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to be commended for his acceptance of amendments. It is not every Minister who is so generous in accepting help, support and input from Members.The provision for the establishment of a Garda reserve is particularly welcome as it maximises the potential of available policing facilities. Ireland is the only civil law country in the world without such a reserve on which to call and its establishment is long overdue. As the Minister made clear in his speech the reserve is in no way meant to be a replacement for the existing force, but rather it is intended as a valuable community resource to be called upon and used to perform certain functions at certain times.When passed the Bill will ensure the Garda Síochána is a truly modern force, fit for the 21st century, efficiently organised and run. It will have the full faith, trust and confidence of the communities it serves. I thank the Minister for his energy and drive. I encourage him to continue the reforms he has brought in his portfolio. I commend the Bill to the House.

Like my colleagues I welcome the Bill, which represents a major step forward and is long overdue. The Minister is to be congratulated on its introduction. Whether the Bill goes far enough is another question entirely. For the requirements of the moment the Bill is to be welcomed.The Minister will not be surprised to hear that my key issue relates to the recruitment and retirement of gardaí. We have seen significant publicity in recent years about the number of gardaí and the requirement for additional recruits. I congratulate the Minister on his recent initiative in extending the recruitment age limit from 26 to 35, which in time will prove to be a major step forward, allowing a whole new age cohort to be eligible for recruitment to the Garda. It reflects the times in which we live. Mobility of the workforce in geographical and professional terms is a hallmark of the current era. I received a number of representations from individuals who discovered relatively late in life, at least in terms of choice of profession, that they genuinely believed they wanted a career in the police force. It is interesting and hardly totally coincidental that this year in excess of 10,000 people applied for 2,000 places. On the contrary it is reflective of the change in the recruitment age limit.However, in line with the change in the recruitment age limit, I draw attention to the stipulations on retirement age. It is a pity that we lose a number of highly qualified and very valuable members of the force at the age of 50. I understand the issues regarding the rules that pertained at the time of recruitment. I am thinking of a Garda sergeant in my locality who has a wealth of local knowledge and genuine policing expertise to contribute to the force. He felt obliged to retire when he became eligible at the age of 50 to pursue another interest because he knew he would be obliged to retire at the age of 57.Change in this matter should be considered, as it would have benefits not only for the force, but also for society in general. While it may be some time before the benefits accruing from any change to the retirement rules accrue, it can be addressed to the benefit of the community, the force and particularly individual gardaí. People with approximately 15 years good working life ahead of them should not be compelled to retire from their chosen profession because of the rules under which they were recruited. While it may be understandable in the circumstances and particularly in the context of the evolution of the Garda Síochána over the years, nevertheless this topic could be addressed with benefit all around.The Garda has given outstanding service to the State over the years. I do not feel qualified to comment on its contribution to the State. The phenomenon of violence against gardaí and fatal incidents in particular has only occurred in my adult lifetime. In 1970 Garda Richard Fallon was murdered when he answered an emergency call in response to a bank raid at the Royal Bank on Arran Quay. This incident had a huge impact on me at the time and listening to a radio interview last weekend with the son of Garda Richard Fallon it would appear that some issues remain outstanding. In deference to the force and its morale, and in the interests of society at large, if issues need to be addressed, however uncomfortable it may be politically, they should be addressed. The vast majority of people remember the sacrifice made by Garda Richard Fallon. If issues remain outstanding they should be addressed for the sake of his family.Unfortunately he was the first of a number of gardaí to give their lives in the service of the State and the force over the period of what we euphemistically call "the Troubles". Some considerable time has now elapsed since the murder of a garda in the course of his duty. The incident resulting in the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and the injuring of Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan has been well rehearsed in this House and I will not go into it further.The Garda has been of indescribable benefit to the State. It probably owes its genesis to Sir Robert Peel in Britain. I doubt if Sir Robert Peel had current lifestyles in mind when he founded the British police force. The founders of our police force could not have anticipated what the present force needs to deal with. The Bill is extremely welcome and goes a long way towards addressing the issues that arise. The issue of policing on the street and in terms of white-collar crime needs to be addressed. I look forward to a further debate on the matter.

I find the gardaí with whom I deal co-operative and helpful. They do an excellent job. Issues of trust and confidence in the Garda have arisen in recent years for a number of reasons. People are concerned about Garda manpower, buildings, locations, equipment and the independence of its investigations. In fairness, there have been some high-profile investigations in the recent past. I consider the deployment of Garda manpower, the location of Garda stations and the provision of Garda equipment to be the primary reasons for the reduction in trust and confidence in the force, rather than the high profile investigations I have mentioned.The number of gardaí serving at present in Clonmel, a town of between 17,000 and 18,000 people, is smaller than the number serving there 20 years ago. There are 40 gardaí, of all ranks, in Clonmel and just eight members of the force are on duty in the town at any one time. The eight gardaí are supposed to police an area that has a population of almost 25,000, when one takes Clonmel's hinterland into account. An inadequate number of gardaí is being deployed to police an area of that size. One wonders what criteria are used to determine the allocation of manpower resources within the Garda. Tralee has a similar population to Clonmel, but it has almost twice as many gardaí as the latter town. Approximately 60 gardaí are stationed in Thurles, which has a population approximately one third that of Clonmel. The manpower issue arises often when one examines the reasons for the undermining of trust in the Garda. Individual gardaí are doing their best, but they cannot respond to calls from the public in the way they would like.The recruitment and appointment of community gardaí is probably the single most important issue facing the Garda Síochána. It is not a new phenomenon — we have been considering it for many years. Community policing has proven its worth in many parts of Ireland, but large swathes of the country are not served by community gardaí. There are no dedicated community gardaí in my constituency of Tipperary South. Some gardaí have community functions as well as their other duties. Community gardaí are absolutely necessary. The problem of a lack of trust and confidence in the Garda is found primarily in large urban housing estates. Visible gardaí are needed on the beat in such areas, where they can liaise with local communities, tenants' associations, residents' associations and RAPID groups.Significant resources need to be invested to help community gardaí to build up relationships with young people in certain areas, but that is not being done at present. Such relationships would help to curb the development of low-level crime in the form of anti-social behaviour. Such behaviour is often not reflected in crime statistics, but it is serious, especially for elderly and vulnerable people. It is difficult for people who are different in any way to live in some of the areas to which I refer. They constantly suffer from stone-throwing, abuse, daubing and egg-throwing etc. The investment of more resources in community policing would help to stop a substantial proportion, if not all, of such behaviour.While I welcome the sections of the Bill which provide for the Garda ombudsman commission, I would like the commission to be entirely independent. If the Garda is to be completely accepted by the people, it is in its interests that a totally independent investigations procedure should be put in place. It would not be a good idea to allow gardaí to be involved in the ombudsman commission's investigations, or to allow gardaí to transfer some investigations to other gardaí. That would not be a good way of dealing with the problems I have discussed. I would prefer if the commission was allowed to operate entirely independently. Such a system would be better and would be more likely to be welcomed by the Garda. I would like to have discussed various other matters, but I have run out of time.

As we examine the broader issue of crime and how we deal with it, we need to consider some of society's major problems. Not enough is being done to address broader aspects of the crime problem, such as anti-social behaviour and dysfunctional and violent young people. The Bill is an important part of the debate on crime because policing is such a central aspect of the matter.We need a police force that is professional and accountable and can sustain the trust and confidence of the people. I would like to bury the myth, which is often spun in response to those who raise human rights issues and cases of miscarriage of justice, that people who ask serious questions about the Garda Síochána do not support the force. Such people are merely interested in the provision of a quality police service. I welcome many aspects of this legislation for that reason. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, needs to be accountable, radical and creative. Above all, he needs to listen to people on the ground.

The Minister should listen to the people more often, rather than basing his policies on hearsay. I want him to be professional and objective when dealing with issues. I feel uncomfortable when a Minister or senior Garda figure says they think they know who perpetrated a crime. I have questions about such statements. I question the integrity and professionalism of such an approach.I commend the many gardaí who do valuable work and provide many examples of good practice. I have seen many examples of good practice in my constituency over the years. However, we should not be afraid to say in the House that there have been many examples of bad practice. I commend those gardaí who are focused on their job and are not distracted by other issues, such as the possibility of double-jobbing. We should not be afraid to refer to such practices.I would like to raise with the Minister a number of issues which arose in my constituency in the last week. Two people armed with a knife and a gun entered a shop in the area last Saturday and stole €6,000. The shopkeeper, who worked her way up from being a shop assistant to running the business after she bought it out, is trying to decide whether to continue to run the business in the face of such intimidation and fear. I have reassured her that she should not give up and advised her to stick with it, but it is difficult for her to be confident. She needs the support of the gardaí on the ground.I would like to mention another case, which highlights the fact that some people in society are treated differently from others. I refer to the case of the mother of a gentle drug addict who was murdered. She was told the day after the trial that the case was coming up. Such treatment is not acceptable. It would not have happened on the south side of Dublin, where the relevant authorities would have kept in touch with the family and informed it of developments. I recently dealt with the case of a man whose young daughter was slashed in the face with a glass in a pub. Those who were responsible got away scot free because of fear and intimidation. Such issues need to be highlighted.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	253	In accordance with the health strategy, the immediate focus has been on the reduction of waiting lists and waiting times for inpatient and day-case treatments in acute hospitals.The national treatment purchase fund has been successful in arranging treatments for 23,379 patients to the end of 2004. The allocation to the fund for 2005 is €64 million, which represents an increase on the allocation of €44 million for 2004. The NTPF is expected to arrange treatment for a further 16,000 patients in 2005. It is now the case that, in most instances, any public patient waiting more than three months will be facilitated by the fund.While our immediate focus has been on reducing waiting lists for admission to hospital for treatment, I am obviously very concerned about the long waiting times being reported in respect of obtaining outpatient appointments in certain specialties. There appear to be difficulties in particular areas and the problem also appears to be spread throughout the country. The management of outpatient waiting lists requires the attention of both the newly established Health Service Executive and the NTPF. At a recent meeting with the NTPF, I raised the question of the fund playing a part in expediting outpatient appointments. The NTPF is examining its position with a view to further assessing the needs of patients on waiting lists and the most appropriate clinical pathways and protocols required for their care. Details regarding this exercise are being finalised by the fund and I expect to receive them shortly.

Is there any role for the NTPF in reducing the size of waiting lists? Could it take letters of referral from GPs and give patients a realistic idea as to when they will be seen by a consultant? There is a number of problems in this area. Sometimes when one refers patients to orthopaedic or ENT units in the south east, one does not get a letter back stating when those patients will be seen, at least not until two or three months before their appointments are due. This, however, could be two or three years after the original letter is sent. This is totally unsatisfactory to patients and the GPs who are trying to manage them in a proper way.If we believe GPs are the gatekeepers of the acute hospital sector, which is slowly crumbling in front of us, we should give patients a realistic time at which they can be seen by a consultant and inform their GPs accordingly. The NTPF seems to be in a position to take over this role and look after the list for the whole country, possibly for all 37 acute hospitals. Perhaps there is no need for each hospital to have an outpatients' appointments administrative centre.The validation of the current lists represents an annoyance and a hindrance and consequently care is not being given to patients when they need it. The waiting list trends are published every year in the media but the patients are not being seen any sooner. I would like to hear a radical proposal from the Tánaiste so patients will know when they will be seen. It is quite strange that in some other jurisdictions, the populations of which believe they have a good health care system, patients often wait no more than 12 weeks for an operation after the sending of the original letter of referral by their GPs. In Ireland, patients often have to wait 12 weeks just to get on to the waiting list. We are falling way behind.I know the Minister has to deal with the crisis in accident and emergency units.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I largely share Deputy Twomey's perspective. The NTPF was established as a universal insurer for those waiting a long time for appointments. The idea was that the fund would have a very focused, targeted approach to using private capacity that exists within or outside the State to deal with those badly in need of surgical procedures. It has worked extraordinarily well.Awareness of the fund needs to be increased. Almost every week in my office, I deal with five or six cases concerning people entitled to use the fund but who have not been told about it. Later this month and in early March, the NTPF will engage in an extensive advertising campaign to ensure patients know they are entitled to obtain the treatment they require through the fund. The NTPF suggested that we have a patient register so the power would be with the patient and so the patient would be given details on the time of his or her outpatient appointment. The idea was that the patient could make direct contact himself or herself. The NTPF also felt the waiting lists were very inaccurate and that there was considerable duplication.Given the long waiting times associated with some specialties, I must examine the issue of outpatient appointments. We need to increase substantially the number of consultant posts. We have approximately 1,940 consultants at present but we need to have 3,600. This is why it is so important that we negotiate with the hospital consultants regarding a new, more modern and flexible contract for consultants. Patients have to wait for so long because we obviously do not have enough consultants. In light of this, I have asked the NTPF to make proposals on how it could deal with patients who are waiting longest for outpatient appointments. The Deputy is correct that some have to wait for incredibly long periods. If there is capacity in the State to deal with these patients in a different way while we await the appointment of more consultants, it should be used.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	261	The Deputy is correct in what he is implying. Not only doctors say that. Sometimes going to an accident and emergency unit is the only way people can get to see a consultant. However, it is adding to the pressure on these units. Every day, 3,300 people present at accident and emergency units. Accident and emergency units are supposed to deal only with accidents and emergencies. We do not have 3,300 accident and emergency cases per day but, due to the lack of out-of-hours GP services in many areas and the failure to secure outpatients' appointments, people are using accident and emergency units. It is important, therefore, that we use the fund when we can without detracting from its focused nature and that we increase the number of consultant appointments, particularly but not exclusively outside Dublin. Some regions have no rheumatologist or plastic surgeon and only one specialist in areas of considerable activity. Nobody can provide a service on that basis.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	262	It is regrettable that the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association and the Irish Medical Organisation are contemplating industrial action in pursuit of a resolution of the dispute over medical indemnity cover for consultants. The only people who suffer as a consequence of this or any industrial action in the health service are patients. It is particularly unfortunate that consultants should chose to embark on this course of action when they and the Government should be uniting to pursue the common goal of ensuring the Medical Defence Union lives up to its obligations to its Irish members.Over the years, Irish hospital consultants paid significant amounts in subscriptions to the MDU. Between 80% and 90% of these costs were ultimately borne by the Irish taxpayer. Taxpayers and consultants have a common interest in ensuring the MDU does not escape from its responsibility for meeting the cost of claims from these years. I therefore appeal once again to both organisations to withdraw their threats and to work with the Government in pursuit of our joint interest. It is clear, however, that even if we kept industrial action to a minimum, it would cause delays in the treatment of patients and prolong their suffering.Within a month of my becoming Minister for Health and Children, I gave an assurance about cover at a conference of the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association and put it in writing. It stated that "no Irish person who has suffered from a medical mishap would be left without compensation and no consultant would be left without cover in all reasonable circumstances and in accordance with the law." Last November, I put in place arrangements for the legal defence of one consultant at St. James's Hospital who was taken off cover by the MDU and against whom a claim had been notified. I met quickly this consultant, representatives of the medical board of St. James's Hospital, the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association and the IMO to agree these arrangements. I am still engaged in intensive efforts to avoid this eventuality through discussions with both organisations. I am exploring whatever avenues may be open to the State in its own right, without compromising its legal position and in association with the consultants affected by a withdrawal of cover by the MDU, to pursue the MDU by legal means. Arrangements are being put in place for representatives of the Chief State Solicitor's Office, the Office of the Attorney General and outside counsel to meet legal representatives of both organisations to discuss these issues. It would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on these discussions.As the Government decided that the clinical insurance scheme should be operated by a State body, namely, the National Treasury Management Agency acting as the State's claims agency, no procurement procedure was required. All aspects of the operation of the scheme required to be supplied are operated by external contractors where the full public service tendering procedures apply.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I thank the Minister for her reply. It is regrettable that the hospital consultants are threatening this action. Does the Minister not accept, however, that doctors are extremely anxious and concerned at the situation in which they find themselves? They understood at first that they had cover from the MDU that turned out in practice to be discretionary, which let them down badly. They fear that, despite her promise, the Minister will let them down again and are intent on ensuring that does not happen. They want a legally binding commitment that they and their patients will not be left without cover, not just words and promises at a conference.Surely the Minister is aware that when a similar process took place in Britain to set up a state indemnity scheme, the state took on the historic liabilities. In this instance, however, a secret deal was done with a competitor of the MDU which is a matter of some concern. Does the MPS have any historic liabilities? Does the deal with the Department protect it from any claims coming through? It seems extraordinary that the historic liabilities were not dealt with comprehensively, leading to the mess in which people find themselves.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	264	There is a misunderstanding. The arrangements with the MPS were also offered to the MDU. When the MDU complained to the European Commission, it held that the procedures were fair.The British Government took over the historic liabilities of obstetricians whereas we are concerned with all consultant activity in the public sector. I gave an assurance in good faith but I cannot compromise the State's legal position. It may be that, as a result of the communication from the MDU last Friday, this matter will be resolved through litigation rather than negotiation. We would prefer negotiation but if that is not possible, we will have to pursue the matter legally although I cannot compromise the position of the State and the taxpayers.The MDU should meet its responsibilities. That was the view expressed in Mr. Justice Johnston's judgment in the High Court last Tuesday. The consultants, the Government and the patients are all at one on this issue. From a legal perspective we must ensure that we do nothing that could compromise our position and the State finances.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	265	Will the Minister assure us that a legally binding guarantee will be given to patients as well as doctors to resolve the immediate problems of potential industrial action? The Minister has not answered my question about the MPS and the historic liabilities. Will she publish the secret deal made with the MPS? Does she not accept that the problem is the large claims in obstetrics? While it may include other consultants, the MDU raised this issue with the Department in the early 1990s.It is regrettable that the Minister's words before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children have set us further from negotiation on this issue. Will she publish the secret deal and ensure that a legally binding guarantee is provided for the doctors? We understand the legal complexities but there is a central need to protect patient care.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	266	My comments were similar to those of Mr. Justice Johnston. The MDU should meet its responsibilities. This has gone on for far too long. Obstetricians are not the only ones affected. Mr. Young from St. James's Hospital is a cardiac surgeon and he was taken off cover. I have a brief on the history of the MPS and the MDU. The MPS took over the obstetric cases and ring-fenced the subscriptions paid. A complaint was made to the EU that unfair practices followed and the Commission held that the procedures were correct. I can make the briefing note available to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Two issues arise. From the perspective of State aids, if an unfavourable deal was done with one group, namely, the MDU that would have implications for the MPS which at all stages made it clear that it is prepared to make a sum of money available if we were to take over the past liabilities.We have tried to have a due diligence exercise carried out because there are major differences between both sides. The MDU puts the value of the historic and known cases at approximately €160 million. The State team puts it at €400 million. There is a large gap between the two. The due diligence exercise is to establish the true position with a view to reaching agreement on the sums of money concerned. We do not have those issues with the MPS and if we were to take over the MPS cases, we would expect an appropriate monetary contribution.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	269	The Government has already undertaken specific investment measures to provide new and improved accident and emergency departments in hospitals, to increase the number of emergency medicine consultants and to provide additional funding to move patients from the acute hospital system to a more appropriate care setting. The Government will continue to focus on the measures required to improve the delivery of accident and emergency services, recognising that we must not look at accident and emergency departments alone to find solutions. We must also develop primary care, sub-acute care and community care so that patients can be treated in the most appropriate setting.The report of the national task force on medical staffing — the Hanly report — emphasised the importance of ensuring that we treat emergency or life-threatening conditions at the most appropriate location. Treatment should commence at the scene, typically by trained ambulance personnel, and the patient should then be taken to the nearest hospital that is best equipped to meet his or her needs.The Hanly report also pointed to the need for further development of ambulance services, increases in the number of acute beds and a reorganisation and resourcing of primary care so that patients, wherever they live, have equitable and rapid access to high quality emergency care.The Hanly report is a significant contribution to the development of acute hospital services and I have asked the National Hospitals Office to progress its recommendations accordingly.

The Minister's response repeats remarks she made last Monday to the effect that the Hanly report is a significant piece of work. She did not, however, make clear, then or now, what parts of the report will be implemented.It seems the Government would like to give the impression that the implementation group has been wound up as a result of public pressure and opposition rather than because of the consultants' boycott. The Minister may clarify that. Does the Tánaiste agree with the report which states: "In local hospitals there should not be a requirement for on-site medical presence overnight or at weekends"? Has she any appreciation of the dire consequences of this, not only for local hospitals but communities throughout the jurisdiction? If this were acted upon, the consequences would be dire.Does the Tánaiste agree that the majority of smaller hospitals throughout the State would not be able to provide accident and emergency facilities on an ongoing basis in any capacity because all inpatient services have a requirement of 24-hour medical care? If we are to lose one, we will lose all and it will have a fatal result for hospital services. Does the Tánaiste accept that the fate of Monaghan General Hospital in regard to the loss of critical services is the fate that awaits many smaller local hospitals throughout the jurisdiction?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	271	The key recommendation in the Hanly report is that we need more manpower at consultant level throughout the country. Although the genesis to the Hanly report was the working time directive, its remit goes way beyond this. We need to move from having approximately 1,940 consultants to 3,600 if we are to provide regional self-sufficiency as far as is possible.From a patient care perspective, a patient must be taken to the most appropriate hospital if he or she is a serious accident and emergency case. The sooner a patient gets there the better. For example, if one has serious brain injury, Beaumont Hospital is the national centre. A small country with 4 million people cannot have a centre in every region. While there are issues in regard to where a potential second centre should be, nobody has argued we should have a centre in every region.The same applies in other complex areas. Services can only be provided on a national basis for a population of 4 million or on a regional basis depending on the speciality. We must make progress because of patient safety concerns. If patients are not cared for in a safe environment, lives or the chances of making a full recovery are put at risk.That is why the establishment of the health information quality assurance authority, which will deal with accreditation and standards and provide information, is important and involves priority legislation which we hope to publish in the near future and take through the House by the summer of this year. The board has been appointed on an interim basis and will hold its first meeting in Cork at the beginning of March.Some 85% of accident and emergency cases will still be dealt with in smaller hospitals. Many accident and emergency cases dealt with in accident and emergency departments could be dealt with in a localised hospital environment. However, more complex cases must go to the bigger hospitals where a multi-disciplinary team of specialists and greater resources are located. The Deputy knows one cannot provide in each county the range of services we would all wish to have. The best we can achieve is sufficiency at regional level.To take the mid-west, which was part of the pilot study for the Hanly report, until recently the region had no rheumatologist, although one third of women in the country suffer from arthritis, and no plastic surgeon, which it still does not have. There are serious deficiencies in the regions and we must deal with the problem on a regional basis, which was the genesis of the Hanly report.We would not add value by having the same group travel the country interviewing all those who work in health care. Some 95% of those the Hanly group interviewed, who were working in health care, agreed with the recommendations. We need to get on with increasing manpower, particularly at consultant level. The sooner we complete the negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association the better so we can have a more flexible, modern contract of employment, suitable to the needs of 2005.

However, does the Tánaiste agree that the Hanly model represents an over-centralisation and will spell a diminution of services at hospital sites throughout the country? I speak with some experience of this. The Monaghan experience is the template that is being and will be applied if the outworking of the Hanly report is to proceed at other hospital sites throughout the country.Does the Tánaiste agree that closing all inpatient beds in smaller hospitals is the opposite of what should be happening because there will clearly be a need for more inpatient beds as time goes on? We addressed this matter earlier today. There is continual need for investment not only in regard to beds but front-line cover in terms of acute hospital services. What will happen to our local hospitals?The Tánaiste should be specific because we want to know what exactly will happen in regard to the outworking of the Hanly report. Will it be introduced by stealth or in a clinical cut following the next general election, as happened in the past in regard to hospital service provision?

In 2003, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, established a project team, chaired by the East Coast Area Health Board, to progress the redevelopment of the Central Mental Hospital. This team included representatives from the Department of Health and Children, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the East Coast Area Health Board, the clinical director, director of nursing and hospital manager of the Central Mental Hospital, the Irish Prison Service and a representative of the chief executive officers of the other health boards.The project team's remit was to critically examine all options for the redevelopment of the hospital, to put together a design brief for the redevelopment and to examine various financing options for the project. Six options were considered by the group: to develop a new facility on a greenfield site in the greater Dublin area; to develop a new facility on a greenfield site outside the greater Dublin area; to refurbish and upgrade the existing facility to accommodate the service; to have a partial new build of the hospital with retention and refurbishment of some of the existing building; to transfer the service to another existing facility; or to do nothing.Several options, including the option of remaining in Dundrum, were examined under the various criteria including clinical quality-strategic fit, the cost, both capital and revenue, timescale, future demands, integrated services, accessibility to the public and safety and security.The team reported to the Department in May 2004 and recommended that the Central Mental Hospital be relocated to a new purpose-built facility in the greater Dublin area as this was judged to be the most appropriate option for delivery of patient care. The project team made no specific recommendation to locate the Central Mental Hospital adjacent to a prison. However, it must be borne in mind that 97% of admissions to the hospital come from within the prison service.The new central mental hospital will be a health facility providing a therapeutic forensic psychiatric service to the highest international standards in a state-of-the-art building. I can confirm that the hospital will remain under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children and will be owned and managed by the Health Service Executive. I have asked my officials to examine the option of providing a separate governance structure for the hospital, by way of its own board, reflecting its importance as a national, tertiary psychiatric service. It is intended to develop the central mental hospital, independently of the prison complex to replace Mountjoy Prison, by means of a separate capital development project managed and directed by the Health Service Executive. A new central mental hospital on the 150 acre site will have its own grounds with a separate entrance, access road and a separate address to the prison complex.The Deputy referred to stigma. Much has been said about the stigma of the mental health service. The present Government is doing more than any other Government to relieve that stigma and to help patients. We are encountering significant opposition from many unlikely quarters. I am doing everything possible, including speaking to many voluntary organisations which appreciate the work that is being done. The Central Mental Hospital has been in Dundrum since 1850. This Government is the first to consider relocating it and building a new central mental hospital. I also understand that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and I were the first Ministers ever to visit Dundrum.The lands of the Central Mental Hospital are the property of the Office of Public Works. My Department is preparing detailed proposals for Government for the development of a new hospital and the disposal of the property at Dundrum. It is my intention that the proceeds from the sale of the existing site will go towards the provision of the new hospital in the first instance, with the balance of funds to be invested in health facilities, in particular community mental health facilities. A memo will go to Cabinet soon in that regard.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	291	My question relating to what consultations had taken place between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister on siting the hospital in grounds of the prison was not answered. In view of the exposé in a recent "Prime Time" programme regarding practices in regard to the movement of prisoners who are suffering from psychiatric conditions and who are rendered as being insane, it is important that we are made aware of the details of any deliberations that take place between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the psychiatric services in Dundrum. Given that people are determined insane and removed to the psychiatric hospital, then rendered sane for the purposes of being taken to court, and subsequently rendered insane to return to prison, we are anxious to know what discussions took place with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this regard.Does the Minister of State agree that organisations such as Aware, Schizophrenia Ireland and others have expressed extreme concern about the discrimination taking place against those who are mentally ill? The patron of GROW stated——

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I am asking the Minister of State to comment on the fact that 97% of hospital admissions come from the Prison Service. Surely it is an indictment of the whole service and the relationship between those with mental illness and the psychiatric services that people with severe mental illness are being moved from prison, and the whole approach——

I met GROW yesterday to discuss many matters of concern regarding mental health. To my knowledge its representatives did not even mention——

I had a very useful discussion yesterday with GROW for approximately an hour or an hour and a half and its representatives did not refer to the Central Mental Hospital. I had a very useful discussion this morning with Schizophrenia Ireland. Its representatives had reservations about the site but, following my discussions with them, they understand the progress that is being made.

The Deputy speaks about stigma, but a constant reiteration and repetition about the problems in the mental health service is becoming a bit tiresome to many organisations. Much good work is being done.

In fairness to every Deputy in the House, we try to stay within Standing Orders as best we can. Six minutes is allowed per question. On the last question, my understanding is that the Minister of State had two minutes for a reply but took five minutes. As we have spent more than ten minutes on that question, I ask Members on both sides of the House to try to stay within Standing Orders as best they can so that we can get through as many questions as possible.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	313	As the Deputy will be aware, the Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver or arrange to be delivered on its behalf health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the proposed developments at Tuam Hospital.The HSE western area has prepared a project planning brief for the Tuam health campus incorporating a community hospital, Alzheimer's unit, child care training centre, primary care unit and an ambulance base. This proposal was one of a number of proposals for capital funding submitted by the HSE western area to my Department for consideration. As responsibility for the development of services now rests with the HSE, any decisions relating to this project will be a matter for the HSE having regard to the western area's overall capital funding priorities in the context of the HSE's service plan for 2005.My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, met a cross party delegation from Tuam Town Council at the end of January and was briefed on the proposal to develop a health campus on the grounds of the hospital. During the meeting, the Tánaiste acknowledged the importance of utilising facilities which were purchased by the State for health care use but said that this would have to be done in the context of the HSE's service plan for the western area. Members of the delegation put forward a number of suggestions on the options concerning the possible use of the Grove Hospital building. The Tánaiste undertook to examine these options and to revert back to Tuam Town Council. My Department will continue to liaise with the HSE to progress this project in the context of the HSE's service plan.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	314	That reply appears to be at variance with reports circulated following the Tánaiste's visit to Galway at the end of January when she met the deputation from Tuam Town Council to which the Minister of State referred. I refer the Minister of State to an article reporting an interview with the Tánaiste which appeared in the Tuam Herald following her visit to Galway. She said she was getting some experts to examine the situation regarding the possibilities for this property and that she hoped this report would be with her within weeks. She went on to say that after meeting the Tuam Town Council group and hearing its view she would analyse its presentation and once she got the views of the experts she would hope to have further information in a few weeks. That is what this question is all about. Why was there a need to get experts to review this project, or what is the Tánaiste talking about?Will the Minister of State agree that before the new Health Service Executive came into being the body charged with the delivery of health services in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon was the Western Health Board? Anticipating that he will agree with that, given that is the first line of the replies to questions from the Department, will he agree it is time to accept the report put forward and submitted by the Western Health Board to the Minister on 8 October 2002 requesting that a health campus be provided in Tuam that would consist of a community hospital, an ambulance base, a primary care unit and a few other facilities? If he does so, surely it is time to approve this project.Will the Minister of State agree that the national spatial strategy which was launched in 2002 lists 11 characteristics to identify a hub town, one of which is that a hub town would have a local or community hospital? Assuming he agrees with that because it is a characteristic listed in the national spatial strategy document, will he agree it is time to sanction this proposal and for the Government to indicate it supports that strategy? The Government can indicate that by sanctioning this project and, thereby, indicate that it also supports the national spatial strategy.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I thought the Deputy would be delighted with the interest the Tánaiste was taking in the project.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I am not familiar with the Tuam Herald  nor am I responsible for what appeared in it. The people examining this project are in the HSE. The Deputy is obviously familiar with the position in Tuam. This is about utilising facilities which were purchased on behalf of the State and maximising the benefits for the particular area. The HSE is examining this project. In 2001, the health service acquired the old Bon Secours Hospital and surrounding site in Tuam. It is a matter of progressing work on that and utilising it.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	319	The Tánaiste indicated when she met the group that she would ask the HSE to examine this project and that she expected it to report within a few weeks. That meeting took place at the end of January. In a matter of a few weeks we hope to have a report on this project and we will communicate then with the Deputy.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I have called Question No. 6.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I propose to take QuestionsNos. 6, 20 and 90 together.As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the administration of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 rests with the Health Service Executive. There are currently three rates of subvention payable under the regulations, that is, €114.30, €152.40 and €190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum.Under Article 10.6 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993, the executive may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the executive in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention subject to the provisions of the Health Act 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the executive generally exceeds the current approved maximum rate of subvention.The nursing home subvention scheme is being reviewed by my Department and I do not intend to increase rates of subvention pending the outcome of the review.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Will the Minister of State confirm that no consideration has been given to existing patients under the Tánaiste's ten point plan outlined in respect of the accident and emergency crisis? Will he also agree that the average cost of nursing homes has doubled in the past four years? Will he agree that the current rate of subvention payments he outlined are derisory for the patients involved? Does he consider it acceptable that patients have to practically beg the health service to get an enhanced subvention? Will he agree that these patients are at the mercy of CEOs in the health service? How does he feel about the fact that 60%, or the majority, of nursing home patients pay between €400 and €500 per week to nursing homes?Will the Minister of State clarify his remark to the effect that when patients no longer have any more means the health service can give higher rates? I am dealing with two cases where patients sold their family homes a few years ago. They wrote to the health service advising that their funds are now exhausted. In these cases it is not the position that these patients have their family homes; they have sold them. They have been given little or no assistance by the health service involved. Their position is not in agreement with what the Minister of State said. Will he comment on those important questions?
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	329	We provided €5 million when the subvention scheme was introduced in 1993. Last year we spent over €114 million on it and this year it is expected that we will spend approximately €120 million on the scheme.When the scheme was introduced it was never intended that it would cover the full costs of nursing home care; it was intended to provide some assistance. I accept what the Deputy said about the amount of assistance being provided, that the top-up payments families must pay are increasing and that puts pressure on a number of families.We are reviewing the scheme. The Department of Social and Family Affairs is also involved in this. We had a meeting on this matter earlier this week and it is being treated as a priority. We have appointed a group of senior officials to oversee this work and bring proposals to Government in mid-2005.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	330	The Minister of State said nothing about the patients who have gone broke and have no funding. These supplementary payments have not increased since 2001, even though I pointed out all the other developments that have happened since that time. We have been waiting for a policy on the long-term care of the elderly for four years. Under the circumstances and with what is happening in acute hospitals and in the community, we must move faster to resolve these problems and not let them reach crisis point.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	331	If the Deputy knows of individual cases of particular hardship, he can provide us with the details and we will examine them. The funding of long-term care is a problem and we are treating it as a priority. We hope to introduce proposals on it later this year.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I also know of cases where people have been pauperised. They are dependent on the enhanced subvention and find that the cost of nursing home care is increasing to the point where they can no longer pay the bill. Will the Minister of State look at the number of discretionary payments being made over and above the limits? I suspect the numbers are very small. I am in contest with the East Coast Area Health Board about a case and it has been a less than edifying experience.People suffering from Alzheimer's disease require high maintenance care in the late stages of the condition and the cost of nursing home care can be extremely high, far greater than the enhanced subvention. Will provision be made for people who have those high costs?There was recognition in the legislation that people living in long-term community welfare homes are entitled to retain a small portion of their pension. There is no such protection for people in a private nursing homes and often they must give up all of their pension, leaving them with no money. These people might not have relatives who can provide them with the small amount of money they need for ongoing expenses or their partners may be on the old age pension and barely able to look after themselves. Will that be examined when the policy is being developed?
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	333	Currently, more than 7,000 people are in receipt of a subvention. The subvention scheme is under review and, under the Nursing Homes Subvention Regulations 1993, the executive may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention in a case where there is severe difficulty. It is not our intention to cause hardship and, where it exists, we would like to intervene and assist.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	334	The Minister of State talks about hardship but the reality is that with a 12-year waiting list to get into a public nursing home in greater Dublin, many children find they have no alternative but to put their parents into a private nursing home. Does the Minister of State accept that an elderly person on a pension of €160 a week with a supplement of €80 a week cannot meet the balance, even with an enhanced subvention? Will the Minister of State make this a priority? We have been talking about reviews for a long time, particularly in greater Dublin where prices are exorbitant. We must deal with this by the middle of the year.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	335	It is a Government priority. When the scheme was initially introduced in 1993, there was provision of €5 million.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	336	The Minister of State cannot compare that to the current costs.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	337	It gives some indication. This year we will spend €120 million. The scheme is not perfect and changes should be made. I regularly meet the difficulties raised by Deputies today. That is why we are reviewing the scheme — to introduce greater equity. The Mercer report examined the funding of long-term care and, following a meeting earlier this month, we appointed a number of senior officials to oversee this work. They will bring forward proposals to Government in the middle of this year. We realise the seriousness of the issue and we intend to act on it.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	338	Does the Minister of State accept that an old person should have to sell his or her home to secure accommodation in a nursing home?
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	339	His or her home could mean anything.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	340	The family home.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	341	It depends on the family home. If I saw someone living in a property worth €1 million, I would not have any difficulty in that person paying for his or her care. It would be different for someone living in a small cottage with no means. They are different situations and it is hard for me to answer a question put in such general terms.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I am aware of a case of an elderly lady who lived in a small terraced house, a former council home, valued at €150,000, which is not a lot of money in today's terms. Her family live in other parts of the country and outside the country and that home was where they came when they visited. The mother, who was in a nursing home, could not get a subvention and her children had to sell the home and dispose of their mother's effects while she was still alive. For them the trauma was like dealing with their mother's death before she had died. From their coming home until the time of her funeral, there was nowhere to wake her or gather to share their memories of her. Is the Minister of State open to a more caring and humane approach in such cases?
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Just as Opposition Deputies hear of these problems in their clinics, Government Deputies are told the same stories. We realise that such situations are extremely sensitive and must be dealt with in a sensitive manner. When assessing a person's means at present, if a property is valued at over €75,000, it is taken into consideration. That is a very small amount and very few properties would be excluded. We are aware the scheme needs to be changed. That is why it is being reviewed and we will show a caring approach in making the necessary changes to the scheme.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I propose to take QuestionsNos. 7 and 105 together.I am informed by the Health Service Executive employer representative division that it has been in discussion with the Irish Medical Organisation over the past number of years in an effort to reach agreement on new changeover dates for non-consultant hospital doctors. To date, the IMO has been unable to confirm agreement to alternative changeover dates.Securing agreement with the IMO on this critical issue will continue to be a priority for the HSEERD. In this regard, employer representatives will seek to bring finality to this issue as part of wider negotiations with the IMO on a revised contract for NCHDs. It has been agreed that these negotiations will recommence under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission on 16 March 2005.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	345	It is important we move on that because that time of year, especially 1 January, is an incredibly dangerous time. January sees the maximum number of patients on trolleys. It is also when doctors and nurses experience the greatest chance of being sick themselves. We should move the changeover date to 1 February, as was done in the UK. I hope the Minister succeeds in moving on that fairly quickly because it is very serious.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I agree with the Deputy. In any event 1 January is a bank holiday. It is not an appropriate day to start a new job, either from the employer's or the doctor's point of view. I hope we can reach agreement and that we will not have to act unilaterally on this issue. There is also the issue of July and the rotation situation in the UK. Both dates need to be changed. If we move to 1 February that would move the other to 1 August, which is the same date as in the UK. There may be issues around people applying for both, but the current date of 1 January is unsatisfactory and should be changed.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	347	The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for decisions in relation to the referral of patients to a private treatment facility, where appropriate. Factors which are relevant to such a decision include assessment of patient need, existing service availability, indemnity and quality assurance.The Health Service Executive, western area, has informed my Department that it is working with the Galway clinic to develop protocols or care pathways to deal with patients who require radiotherapy, mainly for emergency and short-term palliative purposes. My Department has been advised that approximately 50 public patients have been referred to the clinic to date.The western area of the executive is confident that the supra-regional radiation oncology centre at University College Hospital Galway will be fully commissioned and ready to treat patients in March 2005. Last year, approval issued for the appointment of 102 staff for this unit, together with additional ongoing revenue funding of €12 million to cater for this expansion. Approval issued for the appointment of an additional consultant medical oncologist and three consultant radiation oncologists, two of whom have significant sessional commitments to the north-western and mid-western areas. Key staffing is in place, with two consultant radiation oncologists taking up posts in February and March. The HSE western area has been requested to prepare a development control plan to facilitate the expansion from three to six linear accelerators in the medium term. The capital project team is working to develop a brief for this expansion.As recommended in the report on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland, the national radiation oncology co-ordinating group has been established. The group comprises clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions. The group's remit encompasses recommending measures to facilitate improved access to existing and planned services, including transport and accommodation. The group will also advise on quality assurance protocols and guidelines for the referral of public patients to private facilities.

The Minister stated that so far 50 people have been treated. How many people will be treated in this private clinic next year when the public clinic is up and running? I presume the Minister is aware that the average number of patients receiving radiation within one month of diagnosis in the west is at 3% and this increases to only 19% within two months of diagnosis. It is important to know whether the executive will cut short its contract with the private clinic and treat patients only in the public facility in Galway.I would also like the Minister to answer some questions on the radiation oncology report, otherwise known as the Hollywood report. Although it took four years for this report to be published, one of the central points in the report was that the Minister supported centralisation of radiotherapy services and did not believe that small units were safe. A small unit is now being used, although it is a private clinic.Another problem is that the oncologists wrote a separate report. Their submission was never acknowledged, which is surprising. What is the Minister's position now? Is the Hollywood report being set aside and is the view of the oncologists coming to the fore? I have highlighted the issue regarding Galway. This is an extremely contentious issue in the south east and has been for the past three or four years while we awaited publication of the radiation oncology report.

The Galway facility is in place. I visited it in January. It will treat patients in March. Approximately 102 staff have been trained. The lead-in time has been going on since last summer.We have a mixed health system in Ireland with approximately half the population in private health care insurance. We need to ensure that private facilities, provided they are up to standard — the State's job should be standard-setting — are used to treat patients where they are available. We must see people as patients, regardless of whether they are insured and whether they have access to finance. It adds to the trauma of cancer patients and their families if they have to travel long distances for radiation treatment.In a country of 4 million people we cannot have linear accelerators and bunkers everywhere. We need to think in terms of a national network where everything fits together, whether it is provided by the State or by the private sector.I have the report Deputy Twomey mentioned, I received it ten days ago. It makes recommendations for the future. I want to ensure provision in the regions, including the south east and the north west. Facilities are being provided in Limerick at the moment. I want to make sure that the trauma of the experience of cancer is minimised for as many patients as possible. I understand that international experience is that to provide safe treatment, two linear accelerators are needed at any one facility. In this area it is not just the machinery and the bunker that are important but expertise and radiation oncologists. Once all that is networked together for the country, all the patients will get the benefit of that expertise. Much of it can be done in satellite centres and that is the Government's plan. I will make an announcement regarding these matters shortly.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I have not yet finalised my view on the report. I support the view that two centres are needed in Dublin. The report suggests a need for 35 more linear accelerators over the next few years. We need to keep an open mind regarding how we make that happen. In particular, we need it all to work together. In too many areas of health care there are stand-alone facilities which are not being used to their full potential because people are not all working together. In cancer care in particular we need people working together. That is what happens in many parts of the United States of America and elsewhere. I hope we will be able to do that in Ireland. I had a good meeting with a number of people in this area recently and we need to avail of the best expertise in this area. On the issue of the private clinic in Galway, if there is capacity and there is not enough in the public system for patients, we should use that capacity rather than force people to travel to Dublin. That does not make sense from a cost and transport point of view or from the point of view of the patient and his or her family. I want to see the private facilities used.

I am a strong supporter of people making investment in the provision of their own health care while they can. We will get more resources in that context. It is a question of ensuring that a person who does not have the possibility of becoming privately insured is not disadvantaged and that the private facilities can be used to his or her benefit as well. We can do both and we can get much more private investment in health care in terms of bed capacity and diagnostics. There are many areas where the private sector can make a contribution to delivering better services for the population.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	360	On the issue of the January 2005 increases in hospital charges in question, it should be noted that such increases follow on from the announcement in November 2004 of the 2005 health Estimates. The overall health Estimate for 2005, therefore, takes into account the full-year income implications arising from the implementation of the new charges with effect from 1 January 2005. The income goes towards supporting services in public hospitals and is, therefore, part of their budgets.In regard to the overnight levy, the amount charged was increased by €10 to €55 per night, subject to a maximum of €550 in any 12 consecutive months. The charge for a visit to an accident and emergency department was also increased by €10 to €55. This increase in the accident and emergency charge will facilitate more appropriate attendances at accident and emergency units by reducing an incentive for people to attend accident and emergency units when they might appropriately receive services from general practitioners.The charges do not apply to a number of categories of person, including those with full eligibility, women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks and children suffering from prescribed long-term diseases. Additionally, the accident and emergency charge does not apply in circumstances where the person has been referred by a medical practitioner or where the attendance results in a hospital admission. It should also be noted that the Health Service Executive has the discretion to waive the charges if it considers that the charges would cause undue hardship.On the doctor visit card, my Department is considering the nature of the legislative changes required to enable effect to be given to the decision to introduce the new cards. Legislation will be introduced as quickly as possible. I intend to take this legislation to the Government meeting, as I said on the Order of Business this morning, on Tuesday week.In addition to the foregoing increases, the daily cost of private and semi-private accommodation in public hospitals was also increased by 25%. In the interests of equity, it is Government policy to eliminate gradually the effective subsidy for private stays in public hospital beds and relieve taxpayers of the burden of carrying these costs. Even with this increase, the cost of providing services to private patients in major hospitals remains significantly greater than the income from the private insurance companies in many cases. The increase being implemented is aimed at closing that gap. The combination of the hospital charge increases effective from 1 January 2005 will yield approximately €50 million a year.As regards the drugs payment scheme, it is the case that prior to its introduction in 1999, the drug cost subsidisation scheme was available to people certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Those eligible for this scheme did not have to pay more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication. Under the drug refund scheme, families and individuals who did not qualify for the drug cost subsidisation or medical card schemes paid the full cost of their prescription medicines and, at the end of each quarter, could claim reimbursement from their health board for expenditure over £90 in that calendar quarter.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.From 1999, the drugs payment scheme replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the drug refund scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family paid more than £42 or €53.33 per month for approved prescribed drugs and medicines for use in that month.The current threshold for the drugs payment scheme is €85 per calendar month. Based on figures supplied by the primary care reimbursement service, formerly the GMS payments board, a €7 increase in the threshold to €85 per month would lead to savings of €8.4 million. Given the need to prioritise health spending to maximise the benefit over a wide range of pressing health expenditure options together with the advantages of the drugs payment scheme over the schemes it replaced, an increase of €7 per calendar month in the threshold is not considered to be excessive.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the important matter of the review into the death of Róisín Ruddle, Kilmacow, Kilfinny, Adare. I am a fellow parishioner of the Ruddle family and have known Róisín's mother and father, grandfather and great-grandfather, who have been highly respected members of our community. I thank the Ruddle family for their co-operation with the review into the sad case of the death of their daughter, Róisín, and sympathise with Gerard and Helen. I commend the regional health authority, its staff and the staff of Our Lady's Hospital.On 27 March 2003 Róisín Ruddle was placed on the elective cardiac surgery list of Our Lady's Hospital for insertion of a Glenn shunt. Her surgery was scheduled for 30 June 2003. Róisín was admitted to Our Lady's Hospital on 25 June 2003 for her pre-operative investigations and discharged home on 26 June. She was admitted on Sunday, 29 June in preparation for her planned surgery the following day. On Monday, 30 June, Róisín's operation was deferred because there was no staffed intensive care bed available for her following her surgery. Róisín and her parents left the hospital at approximately 12 noon on 30 June and returned home.Róisín died at home in the early hours of Tuesday, 1 July. She was due to undergo the Glenn shunt procedure on 30 June. This procedure was a palliative operation which was part of a staged strategy in the management of Róisín's cardiac condition. She underwent the normal pre-operative investigations as I have stated. On 30 June her surgery was deferred because no staffed intensive care bed was available.The autopsy indicated that Róisín's death was due to acute cardio-respiratory failure associated with the presumed development of a cardiac arrhythmis. This view was supported by the medical opinion presented in the course of the review. If the Glenn shunt procedure had gone ahead as planned on 30 June, it would most likely have improved Róisín's oxygen saturation and this may have reduced the likelihood of her condition. Nevertheless, it is the view of the panel that if Róisín's operation had gone ahead as planned on 30 June, the likelihood of her survival would have been greater.Given the centrality of the ICU to the operation of Our Lady's Hospital as a whole, the shortage of nurses to staff the unit does not appear, according to the review, to have been seen by hospital management at the time as a prior issue warranting significant management attention. From the evidence presented, it is clear that the problems relating to the recruitment and retention of specialist nursing staff were considered matters to be addressed solely by the nursing director and her staff. Although aware of the problems, there is no evidence that hospital management or the committee of management gave any active support, other than the approval of financial resources, to helping the director of nursing with the problem of devising initiatives that were clearly needed to address the recruitment issue that is central to the report and to this highly critical area of the hospital's activities.It is the opinion of the panel that insufficient focus was placed by Our Lady's Hospital management and the committee of management on the resolution of this issue. As a consequence, there was a lack of urgency in applying and distributing available resources for resolving the problem. The panel pointed out that despite significant efforts made by the staff, the difficulty arises regarding the area of nursing. The fundamental reason for the deferral of Róisín's surgery is clearly stated by the panel. It was due to the inability of Our Lady's Hospital to recruit or retain sufficient experienced ICU nursing staff to support the available ICU beds. Among the factors contributing to the shortage of paediatric ICU nurses was a change in the system of nurse education in the mid-1990s. It was a fundamental managerial planning issue that when such changes are considered by the Department and the Minister, a planned approach should be taken to ensure that these problems do not arise.I will raise the issue of the development and investment in Our Lady's Hospital on a future occasion. I am amazed that despite the difficulties with recruitment, the hospital does not have a recruitment website. The panel recommends such a website.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The report of the panel reviewing the events surrounding the death of Róisín Ruddle was published on the Department's website earlier today. The report prepared by the former Eastern Regional Health Board in July 2003 has also been published. Copies of the report were made available to Róisín's family and to Our Lady's Hospital in recent days.I wish first of all to express my sympathy to Róisín's parents and to her extended family. They have been through extremely difficult times in the past, and the publication of this report will no doubt recall for them all the trauma of those times. Our thoughts are with them today. While it is appropriate for the House to discuss the matter, I know that our words will probably ring hollow with Róisín's family at this time.On behalf of the Tánaiste, I thank the review panel for completing a very thorough examination of the issues that have arisen in this case. The principal finding in the review panel's report was that if Róisín's operation had gone ahead as planned on 30 June 2003, the likelihood of her survival would have been greater and that the fundamental reason behind the deferral of Róisín's surgery was the inability of Our Lady's Hospital to recruit or retain sufficient experienced nursing staff to support the available ICU beds. The Tánaiste recently met the hospital's chief executive and the director of nursing and they assured her that key recommendations in the report have been acted upon.For example, in September 2004 the hospital assigned full-time responsibility for the recruitment and retention of specialised paediatric nurses to its most senior assistant director of nursing. A clinical bed manager was appointed in August 2004 to ensure the efficient and effective use of beds and cots in accordance with international best practice. The hospital has already established links in relation to cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery with a number of institutions outside of the country, including Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.The chief executive also assured the Tánaiste that the other recommendations in the report will receive the hospital's urgent attention. The Tánaiste expects the hospital's committee of management, the hospital management and the hospital staff to ensure that the issues relating to the hospital's internal organisation are fully addressed as a matter of urgency.The reason for the deferral of Róisín's surgery on 30 June 2003 was that there was no staffed intensive care bed available in the intensive care unit to accommodate her post-operatively.The intensive care unit at Our Lady's Hospital has a physical capacity of 21 fully-equipped beds, divided into two units, but has never been in a position to open all the 21 beds due to the lack of specialised nursing staff. In June 2003, the unit as a whole was staffed for between 14 and 16 beds, depending on the casemix between intensive care and high dependency patients. Patients requiring intensive care are nursed on the basis of one nurse per patient; patients requiring high dependency care are nursed on the basis of one nurse per two patients.The review panel's report notes that, despite significant efforts made by Our Lady's Hospital in more recent times, the hospital is still not in a position to staff its full complement of ICU beds. The review panel's report points out that there is an international shortage of paediatric ICU nurses. In recent times, Our Lady's Hospital has, with the support of the Health Service Executive and my Department, embarked on a comprehensive strategy to recruit and retain nurses for its ICU, including overseas recruitment campaigns in Bahrain, the Philippines and Poland as well as the United Kingdom. The hospital also targets post-registration paediatric nursing students to encourage them to work in ICU.While the hospital has had some success in recruiting nurses into its ICU, this recruitment has been offset by many of the nurses leaving the unit for various reasons. Many of the nurses working in the ICU are from overseas and some choose to return home or to work in other countries. Others leave on promotion, while others find that the stress of working in such intensive conditions takes its toll.The hospital has taken many initiatives in an attempt to retain staff, including the introduction of family-friendly work policies and a self-rostering system for its ICU nursing staff which allows the nurse to choose his or her own working hours. The hospital also offers extensive educational opportunities for nurses and provides free accommodation to all non-national nurses for the first eight weeks of their adaptation period.Among the factors contributing to the shortage of paediatric ICU nurses in this country was a change in the system of nurse education in the mid-1990s. Since 1996, the only route to becoming a children's nurse is to pursue a post-registration higher diploma programme over 18 months. It currently takes four years training to obtain registration as a general nurse, which means it takes a minimum of 5.5 years to qualify as a children's nurse. If the nurse then wishes to qualify as a specialist paediatric ICU nurse, he or she must first obtain a minimum of six months work experience in paediatric ICU and then complete a further higher diploma in paediatric critical care over one year full time or two years part time. It currently, therefore, takes a minimum of seven years to become a fully-trained paediatric ICU nurse. In my opinion, this is too long.One of the review panel report's recommendations is that the overall training period required to become a fully-qualified children's ICU nurse be re-examined. The expert group on midwifery and children's nursing education has recently reported to the Tánaiste. One of its recommendations, the introduction of a direct entry undergraduate programme for combined children's-general nursing, lasting 4.5 years, must be implemented. We also need to reduce the length of the existing post-registration programme for qualification as a children's nurse. These measures will reduce the time taken to qualify as a children's nurse and should increase the numbers coming through the system.The Tánaiste will shortly announce how the report of the expert group on midwifery and children's nursing education can best be implemented. She welcomes the fact that the hospital has established links with similar institutions outside of the country and would encourage them to explore this option for courses in specialist and expert practice.I assure the parents and extended family of Róisín Ruddle that every possible measure will be taken to ensure that all the intensive care beds in Our Lady's Hospital are staffed and available to those children who require access to them.

In an adjournment debate on 29 January 2003 I called upon the Minister for Health and Children to act as a matter of urgency to address the severe staffing shortage at St. Mary's residential care facility at Drumcar, County Louth, and to ensure that the residents at the centre had all the personnel and other resources they needed to live with dignity and safety.Thousands of people, including the families of more than 250 people with physical and intellectual disabilities then resident at Drumcar, were sick with worry about the welfare and safety of their loved ones. A consultant's report had just been published which highlighted the unacceptable conditions for many residents in Drumcar as a direct result of understaffing. Understaffing led to inadequate supervision, inappropriate mixing of residents with very different abilities and disabilities, including very aggressive individuals with passive and introverted individuals, the overuse of restraints in some cases, the leaving of some residents locked up and unattended at night and increased risk of mortality from fire.The report identified the need for 94 additional staff to cater for all the needs of the residents. Following this report there was a concerted campaign for increased funding for more staff. I played a part in that lobby and I welcomed the outcome when agreement was reached with the Department of Health and Children for the appointment of 30 extra staff at St. Mary's. The extra staff commenced work in April 2003 and were specifically hired to ensure there were sufficient numbers on night duty. This was to address fire and other safety risks for residents at night. A key part of the agreement with the Department of Health and Children and the North Eastern Health Board was that the other issues would be addressed, including the provision of the remaining 64 staff required.I will cite a note by the management of St. Mary's, which is under the auspices of the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God:We remained hopeful that the funding for the remaining 64 staff would be approved over the following two years.During the past two years, because of the serious risk to the safety of the clients and staff on day duty, we were left with no alternative but to take on extra staff without funding which resulted in overspends in the nursing pay area. This excess in expenditure was funded through stringent cutbacks in other areas, and vacancies in areas such as speech therapy, social work, medical registrar and administration. The planned programme of building maintenance and painting had to be suspended and this has impacted negatively on the quality of the environment for the clients, and will ultimately cost a lot more to restore in the future.In 2004, both ourselves and the NEHB experienced substantial shortfalls in the funding to meet the extra cost of the various pay awards, and like other health agencies we had substantial value for money and other cutbacks imposed on our allocation. We have now reached the stage where we have exhausted all options internally to meet the shortfall.The very grave situation facing the North East Services was discussed with the North Eastern Health Board on the 10 November 2004 and the Board requested us to conduct a review of the situation, and advise them of the options which we would have to consider to deal with the situation. We did this over the following weeks and informed the Board in December of the various options. The Board passed our concerns on to the Department of Health and Children and a meeting was arranged with the Health Service Executive on 1 February 2005.Following that meeting on 1 February between the HSE Northeast and St. John of God Northeast Services it was agreed to use the existing joint partnership forum to develop a strategy on how best to continue the implementation of the Sale and Oreschnick Report to address the outstanding priority concerns regarding health and safety issues and critical staffing levels at St. Mary's Residential Services.It is expected to complete this process within the next three weeks. In the meantime St. John of God Northeast Services has undertaken to defer the decision around the suspension of respite service provision in St. Mary's until February 28 2005.Aware that my time has marched on, I will conclude by appealing to the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that the outcome of this process is the approval of the full staff complement, namely, the 64 staff identified more than two years ago, funding for same and the restoration of all services lost through the unacceptable delay in fulfilling commitments already given.As the sibling of someone with Down's syndrome who has spent many years in Drumcar, I believe that it is a wonderful facility only because of the great dedication of the hospitaller order and staff at the site. It requires and deserves a wholehearted and fulsome response from the Department. The loss of respite would be a devastating blow to countless families and I do so appeal.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	365	On behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position with regard to St. Mary's residential care facility, Drumcar, County Louth. I appreciate the Deputy's personal interest in the matter.The Department has, since 1997, allocated a significant level of funding across the disability sector which has resulted in significant and unprecedented developments in the quality and quantity of the health related services being provided to people with disabilities. With regard to the matter raised by the Deputy, in June 2002 St. Mary's, Drumcar, was served with formal notice of industrial action by the Irish Nurses Organisation because of the staffing position in its residential services.As requested by the order, the services of the Labour Relations Commission were availed of. One of the proposals to emerge from the conciliation conference was to conduct an independent review of the staffing of the residential services at St. Mary's. It was agreed that this review would be conducted by Diana Sale and Bob Oreschnick, 1066 Consultancy and Healthcare Consultancy Limited. They were commissioned by the order to undertake the work. The report was finalised on 13 November 2002.Statutory responsibility for the provision of intellectual disability services, including the funding of the Drumcar services, lay with the then North Eastern Health Board. Following publication of the report, the board indicated that there was insufficient funding available to it to implement the recommendations contained in the report. Following discussions between the Department, the North Eastern Health Board and the St. John of God order in February 2003, agreement was reached on the provision of funding to enable the order to proceed with the immediate recruitment of 30 additional staff. The initial investment, amounting to approximately €l million, was intended to address the priority issues identified in the Sale and Oreschnick report around quality of care and health and safety.Agreement was reached on a process by which the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report would be progressed as a matter of priority as resources permitted. As it has not been possible to provide further additional funding in 2004, both the order and the North Eastern Health Board have expressed anxiety regarding funding for the further implementation of the report, which recommended a total of 94 additional staff.As the Deputy is aware, the Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive which was established on 1 January 2005. Under this Act, the executive is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to have delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Following a meeting held on 1 February 2005 between the Health Service Executive north east and St. John of God north east services, it was agreed to use the existing joint partnership forum to develop a strategy on how best to continue the implementation of the Sale and Oreschnick report to address the outstanding priority concerns regarding health and safety issues and critical staffing levels at St. Mary's residential services. It is expected to complete this process by the end of the month.In the meantime, St. John of God north east services has undertaken to defer the decision around the suspension of respite service provision in St. Mary's until 28 February 2005. The Health Service Executive north east disability services and St. John of God north east services will arrange to keep parent representatives abreast of developments in the process. Both parties are hopeful of a positive outcome.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	366	It is with a deep sense of frustration that I raise this issue. Children in the Donabate-Portrane area urgently need a post-primary school on the peninsula. The Department of Education and Science is well aware of the position and a decision to proceed with a school in the area is overdue. It is now a matter of urgency as we are approaching a crisis.Over the years the Department has taken the view that the second level requirements of students from Donabate and other towns and villages such as Lusk and Rolestown and Ballyboughal can and should be met in established schools such as Loreto College, Balbriggan, St. Joseph's, Rush, Malahide community school and in Swords, Fingal community college, St. Finian's College, Christian Brothers and, to a lesser extent, Loreto College. In recent years, this list has extended to include St. Mary's, Baldoyle, and Portmarnock community school.In September 2003, I had reason to raise in the House the circumstances of 160 second level students who travelled by rail from Donabate to schools in Portmarnock, Malahide and Baldoyle. Students carrying schoolbags were forced to jostle with other commuters to try to get through the doors of trains which were already packed by the time they reached Donabate. Some children were left on the platform when the train departed and on at least one occasion a student was thrown off the train on to the platform by a frustrated adult commuter endeavouring to get to work. While this sad situation has improved with the provision of additional train carriages, a repetition of such events is inevitable given the increased number of people using the rail service and the fact that no further capacity will be available on the trains for the next four years.The population of Donabate, like most other towns in Fingal, the fastest growing area in Ireland, has increased substantially in recent years — Donabate's population is expected to increase from 5,000 to 25,000 over the next ten years. A recent door to door survey carried out by Donabate-Portrane second level school committee indicated that on the basis of the existing primary school population, 725 second level places will be required by 2007.The boom in housing development in Fingal, without the necessary infrastructures, such as schools, is causing distress and havoc for parents. The schools which children attended over the years, such as Balbriggan, Malahide and other schools, are full of students from their immediate catchment areas. "Students from Donabate need not apply" is the message parents get when they phone the schools. That is a reluctant policy of the schools boards of management. It is patently obvious, therefore, that a crisis is quickly developing.The Minister and the Department are fortunate in that a suitable site can be acquired from the local authority, Fingal County Council, for this school. In fairness to the council, the need for a second level school in Donabate has been identified and provided for in the development plans for the area. Following repeated representations on this issue, I received the standard reply that a new school planning model will be piloted in five areas, including north Dublin, encompassing Donabate. I have no doubt I will get the same response this evening. I am concerned that this planning model — to date we have received no indication when its interim report will be available — will be used as an excuse not to take, or to delay, the decision urgently required for Donabate to commence the planning process for a second level school.It is important we do not delay this model process because, on the basis of previous reports, I believe a further consultation process could be set in train and it could go on for another year. Let us make a decision. It is patently obvious that there is a need for a school and let us give it the go-ahead. It could take another five years to provide it but let us get it started.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I thank Deputy Ryan for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the overall strategy of the Department of Education and Science to address the future requirements in both the primary and post-primary sectors in the Donabate area.At the outset, it is important to note that the school planning section of the Department works closely with the four local authorities in the Dublin region in monitoring demographic changes and assessing the likely impact of planned new housing developments. A dedicated forum, the Dublin school planning committee, chaired by the school planning section of the Department of Education and Science interacts with the Dublin local authorities in this regard. This forum comprises representatives of the patron bodies of primary schools.The Dublin school planning committee acts as an initial point of contact where local authorities can signal to the Department and the patron bodies anticipated demand for school provision. Detailed discussions regarding reservation of sites and scale and timeframe for developments also take place at this forum. The issue of the provision of a post primary school for Donabate has been discussed at this forum.A decision on the need for a new school in any given area will involve further separate detailed consultations with a local authority regarding the likely timescale for the actual delivery of the housing developments together with an ongoing assessment of the capacity of existing schools to meet anticipated demand. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this process is well under way with the local authority in regard to the Donabate area.In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, a new school planning model involving published area development plans is being piloted in five areas over the current school year. Donabate is included in the pilot scheme as part of an overall plan for the north Dublin, east Meath and south Louth area. This particular area was chosen in recognition of its rapidly developing nature and the pressure which is being brought to bear not only for post primary school places, but for primary places as well. The need for a new post-primary school is also being considered in the context of this plan.The purpose of this new approach to school planning is to ensure that, in future, the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.Arising from this process, an individual plan will set out the blueprint for the future of educational provision in an area which will be the touchstone against which all decisions in relation to capital investment will be made for the next decade. The draft plan for north Dublin, east Meath and south Louth area is nearing completion in the school planning section of the Department and the Department of Education and Science hopes to be in a position to publish it shortly.I assure Deputy Ryan that the Department is keenly aware of the developing nature of the Donabate area and is anxious to ensure that its educational infrastructural needs are met in a timely manner. The Minister for Education and Science is confident that the planning process in train will provide a strategic response to those needs.

I intend to bring proposals to Government on the development of a modern framework for pharmacy in the near future.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	369	The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the provision of general practitioners to provide for the appropriate delivery of the needs of medical card holders within their area.The procedure which governs the filling of vacancies which may arise due to the death, resignation or retirement of an existing general medical services contract holding general practitioner forms part of the contract which was agreed in industrial relations negotiations between the Department of Health and Children and the Irish Medical Organisation. Advertisements are placed in the national and medical press when a vacancy occurs and applications are invited from interested suitably qualified general practitioners. Interviews are held and the post is offered to the successful candidate.The most recent published information on the distribution of GPs and their panel size was contained in the 2003 annual report for the GMS payments board. This indicates the following panel composition for the 595 general practitioners who held GMS contracts for a full year with the area boards of the former Eastern Regional Authority to provide services for medical card patients.No. of DoctorsPatient Panel size163up to 250133251 to 500207501 to 1000741001 to 1500171501 to 200012001 to 2500The capitation rates paid to general practitioners under the general medical services scheme are based on the age, gender and location profiles of their patient panels. They also reflect the agreed outcome of industrial relations negotiations on the subject with their representative organisation, the Irish Medical Organisation. A GMS GP may also hold other contracts with the local Health Service Executive to provide services under the Health Amendment Act, such as the high tech medicines, methadone treatment, primary childhood immunisation, EU regulation and other immunisations for certain GMS eligible persons schemes. They also may qualify for allowances towards the employment of practice support staff such as practice nurses, secretaries and managers.My Department has held discussions with the Irish College of General Practitioners on the subject of future general practice manpower needs. It was agreed to increase the number of training places which will lead to an increase of 22 in the intake of students for each of the next three years. Funding has been provided in the Health Service Executive's allocation for 2005 for the commencement of this process.

Under section 31(1) of the Act, the executive is obliged to prepare, adopt and then submit to me for approval a service plan for the financial year or other period as may be determined by me. Subsection (8) provides that not later than 21 days after receiving the service plan, I shall either approve it or issue a direction under subsection (9) that it be amended. If I approve it, under subsection (13) I am obliged to ensure that a copy of the approved plan is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 days after it has been approved by me.The national service plan will be informed by the guiding principles underpinning the health strategy, namely, equity, people centredness, quality and accountability. The plan will cover all the major programmes of care.

I am informed that ECT is administered in accordance within the guidelines on protocol for the administration of ECT as set out by the Irish College of Psychiatrists, formerly Royal College of Psychiatrists of Ireland. The protocol is comprehensive and provides guidance on the prescription of ECT by the consultant psychiatrist, administration of anaesthetic, preparation of the patient, patient's consent, the administration of ECT and pre- and post-ECT nursing care plan.The report of the Health Research Board, Activities of Irish Psychiatric Services 2003, states that the use of electroconvulsive therapy, ECT, has been declining in recent years due to the availability of other treatments for mental illness, particularly depression. However, the rate of reduction has varied between former health board areas and between services in each area. This fact has been noted by the former inspector of mental hospitals in his report for the year ending December 2003. The inspector also indicated that he had monitored the use of this treatment and of the facilities for its provision during his inspector of mental health facilities. Any deficiencies noted by the inspector in facilities or practice had been highlighted in individual reports.The Mental Health Act 2001 contains provisions relating to the administration of electroconvulsive therapy which, when fully implemented, will provide further safeguards to involuntary patients being administered this treatment. The Act provides that the Mental Health Commission will make rules providing for the use of such treatment and ECT will only be applied in accordance with these rules. In advance of these rules being provided, Dr. John Owens, chairperson of the Mental Health Commission, recently expressed his concern at the disparity in the use of ECT and has indicated that this matter will be investigated by the commission.

The chairman, who also chairs the recruitment committee, has informed me that the recruitment process started again in December. The position was advertised in the national media during December.An extensive search campaign has also been undertaken by the recruitment agency, both nationally and internationally. The recruitment campaign has been underway for two months and the chairman expects that it will be a number of weeks before a short list of suitably qualified candidates is compiled.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	373	The provisions of the European working time directive as it relates to the working hours of doctors in training came into force on 1 August 2004. The relevant provisions were transposed into Irish law by way of the European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004.Employers and the Irish Medical Organisation have been engaged in discussions for some time under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, to advance proposals to effect a reduction in the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors to conform with the provisions of the European working time directive, EWTD. While some progress has been made, much remains to be resolved. The LRC has requested that both parties refrain from engaging in any form of unilateral action for the duration of the negotiation process.As a result, as of 1 August 2004, health employers have not acted unilaterally to achieve full compliance with the EWTD. In many sites around the country, the introduction of new rosters would facilitate significant progress towards EWTD compliance while maintaining safe patient care and existing levels of service provision. However, health employers, in response to the request of the LRC, are at present awaiting agreement between management and the IMO at national level before proceeding.The ability of the Health Service Executive to effectively implement the European working time directive for the benefit of all NCHDs is dependent on the full co-operation of the Irish Medical Organisation at both national and local level. This process was delayed for some time in the absence of agreement by the IMO to the establishment of local implementation groups in each hospital and a national implementation group to co-ordinate and direct the work of the local groups. However, agreement was finally reached with the IMO in late 2004 to the establishment of nine pilot sites. The work by the local groups at these sites is progressing with a view to developing plans for the full implementation of the directive.Local implementation groups at nine pilot sites are examining local implementation issues and developing plans for the full implementation of the directive. Included in these pilot local implementation groups are representatives of consultants, local representatives of training bodies, NCHDs, nurses, management and other grades. The work of the groups is well underway and it is intended that they will document how measures to reduce or reorganise NCHD hours can best be implemented. Action can then be taken on foot of this information when the industrial relations issues have been resolved.The next stage in their work will be a comprehensive analysis of hospital activity. The data gathered from this exercise will provide information to assist the local groups in examining the activity levels of NCHDs and determining how best to match resources against activity levels in the context of EWTD requirements. Further negotiations on issues relating to industrial relations matters will take place under the auspices of the LRC, aided and informed by the information compiled by these pilot local hospital groups.In addition, both sides have accepted a proposal made by the LRC on 7 February 2005 for the establishment of a national implementation group, which will have membership from the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Medical Organisation, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board, the Medical Council, the postgraduate medical training colleges and representatives of nurses and other health care professions. This group will co-ordinate the work of the existing nine pilot hospital local implementation groups, issue agreed guidance on issues related to the implementation of the EWTD and assist in the development of local implementation plans.Finally, management and the IMO have also agreed to recommence substantive negotiations on the NCHD contract. The next meeting in this regard has been arranged by the LRC for 16 March 2005. In this context, I am hopeful that early progress can be made in resolving outstanding issues so full implementation of the directive's requirements can proceed without further delay.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 16, 46 and 62 together.Ireland's first influenza pandemic preparedness plan was finalised in 2002. "A Model Plan for Influenza Pandemic Preparedness" was prepared by a committee under the chairmanship of Professor William Hall, director of the national virus reference laboratory, NVRL, and was presented to the Department of Health and Children in September 2002.An expert group was established by my predecessor in late 2003 to update the 2002 plan in light of experience with SARS. It is chaired by Professor Hall. The outline plan sets out various recommendations and options. Following detailed consideration of these options, the expert group will make specific recommendations about the implementation of the various aspects of the plan.The expert group met in November 2003 and January 2004; a meeting scheduled for March 2004 was cancelled because of the non-participation of consultants in departmental committee meetings. No further meetings were possible in 2004. I now understand that an exception is being made in the case of the influenza pandemic expert group. Arrangements are being made for an early meeting. There have been preliminary meetings within the last two weeks between the chairman and officials of my Department to prepare for this meeting.This 2002 WHO plan is being updated to incorporate new scientific data and experience obtained during recent outbreaks. A WHO consultation meeting held in December 2004 recommended several revisions to the WHO preparedness plan. The updating of our pandemic plan will take account of these recommendations once agreed and published by the World Health Organisation.In addition to the expert committee work, a contingency planning steering group was established by my Department in January 2004 to oversee the development of a generic public health contingency plan for the health system which would be activated in the event of a large scale emergency resulting from an infectious diseases outbreak or incident, such as SARS, influenza pandemic and so forth, to mitigate the impact of such an emergency. The implementation process is now under the direction of the Health Service Executive.Vaccination is the principal measure for preventing influenza and reducing the impact of epidemics. It will be the primary public health intervention in the event of an influenza pandemic. However, the production of a vaccine tailored to a pandemic influenza strain could take six to nine months. Developments are underway at international level seeking to expedite this process. At European level, EU member states and the European Commission agreed in 2004 to engage with the pharmaceutical industry regarding vaccines and antivirals. A report on this issue is scheduled for consideration by the health security committee next week.Pending the availability of virus specific vaccines, antiviral drugs will be the only influenza specific medical intervention available for use in a pandemic. It will be necessary to use antivirals to treat individuals who are ill, particularly those who may be more vulnerable to the virus, and to protect essential workers and vulnerable groups.Priorities for treatment and prophylaxis, prevention, are discussed in the 2002 influenza pandemic plan. The influenza pandemic expert group established in 2003 is reviewing this plan, including the recommendations for use of antivirals. As already stated, the work of the expert group was delayed through 2004 by the non-participation of consultants in departmental committee meetings. However, my Department has continued work on refining the estimated requirements for antivirals. It is intended to reconvene the expert group in the near future to review these estimates and complete its important work.

Its remit is to provide specific evidence based measures to Government to prevent and reduce alcohol related harm. The task force published an interim report in May 2002 and has recently published its second report. Together, the two reports provide approximately 100 evidenced based recommendations which aim to tackle alcohol related harm in this country and are framed on the ten strategy areas for alcohol action outlined in the World Health Organisation European charter on alcohol. I welcome the publication of this report and I intend to bring it to Government shortly.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	376	It is regrettable that the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation should have decided to take industrial action in pursuit of a resolution of the dispute surrounding medical indemnity cover for consultants. The only people who suffer as a consequence of this, or any, industrial action in the health service are patients. It is particularly unfortunate that consultants should choose to embark on this course of action when, in fact, they and the Government should be uniting to pursue the common goal of ensuring that the Medical Defence Union, MDU, lives up to its obligations to its Irish members.Irish hospital consultants paid significant amounts in subscriptions over the years to the MDU. Between 80% and 90% of these costs were ultimately borne by the Irish taxpayer. Taxpayers and consultants have a common interest in ensuring that the MDU does not escape from its responsibility for meeting the cost of claims from these years. I therefore appeal once again to both organisations to withdraw these threats and to work with the Government in pursuit of our joint interest.If some form of industrial action does take place, I will ask the IHCA and IMO to ensure that the impact on patient care is kept to the absolute minimum. I will also request the Health Service Executive to put in place contingency measures to ensure that disruption to patients is kept to a minimum. It is clear, however, that even if kept to a minimum, the effect of this action on patients would be to cause delays in their treatment and to prolong their suffering.I am still engaged in intensive efforts to avoid this eventuality through discussions with the IHCA and IMO. These include discussions on assistance to consultants who may be left without indemnity cover by the MDU. I am also exploring whatever avenues may be open to the State in its own right, or in association with the consultants affected by a withdrawal of cover by the MDU, to pursue the MDU by legal means. Arrangements are being put in place for representatives of the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Office of the Attorney General to meet with legal representatives of the IHCA and IMO to discuss these issues. It would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on these discussions at this stage.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 21, 44 and 106 together.The primary health care strategy, "Primary Care: A New Direction", which was published in 2001, sets out the Government's broad vision for the development of multidisciplinary team based primary health care. The principal objective of the strategy is to strengthen primary care so it can play a more central role as the first and ongoing point of contact for people with the health care system.In 2005, an additional €5 million in revenue funding has been provided to support the implementation of the strategy, bringing total ongoing additional revenue funding to €12 million per annum. This funding is being provided through a range of initiatives, including an initial ten primary care teams, to progress the implementation of the strategy. To date, capital funding of €2.725 million and a further €1.8 million in respect of information and communications technology supports have also been provided. This funding is, of course, in addition to the substantial funding already in the system for the delivery of a wide range of primary and community care services.Since 2002, ten multidisciplinary primary care teams have been developed and are delivering an enhanced and expanded range of primary care services to their target populations. The experience of developing these initial teams is already providing valuable learning which will help to inform the wider implementation of the strategy. A significant component of the development of further primary care teams must involve the reorganisation of the staff and resources already within the system. During 2004 detailed work was undertaken by the health boards to map the numbers and locations of future primary care teams and networks.Since the primary care strategy was published, the Government has also provided significant further support for the development of GP co-ops to provide the benefits of reliable out of hours services to the public and to relieve pressure on hospital accident and emergency departments. Between 2000 and 2005, approximately €105 million has been provided to the statutory agencies for the development of out of hours GP services.In 2005, an additional €60 million has been provided to improve access to primary care by providing for some 30,000 additional persons to become eligible for a medical card and free access to GP visits for those on low income who do not qualify for a medical card at present. The medical card income guidelines have been increased with effect from 1 January 2005 by approximately 7.5% generally and, in specific regard to children, the income allowance for each of the first two children has been increased by approximately 20% and for the third and subsequent children by approximately 30%.Free access to general practitioner visits will be provided to individuals and families based on income guidelines 25% over the new medical card income guidelines. It is estimated that approximately 200,000 persons will become eligible for free GP services with the "doctor visit" card. My Department is at present considering the nature of the legislative changes required to enable effect to be given to the decision to introduce these medical cards. Legislation in this regard will be introduced as soon as possible.These two initiatives will assist in overcoming barriers to accessing GP services in the case of those on low incomes and in the region of 230,000 additional people, including children, will be able to access their general practitioner free of charge.

While I do not propose to comment on the specific circumstances of the case, I wish to convey my deepest sympathy to the family of the child concerned.The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for children taken into care. Accordingly, my Department has requested the chief officer of the Health Service Executive, eastern regional area, to make arrangements to meet with the family as soon as possible to discuss their concerns.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	380	On 3 December last, I received a copy of an internal audit report of the Irish Blood Transfusion Services Board, IBTS, on discard blood products. The audit involved a search of available records to determine if blood or blood products were issued or sold to commercial companies and what volumes were involved from the 1980s to date. This audit was carried out at the request of the chief executive in November on the records of the Dublin and Cork blood centres.The report noted that in March 1997, the national medical director of the IBTS issued a memo outlining procedures for the issue of products for research purposes to academic and health care institutions. From that date, the practice of providing product to commercial companies was discontinued at Pelican House in Dublin. At the Munster regional transfusion centre, MRTC,the definition of health care institutions was taken to include a number of commercial ventures.The national medical director issued a subsequent memo in March 2002 to the MRTC clarifying the policy on the issue of products to commercial companies, stating that "provision of materials to these commercial companies should be suspended with immediate effect". There was no further issue of products to commercial companies after that date.I have been assured by the IBTS that this practice has been discontinued and that no products have been issued or sold to commercial companies since 2002.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	381	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 24 and 28 together.The strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance, SARI, was launched in June 2001. Since then, approximately €20.5 million in funding has been made available by my Department for this purpose. Of this, approximately €4.5 million has been made available in the current year. This SARI funding is in addition to normal hospital funding arrangements for to infection control.The strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland recommended that a national SARI committee be established to develop guidelines, protocols and strategies to deal with antimicrobial resistance. This committee was established in late 2002 and as part of its remit provides advice to the regional SARI committees which were established as a result of the strategy's recommendations.Effective infection control measures, including environmental cleaning and hand hygiene, are central to the control of health care associated infections, including drug resistant organisms such as MRSA. The infection control subcommittee of SARI recently prepared draft guidelines for the control of MRSA in Irish hospitals and community health care settings. The key recommendations cover such areas as environmental cleanliness, bed occupancy levels, isolation facilities, hand hygiene, appropriate antibiotic use and protocols for the screening and detection of MRSA. These draft guidelines, based on the best evidence available internationally, are a key component in the response to MRSA in Ireland. When finalised, these recommendations will replace guidelines issued by my Department in 1995 on MRSA.The HSE has identified hospital infection control as a priority area and is currently in discussion with SARI representatives to develop a common approach to this area. A number of initiatives are being considered, for example, development of national standards for infection control infrastructure in hospital building programmes.

Under the Act, the executive is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.The Health Service Executive has informed me that the initial cost of developing the HSE logo was €3,146.00, including VAT. Subsequent costs were incurred and include the redesign of the general medical card, which cost €1,511.97. As the corporate identity is being rolled out nationally, a corporate identity manual and CD-Rom was developed with guidelines for use of the logo to assist area managers in directing printers and designers at a cost of €12,410.01. This included production of 1,500 CD-Roms and manuals.A number of additional costs, such as those for Irish translation and further work with printers, have been incurred but final figures are not yet available. Since the establishment of the Health Service Executive in January 2005, former health boards areas have been required to begin to roll out the new HSE corporate identity. Stocks of stationery in the former ERHA and health board areas were allowed to run down last year, so the cost involved with new stationery is comparable to the regular replacement cost of old stock.There will be a marginal increase in cost for the new logo over logos used in the former health board and health authority areas. These costs relate to the colour scheme. Apart from stationery and some other important signage, the corporate identity is only being changed where replacement is required. The total costs for implementing the new logo are, therefore, not currently available.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 27 and 41 together.The strategy "Primary Care: A New Direction" recognises that the provision of modern, well equipped, accessible premises will be central to the effective functioning of primary care teams and networks. Therefore, one of the key objectives is to facilitate and encourage the development, where appropriate, of modern, well equipped, user friendly buildings in which the broad range of primary care services, including general practice, can be delivered.The concept of delivering all services from a single location is considered appropriate for many settings, especially in urban areas. It is also recognised that, where populations are widely dispersed, it may be preferable to have the team deliver services from more than one location, so that primary care services are easily accessible to those who use them.It is clear that the existing network of community health centres and general practice premises is not adequate to meet the needs of primary care teams. To ensure that appropriate facilities are developed on the required scale, resources other than those of the Exchequer will be required and, indeed, this is line with the historic practice whereby there has been a mix of public and private facilities provision, with, for example, general practitioners in many cases funding their own practice premises.In this regard, the strategy emphasises the need to gain full benefit from existing buildings and to fully explore opportunities for private investment and public private partnerships in implementing the development programme. The Government is committed to developing policy in such a way as to encourage innovative approaches to the provision of facilities and services to support the development and operation of primary care teams and networks in accordance with the objectives of the primary care strategy.With regard to the development of health facilities which include a pharmacy, it is important to note that the primary care strategy places the community pharmacist in the primary care network, on the basis that the pharmacist will serve the needs of clients of more than one primary care team. The strategy does not specify where any of the primary care network members should be located relative to the members of the primary care team.The report of the pharmacy review group includes a number of recommendations aimed at ensuring a separation between prescribing and dispensing and this includes recommending that there be a requirement for discrete premises, with separate entrances, for general practitioners and pharmacists. The Government has yet to consider this report and it would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt any decisions on its recommendations at this stage.

I listened carefully to the delegates' views concerning the development and improvement of oncology services at regional level and, in particular, radiation oncology services, breast cancer screening and capital funding for oncology facilities. I expressed my view on the importance of developing regional services consistent with best patient outcomes in line with international standards and agreed to revert to them at a later stage.

A sum of €70 million is available to the Health Service Executive this year for these initiatives. I have met with senior management of the HSE and my Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure the early implementation of these measures.The Government's programme for capital investment in hospital infrastructure is continuing and is resulting in new and improved accident and emergency departments being provided around the country. New accident and emergency departments have been provided at Cork University Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Naas General Hospital, South Tipperary General Hospital in Clonmel and Roscommon General Hospital.I welcome the recent intervention of the Health and Safety Authority. The HSA has a clear statutory role in health and safety in the workplace. The HSA has investigated specific incidences in hospitals in the past and has worked with the hospital authorities to ensure that satisfactory mechanisms have been put in place to safeguard health and safety. The HSA has asked hospitals to carry out a comprehensive risk assessment of their accident and emergency departments. This will be done with the co-operation of management and staff in each hospital.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	388	A statutory complaints framework is provided for under the provisions of Part 9 of the Health Act 2004, which was enacted in December 2004. This provides for the establishment of a statutory complaints framework to apply to complaints about the actions of the Health Service Executive or a service provider. The establishment of such a framework follows on the commitment in the health strategy to provide for such a statutory framework to provide for greater clarity and uniformity of approach in dealing with complaints and to provide for structured local resolution processes with access to independent review.Under the statutory framework provided for in the 2004 Act, an action is defined as "anything done or omitted to be done" by the executive or by a service provider with whom it has an agreement for the provision of services or with a service provider to whom it provides assistance for the provision of services.This framework initially seeks to resolve the complaint at local level but provides for access to independent review if the complainant is dissatisfied with the outcome of the complaint. It also provides for access to the Office of the Ombudsman, or the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, if the complainant is still dissatisfied following the outcome of the review.The provisions of the statutory framework will apply to all service providers providing services on behalf of the executive. They can either avail of the executive's complaints system or establish their own if the executive is satisfied that its standards are comparable to that of the executive. There is also provision that where a person is unable to make a complaint because of illness or age or disability, a complaint may be made on his or her behalf by certain specified persons.Complaints must be made within 12 months of the actions giving rise to the complaint. The framework provides that complaints cannot be made about certain issues which include matters which are or have been the subject of legal proceedings, matters relating to clinical judgment and matters relating to the recruitment and appointment of employees. The provisions of the statutory framework provide that the operational detail will be set out by way of regulations to be made by the Minister.The Deputy will also be aware that Part 2 of the Disability Bill 2004, which deals with assessment of need and access to health and education services contains redress mechanisms consisting of complaints, appeals and enforcement procedures so as to provide individual means of redress under the provisions of this part. In addition, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 contains an appeals mechanism which covers the assessment of need for a child with special educational needs and the delivery of the supports by the education and health services necessary to enable the child to participate in and benefit from education.

I am aware of concerns expressed regarding the practice of admitting children to adult psychiatric units. I accept that the placement of children with mental health problems in adult facilities is inappropriate.The first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry recommended that a total of seven child and adolescent in-patient psychiatric units, for children ranging from six to 16 years, should be developed throughout the country. Project teams have been established to develop child and adolescent in-patient psychiatric units in Cork, Limerick, Galway and one in the former Eastern Regional Health Authority area at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview. Approval to tender for design teams for the units in Cork, Limerick and Galway was given by my Department recently. At present, in-patient services for children and adolescents are provided at Warrenstown House, Dublin, and at St. Anne's in Galway.The working group on child and adolescent psychiatry also recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric services as the most effective means of providing the required service for children with mental illness. This has been a priority for my Department in recent years. Since 1997, additional funding of almost €19 million has been provided to allow for the appointment of additional consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry, for the enhancement of existing consultant led multidisciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. This has resulted in the funding of a further 19 child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists. Nationally, there are now 52 such psychiatrists employed.The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including child and adolescent psychiatry, will be considered in the context of the work of the expert group on mental health policy which is due to report in 2005.

I hope to complete this work in a matter of weeks.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 36 and 37 together.The report of the panel reviewing the events surrounding the death of Róisín Ruddle was published on my Department's website earlier today.First, I wish to express my sympathy to Róisín's parents and to her extended family. They have been through extremely difficult times in the past and the publication of the report of the panel reviewing the events surrounding Róisín's death will no doubt recall for them all the trauma of those times.The review panel's report found that if Róisín's operation had gone ahead as planned on 30 June 2003, the likelihood of her survival would have been greater, and that the fundamental reason behind the deferral of Róisín's surgery was the inability of Our Lady's Hospital to recruit-retain sufficient experienced nursing staff to support the available ICU beds.I recently met with the hospital's chief executive and director of nursing. They assured me that key recommendations in the report have already been acted upon, including the appointment of a full-time nurse manager to manage nursing recruitment and retention; the appointment of a clinical bed manager; and the establishment of links with similar institutions outside the country to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and experience. They also assured me that the remaining recommendations will receive the hospital's urgent attention.I have full confidence in the ability of the hospital management and its clinicians to address the issues raised in the report and to work to deliver on the recommendations applicable to the hospital's internal organisation.One of the report's recommendations is that the overall training period required to become a fully qualified children's ICU nurse be re-examined. Every avenue to make children's nursing an attractive option must be explored. I recently received the report of the expert group on midwifery and children's nursing education. One of its recommendations, the introduction of a direct entry undergraduate programme for combined children's-general nursing lasting four and a half years, must be implemented. We also need to reduce the length of the existing post-registration programme for qualification as a children's nurse. These measures will reduce the time taken to qualify as a children's nurse and should increase the numbers coming through the system.I will shortly be announcing how the report of the expert group on midwifery and children's nursing education can best be implemented. I welcome the fact that the hospital has already established links with similar institutions outside the country and I encourage it to explore this option for courses in specialist and expert practice.

The report concludes that in the future it will be essential to base cystic fibrosis care in fewer units of a more significant size in order to sustain viable staffing levels and to ensure that staff have a sufficient workload to enable them to maintain their skills level.I understand that the Health Service Executive is pursuing with St. Vincent's Hospital, which is designated as the national adult cystic fibrosis centre, proposals for improvement to the physical infrastructure to support the highly professional treatment and care services provided there at present.

The use of any particular diagnostic test such as the RAST test, either in its own right or as an alternative to another test, would be a decision that a doctor and a patient would make given the nature of the condition involved and, in particular, any specific features which would characterise the individual patient's clinical presentation. The RAST test is an allergen specific IgE antibody test which can be used when there are signs or symptoms suggestive of an allergy to one or more substances or foods.The use of particular diagnostic tests should be based on the best available evidence on such properties as their sensitivity, specificity, effectiveness and cost effectiveness. This evidence is described in the international medical literature, any recommendations emanating from standards or training bodies or expert scientific groups and, of course, the doctor's own experience, skills and knowledge of the patient.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 43, 52, 68, 73, 78  and 87 together.My Department is at present considering the nature of the legislative changes required to enable effect to be given to the decision to introduce doctor visit cards. I have received legal advice that an amendment to the Health Act 1970 is required in order to enable effect to be given to this decision.My Department is working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to legislation in this regard being introduced in the Oireachtas as soon as possible. Work is also progressing, at the level of the Health Service Executive, on the necessary administrative arrangements to ensure that as soon as the necessary legislative provisions are enacted, doctor only medical cards can be issued.The Health Service Executive will be contacting general practitioners who hold contracts under the general medical services scheme to advise them of the necessary administrative details regarding the new cards. There is no requirement for a process of industrial relations negotiations with doctors' representative organisations in this regard. However, I look forward to constructive discussion with the Irish Medical Organisation in order to ensure the smooth introduction of the doctor only cards. The Health Service Executive will facilitate this.In September 2004, the number of current medical cards in circulation was 768,895 providing services for 1,151,106 persons, or 29.39% of the population of 3,917,203, according to the 2002 census. In January 2005, there were 767,558 current cards providing services for 1,145,083 persons, or 28.32% of the population of 4,043,800, which is the official estimate of population as at September 2004.The decline in medical card coverage can be attributed to the continued economic success of the country and also to results of the cleansing of medical card databases during 2003 and 2004, in which approximately 104,000 medical card records were removed. Many of the deletions from the database would have been due to normal reviews but a number would have been duplicate or expired records. Regular periodic reviews of eligibility are undertaken by the Health Service Executive to ensure that their medical card databases are accurate.The implications of my decision to extend medical card coverage, as announced in November, will become apparent as the year progresses. New income guidelines, as agreed by the chief executive officers of the former health boards, are being used by the local area offices for the determination of eligibility to an additional 30,000 full eligibility medical cards since January 2005. The additional 200,000 doctor visit cards will be introduced progressively from April 2005, once the legal and administrative arrangements are in place.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	398	The Government's policy on radiation oncology is based on the report entitled "The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland". The report was prepared by a multidisciplinary group of experts in radiation oncology, medical oncology, public health and palliative care, including representatives of bodies such as the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Cancer Society and Aid Cancer Treatment. The report has had significant international endorsement from such bodies as the US National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society.The Government is determined to ensure access by cancer patients throughout the country to high quality radiation oncology in line with best international standard. Significant progress is being made in implementing the report's recommendations. Two additional linear accelerators are being provided at the supra-regional centre at Cork University Hospital at a capital cost of over €4 million. The first of these linear accelerators has been installed and the second is expected to be commissioned by the autumn. Last year, approval issued for the appointment of 29 staff for this unit and additional ongoing revenue funding of €3 million to cater for this expansion. Two additional consultant radiation oncologists will be appointed at Cork University Hospital with sessional commitments to the south-eastern and the mid-western areas. Cork University Hospital is also in the process of recruiting other key posts required for the commissioning of the new linear accelerators.The supra-regional centre at University College Hospital, Galway, is constructed and the equipment is currently being commissioned. Last year, approval issued for the appointment of 102 staff for this unit, together with ongoing revenue funding of €12 million to cater for this expansion. Approval issued for the appointment of an additional consultant medical oncologist and three consultant radiation oncologists, two of whom have significant sessional commitments to the north-western and the mid-western areas. Key staffing is in place, with two consultant radiation oncologists taking up post in March. The western area is confident of meeting its target date for commencement of patient treatments in March 2005.The report recommends that there should be two radiotherapy treatment centres located in the eastern region, one serving the southern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas and one serving the northern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas. The international panel established to advise on the optimum locations for radiation oncology services in the eastern region submitted its advice to me on 28 January last. I intend to reach an early decision on this matter.While the immediate priority is to provide significantly enhanced services in the major population centres of Dublin, Cork and Galway, I will keep the question of networked satellite locations under active review.As recommended in the report, the national radiation oncology co-ordinating group was established last year. The group comprises clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions. The group's remit encompasses recommending measures to facilitate improved access to existing and planned services, including transport and accommodation. The group will also advise on quality assurance protocols and guidelines for the referral of public patients to private facilities.

The examination included an evaluation of the pilot programme, quality assurance, laboratory capacity and organisation and the establishment of national governance arrangements. The expert's report was published by the executive on 14 December 2004.My Department is now consulting with relevant professional representative and advocacy groups on the report as an essential input into its preparation of a detailed response to the recommendations. These groups are: the Irish College of General Practitioners, An Bord Altranais, the Academy of Medical Laboratory Science, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the RCPI, the Faculty of Pathology of the RCPI, the Women's Health Council and the Irish Cancer Society.Following the consultation process, my Department will examine options for a national cervical screening programme.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	400	As the Deputy may be aware, the report of the working group on elder abuse, Protecting Our Future, was launched on 11 November 2002.This report, in starting with a definition of elder abuse and recommending the putting in place of structures to deal with suspected cases, will hopefully give older people who feel they are the subject of abuse in any shape or form, the confidence to report their anxieties, as appropriate, to a social worker, a public health nurse, a member of the Garda Síochána or indeed any professional or care worker.One of the recommendations in the elder abuse report is the establishment of a national implementation group and this group was established in December 2003 and has commenced its work.In addition, funding of €800,000 was provided in 2003 to commence implementation of the elder abuse programme. In 2004, an additional €75,000 was allocated to each health board for its continued implementation, including the appointment of case workers, and this year an additional €900,000 has been allocated for the elder abuse programme.The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The main difficulty with regard to adult homelessness has been in the Dublin area and in order to address this the former Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, appointed a director of homelessness who is working to implement the provisions of "Homelessness — An Integrated Strategy", May 2000.To address the mental health needs of homeless people in the Dublin area, the three former area health boards were commissioned by the ERHA to provide multidisciplinary mental health teams. Multidisciplinary teams will play a key role in developing services that are responsive, targeted and effective and include the following key elements: the provision of screening, assessment and treatment to homeless people with mental health problems; targeting those homeless people sleeping rough with mental health problems; bringing the mental health services to hostels, day centres and other settings where homeless people present; and providing support and consultancy to homeless services and their staff on mental health issues and concerns.Guidelines on good practice and quality assurance in mental health services were issued by my Department in 1998. The guidelines state that well planned discharge policies and procedures should be in place and should include documentation and a pre-discharge checklist to ensure that all appropriate information is given and appropriate services arranged prior to a patient's actual discharge. A post-discharge care plan should be prepared and discussed with the patient and arrangements must be made for the first review of the patient post-discharge.The homeless preventative strategy was published in 2003. The strategy is designed to prevent homelessness among those leaving institutional care and provides guidance to service providers to ensure procedures and policies are in place to further reduce the risk of people leaving institutional care becoming homeless.An expert group on mental health policy was established in August 2003 to prepare a new national policy framework for the mental health services, updating the 1984 policy document "Planning for the Future". The issue of homeless mentally ill persons will be considered by the group. The group has now completed an extensive public consultation process on the mental health services and the findings of this process were published just before Christmas. The expert group is expected to complete its work later this year.

These schemes have been targeted at supporting older people at home in the community as an alternative to long-term residential care. Older people who are being discharged from the acute hospital system and those living in the community have been targeted under these schemes. In the HSE eastern region area, people have been discharged from acute hospitals under the Slán Abhaile and Home First pilot projects. These projects have recently been evaluated by Trinity College Dublin and the report of these evaluations has been presented to the HSE eastern regional area.The Department has been working with the HSE to develop a national home care grant scheme. A draft of the scheme is currently being finalised by the HSE. Funding of €2 million has been allocated to the HSE in 2005 to introduce the scheme. In addition, funding of €113.75 million was allocated in 2004 to the home help service to support older people living in the community, with this funding being increased to €118.75 million in 2005 for this service.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 57 and 86 together.The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland. To this end, we will provide considerable investment in cancer services in the coming years.I recognise the importance of further developing regional oncology services consistent with best patient outcomes in line with international standards. Oncology services in all regions have experienced significant development and expansion in recent years. Since 1997, there has been a cumulative investment of over €720 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. This includes the sum of €23.5 million, including €11.5 million for radiation oncology services, which will be provided this year to ensure that we continue to address increasing demands for cancer services throughout the country.The provision of cancer services at Waterford Regional Hospital is now a matter for the Health Services Executive. I understand that a draft planning brief for further developments at Waterford Regional Hospital is being considered in the context of the capital investment framework 2005 to 2009. Cumulative funding of approximately €55 million has been allocated since 1997 in the development of cancer services in the south eastern area. This funding has enabled the appointment of an additional ten consultant posts in key areas of cancer care, including three consultant medical oncologists, and has resulted in significant benefits for cancer patients in the region.The national cancer forum is currently finalising a new national cancer strategy which is expected to be completed in the spring. The forum has concluded that the current fragmented arrangements for the delivery of cancer services cannot be recommended to deliver best quality cancer care. The new strategy will have regard to the multi-faceted aspects of cancer control. The key priority in the development of improved cancer care is that cancer patients will have access to multidisciplinary care to ensure optimum treatment and best outcomes. The strategy will set out the key priorities for the development of cancer services over the coming years and will make recommendations on health promotion, screening and early detection, cancer treatment services, genetics, supportive care, research and survivorship.

Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the procurement of beds in the private nursing home sector for high dependency patients, where appropriate.The executive has recently advertised seeking tenders from the private nursing home sector for the care of high dependency patients. The question of capacity of the private nursing home sector to provide care for high dependency patients as well as the number of beds and the location of any such beds will be addressed as part of this process.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	408	The position is that, following legal advice from the Attorney General on the matter, my Department instructed health boards on 9 December 2004 to cease imposing any financial charges from that date on fully eligible people in receipt of public long stay inpatient services. With effect from 1 January 2005, under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive has responsibility for the delivery of health services. My Department is in contact with the executive about monitoring the implementation of this instruction to cease to impose charges to qualifying elderly patients. The executive has this week advised that it is not aware of any instances where charges continue to be imposed on qualifying elderly persons.The Deputy will appreciate that the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004, which was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 17 December 2004, provides, among other things, for a statutory framework for the imposition of charges on all persons to whom long stay in-patient services are provided, irrespective of their eligibility status. The President referred the Bill to the Supreme Court for a decision on its constitutionality. The position with regard to charges for long stay care will become clearer once the Supreme Court's decision, which is due shortly, on the constitutionality of the Bill becomes available.

This team included representatives from the Department of Health and Children, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the East Coast Area Health Board, the clinical director, the director of nursing and the hospital manager of the Central Mental Hospital, the Irish Prison Service and a representative of the CEOs of the other health boards. The project team's remit was to critically examine all options for the redevelopment of the hospital, to put together a design brief for the redevelopment and to examine various financing options for the project.There were six options considered by the group as follows: to develop a new facility on a green field site in the greater Dublin area; to develop a new facility on a green field site outside the greater Dublin area; to refurbish-upgrade the existing facility to accommodate the service; partial new build of the hospital with retention and refurbishment of some of the existing building; to transfer the service to another existing facility; or "do nothing". Several options, including the option of remaining in Dundrum, were examined under the various criteria, including clinical quality-strategic fit, cost, capital and revenue, timescale, future demands, integrated services, accessibility and safety and security.The team reported to the Department of Health and Children via the Eastern Regional Health Authority in May 2004 and recommended that the Central Mental Hospital be relocated to a new purpose built facility in the greater Dublin area, as this was judged to be the most appropriate option for delivery of patient care. The project team made no specific recommendation on locating the Central Mental Hospital adjacent to a prison. However, 97% of admissions to the hospital come from within the prison service.The new Central Mental Hospital will be a health facility, providing a therapeutic forensic psychiatric service to the highest international standards in a state of the art building. The hospital will remain under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children and will be owned and managed by the Health Service Executive.

The information is currently being collated in respect of the ongoing pilot programmes with which my Department has a direct involvement. As the question covers ongoing pilot programmes across the health services it has also been referred to the Health Service Executive, HSE. The HSE will respond directly to the Deputy on all other pilot programmes ongoing throughout its area of responsibility.

Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for orthodontic services.The chief officers of the HSE areas have informed my Department of the following information on their orthodontic assessment and treatment waiting lists, as shown in the table, as at the end of December 2004.Assessment Waiting ListTreatment Waiting ListHealth Service ExecutiveNumbers awaiting assessmentAverage waiting time (months)Category AAverage waiting time (months)Category BAverage waiting time (months)South Western Area4033- 66191225424East Coast Area121< 333< 6167< 18Northern Area1353- 697< 182466< 36Midland Area1734NilNo Waiting Time31212Mid Western Area2,89624- 36NilNo Waiting Time73024- 36North Eastern AreaNilNo waiting time81.5- 227618North Western Area2,55710.517981,19124.5South Eastern Area2362- 2.5NilNo Waiting Time67518Southern Area2,853According to Date of Birth.

Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients.The number of cases treated is dependent on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in the area and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list. In fact, the provision of orthodontic services is currently restricted due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients and, accordingly, HSE areas do not normally maintain category C waiting lists.My Department has taken steps to address the shortage of trained staff and improve orthodontic services through the grade of specialist in orthodontics. Six dentists successfully completed their three year specialist in orthodontics training and commenced work in the HSE in October 2004 and a further 13 are currently in training.Although the Deputy has requested information on waiting list trends over the last five years, complete records at a national level are only available from September 2000. The above table shows that at the end of the December 2004 quarter, there were 9,954 patients awaiting orthodontic assessment and 10,953 patients awaiting orthodontic treatment. This compares favourably with 18,793 patients awaiting orthodontic assessment and 12,593 patients awaiting orthodontic treatment at the end of the September 2000 quarter and represents a reduction of 47% and 13% approximately, respectively, in the period to December 2004.Finally, at the end of the December 2004 quarter, there were 23,572 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are over twice as many patients getting orthodontic treatment as there are waiting to be treated and more than 8,500 extra patients are getting treatment from the Health Service Executive since the end of the September 2000 quarter.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	414	The national cancer forum is currently finalising a new national cancer strategy which is expected to be completed in the spring. The national cancer forum, a multidisciplinary group of experts in cancer care, has conducted an extensive consultation process with professional bodies, voluntary organisations and the general public. In developing an organisational model for the delivery of cancer treatment services, the forum's considerations have been informed by the broad strategic context in which the cancer strategy exists, a review of the current status of cancer care, a review of the literature evidence concerning key aspects of the organisation of cancer services and a review of international models of care.The forum has concluded that the current fragmented arrangements for the delivery of cancer services cannot be recommended to deliver best quality cancer care. Cancer care is a dynamic process involving the interaction of many different elements of the health system. Although they are often considered separately, the overall quality and performance of services as delivered to patients is dependent in a very significant way on how well each of these elements integrate and co-ordinate with each other. They must be planned and organised in a manner which facilitates integration so that, from the perspective of the user, the whole system operates in a complimentary and efficient manner.The new strategy will have regard to the multi-faceted aspects of cancer control. The key priority in the development of improved cancer care is that cancer patients will have access to multidisciplinary care to ensure optimum treatment and best outcomes in line with international best practice. The strategy will set out the key priorities for the development of cancer services over the coming years and will make recommendations on health promotion, screening and early detection, cancer treatment services, genetics, supportive care, research and survivorship. This is especially important as more people are living longer with cancer than in previous years.Oncology services nationally have experienced significant development and expansion in recent years. The key goal of the national cancer strategy 1996 was to achieve a 15% decrease in mortality from cancer in the under 65 year age group in the ten year period from 1994. An external evaluation of the extent to which the objectives of the national cancer strategy 1996 have been met demonstrated that this figure was achieved in 2001, which was three years ahead of target. The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients nationally.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I regard the report of the national task force on medical staffing as a significant contribution to the development of acute hospitals services and to the organisation of medical staffing. The report makes important proposals for reducing the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, in line with the European working time directive. It highlights the need to implement changes in medical staffing to ensure safety and quality of patient care and to reduce significantly the unacceptably long working hours of NCHDs.The Hanly report recommends a significant increase in the total number of consultants, working in a consultant provided, team based system, so that patients can receive faster access to senior clinical decision making. The Hanly report also deals with medical education and training, with particular reference to the changes that will be needed in the context of a 48 hour working week for NCHDs.Regarding the organisation of hospital services, the report proposes an appropriate way forward in terms of regional self sufficiency, investment in hospital services and the organisation of those services around hospital networks. In line with these recommendations, I will continue the Government's planned investment in new hospital facilities and additional consultant posts. I believe that this approach will be to the benefit of all patients.The national hospitals office is best placed to further the recommendations of the Hanly report regarding hospital services. Mr. David Hanly, who chaired the national task force on medical staffing, will continue to be available for advice on the reform process.

In this context, funding has already been provided for an additional 900 beds in acute hospitals throughout the country, 700 of which were in place at the end of January 2005. It is envisaged that the remaining 200 beds will open before the end of 2005.There has been no overall diminution in the number of beds since 1997 in the hospitals mentioned with the exception of orthopaedic beds having been transferred from Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and from Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital to Waterford Regional Hospital. It is important to note that the numbers of beds available in any hospital may fluctuate over time depending on service demands and other factors such as seasonal closures and refurbishment. I am providing details separately to the Deputy. In addition, extra beds will be provided in the new acute medical units which I announced as part of the accident and emergency services package on the publication of the Estimates for 2005.

The chairman of the inquiry has been so advised and I expect her final report on or before that date. The chairman had indicated to me that she would provide her report on paediatric hospitals in December 2004 but this did not happen. I am in communication with Parents for Justice and will arrange to meet them in the near future.The European Commission is currently considering the question of a directive in respect of organ transplantation, including the issue of consent, and proposes to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the situation. It will present a report on its analysis to the Council of the European Union as soon as possible. It is hoped that this will provide the framework for the development of legislation in this area.In the meantime, it is intended to review organ donation, procurement and utilisation policy in Ireland. This work will inform Ireland's contribution to the discussions about the proposed directive on organs.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	421	The most recent figures available show that in 2003, the total cost of antihistamines prescribed under the general medical services, drug payment scheme and long-term illness scheme was €2,338,784. Figures are not available for the sale of non-prescription, "over the counter" antihistamines.Antihistamines are a well recognised, safe and effective treatment for a wide variety of allergic reactions. The indications for prescribing these products, together with any possible side effects and potential interactions with other medicinal products that patients may be taking, are widely referenced in medical literature. This information would also be contained in the prescribing material which accompanies the product and is, therefore, well known to doctors treating patients with these conditions.I am not aware of any information to suggest that there is an excessive reliance on antihistamines for the treatment of allergic conditions. Prescriptions for antihistamines, as with any medicinal product, are issued by doctors based on the symptoms of the presenting patient at the time of consultation. The type and level of medication prescribed is, therefore, a matter of clinical decision for the particular doctor involved.

Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for infection control measures in hospitals. Accordingly, my Department has requested the interim chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive to reply directly to the Deputy on the number of bed days lost in 2004 as a result of outbreaks of norovirus, more commonly referred to as the "winter vomiting bug".Norovirus is very resilient and is highly infectious and can remain infectious for long periods. As it is a community infection, outbreaks in hospitals are simply a gauge or reflection of what is happening in the community. While outbreaks cannot be eradicated, they can be controlled. The HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre, formerly the National Disease Surveillance Centre, has published guidelines on the management of outbreaks of gastroenteritis. These guidelines provide a framework to address the challenge of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in hospitals and other settings caused by norovirus.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	425	The question of who is responsible for settling claims against consultants arising from events, which occurred prior to the establishment of the clinical indemnity scheme, is, in the first instance, one for consultants and their defence bodies. Consultants paid substantial subscriptions to the Medical Defence Union, MDU, over many years. The primary purpose of joining the MDU was to secure professional indemnity cover without which a doctor could not practice. Doctors would have had a reasonable expectation that claims against them would be met despite the fact the MDU did not consider itself to be carrying on an insurance business. The failure of the MDU to meet the reasonable expectations of its Irish members is regrettable.As the State reimbursed up to 90% of the cost of indemnity cover purchased by consultants employed in the public service it has a legitimate interest in ensuring that Irish consultants are treated in a fair and equitable fashion by the MDU. Giving tangible expression to this interest may result in the State giving assistance to consultants, or joining with consultants, in taking legal action against the MDU.

Some 2,664 cases of STIs were notified in Ireland during quarter one of 2003, compared with 2,541 notifications during quarter one of 2002, representing a 4.8% increase in STI notifications.The three most commonly notified STIs in quarter one of 2003 were: ano-genital warts, 929 cases; non-specific urethritis, 560 cases; and chlamydia trachomatis, 525 cases. The highest increase reported in quarter one of 2003, compared with quarter one of 2002, was for infectious hepatitis B, up by 230%. The most significant decreases reported during quarter one of 2003, compared with quarter one of 2002, were for gonorrhoea, down by 16.67%, and syphilis, down by 8.2%.

My Department, through the national AIDS strategy committee and its sub-committees on education and prevention, surveillance and care and management, is working to implement these recommendations. Specifically with regard to prevention, the health promotion unit of my Department is overseeing a wide range of activity at the research, strategy and programme level.My Department is working with the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to undertake the first ever survey of sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. The aim of this research is to gather reliable nationally representative baseline information that will build a representative national picture of sex and sexual behaviour in Ireland to inform the development of treatment and prevention services. The health promotion unit has also supported the development of a sexual health strategy within the north-west and southern areas of the Health Service Executive with a view to developing a national framework for sexual health promotion.My Department is working with a wide range of partners to implement a comprehensive range of prevention programmes as recommended in the National Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005 and the report of the national Aids strategy committee 2000. The following are some of the current priorities. In the school setting my Department is working in partnership with the Department of Education and Science and the Health Service Executive to support schools in the introduction and delivery of social, personal and health education at both primary and post-primary level. Relationships and sexuality education is an integral part of this curriculum and remains a key priority for this work with schools.In the out of school setting the health promotion unit of my Department works in partnership with the youth affairs section of the Department of Education and Science and the National Youth Council of Ireland to implement the national youth health programme. The aim of the programme is to provide a broad based, flexible health promotion, education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in the non-formal education sector. Within the context of this programme a new initiative, entitled "Sense and Sexuality", has been launched to support youth workers, addressing the issues of relationships, sexuality and sexual health with young people.A national public awareness advertising campaign aimed at men and women in the 18 to 35 year age group has been developed to increase awareness about safe sex and sexually transmitted infections. The overall goal is to increase safe sex practices, reducing the incidence of STI transmission and unwanted pregnancies among young people in Ireland. The campaign runs in third level colleges, places of entertainment — pubs, clubs, discos and so forth — youth venues and some health centres. This national programme has been running for several years and a new and revised campaign is being implemented by the health promotion unit, which has greatly increased the number of venues targeted.The health promotion unit also produces a range of awareness raising leaflets on STIs and safe sex practices.

Under the Act, the executive is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. As part of its responsibility to prepare and submit an annual service plan for my approval, the executive is obliged under section 31 of the Act to indicate any capital plans its proposes. It can be expected during the process to have regard to the full range of potential capital developments, its criteria in determining priorities, available resources and any other relevant factors.The Department has not yet received the executive's 2005 service plan. In the interim, the Department has asked the chief executive of the executive's southern area to investigate the position in respect of the project and to reply directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	430	It is estimated that the total percentage increase in VHI premiums for its core products since 1997 is 96%. Officials in the Department of Health and Children have estimated that the recently announced increase in the cost of private beds in public hospitals will result in an increase in health insurance premiums of approximately 5%.In the interests of equity, the Government has a policy of gradually eliminating the effective subsidy for private stays in public hospital beds, thereby relieving the taxpayer of the burden of carrying the costs. Even taking the increase into consideration, the cost of providing services to private patients in the major hospitals will continue to exceed the income arising from the charges.Notwithstanding the increase and the phased implementation of the move towards economic pricing of public pay beds, the cost of community rated private health insurance remains low by international standards and continues to benefit from tax relief at the standard rate. The regulatory framework provides that premiums for children under the age of 18 years will be waived or will not exceed 50% of the adult rate, while premiums for students in full-time education up to the age of 23 years may not exceed 50% of the adult rate.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	432	Significant progress has been made in increasing the number of training places in a wide range of health and social care professional courses in recent years. Following the implementation of the recommendations of the Bacon report, approximately 152 undergraduate places are available to students who want to study physiotherapy in Ireland. The number of occupational therapy training places has more than tripled to 110 since 2000. The number of speech and language therapy training places has more than quadrupled to 105 in the same period.The report on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland identified the need to increase significantly the number of radiation therapists to meet human resource needs under the proposed expansion of radiotherapy services. In advance of the implementation of the report's recommendations, the annual intake into Trinity College's school of radiation therapy increased from ten in 2000 to 25 in 2002. The Department of Health and Children has also taken steps to address the shortage of trained staff in orthodontics and to improve orthodontic services through the grade of specialist in orthodontics. Six dentists successfully completed the three year specialist in orthodontics training and commenced work in the Health Service Executive in October 2004. A further 13 dentists are in training.The increased intake of students into the professions I have mentioned will help to address the health service's human resource requirements and to provide the personnel required for future health care demands, thereby assisting the delivery of the goals in the Disability Bill. In this context, the Deputy may wish to note that an additional €70 million in revenue funding has been provided for services to support people with disabilities in 2005. This will enable people with disabilities to receive new services from more than 1,000 front line staff, including therapy professionals.Responsibility for human resource planning, recruitment and monitoring and filling vacancies in the health service rests with the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005 under the Health Act 2004. The Department of Health and Children has asked the interim chief executive officer of the executive to investigate the filling of professional health vacancies and to respond directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	433	The provision of step down services for people ready to be discharged from hospital is a key element in ensuring that health services are matched to patient needs. When I published the health Estimates for 2005, I announced that patients awaiting discharge from acute hospitals would be accommodated in private nursing home beds for up to six weeks. When a patient is discharged from a private nursing home, he or she will go to a nursing home of his or her choice or to his or her home with the support of a home care package.It has been estimated that approximately 500 people could be accommodated in such beds over a 12-month period under the initiative. The home care packages will be extended to support 500 additional older people at home. Some 100 high dependency patients will transfer to suitable private nursing home care. The scope for using greater numbers of private nursing home beds to alleviate pressure on acute hospitals will be actively pursued.Work is under way in the Department of Health and Children on a proposal for a public private partnership investment scheme for 850 community nursing units. There have been discussions between the Department and the Department of Finance on the development of the scheme. As the contracting structure of such schemes is complex, it is important to have a clear view of the benefits that will accrue from them. The work that has been done so far has helped to clarify a number of issues. I am aware that additional long stay bed capacity is required to relieve pressure on the acute hospital and community care programme. I will pursue the need to deliver such capacity with the Minister for Finance as a matter of high priority.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	434	Casemix is an internationally accepted management system for the monitoring and evaluation of health services. It allows for the collection, categorisation and interpretation of hospital patient data about the types of cases treated. It assists hospitals in defining their products, measuring their productivity and assessing quality. It is used as part of the budgetary process to base funding on measured costs and activity, rather than on less objective systems of resource allocation, and to fund hospitals based on their mix of cases. It is used in a broad way when considering investment options with the acute hospital sector, bed capacity and the national treatment purchase fund.The programme operates in 37 hospitals in Ireland. It involves over €3 billion of expenditure and 1.6 million patient encounters each year. Ireland operates a budget neutral policy, which rewards efficiency by retargeting funds from less efficient hospitals to those which have demonstrated that additional funding will result in real benefits. The negative adjustment of €1,055,679 in the case in question was a reflection of the hospital's performance vis-à-vis its peers, following full compensation for its unique local circumstances and mix of cases.The casemix system allows hospitals to take full account of their unique patients and unique issues, including elderly or other patients with a long length of stay. Hospitals are not penalised for excessive length of stay. Credit is given for all long stay patients, regardless of reason. Hospitals are not given a profile of patients whom they must treat. They are judged on their efficiency in treating cases, relative to their peers. The entire process takes place in consultation with each hospital. Patient centred information is at the centre of the process. The Department reviews performance across the public hospitals. It discusses the results with hospital management to encourage performance and value for money improvements.The national programme will be significantly enhanced and expanded on foot of a recent review of the casemix system. That will allow it to be applied to all acute hospital encounters and all acute and sub-acute hospitals by the end of the decade. At least 50% of acute hospital funding will be based on peer group related casemix performance for the 2008 financial allocations.This development in the system will greatly enhance resource allocation, evaluation of investment and value for money aspects in the health sector. I am committed to performance related targets. Casemix is the most internationally accepted performance related acute hospital activity programme. It will be used as a central pillar in all acute hospital funding policy.

A comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs, Acute Hospitals Bed Capacity — A National Review, was published by the Department in January 2002. The review helped to inform the Government's commitment to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals by 2011 in the context of the health strategy. The review took account of projected demographic changes.Since the publication of the bed capacity review, funding has been provided for an additional 900 beds in acute hospitals, 700 of which were in place at the end of January 2005. It is envisaged that the remaining 200 will open before the end of the year. This provision, along with actions being taken in respect of accident and emergency services, should have a significant impact on available bed capacity.

The determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the executive, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.It was the practice for former CEOs of health boards to draw up income guidelines each year to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility for a medical card. This function now rests with the executive. New income guidelines were agreed with effect from 1 January 2005, taking on board the announcement in the 2005 health Estimate to extend medical card coverage to up to 30,000 extra individuals. The new income guidelines represent an increase of approximately 7.5% over the 2004 guidelines and, with a view to assisting families on low income with children, the income allowance for each of the first two children was increased by approximately 20% and for the third and subsequent children by approximately 30%.The executive has advised that a social welfare recipient whose sole income is a social welfare payment will be within the income threshold for receiving a medical card. Increases in social welfare rates in recent years have meant that such rates may exceed the income guidelines for a medical card. On foot of this, the Department of Health and Children wrote to the chairman of the group of former health board chief executive officers on a number of occasions asking him to advise the CEOs of concerns that medical card holders should not be disadvantaged by virtue of increases in social welfare payments announced in the budget. They were asked to ensure that increases in social welfare payments do not lead to medical card holders losing their medical cards by reference to the income guidelines and to make every effort to ensure that medical card holders and applicants are made aware that increases in social welfare payments will not disadvantage them when applying to hold or retain a medical card.In the context of the announcements in the 2005 health Estimates on the extension of medical card coverage, it was further clarified that the instruction about medical card holders not being disadvantaged by virtue of increases in social welfare payments would continue to apply. It should be noted that the income guidelines are not statutorily binding. A medical card may still be awarded even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines if the executive considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances justify it. It is open to all persons to apply to the executive for health services if they are unable to provide the services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.

The list is reviewed and amended each month, as new products become available and deletions are notified. An item must comply with a published list of criteria if it is to be included on the common list. The criteria include authorisation status where appropriate, price and in certain cases the intended use of the product. The product should ordinarily be supplied to the public by medical prescription only. It should not be advertised or promoted to the public.The Deputy will be pleased to know that drugs for the treatment of allergic emergencies are included in the common list. Reimbursable adrenaline pens are approved for use by patients in the community outside clinical supervision. I do not plan to draw up new guidelines for the use of adrenaline pens to provide new training and retraining for the treatment of allergies for general practitioners. If the Deputy is aware of a particular problem with the use of adrenaline pens, he should contact the Health Service Executive immediately.

Article 8.2 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 provides that an amount equivalent to one fifth of the non-contributory old age pension is disregarded by the Health Service Executive when assessing the means of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought. This provision ensures that a person can retain a proportion of his or her income for personal use.

Under the code, "any circumstance which could place patients/clients in jeopardy or which militate against safe standards of practice should be made known to appropriate persons or authorities". I have no specific plans at this stage to introduce legislation, as referred to by the Deputy, but I will keep this matter under review.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The task force on medical staffing recognised the important contribution that primary care can make to the provision of quality patient care and to reducing inappropriate demand on the hospital sector. At the Department's request, the East Coast Area Health Board, which is now the HSE east coast area, and the Mid-Western Health Board, now the HSE mid-western area, comprising the two phase 1 implementation regions, each engaged in a detailed exercise to identify the primary care developments required to support the reconfiguration of the hospital services in their areas. The need for consultation with the relevant stakeholders who will work in the primary care teams and with the communities to be served by the teams and networks was emphasised.The HSE mid-western area has developed a draft plan of potential locations for future primary care teams and primary care networks under its jurisdiction in accordance with the service model described in the primary care strategy. The exercise involved a structured examination of a broad range of data including, demographic information, disease patterns, locations of existing public health services, general practice populations, deprivation and mental health indicators and transport links. A database of information was assembled and a geographical information system, GIS, was used to examine the data. The HSE mid-western area intends to use the draft plan as the basis for consultation with primary care providers and service users to progress the roll out of primary care teams and primary care networks.The HSE east coast area exercise involved a detailed examination of existing primary care services and the preparation of a prioritised action plan for the development of primary care to support the co-ordinated implementation of the primary care strategy and the recommendations of the report of the national task force on medical staffing. The approach taken by the HSE east coast area addressed service requirements including integrated care; information and communications technology needs within primary care and linkages between general practice and hospital services; staffing; premises; equipment; communication and access arrangements and developments between general practice and acute hospital services.An allocation of €1.5 million has been made in 2005 to enable work to begin on the appropriate development of primary care services in line with the plans prepared. The Department will work closely with the executive to agree specific priorities in each area in the context of this development funding.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	443	According to the most recent Health Service Employers Agency survey of nursing resources, recruitment remains well ahead of resignations and retirements. Employers reported that 794 vacancies existed at 30 September 2004. The vacancy rate now stands at 2.34%. This could be considered to be a normal frictional rate, given that there will always be some level of movement due to resignations, retirements and nurses availing of opportunities to change employment and locations.The survey does not collect data on vacancies in individual hospital departments such as accident and emergency or intensive care departments. Data on the number of nurses offered permanent contracts in acute hospitals are not available. However, the survey found that in the year ending on 30 September 2004, a total of 3,749 staff nurses were recruited by health boards, voluntary hospitals and intellectual disability agencies. During the same year, 3,188 staff nurses resigned, retired or moved to another employer. An extra 561 nurses were employed in the health service in the year ending on 30 September 2004.The recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of nursing staff have been a concern of the Government for some time. A number of substantial measures have been introduced in recent years. The number of nursing training places has been increased by 70% since 1998, to 1,640 from 2002 onwards. In excess of €90 million in revenue funding is being provided in 2005 for undergraduate nurse training. Nursing continues to be regarded as an attractive career. There were 8,300 CAO applications for 1,640 places in the autumn 2004 intake.A comprehensive range of financial supports has been introduced to support nurses in pursuing part-time degrees and specialist courses, including "back to practice" courses. The cost of these supports will be €10 million in 2005.The Department introduced a scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in February 2001. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent, part-time basis. Almost a quarter of nurses now work job sharing hours or part-time hours.Since 1998, nurses have been paid for overtime. Previously they had been given time off in lieu, and the introduction of payment represents a further significant financial incentive for nurses.The promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, has been substantially improved on foot of the recommendations of the commission on nursing and the 1999 nurses' pay settlement. The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery has been especially active in this area and, to date, over 1,600 clinical nurse specialist and advanced nurse practitioner posts have been created.Ensuring that there are sufficient nursing resources in 2005-06 is a priority for the HSE. This will be the transition year between the diploma and degree programmes. The final group of diploma students recently graduated and the first group of degree students will graduate in 2006. A steering group inclusive of nurse managers and HR specialists is being established by the HSE to manage recruitment in this period. This group will oversee the work of a project office tasked with running local and overseas recruitment campaigns. Additional funding has been provided to the HSE for nursing recruitment in 2005.I am confident that the extensive range of measures I have outlined, including the substantial increase in training places, the recruitment of overseas nurses, the more effective utilisation of the professional skills of nurses and midwives, in addition to close monitoring and assessment of staffing on an ongoing basis, will continue to prove effective in addressing the nursing workforce needs of the health service.

Patients will have direct access to general practitioners, nursing, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and social workers, who will work together as a team to provide a patient centred service in the local community to the community as a whole, including older people.There is evidence that health care professionals working together as a team within the primary care setting represent the most appropriate, effective and user friendly approach to the organisation of health services. The introduction of a multidisciplinary primary care team within a community can enable people to be maintained at home in times of crisis, reduce emergency admissions and shorten lengths of hospital stay. Primary care teams will establish appropriate linkages and relationships with existing specialist community teams, which will enable the team to act as a single and ongoing point of contact in accessing required specialist services.The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the employment of social workers who work with older people. Accordingly, the Department has requested the chief officers of the executive's areas to investigate the matter raised and to reply direct to the Deputy.

In addition, where a pharmacist experiences difficulties with a particular client, a guarantee is in place that the client will be reassigned if the pharmacist so wishes.Last year the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, IPU, raised with the Department of Health and Children some concerns about the suitability of patients being placed in community settings. Arising from discussions between officials from the Department and representatives of the IPU, a notification system is being developed to monitor any difficulties experienced by pharmacists within the methadone scheme and to ensure that appropriate systems are in place to respond to any such difficulties.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I am aware of the report to which the Deputy refers. Section six of the report comments on the implementation of the National Economic and Social Forum report on equity of access to hospital care. The National Economic and Social Forum fourth periodic report raises several issues, mainly about equity of access to hospital care, in particular the "public private mix" in hospital care.The report acknowledges and welcomes the many positive initiatives implemented in the Irish health service in recent years, for example, the increases in funding; the establishment and work of the national treatment purchase fund — particularly its fixing of a three month deadline for hospital treatment and its data gathering on hospital beds which has been commissioned; the Department's commitment to a partnership approach; and progress on institutional and structural reform.The National Economic and Social Forum report contains some wide ranging comments on the issue of equity of access to hospital care. The National Economic and Social Forum recognises the Government's health service reform programme as providing a unique opportunity to achieve greater equity for the most vulnerable groups in our society. The Government intends to provide a policy and legal framework which ensures equity for public patients and enables patients and clients to access the services they need. Specifically, the national treatment purchase fund was set up to deal with waiting lists and particularly to ensure that those waiting longest receive treatment. Issues regarding the interaction between the public and private sectors and provision of hospital services is under active review and will be addressed, for example, in the context of negotiations on the consultant contract and the contribution which the private sector can make.The report of the national task force on medical staffing sets out the changes needed in non-consultant hospital doctors' work patterns; a series of reforms in medical education and training; the number of additional consultants needed and how they should work under a significantly revised contract. The report emphasised that change could not be achieved without reform of acute hospital services.Taking this into account, the Government is committed to developing acute hospital services in a way that will command the confidence of people throughout the country. Consultant contract negotiations are paused pending resolution of issues related to medical indemnity arrangements. However, significant preparatory work has been undertaken on a draft consultant contract and management position paper.At my request, the national treatment purchase fund is giving consideration to the question of how improvement in waiting times for out-patient appointments might be progressed.The National Economic and Social Forum report comments on the ratio of acute hospital beds per head of population in Ireland compared to other OECD countries. At the outset it should be pointed out that the OECD advises caution in the interpretation of cross-country data on health. Health care systems differ significantly across the range of OECD countries. It should also be noted that the Irish data on the number of acute beds do not include the acute beds located in private hospitals in Ireland while some OECD countries include acute beds in private hospitals.A comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs, Acute Hospitals Bed Capacity — a National Review, was conducted by my Department and published in January 2002. This review helped to inform the Government's commitment to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals by 2011 in the context of the health strategy. Since the publication of the bed capacity review funding has been provided for an additional 900 beds in acute hospitals throughout the country, 700 which were in place up to the end of January 2005. The remaining 200 are due to open by the end of 2005.The report of the task force on medical staffing also recognised the important contribution that primary care can make to the provision of quality patient care and to reducing inappropriate demand on the hospital sector. The east coast area and the mid-western area, as the two phase one implementation regions, have prepared detailed plans for the development of primary care in order to support the reconfiguration of the hospital services in these regions and additional funding has been provided in 2005 to enable appropriate developments to commence.The primary care strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, sets out the direction for the development of primary care as the central focus for the delivery of health and personal social care services. This will enable patients to have direct access to a broad range of services provided by an integrated multidisciplinary primary care team in their local community.The strategy also envisages the development of extended hours and out of hours cover for defined primary care services. Primary care planned and organised on this basis can lessen the current reliance on specialist services and the hospital system, particularly accident and emergency and out-patient services.I have considered the concerns raised in the National Economic and Social Forum report about the increase in the drug payment scheme threshold. However, given the need to prioritise health spending in order to maximise the benefit over a wide range of pressing health expenditure options, together with the advantages of the scheme over the schemes it replaced, an increase of €7 per calendar month in the threshold is not considered to be excessive.The drug cost subsidisation scheme and drug refund scheme were merged into the drug payment scheme in July 1999. To qualify under the old drug cost subsidisation scheme, patients had to be certified by their doctor as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure on medicines of £32, €40.63, per month. Under the drug refund scheme, families and individuals paid the full cost of their prescription medicines and claimed reimbursement from their health board of expenditure over £90, €114.28, in each quarter. Many families and individuals had very heavy expenditure on drugs and medicines and had to wait a further six weeks from the end of that quarter before they received a refund. This caused considerable cash flow problems for a significant number of families and individuals.This does not happen under the drugs payment scheme. The primary aim of the scheme was to merge the best elements of the old schemes and improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. Since the introduction of the scheme, no individual or family has had to pay more than the monthly threshold, €85, for approved prescribed medicines. It means that families and individuals are able to budget for the cost of medicines. Regardless of the amount of their drugs bill no individual or family has to spend more than €85 per calendar month.The scheme is for everyone. There are no qualifying criteria. Where expenditure by a family or an individual exceeds €85 per month on approved prescribed medicines, the balance is met by the State. The total reimbursement to patients under the previous schemes in 1998 was £75 million. This cost has increased to €204 million in 2003, the latest figure available, for the drug payment scheme.The National Economic and Social Forum report also comments on the decline in numbers eligible for a medical card. At the beginning of January 2005 there were 1,145,083 people covered by medical cards, which is 28.32% of the current population. In 1998, there were 1,183,554 persons covered by medical cards, which was 31.95% of the population at that time.The decline in numbers can largely be explained by a number of factors, including the changed economic circumstances of the population. These changed circumstances have meant that many people are no longer eligible for a medical card on means grounds. In addition to the above, the ongoing management and review of the medical card databases is a factor in the reduced numbers who held medical cards.The cleansing exercise by health boards during 2003 and 2004 resulted in the removal of approximately 104,000 cards from the medical card register. Most of these cards would have been considered as normal deletions due to death, change in eligibility status or persons moving from one board area to another. A certain proportion were removed due to being duplicates or expired records for people over 70 years of age. A total of €60 million was provided in the 2005 Estimates to improve access to primary care by providing for up to 30,000 additional persons to become eligible for a medical card and free access to GP visits for up to 200,000 additional persons on low income.Responsibility for the determination of eligibility of applications for medical cards rests by legislation with the chief officer of the relevant area of the Health Service Executive. Decisions are taken based on the income and individual needs of the applicant. This ensures that medical cards are granted to persons for whom the provision of medical services for themselves and their families would prove an undue financial hardship. The executive's area chief officers have the discretion to grant a card on an individual basis, in cases where the income ceiling may be exceeded but where the circumstances of the case warrant such a decision.One of the objectives of the health strategy is to prepare legislation to update and codify the legal framework for eligibility and entitlements in regard to health services. The Department is reviewing the existing legislation on eligibility and entitlement to services with a view to introducing legislation clarifying the position on those issues.I welcome informed comment on health policy and the performance of the health system and the views put forward by the National Economic and Social Forum will be taken into account in the ongoing task of policy evaluation and future planning.

The forum, a multidisciplinary group of experts in cancer care, has conducted an extensive consultation process with professional bodies, voluntary organisations and the general public. In developing an organisational model for the delivery of cancer treatment services, the forum's considerations have been informed by the broad strategic context in which the cancer strategy exists, a review of the current status of cancer care, a review of the literature evidence concerning key aspects of the organisation of cancer services and a review of international models of care.The forum concluded that the fragmented arrangements for the delivery of cancer services cannot be recommended to deliver best quality cancer care. Cancer care is a dynamic process involving the interaction of many different elements of the health system. Although they are often considered separately, the overall quality and performance of services as delivered to patients depends in a significant way on how well each of these elements integrate and co-ordinate with each other. They must be planned and organised in a manner which facilitates integration so that, from the perspective of the user, the system operates in a complementary and efficient manner.The new strategy will have regard to the multifaceted aspects of cancer control. The key priority in the development of improved cancer care is that cancer patients will have access to multidisciplinary care to ensure optimum treatment and best outcomes in line with international best practice. The strategy will set out the key priorities for the development of cancer services over the coming years and will make recommendations on health promotion, screening and early detection, cancer treatment services, genetics, supportive care, research and survivorship. This is especially important as more people are living longer with cancer than in previous years.Oncology services nationally have developed and expanded significantly in recent years. The key goal of the national cancer strategy 1996 was to achieve a 15% decrease in mortality from cancer in the under 65 year age group in the ten year period from 1994. An external evaluation of the extent to which the objectives of the national cancer strategy 1996 have been met demonstrated that this figure was achieved in 2001, which was three years ahead of target. The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients nationally.

A vaccine uptake rate of 95% is required to protect children from the diseases concerned and to stop the spread of the diseases in the community.Mumps data provided by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the Health Service Executive, formerly the National Disease Surveillance Centre, indicate that 68 mumps cases were reported for the first four weeks of 2005, that is, up until 29 January 2005. Two cases were reported for the same period in 2004. There has been increased mumps activity throughout the country since October 2004.A number of educational institutions in the country have reported mumps outbreaks/mumps cases among students and some staff. Public health staff are working closely with college health services to provide information and advice on how to prevent mumps and, in some colleges, have administered vaccine to those most at risk of infection. Students in colleges where outbreaks are occurring are being recommended MMR vaccine if they have not already received at least two doses of MMR vaccine. In other colleges, where sporadic cases have occurred, MMR vaccine has been offered to contacts of the cases.I take this opportunity to again urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.

The board is a broadly representative body. The 29 members include 17 elected by nurses who are representative of all the divisions of the register.In November 2004, the board approved a number of changes to the nurses rules, including the following amended rule relating to admission requirements for nurses wishing to train in public health nursing:Before admission to the programme for education and training leading to registration in the Public Health Nurses Division of the Register, the name of the candidate for the registration must already be entered in the Register of Nurses and the candidate must have two years clinical experience in nursing. Unless the candidate's name is entered in the Midwives Division of the Register, the candidate must complete an An Bord Altranais approved module or unit of study on Maternal and Child Health as part of the programme.I understand that in framing this rule change the board was mindful of recommendation 8.30 of the report of the commission on nursing which recommended dropping the mandatory requirement for a midwifery qualification for those wishing to train as public health nurses. My approval is required under section 26 of the Nurses Act 1985 and these rules were formally approved by me in December 2004 as soon as they were submitted by the board.

Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for orthodontic services.The chief officers of the HSE areas have provided the following information for category A and category B orthodontic patients:DateNumbers in Treatment31/12/0423,57231/12/0321,08331/12/0220,15131/12/0117,29530/09/0015,03931/05/99*14,209*Although the Deputy has requested figures on orthodontic services in the past seven years, national figures are only available from May 1999 and complete records are only available from September 2000.Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients.The number of cases treated is dependent on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in the area and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list. In fact, the provision of orthodontic services is currently restricted due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients and, accordingly, HSE areas do not normally maintain category C waiting lists.My Department has taken steps to address the shortage of trained staff and improve orthodontic services through the grade of specialist in orthodontics. Six dentists successfully completed their three year specialist in orthodontics training and commenced work in the HSE in October 2004 and a further 13 are currently in training.Patients in treatment in the health board orthodontic service receive between 18 and 24 appointments over the course of their treatment period of approximately two years. The table above shows that at the end of the December 2004 quarter 23,572 patients were undergoing orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This represents a 66% increase on the numbers in treatment in May 1999 and means that currently there are more than twice as many patients undergoing orthodontic treatment as there are patients awaiting treatment.

However, in order to improve recruitment and retention prospects, my Department has put in place a number of important initiatives to meet the human resource needs of the health services.Specific human resources initiatives in key areas such as pay rates, improvements in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional and career development have and will play a part in increasing staffing levels. Overseas recruitment by health agencies has, over recent years, also contributed significantly to meeting the workforce needs of the health services, particularly in the medical, surgical and nursing professions.There is a wide variation in the numbers of nurses employed in the health services of developed countries. Figures on a consistent basis are not readily available for cross country comparisons. Research by the OECD, OECD Health Data 2004, 1st Edition, in which the most recent comprehensive comparison between European countries was 2002, suggests that Ireland has one of the higher ratios, although countries profile their data in different ways.The Irish health care system has traditionally been based on a large number of nurses. Other European countries tend to have systems where there is greater skill mix and grade mix involved in the delivery of health care services; therefore the ratio of nurses to patients is lower. The Irish health service is also moving in this direction and in coming years there will be a higher proportion of support workers, including health care assistants, involved in the delivery of care, freeing up nurses and midwives to concentrate more of their time on higher level duties and expanding the scope of their practice.Nurse recruitment is a priority for the Government. The HSE reported that in the year ending 30 September 2004 an additional 561 nurses were employed in the health service and since 1997 over 6,300 additional nurses have been recruited.The Department of Health and Children has made substantial investment in consultant numbers in recent years. The current number of permanent consultant posts stands at 1,947. The OECD does not collate statistics specifically relating to consultants but does, however, provide statistics under the heading of physicians which encompasses any doctor who is fully registered with the Irish Medical Council. In 2002, Ireland had 2.4 physicians per 1,000 population — OECD Health Data 2004, 1st Edition. Government policy is to substantially increase the number of consultants throughout the next decade. There are currently 4,034 non-consultant hospital doctors training posts in Ireland, the occupants of which are given the opportunity of proper skills development on the basis that many in this category will become the consultants of tomorrow.According to the Irish College of General Practitioners there are approximately 2,600 GPs working in Ireland. According to the GMS payments board annual report of 2003, 2,181 of these hold a GMS or other public contract. My Department has been in consultation with the Irish College of General Practitioners and the HSE on the subject of addressing future manpower needs in general practice. In this regard, it was agreed that the number of trainees should increase by a total of 66 in order to conform with the recommendations of the Irish College of General Practitioners. This will be achieved on a phased basis over a three year period.Given the large numbers of staff employed and the unique nature of the services being delivered, a coherent, strategic approach to workforce and human resource planning needs to be developed further. This should be aligned closely with strategic objectives and the service planning process. Planning for the development of new and existing services in the future must be soundly based on a robust and realistic assessment of the skill and human resource needs to deliver these services.Enhanced skills mix by matching skills to service needs benefits patients and empowers health personnel to reach their full potential. This optimises their contribution to quality care. The continued implementation of the "Action Plan for People Management" has a crucial role to play in improving retention and reducing the turnover of skilled staff. The Health Service Executive will be centrally involved in the development of an integrated workforce planning strategy for the health sector.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	469	In the most recent Health Service Employers Agency survey on nursing resources, employers reported that 794 vacancies existed at 30 September 2004. The vacancy rate now stands at 2.34%. This could be considered to be a normal frictional rate, given that there will always be some level of movement due to resignations, retirements and nurses availing of opportunities to change employment and locations. There were 33,739 whole time equivalent nurses employed in the public health service at the end of September 2004. This is an increase of almost 6,400 or 23% on the 1997 figure of 27,347 nurses, wte.The recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of nursing staff has been a concern of this Government for some time. A number of substantial measures have been introduced in recent years. The number of nursing training places has been increased by 70% since 1998 to 1,640 from 2002 onwards. In excess of €90 million revenue funding is being provided in 2005 for undergraduate nurse training. Nursing continues to be regarded as an attractive career. There were 8,300 CAO applications for 1,640 places in the autumn 2004 intake.A comprehensive range of financial supports has been introduced to support nurses in pursuing part-time degrees and specialist courses, including "back to practice" courses. Since 1998, nurses have been paid for overtime. Previously they had been given time off in lieu and the introduction of payment represents a further significant financial incentive for nurses. My Department introduced a scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in February 2001. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent, part-time basis.The promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, has been substantially improved on foot of the recommendations of the commission on nursing and the 1999 nurses' pay settlement. The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery has been especially active in this area and, to date, over 1,600 clinical nurse specialist and advanced nurse practitioner posts have been created.I am confident that the extensive range of measures I have outlined, including the substantial increase in training places, the recruitment of overseas nurses, the more effective utilisation of the professional skills of nurses and midwives, in addition to close monitoring and assessment of the situation on an ongoing basis, will continue to prove effective in addressing the nursing workforce needs of the health services.

I have had several meetings with the organisations representing consultants. I have also held meetings with the Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society.The MDU has been involved in protracted discussions with representatives of my Department and their legal and insurance advisers on a possible agreement on the financing of claims which precede the establishment of the clinical indemnity scheme. These have been in progress for almost twelve months. Some progress had been made in recent weeks on key elements of the agreement, including the conduct of a due diligence examination of the MDU's financial position. However, the MDU abruptly terminated this entire process at the end of last week.I believe that the MDU has treated its Irish members very badly in leaving them without indemnity cover. I am not aware that it is taking similar action with any of its UK members, whether GPs or consultants. I will ask my Department and the State's legal advisers to explore what options are open to individual consultants and the State to seek redress through the courts.

Those qualifying under the scheme will be paid up to €2,000 if they have already paid up to that amount by way of charges. Where persons have been charged anything less than €2000, they will be refunded the amount they have paid.The scheme does not apply in the case of persons who were in long stay care in the institutions in question but who died before 9 December 2004. If, however, individuals concerned died on or after this date, payments will be made to the executor or person who has taken out the grant of administration in respect of the individual who has died.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	479	The requirements regarding information that must be provided by insurance undertakings to holders of life assurance policies are laid down in Part IIIA of the Insurance Act 1989 and in the Life Assurance (Provision of Information) Regulations 2001 made under that Part of the Act by the then Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The requirements in part reflect obligations laid down in EU Directive 92/96/EEC. The purpose of the requirements is to provide policyholders with relevant information about their policies.I am informed by the financial regulator that it is unaware of complaints being made about the manner in which the regulatory requirements are being implemented by insurance companies and has not been requested to make any changes to these requirements. However, the regulator will shortly commence a public consultation process on a unified and harmonised code of conduct for all financial service providers and the issue of communication with investment policyholders on an annual basis will be addressed in this document.Should it appear to the regulator that changes are necessary in order to better protect consumers, the regulator has power under the Act to make additional regulations. This follows from amendments made to the Act by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003, which transferred responsibility for insurance issues from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the regulator.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	480	The NTMA has no role in calculating the value of the unclaimed policy, the proceeds of which are transferred to the dormant accounts fund.Under the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003, where a claim is made in respect of such a policy the insurance undertaking concerned establishes the identity of the policyholder, gives a written notice to the NTMA of the net encashment value of the unclaimed policy and sends a copy of this notice to the policyholder. On receipt of the notified amount from the NTMA, the insurance undertaking settles with the policyholder.For the purposes of the claim procedure the policyholder includes all persons with a legitimate claim on the policy and the net encashment value is the amount payable to the policyholder by the insurance undertaking, including interest, under the terms of the policy at the time when the policy holder makes a claim.Under the Act, the policy is treated as unclaimed if, in the case of a fixed term policy, the specified term has expired, if an amount would be payable if the policyholder were to make a claim and if the insurance undertaking has received no communication from the policyholder for a period of at least five years. In the case of a policy which does not have a specified term, these conditions are met only when a period of 15 years has elapsed without any communication from the policyholder. The Act also sets out procedures for notification of the holders of dormant policies before the transfer is to be made. The amount to be transferred to the fund is the net encashment value of the unclaimed policies at the time of transfer as established by the insurance undertaking.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 156 together.As the Deputies will be aware, over the past number of years the Government has considered carefully the whole area of child care. It has been decided as a matter of policy that child benefit will be the main instrument through which support will be provided to parents with children. One of the main benefits from this approach is that, whereas tax relief would be of little or no benefit to those with low incomes, the provision of support for parents through the child benefit route means equality of treatment for all recipients.In line with this policy approach, the Government has substantially increased child benefit since coming into office in 1997. Overall expenditure on child benefit has increased by 279%, from €506 million in 1997 to an estimated €1,916 million in 2005.To address the availability of services, the supply of formal child care places is being stimulated through a programme of investment under the national development plan equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP. The EOCP funds capital development to increase places, support staffing costs for facilities targeting disadvantage and improve child care quality. Over the next five years, 2005-09, the capital envelope for the planned programme of continued investment in child care facilities will be €313 million, which is expected to create about 17,000 places — some 3,400 per annum for each of the next five years. The 2005 allocation for the EOCP provides €83.4 million, of which €43.8 million is current and €39.6 million is capital funding.The Government has also undertaken measures to favour the supply of child care by tax incentives to set up facilities and relief from benefit-in-kind taxation for free or subsidised child care where this is provided by employers. Taken together, these represent substantial measures to assist with the cost of child care and I have no plans to introduce additional measures at this time.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that figures are not available to estimate with any accuracy the cost of introducing tax relief at the standard rate of tax for child care expenses. However, it is tentatively estimated that if a tax credit of €1,200 per child, that is, the equivalent of an allowance of €6,000 at the standard rate of tax, was introduced for all children under six years of age, the cost to the Exchequer would be in the region of €223 million in a full year. If the tax credit was confined to children where both parents are working and to children of single and widowed parents who are working, the cost would be in the region of €161 million in a full year.The numbers of taxpayers likely to benefit from such measures are estimated at 140,890 and 102,145, respectively. It is not possible to estimate the likely offset due to child care activities moving into the formal taxable economy.

It also conferred on the agency responsibility for, inter alia, the development and licensing of aquaculture in the Foyle and Carlingford areas and provided that legislation would be brought forward for this purpose.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that over the last number of months officials from this Department have been engaged in an intensive series of meetings with Northern colleagues, the Loughs Agency, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and that substantial progress has been made in advancing the Bill.At the outset of these discussions, a wide range of issues requiring resolution was identified. Substantial progress has been made in reaching agreement on most of the points and I am pleased to say that only a few issues remain outstanding.While I appreciate that previous indications were that I expected to publish the Bill before now, I am sure the Deputy will nevertheless agree that, given the complexity of the task assigned to them, it is important that the officials be allowed the necessary time to deliver a draft which fully and comprehensively addresses all the issues. I have asked this Department to continue to work very closely with all parties concerned and to ensure, however, that there is no undue delay in the process.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	485	My Department has given consent to construct the pipeline. This is essentially permission in principle to proceed with the design process for the pipeline, including the onshore 9 km section. This, in turn, is followed at the installation stage by the issue by my Department of "consents to install" for the various phases of pipelaying. This stage addresses all technical issues including methodology, design, trench depth and so forth. Consent to install was given in 2002 for the landfall section of the pipeline and some site preparation work for the onshore section.The design of the onshore pipeline is in accordance with international design codes. To this end, my Department commissioned an independent expert to evaluate the onshore pipeline design code. The study addressed design methodology, operating conditions, pipeline corrosion, public safety, welding and testing, pipeline material quality and protection from interference. The recommendations of this evaluation indicated that the design code has been selected in accordance with best public safety considerations and is appropriate for the pipeline operating conditions. Subject to the developers undertaking to comply with a numbers of conditions laid down in the then Minister's approval and consents, the design is generally in accordance with best national and international industry practice and the pipeline is considered to meet public safety requirements.The pipeline proposals were for a capacity of 375 bar. The maximum capacity which will be used is 150 bar at initial production, reducing substantially over the life of the field. The capacity of 375 bar was allowed for the purpose of providing the best emergency responses in the unlikely event of emergencies arising with the transportation of the gas from the field to the terminal.In addition, a quantified risk assessment has been undertaken for the onshore section of the pipeline which included a detailed analysis of the risk of damage to the pipeline and consequences of any such damage. This showed that even in the worst case of the pipeline being ruptured and the gas being ignited, the occupants of a building 70 metres away would be safe. The design of the pipeline means that the risk of such an event or any other type of gas escape is infinitesimally small.

As the Deputy will be aware, drift net salmon fishing around the coast is now confined to a two month period in June and July each year on a four day week basis.I am advised by the regional fisheries boards that it is normal practice to issue drift net licences, upon payment of the appropriate licence fee by the successful applicants, a couple of weeks before the start of each season. I am assured by the boards that the drift net licences for 2005 will be issued, as in previous years, in good time before the start of the season which is due to commence on 1 June this year.

In July 2002 the Department requested all coastal local authorities to submit proposals, in order of priority, for consideration in the context of the 2003 to 2006 national coast protection programmes. Waterford County Council submitted proposals in respect of ten locations in the county at an estimated cost of €5.14 million. In addition, Dungarvan Town Council submitted one proposal with an estimated cost of €210,000. In 2004, the Department provided funding of €70,902.76 to Waterford County Council towards emergency works and a diving survey at Helvick.The Exchequer funding available to the Department in 2005 for coast protection works is €2.8 million for the entire country and the allocation of this funding is under consideration at present.

Discussions towards this end have taken place within the coordinated local aquaculture management system, CLAMS, plan for the harbour and it is understood that detailed proposals will be circulated shortly.While the Department does not have any new applications for licences in Ardgroom on hand, any such application would be considered on its merits. In assessing the scope for additional activity within the harbour, account would be taken of a number of factors including carrying capacity, navigational safety and visual impacts.

The Garda Commissioner, Noel Conroy, and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, Hugh Orde, also participated in part of the discussions and provided the Governments with a security briefing on recent events.The meeting also provided an opportunity to consider possible options for political progress and, in this context, we discussed various proposals received from the political parties. Both Governments are in agreement that any political way forward must be consistent with the fundamental principles of the Good Friday Agreement and capable of attracting broad cross-community support. Following the meeting, the Taoiseach highlighted the key concern of the two Governments, when he said, "the reality of the situation is that until we get an end to criminality, and an end to decommissioning, then we cannot win the trust and confidence of the parties to be able to move forward". Progress in the near term is not possible without absolute clarity and certainty on these issues, which are at the heart of the present impasse.After the meeting, the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair restated their firm commitment to advancing the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, as endorsed by the people of this island. Both Governments are determined that current difficulties should not be allowed to jeopardise the significant progress made in recent years, particularly in the vital areas of policing and North/South co-operation. The Secretary of State and I will co-chair a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Dublin in the coming weeks with a view to giving renewed momentum to the process of implementation.

These experts are drawn from all stakeholders in the area. The first report of the review group in 2002 mapped out a strategy for the simplification, restructuring, modernisation and consolidation of company law in Ireland. In July 2002, the Government approved the recommendations in that report and drafting of the general scheme of a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the review group has been in train since.A further report of the review group, expanding on some of its earlier recommendations and considering in detail a number of specific areas of company law such as liquidations, followed in 2004. These recommendations will also be incorporated in the general scheme currently being drafted. The expectation is that the general scheme should come to Government for approval later this year. Drafting of the heads of the general scheme has been an inclusive project throughout, with the expertise of the review group assisting the Department in that task on an ongoing basis. The review group will be assigned a new two yearly programme of issues for consideration in January 2006.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	499	The information the Deputy requires is contained in Table 1 and Table 2. In the aftermath of EU enlargement, it is Government policy that employers should be able to source nearly all of their workforce needs from within the EU. Accordingly, only in cases where exceptional levels of skill and qualifications are needed for the job, and the employer has made meaningful attempts to find EEA nationals first, will my Department now consider work permit applications. Subject to an employer applying to renew a work permit, applications will be granted on the basis that the conditions set out in the original permit application are adhered to.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	500	I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 175 together.A work permit is granted to an employer in respect of a specified employee and job vacancy, where the employer can demonstrate that the vacancy cannot be filled from within the wider European Economic Area, EEA. The EEA comprises the 25 member states of the EU, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.Apart from the renewal of existing permits, which now constitute the bulk of applications, new permits are confined to highly skilled and highly paid positions. Present policy is informed by the imperative to address the identified labour and skill needs in the economy. In order to best achieve these ends, the work permit is granted to the employer. This ensures greater traceability, the more effective enforcement of the employees' rights and enhanced administrative efficiency.The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including migrant workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual/s concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.An application for a work permit requires a statement, counter signed by the would-be employer and employee, of the main functions of the job, salary-wages, deductions — other than statutory, other benefits and hours to be worked per week. Work permits are not granted unless there is compliance with minimum wage legislation. Applications for renewals require documentary proof that the stated wages have been paid.Persons employed in Ireland under the work permit scheme in recent years have been readily facilitated in changing jobs. In such circumstances a new work permit is issued to the person's new employer. This allows an employee to move to a new employer where there are genuine reasons for the employee wishing to leave his/her existing employment.A new employment permits Bill, currently at the final stages of preparation, will include provision for additional protections for migrant workers. It is intended that employers will be prohibited from deducting from the remuneration of migrant workers any costs associated with their recruitment and the retention by employers of personal documents belonging to migrant workers.If the Deputy has evidence that particular employers are exploiting their workforce this should be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation.

The function of the boards is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity at local level. The boards provide a single point of contact at local level for new and established small businesses. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, enterprises may qualify for support from the CEBs in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants. In addition, the CEBs deliver a comprehensive range of development and support programmes designed to help, new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.I suggest that the person concerned should, in the first instance, make direct contact with Kildare County Enterprise Board, the Woods, Clane, County Kildare, Tel.

The ceiling, which applied only to new claims after that date, is currently €12,697.38 a year gross earnings. Where earnings are in excess of this amount, there may be entitlement to a continued payment at a reduced rate up to maximum earnings of €17,776.33 a year gross.The person concerned was awarded deserted wife's benefit from 1 April 1993. She subsequently took up employment under her name prior to marriage and using a different personal public service number but failed to notify my Department of her earnings. This only came to light in March 2003, following inspection of her employer carried out by an officer of my Department.On foot of this information, the person concerned was written to and afforded 21 days to respond. Having failed to receive a reply, a formal decision issued to her on 10 February 2004 informing her of the termination of her claim and a resulting overpayment of €18,747.94. She was given 21 days to appeal the decision, which she failed to do.The person concerned subsequently contacted my Department by phone querying the stopping of her payment. It transpired that she had not received any of the aforementioned correspondence as she had changed address and had not notified my Department of this event. Copies of the original correspondence and decision letter were re-issued to her at her new address and she was again afforded the opportunity to appeal the decision but no appeal was lodged by her.In all cases, there is an onus on people to notify my Department of the fact that their earnings have increased or where there is a change of address. Claimants are advised of this when the payment is initially awarded. Notice of this is also included on the payable order book, the payment method chosen by the person concerned in this instance.My Department recently issued a reminder to the person concerned with regard to her obligation to put arrangements in place to repay the overpayment which is still outstanding as a debt due to be repaid to the State.Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

No substantial changes have been made in these arrangements in recent years.From January 2000, home helps were successful in securing equivalent status to non-nursing employees in the health service and are broadly in line with rates for equivalent health service staff. It is understood that these new pay rates also apply to the various agencies contracted by the HSE to provide home help services.Home helps employed directly by the HSE now have full employee status, with all the rights of other health service employees, including annual leave, premia payments and mileage allowances.The treatment of earnings from employment as home help vis-à-vis earnings from other insurable employment for social welfare purposes is under review within my Department.

Based on the information supplied in his application regarding his job seeking efforts, a deciding officer disallowed his claim on the grounds that he is not available for or genuinely seeking work. It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision to the social welfare appeals office and a form for this purpose was issued to him on 7 February 2005.Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

To qualify for participation in the back to education scheme, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a period of at least 12 months immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study.The person concerned does not satisfy the eligibility criteria for participation in the back to education allowance scheme. Consequently, as a full-time student she has no entitlement to rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.

The accommodation needs of people in these circumstances are provided for through the system of direct provision operated by the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.The Dublin and mid-Leinster region of the Health Service Executive has advised that the application for rent supplement was refused on the grounds that the family in respect of whom the application was made includes a person seeking asylum who arrived in the State after 27 May 2003. The family was unsuccessful in appealing against this decision. The executive has further advised that it informed the family that their accommodation needs fall to be catered for through the direct provision service operated by the Reception and Integration Agency.I understand that the family has applied recently to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for permission to remain in the State on the basis of having an Irish born child. The question of their entitlement to rent supplement can be reviewed if necessary depending on the outcome of this application.

The application form which he completed concludes with a declaration that the information given is complete and accurate and that the applicant undertakes to advise of any changes in circumstances, including income levels.As the Deputy is aware from my previous replies regarding this case, the overpayment of diet supplement occurred owing to the failure of the person concerned to notify the community welfare officer that he had commenced employment. The Health Service Executive is obliged to seek to recover any overpayment of supplementary welfare allowances, which scheme it administers through the community welfare service on my behalf. Arrangements for recoupment of the diet supplement overpayment in question is a matter for resolution between the executive and the person concerned and I have no function in this regard.In the opinion of the officers dealing with this case, recoupment of the overpayment by instalments of €10 per week is reasonable and will not cause hardship to the person concerned in view of his financial situation. His income comprises full rate invalidity pension and his earnings from part-time employment.The person concerned has been assisted previously in respect of outstanding funeral expenses by way of a supplementary welfare exceptional needs payment.

It is estimated that the allowance will cost the Department €102.26 million in 2005.The allowance covers the normal standing charges, urban or rural domestic, the public service obligation levy and 300 units of electricity per two monthly bill. The related VAT at 13.5% is also covered. Customers can carry a maximum of 900 unused units forward on their bill.My Department has made a number of changes to the electricity allowance over the past four years. In 2002, the number of free units was increased to 1800 units per annum from 1500 and this applied from February of that year. From April 2004 the number of units applying to each of the six two monthly bills was set at 300 per bill. Until then 250 units applied to the three summer bills and 350 applied to the three winter bills. At the same time, the number of unused units which could be carried forward increased from 600 to 900.To date, the Department has met all ESB increases in full, including the two most recent in October and January last which amounted to a total increase of 12.6%. From January 2005 the cost of a domestic unit of electricity is 12.20 cent and the Department pays this in respect of the 1,800 free units per annum.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I propose to answer Question Nos. 185 and 186 together.The published annual reports and accounts of Aer Rianta, now Dublin Airport Authority, for the years 1990 to 2003 are available in the Oireachtas Library. Throughout that period, Shannon Airport was a business unit within the group and there was no requirement to publish separate financial accounts for the airport. I am not, therefore, in a position to give the detailed breakdown requested by the Deputy.With regard to the business planning process for Shannon Airport, I refer the Deputy to my reply of last week to his Question No. 132 on 3 February 2005.The new Shannon Airport Authority was incorporated in September 2004 and, in line with the framework provided by the State Airports Act 2004, it is envisaged that the new authority would, in due course, own and operate Shannon Airport. In accordance with the 2004 Act, each of the new airport authorities, including the Shannon Airport Authority, is required to prepare a comprehensive business plan for their airport and this work is currently ongoing. The formulation of these business plans will be a key aspect of achieving operational and financial readiness on which both I and the Minister for Finance must be satisfied before the assets of Shannon and Cork airports are vested in the new airport authorities.Among the measures required for the future development of Shannon Airport on a successful and sustainable basis in an increasingly competitive environment are traffic growth and the need to address the airport's cost base. It has been recognised for some time that costs in Shannon are high relative to comparable airports. Under the overall stewardship of the Dublin Airport Authority the Shannon Airport Authority is seeking to address this issue in consultation with union representatives.I am confident that the new boards of the three airport authorities will successfully meet the challenges ahead.

Bus Átha Cliath received an Exchequer capital grant of €743,000 in 2004 for the purchase of on-bus closed circuit cameras, CCTV. A major objective of installing the CCTV was to reduce anti-social activity on the company's buses.The National Roads Authority has provided funds to some local authorities for specific additional safety measures on sections of the national roads network, for example, on the M50, where stone throwing incidents have occurred from the over bridges.

In respect of three animals slaughtered in December 2004, the 60% advance payment in the amount of €144.00 was processed for issuing on 1 February 2005. However, these moneys were offset against an overpayment that occurred on the area based compensatory allowance scheme.The EU slaughter premium scheme ceased on 31 December 2004 with the introduction of the new single payment scheme on 1 January 2005. Therefore, slaughter premium will not be payable to the person named in respect of four cows slaughtered in January 2005.

There is, however, one area for which the Department is responsible which does impinge on addressing one particular type of anti-social behaviour. This is the provision by my Department of grant assistance to local authorities towards the cost of implementing the provisions of the Control of Horses Act 1996. This legislation was enacted to deal with the problem of wandering horses, particularly in urban areas. In the context of implementing the Act, a number of local authorities have supported horse projects designed to equip young people with horse management skills in particular and to support the development of life skills in general.My Department has to date provided financial support towards such projects to a total to date of €4.178 million. The amount involved in 2004 was €50,000. The provision in the Vote for the Department of Agriculture and Food 2005 for expenditure on implementation of the Act is €1.7 million, which would encompass any expenditure on projects of the kind described.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	518	Implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland submitted an action programme for the further implementation of the directive to the European Commission on 22 October 2004.The likely impacts of the nitrates directive on the various sectors in agriculture were considered at length when the action programme was being devised. The process included two periods of public consultation during which various interested parties made valuable input. An independent adviser, Mr. Denis Brosnan, was appointed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to review the written comments and to report to the Minister with his recommendations. Mr. Brosnan's recommendations were reflected in the action programme.I am aware that some of the requirements of the action programme submitted to the European Commission, such as those relating to the storage and management of organic manures, have given rise to concern among some farmers and, in particular, among intensive producers such as those in the poultry sector. My Department has already made a number of improvements to its schemes in order to assist farmers in meeting their obligations under the nitrates directive. Mr. Brosnan's report recommended some additional changes to schemes, including the possibility of increased funding for the farm waste management scheme, together with its extension to other sectors such as the poultry sector. No decisions have been taken on these points.In parallel with the action programme, Ireland also submitted a derogation proposal to the European Commission setting out a scientific justification for operating levels of up to 250 kg organic nitrogen per hectare, based on the specific characteristics of Irish agriculture. The derogation proposals are also designed, inter alia, to ensure that outlets remain for the utilisation of organic manure produced by intensive farm enterprises. The final details of any such derogation provision will be the subject of negotiations with the Commission, which has indicated that it will consider the matter only when an acceptable action programme is agreed and in place.My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government over the coming months to reach agreement with the European Commission on the implementation of the nitrates directive in a manner that will minimise the burden of compliance on farmers generally and ensure that the future of Ireland's commercial agriculture sector is safeguarded.

While it is not a State body, and it has not heretofore been considered to be within the ambit of the Freedom of Information Acts, it does receive a significant proportion of its income from my Department.

The average processing time for such applications is currently 24 months. As outlined in the previous parliamentary question relating to this matter, which was answered on 2 November, cases are normally dealt with in chronological order and this practice would not be deviated from except in exceptional circumstances.I have been informed by my officials that there is no record of receipt of the correspondence detailed by the Deputy.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	525	As indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 317 of 2 February 2005, to attempt to compile this material would entail examination of a large number of records in each institution going back over the last three years. This research would be a very staff intensive exercise and, in the current climate, I am not in a position to recommend that governors divert staff from other duties or to incur additional costs through overtime in order to compile these data.As the Deputy is aware, I am determined to restructure prison costs and working arrangements to ensure that more resources — staff and finance — are available in the interest of greater efficiency. Negotiations are underway with the Prison Officers' Association on proposals aimed at achieving this objective. In the interim, as the Deputy may be aware, the Irish Prison Service has succeeded in achieving major cuts in expenditure in the last year. However, these cuts cannot be achieved without some effect on services, including compilation of statistics.I have asked the director general of the Irish Prison Service to ensure that, when the prison costs issue has been resolved, a standard approach be adopted throughout the prisons to statistical reporting of contraband, including seizure of drugs.

The personnel strength of Glanmire Garda station, all ranks, as at 1 January 1998 was 14. This represents an increase of four, 28.5%, in the number of personnel allocated to Glanmire Garda station.Glanmire Garda station is open to the public from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday to Saturday. It is also open from 12 noon to 1p.m. on Sunday. The operational hours of Glanmire Garda station are from 8 a.m. to 6 a.m. — 22 hour service. Calls between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. are answered by the district patrol car attached to Cobh Garda station. I am further informed that the extension of the opening hours at Glanmire would only serve to confine additional personnel to indoor duties, who, in the view of the Garda authorities, would be deployed more usefully on the beat.In relation to Garda resources generally, I am, of course, very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.The commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Glanmire Garda station will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. Clearly, of course, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front line, operational, high visibility policing. They will have a real impact.

However, as with any new station, construction depends on a number of factors, including the availability of financial and other resources and priorities within the Garda building programme.

A non-EEA spouse of an Irish national who is a citizen of a visa required country must be in possession of a valid visa each time they wish to enter or re-enter the State. The coming into force of the Immigration and Citizenship Act 2001, details of which are available on the Department's web site www.justice.ie, abolished the previous system of post-nuptial citizenship.A non-EEA spouse of an Irish national who is in the State may make an application to the immigration division of my Department for permission to remain in the State on that basis. In order to prevent abuses of the system, in so far as is possible and without unduly interfering with the Irish citizen's private circumstances, the immigration division will seek to establish various matters. These include the context in which the marriage took place, the validity of the marriage and whether the couple are residing in a family unit. This may involve requesting supporting documentation as evidence of the relationship or an interview by the immigration authorities of either or both parties. If permission to reside is granted to a non-EU national on the basis of marriage to an Irish national then the non-national concerned will be able to reside in the State and work without the requirement of a work permit.The immigration division of my Department has growing experience of marriages being entered into for the sole purpose of enabling the non-national in question gain entry to the State. Frequently in these circumstances the Irish national may be totally unaware that this is the intention of the non-national and will feel aggrieved by the perception that the immigration authorities are interfering with their private life in refusing to allow their spouse to enter or remain in the State.

Two types of processing caseloads exist in the ORAC and the RAT, namely, applications which are prioritised on foot of a ministerial prioritisation direction made under section 12 of the Refugee Act 1996 and cases in respect of which such a direction does not exist.With regard to processing timescales for prioritised asylum applications, on 24 January 2005 I announced new arrangements for the speedier processing of such applications which were implemented with effect from 25 January. The new arrangements apply in the main to nationals of Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and South Africa. In 2004, these applications comprised 47% of all applications. These new arrangements include the reduction of processing timescales both at the initial stage in ORAC from six weeks to around three weeks and for appeal determinations in RAT from an average of five weeks to three weeks.For other cases, the typical processing time in the ORAC is in the region of six months. The average length of time taken to process and complete substantive appeals in the RAT is approximately 16 weeks and appeals which are determined on the basis of papers alone are completed in five to six weeks.Work is ongoing in the ORAC and RAT with a view to further speeding up processing times for asylum applications. It should be noted, however, that the extent to which any period can be abridged is dictated in part by the necessity to allow an applicant a reasonable period in which to set out his or her claim in full. These safeguards are underpinned by the Refugee Act 1996. Also, a range of factors can add to the complexity of cases, notably where a case requires more than one interview or the applicant is unable to attend an interview or hearing for valid medical reasons.Following significant additional investment in the asylum determination process over the past four years, considerable progress has been made in processing asylum applications in the timescales involved. This is evidenced, for example, by the fact that the number of cases more than six months old in the ORAC and the RAT stood at 1,057 on 31 January 2005, as compared to a figure of approximately 6,500 at the end of September 2001.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	548	The Department of Education and Science supports a number of programmes aimed at addressing educational disadvantage and which assist in countering anti-social behaviour.The young peoples facilities and services fund, YPFSF, is a programme that targets those young people most at risk from substance misuse in disadvantaged areas. In developing youth, sport and other recreational facilities, the YPFSF seeks to attract at risk young people away from the potential dangers of substance misuse, into safe, non-threatening and constructive environments. My Department is responsible for funding projects mainstreamed under round one of the YPFSF. An amount of €6.574 million was expended in 2004 on 80 projects in the four VEC areas of city of Dublin, County Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and Cork city. An amount of €6.985 million is available for expenditure on these projects in 2005.Under the national drugs strategy, my Department and the Department of Health and Children developed guidelines to assist schools in the formulation of a drugs policy and to ensure that all schools had drugs policies in place. The policy is intended to address education concerning alcohol, tobacco and drugs and the procedures for managing incidents relating to these substances. Expenditure in 2004 by the local drugs task forces was €3.092 million. The budget for 2005 is €3.286 million.The special projects for disadvantaged youth scheme makes grant-in-aid available to organisations and groups for specific projects which seek to address the needs of young people who are disadvantaged due to factors such as youth unemployment, dependence on social welfare or unemployment assistance and social isolation. These projects are administered at local level by the vocational education authorities and national youth organisations such as Foróige and the National Youth Federation. There are currently 167 projects in receipt of funding under this scheme and the 2004 allocation was €13.5 million. Allocations for 2005 have not yet been finalised.A fund exists for the development of targeted educational responses to certain children at risk. The target group is children from pre-school age to 18 years old, including young people at risk of early school leaving, becoming involved in anti-social behaviour, crime, prostitution and so forth. Some 30 projects were funded in 2004 supporting a range of community based projects for at-risk children. The allocation of €1.27 million is constant.There are five residential schools for young offenders under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science providing residential care, education and rehabilitation for children generally up to age 16 years referred by the courts. The expenditure on operational costs in 2004 was €28.5 million. The 2005 provision is €34.7 million. Secure care and high support units provide residential care for children who are at risk and in need of care and protection and who require an education service in a secure and therapeutic environment. The Department of Education and Science has responsibility to provide education services for these children. The cost of the teaching provision in 2004 was approximately €1.5 million and is estimated to be €1.6 million in 2005.There are five youth encounter projects which were established to provide educational facilities for children who had become alienated from the conventional school system, were persistent truants and had become involved in, or were at risk of becoming involved in, minor crime and delinquency. The expenditure costs for 2004 was €2.2 million. The provision for 2005 is €2.4 million.

The allocation for the third level sector was €97.5 million. The 2004 Revised Book of Estimates reflected increased funding which was announced subsequent to the publication of the Abridged Estimates in November 2003.The outturn for primary and post-primary was €352.7 million, of which primary was €171 million; post-primary was €162 million and the primary and post-primary combined allocation for schools ICT was €19.7 million. The third level outturn was €96.6 million. My Department carried forward €50 million which is being allocated for use in the primary and post-primary sectors in 2005.

Teachers with restricted recognition are qualified to teach in certain categories of special school and classes and as resource teachers. In these contexts, they can apply for permanent positions which entitle them to sick leave, holiday pay and normal salary and pension entitlements.The study referred to by the Deputy was completed some time ago and the outcomes were conveyed to the named college. My Department has not yet received a final application for recognition from that college.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	551	My Department is already supporting the education of individual students with autism in various second level schools throughout the country. Discussions are taking place with the management authorities of a small number of schools with a view to establishing second level provision for groups of children with autism who are now coming to a transition stage and are about to move from primary to second level. Organising such provision is a significant task of the National Council for Special Education.The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003. With effect from 1 January 2005, the NCSE, through local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, will process resource applications for children with special educational needs. Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post-primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support and-or special needs assistant support for the pupil.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I take it that when the Deputy refers to teaching assistants, she is referring to special needs assistants. The Deputy will be aware that with effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs. In particular, it is responsible for the following: deciding on applications for resource teaching hours in respect of children with low incidence disabilities with special educational needs at primary level; deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant, SNA, hours.Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on resource teaching and SNAs, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.The Deputy is also aware that a review of SNA provision in primary schools commenced in September 2004 and is continuing. The review is concerned with the level and deployment of SNA posts in mainstream classes. The intention is to ensure that the level of approved SNA support in schools, and the manner in which that support is being allocated, are such as to ensure that the special care needs of pupils are being appropriately met.For these reasons, the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available. I am, however, satisfied that the establishment of the NCSE will greatly enhance the provision of services to children with special educational needs, SEN, and result in a timely response to schools who have made application for SEN supports. The local service delivery aspect of the council's operation through the SENOs will provide a focal point of contact for parents-guardians and schools and will, I am confident, result in a much improved service for all.

Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post-primary school, it is open to the school to apply for additional teaching support and-or special needs assistant support for the pupil.My Department allocates additional teaching support and special needs assistant support to second level schools and vocational education committees to cater for pupils with special educational needs. Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupil or pupils involved and having regard to a range of factors, including the overall resources available to the school.My Department has approved an allocation of 48.60 hours teaching support per week and 56.0 hours special needs assistant support per week to the school in question to cater for the special educational needs of a number of pupils, including the pupil to whom the Deputy refers. The level of support allocated was determined after detailed consideration of the school's application, the supporting documentation provided and having regard to the overall level of resources already available to the school to address special needs issues.If the school authority is of the view that the existing approved allocation is incapable of addressing the current level of assessed special needs within the school and additional information to that already submitted becomes available, my Department will be prepared to reconsider the case.

All applications for temporary accommodation for the 2005-06 school year are currently being assessed in the school planning section of my Department. I intend to publish a list of the successful applicants shortly. The school referred to by the Deputy has also an application with my Department for a major capital project.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	556	My Department has not received an application for capital funding from either the junior or senior school referred to by the Deputy. However, officials in the school planning section of my Department are reviewing the overall primary educational needs of the area in which both schools are situated.As the Deputy is aware, a new school planning model involving published area development plans is being piloted in five areas over the current school year. Included in the pilot scheme is an overall plan for the north Dublin-east Meath-south Louth area. The need for additional primary facilities in that area will be considered in this context.The purpose of this new approach to school planning is to ensure that, in future, the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process. Arising from this process, an individual plan will set out the blueprint for the future of educational provision in an area, which will be the touchstone against which all decisions on capital investment will be made for the following decade.The draft plan for north Dublin-east Meath-south Louth area is nearing completion in the school planning section of my Department and I hope to be in a position to publish it shortly.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.If an applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	559	On 26 January 2005, my Department approved tender documentation for a branch library at Castleisland and authorised Kerry County Council to proceed to invite tenders for the project. Further advancement of the project is a matter for Kerry County Council.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	560	Article 10(4) of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 sets out an exemption for development consisting of the use of not more than four bedrooms in a house, where each bedroom is used for the accommodation of not more than four persons, as overnight guest accommodation. The exemption does not apply where the development in question would contravene a condition attached to a planning permission or be inconsistent with any use specified or included in such a permission.The exemption was reviewed and revised when drawing up the 2001 regulations which were subsequently endorsed by the Oireachtas. No problems relating to the application of the exemption have been brought to my Department's attention and I have no plans to amend the legislation in this regard.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	561	I refer the Deputy to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 579 of 19 October 2004.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	562	A number of measures have been put in place to ensure that local authorities have the capacity to fulfil their responsibilities under the Housing Acts for the management and maintenance of their housing stock. These measures include the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 and the recently enacted Residential Tenancies Act 2004.The housing unit, which is funded by my Department and local authorities, has produced guidance and organised training courses for local authority staff to help them deal with anti-social behaviour. My Department contributed €270,000 in 2004 towards the running costs of the unit. It has also put in place a housing management initiatives scheme which includes funding for programmes to improve estate management, tenant liaison and training initiatives. Grants amounting to €704,000 were paid by my Department in 2004.Details of funding arrangements for 2005 have not yet been finalised but it is my objective to consolidate the progress made to date.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	563	Riverview, Ballyhahill, was designated for funding under my Department's remedial works scheme in January of this year and approval has been given to Limerick County Council to obtain tenders for the proposed works.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	564	Part 17 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500, as ascertained at the last preceding census and not having a town council, may make a proposal for the establishment of such a council. Under the relevant provisions of the Act, which I hope to commence in the near future, a proposal to establish a town council, and the timing of any such proposal, is a matter for the local community in the first instance, with a decision on such a proposal being a reserved function of the relevant county council, following a public consultation process. However, Part 17 also allows for the first elections to new town councils to proceed independently of the normal local election cycle.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	565	Polystyrene is widely used internationally as protective packaging in the transport of electrical and other goods. It is also used in meat trays, egg cartons, hot beverage cups and other fast food packaging. While polystyrene can be recycled — for example, for insulation and other building products — there are limited outlets for it in Ireland. There is some processing activity relating to the remoulding and manufacture of roof slates and also a compacting operation of the material into blocks which are exported. However, the overall scale of these activities is limited. There are no official data on the amount of polystyrene put on the market in Ireland.Polystyrene recycling is also fairly limited in other EU member states where, because of its high calorific value, a significant proportion of the material collected is used as feedstock in thermal treatment plants. The recycling of polystyrene is particularly hindered by its high volume to weight ratio and the associated costs of collecting such material.With a view to facilitating the increased recovery of waste generally on an all-island basis, a North-South market development group was established last year to identify market opportunities for materials, including plastic materials, recovered for recycling. The group is developing a market development programme which will be published later this year.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	566	I am not aware of any reprocessing capacity in Ireland for cigarette papers and the inner lining of cigarette packets. The selection of materials for recycling must of necessity be done on a targeted basis. Having regard to the types and volumes of the materials mentioned, it would not appear economically viable specifically to target those materials for collection and recycling. However, in those households served with segregated collection of dry recyclables, the light cardboard outer packaging on cigarette packets can be deposited in the recyclables wheelie bin for recycling.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	567	Under section 29(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, my Department issues licences to hunt wild deer during an open season and some 2,215 such licences were issued for the 2003 to 2004 season. The extent of the deer hunting season is reviewed annually by staff of the national parks and wildlife service of my Department. The views of a number of organisations and individuals with knowledge of Irish deer species are also taken into consideration when reviewing open season dates.In general, the open season for stags runs from 1 September to 28 February, and that for hinds from 1 November to 31 January. There are some regional variations. For example, red deer cannot be hunted in County Kerry at any time of the year and the open season for sika and fallow females finishes on 28 February in Dublin and Wicklow. Applications for licences to hunt wild deer are considered from 1 August for the following open season.My Department also issues an annual licence, under section 26(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, to the Ward Union Hunt Club to hunt deer with a pack of stag hounds during such period or periods as is or are specified in the licence. The Ward Union Hunt Club usually applies for a licence in September. Information on the conduct of hunts under the previous year's licence is reviewed and taken into account in considering whether to issue a new licence and any conditions that may attach to it. The licence for the current season is valid from 15 October 2004 to 31 March 2005.
