#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.The evaluation of files for release to the National Archives is carried out by designated officials in my Department.  I have no role in that process.  As files are processed for release each year, it is normal that some are certified by the appropriate official for retention on the grounds set forth in the Act.  Under section 8(6) of the National Archives Act 1986, provision is made for the review of closed records at five-yearly intervals from the date the certificate to withhold the records is made.  My Department complies with its statutory obligation in this regard.A total to 724 files or file parts were transferred to the National Archives to be released for public inspection on 1 January 2007.  Six files were withheld, of which two were withheld under section 8(4)(a) of the Act, one under section 8(4)(b) and (c) and one under section 8(4)(c) of the Act.  On the advice of the Attorney General, two files were withheld under the 75-year European Court of Human Rights rule.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1	What kind of files were withheld?  Does the Taoiseach have the number of files that have not been released and to what they relate?  I note that, according to a recent newspaper article, the son of Rudolf Hess wrote to the former President, Mr. de Valera, in 1968, asking him to petition for the release of his father from Spandau prison in Berlin.  The Taoiseach will be well aware of the story.  The Secretary General of the Department of External Affairs, as it was then known, responded by saying that no further action was considered necessary and that the letter should just be acknowledged.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.Does the Taoiseach have a list of what else has been released?  Is it available in the Oireachtas Library or on the Internet?  How does the average person access such information if he or she should so wish?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The files are sent to the National Archives every year so all of the records will be there.  Of the six files in question, two were withheld under section 8(4)(a) of the Act, which relates to public interest, one was held under section 8(4)(b), which relates to information obtained in confidence, and one was held under section 8(4)(c), which relates to distress or danger of defamation.  In practice most of the files withheld concern personal security matters.  The European Court of Human Rights restricts the release of documents for 75 years and we observe such restrictions when we have documents on file from that body.  This year two files were withheld on this basis, both of which related to the case taken against the British Government for the ill treatment of internees in Northern Ireland.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Is it true that they were withheld partially because there are persons living who may be affected by the consequences of their release?  Are those persons in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland and is this why the files have not been released or does the Taoiseach have this information?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Even the names of most of these files are not given because that would be too much information.  Not many files are withheld every year — between five and nine files each year in recent times — and most relate to people in Northern Ireland who wrote to the Taoiseach of the day with information.  While the files come under the category of public interest information obtained in confidence, distress or danger, they all relate to the security situation.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	5	During the Taoiseach's term of stewardship, how many of the files withheld have been transferred to the archives?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Very few, to the best of my knowledge.  I have the figures from 1999 and later and no file or part-file was withheld in 1999 or in the few preceding years.  The 30 year rule affects files from the 1969 to 1970 period so in 2000 and 2001 there were 12 and 13 such files.  The figures for the years after this were five, five and six.  Almost all of these files related to security information supplied in writing by people.  Inevitably, given the times, a number of documents contained sensitive or confidential information about individuals.  In some cases the information may not have been accurate but it was supplied by individuals and no assessment is made as to the accuracy of the information supplied in the files.I understand officials from my Department made every effort to ensure documents were released in their entirety where possible and sought the release of papers relating to political contacts between the Irish and British Governments and policy considerations of the Government of the time.  Files withheld tended to relate to security information and information supplied by individuals in this regard.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Do the files held tend to be reviewed?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	8	They are reviewed every five years.  I am not sure that the files I have seen and those that have been held back will ever be released unless, as in the human rights situation, we can get them out eventually.  Many of the files relate to people writing to the Taoiseach of the day and giving their view or assessment of information they believed to be security information.  How can anyone ever make an assessment about whether they were right or wrong?  I do not think most of the files in question will ever see the light of day.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Will the files from 1976 which were withheld and not released in January 2007 be considered for review in January 2008?  Regarding the 1976 files relating to the Sallins mail train robbery and the subsequent framing of people for that raid, were any files withheld relating to the operation of the Garda heavy gang at the time?Regarding the inquiry into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, did Mr. McEntee SC have full access to all files relating to the matter, including those not released, under the National Archives Act?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	10	No files relating to the Sallins robbery were held in my Department.  They would have been Garda files or files held by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  As I stated, the only files in my Department related to the security situation and only a very small number of files were held back.  The files related to security information and we had no files relating to the issues the Deputy mentioned.On the McEntee inquiry, on which we will have questions later, any appropriate files, either Garda files or otherwise, were available.  I will deal with the matter when we come to the question.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	11	In light of the Taoiseach's response to Deputy Rabbitte concerning the five-yearly review, how many files have been subject to multiple reviews?  The Taoiseach referred to the period from 1999 onwards.  Do the files withheld relating to 1976 concern a single incident or a number of incidents?  Are the same people cited in each of them or do they relate to different groups of people?The Taoiseach appeared to indicate to Deputy Rabbitte that some files may have been withheld to avoid embarrassment to people who corresponded with members of the Government.  Will he explain the security implications of withholding such correspondence?Has the Department of the Taoiseach succeeded in creating a computer database of archives?  To what extent has a division taken place in the National Archives between, on the one hand, professional historians and researchers and, on the other, members of the public who use the National Archives, for instance, to look up family histories?  Could the difficulties in the National Archives caused by lack of space be overcome by introducing greater computerisation of records?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The National Archives has legislation, procedures and a budget for dealing with these issues so I do not want to answer on its behalf.  State papers are released under the National Archives Act and provide historians with valuable insights into the Government's consideration of the events of 30 years previously.  I am sure those analysing these historical records will find the State papers a valuable research resource.I know from officials in my Department that they make every effort to ensure that documents are released in their entirety where possible.  In particular, they have sought, wherever possible, to release papers relating to the political contacts between the Irish and British Governments and the policy considerations of the Government of the time.  These are key historical records and the area in which historians are interested.  My officials also sought to minimise any redactions within the documents that were released so that they would be fully accessible to readers.I am not involved in this process, which is entirely conducted by authorised officials within the provisions of the Act.  I do not have control over the staff of the National Archives who do a good job in assisting historians and members of the public in accessing records.Information that is held back is not done so out of embarrassment.  Thirty years ago, people in communities in Northern Ireland or in the Border region may have written letters containing facts or information they believed to be of a security nature.  Some of these people or members of their families are still alive.  Such instances, where people offered their view of sensitive information, are considered under the Act to be files that could create distress to individuals or their families or to present a danger or defamation.Such people acted in good faith at a time of conflict and great difficulties in their areas.  This provision is included in the legislation to protect that type of information so that people who thought they were being helpful at the time are not involved in conflict 30 years later.  Only a small number of files are involved.  They relate not to policy issues but to judgments of individuals, right or wrong, on the security situation at the time.  It would be unfair ever to release those papers.  I do not know what purpose would be served in doing so.  Perhaps it might make no difference to release them in 75 years under the European Court of Human Rights rule but I do not see what purpose that would serve.A total of 55 files on Northern Ireland were released to the National Archives this year.  Only two of these were withheld under the European Court of Human Rights rule, 44 were released entirely without redactions, and 11 were released with redactions.  Such redactions generally relate to the names of individuals.  Of the 11 redacted files, 36 documents out of those files were affected.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	13	My question relates to storage and access to the National Archives and to Deputy Boyle's point regarding computerisation.  The facilities there are entirely inadequate.  Given that the General Registry Office has moved to Roscommon town and its records have been successfully computerised and that the Land Registry is on its way to Roscommon town and is in the process of computerising its records, would it not make sense to decentralise all our national records to Roscommon town?  The facilities should be provided where the technology and skills are already available.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Since the Government successfully implemented the other changes, it should consider this proposal along with everything else.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Does that mean the Taoiseach agrees with my proposal?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Deputy Naughten obviously agrees with the actions we have already taken in this area.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 10, inclusive, together.As I indicated in reply to previous questions on the matter, the recommendations of the Nally report in regard to the reorganisation of the Chief State Solicitor's office have been largely implemented.  The recommendation that responsibility for local State solicitors should be transferred from the Attorney General to the DPP, with legislative provision to enable the DPP to delegate to them, is almost implemented and should be fully implemented in the nearfuture.The offices of the Chief State Solicitor and Director of Public Prosecutions have been in negotiations with the State Solicitors' Association for some considerable time.  Following these lengthy negotiations, a revised offer was made to the association on 6 September 2006.  The association indicated it will accept the offer subject to agreement on new contracts with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The details of the new contracts are in the final stages of agreement.Officials in the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions are confident final agreement will be reached in the near future allowing for the service to transfer.  The enabling legislation and appropriate legislative provisions on the transfer of the local State solicitor service are contained in the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005, which was signed by the President on 9 July 2005.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	18	There has been much talk about what the DPP might be able to do and what generally happens.  Traditionally, as the Taoiseach is aware, the DPP was seen as being in a position to assist the courts to arrive at a decision.  In our adversarial court system a situation may arise where the defendant's barrister can go into a long tirade about mitigation for a defendant while the DPP, because of a convention, sits there and says nothing.  Just as the barrister for the defendant can make a case for mitigation, so too should the DPP's office be able to make a case for prosecution.  He often does that by giving his views on the leniency of sentences.  Does the Taoiseach accept the current system does not allow for the people, through the DPP, to have their say prior to a sentence being handed down?  Would it be reasonable to set aside the current convention?  In an adversarial situation, prior to a judge handing down a sentence, and where the defendant's barrister makes a case saying why the person should be given a lenient sentence, the DPP should speak on behalf of the people even if referring to tariffs set down by the Oireachtas.The problem is that this does not happen because of a traditional convention.  Does the Taoiseach have a view on this?  Does he think the antiquated system should go by the board and that the DPP should be able to speak up on behalf of the people to say that a certain crime should carry a certain sentence?  It would send a clear message to criminals who think they can get a soft touch and that the law is tilted in their direction.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I will not give judgments on these issues.  The questions relate to the Nally report's recommendations on the updating of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor's in 1999 to improve relationships between the office and the DPP and on the powers that should be transferred from the Attorney General to the DPP, with legislative provision to allow the DPP to delegate to the Chief State Solicitor.  Other aspects in the report are almost fully implemented.The DPP has contributed to some of these debates.  He is independent under the 1974 Act so I do not want to give my view or that of the Government on how he handles cases.  He has a level of independence that allows him to decide how he deals with these issues.  He has stated in some speeches at conferences that there are areas we should examine or that his office should examine.Since the Nally report was published in 1999, negotiations with staff to implement the recommendations and the putting in place of adequate staff structures took a few years.  Staff structures for the criminal division of the Chief State Solicitor's Office were transferred to the DPP's office to form a unit headed by a solicitor.  That unit has professional staff who work for the DPP under the meaning of the 1974 Act.  Removing those powers from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and giving them to a solicitor in the DPP's office was a significant change.  If I was to say how he should do his job, however, I would be interfering.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	20	What is the relationship between county solicitors and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor?  Are they subcontractors?  Do they get a set amount of money or are the staff of such solicitors paid equally?  Is the deal done with the county solicitor who then employs the number of staff he or she thinks appropriate at different levels?The DPP stated it would be desirable for a legal policy unit to be established in his office.  Is that proceeding or have discussions taken that into account in the new arrangements?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	21	In recent times 75 additional staff were taken on but the more recent proposal is to have a separate research unit with staff who would not be involved in the ordinary day-to-day cases.  In the context of this year's Estimates, they sought resources.  I do not know at what stage the negotiations are at present.  It seems a very valid point that staff involved in day-to-day cases should not be the research people.  Additional staff is required for that.There was a report on the workloads and the expense base of the office of the Chief State Solicitor by reviewers engaged by the Chief State Solicitor's office before the offer was made last year.  The offer dealt with many of the issues raised in the course of negotiations with the State Solicitors' Association.  It is designed to have a benchmark of expenses.  What happens in the Chief State Solicitor's office is that they are contracted.  They have separate offices and separate staff, so their workloads are different.  They are endeavouring to have a contract that would be compatible for them all.  They do the vast amount of the work on a nationwide basis, so they represent a vitally important cog in the whole system.  The negotiations are concluded and they are drawing up the contracts that will allow them to work to the Chief State Solicitor's office.  There are a large number of people on a nationwide basis involved in these offices.  At last, after a long industrial relations process, they seem to have resolved the issue and the contracts are being drawn up.  They would be contracted to the Chief State Solicitor's office with terms affixed.  There will not be the same money for everyone because the workloads are different in the cases of different counties.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.Significant progress has been made since the publication of the 2001 OECD report, Regulatory Reform in Ireland.  The focus of our efforts in progressing regulatory reform is now on implementing the Government White Paper, Regulating Better, which was published in January 2004 in response to the OECD's report.The White Paper sets out six core principles that must be reflected in how we design, implement and review legislation and regulation.  Some of the key areas outlined in the OECD report relate to specific sectoral issues and the appropriate Ministers with responsibility for those sectoral areas report directly to the House on progressing those OECD recommendations.The better regulation group was established in 2004 to progress the commitments in the White Paper and to oversee the implementation of the action plan, which forms part of the White Paper.  The group met on five occasions in 2006 and presented a detailed report to Government at its meeting on 13 February on its progress in implementing the commitments in the White Paper.  The better regulation group has played a leading role in overseeing the introduction of regulatory impact analysis across Departments and Government offices.  Officials are now routinely applying regulatory impact analysis, RIA, to regulatory proposals in advance of their submission to Government.  The better regulation unit of my Department provides practical support for officials conducting regulatory impact analyses.Concrete examples of this support include a dedicated RIA training course, the RIA guidelines, the guidelines on consultation for public sector bodies and the recently established RIA network.  Alongside this work, the better regulation group has steered and focused work in the area of statute law revision.  The Statute Law Revision Bill 2007, published on 1 February, provides for the repeal of more than 3,000 obsolete Acts that predate the foundation of the State.  Two comprehensive public consultation processes preceded the drafting of the text of the Bill.  The Bill completed all stages in the Seanad on 14 February and is listed for Second Stage in this House tomorrow.  It is envisaged that the Bill will be enacted in the lifetime of the current Dáil.  The removal of these ancient Acts from our Statute Book will undoubtedly assist in clarifying the legislation that remains in force.To identify priorities for improving the regulatory environment for business, the better regulation group has also commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to conduct a survey of business attitudes to regulation.  This comprehensive survey of more than 800 companies, including SMEs, focuses on red tape and on the impacts of regulation on business more broadly, such as the extent to which regulation facilitates, or is a barrier to, economic growth and the competitiveness of business.  I intend to publish the results of this survey shortly.In addition to the initiatives already mentioned, the better regulation group also oversees the work of a number of subgroups, including the subgroup on regulatory appeals and the subgroup on electronic statutory instruments.The subgroup on regulatory appeals has been charged with progressing commitments in the White Paper in relation to developing improved approaches to appealing the decisions of the major economic and sectoral regulatory bodies.  Given the complex nature of the issues involved in appeals, the Government decided, in July 2006, to initiate a broad public consultation process on the issue, with advertisements placed in the national media.As part of this consultation process, the subgroup published a consultation paper on regulatory appeals and a successful consultation seminar was organised by my Department in September 2006 to generate debate on the issue and encourage interested parties to respond to the consultation paper.  The seminar presented legal, international and business experience in relation to appeals and speakers at the seminar included the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Attorney General.Thirty five submissions have been received to date in my Department in response to the consultation paper on regulatory appeals.  The better regulation group is currently in the process of reviewing the submissions received and will publish a synthesis document in the first quarter of this year.  These submissions will inform proposals on appeals which the better regulation group will prepare for consideration by the Government.The subgroup on electronic statutory instruments is looking at improving electronic accessibility to statutory instruments.  Revised procedures for the production of statutory instruments have been developed and are currently being piloted across Departments and offices.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The 2001 report refers to bottlenecks in the physical infrastructure of housing, transport and other areas.  Will the Taoiseach comment on how many of the OECD's conclusions and policy options have been dealt with since then?  I note in the executive summary of the 2006-07 global competitiveness report that Ireland is ranked at 31.  In respect of higher education and training, Ireland is ranked at 16, which means a slippage in terms of our competitiveness as against countries such as Finland, Norway and Sweden which have held the top three places in these areas for a long time.Will the Taoiseach comment on reform of the energy market in view of the decision to grant the ESB authority to build a new power plant?  Will he also comment on the implementation of a North-South interconnector?  This was agreed by Government a long time ago but not a single pylon has gone into the ground.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The Taoiseach will also be aware that 40,000 Smart Telecom customers had their service disconnected last year.  Does he agree that, in respect of the regulatory impact of such an occurrence, there is a clear need to tighten up the regulations which would require Eircom to give notice to ComReg who, in turn, could warn customers of a breakdown in the service?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	26	These questions relate to the regulator and would be more appropriate to the line Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	27	My question is about the implementation of the recommendation of the OECD report on regulatory reform.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Yes, but individual questions for line Ministers should be addressed to the line Minister.  The Deputy may ask a broad general question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	29	This is a broad general question about telecommunications regulation.  Some 40,000 customers on a particular scheme had their service disconnected last year.  Does the Taoiseach consider there should be a tightening up of regulatory reform in order that ComReg could give notice to customers of such an event?The website of the Department of the Taoiseach includes a section on the customer action plan for 2005 to 2008.  The target set is that all correspondence will be acknowledged within three days and answered comprehensively within 15 days and that all emails will be acknowledged within one day.  Are these targets being met by the Taoiseach's Department?  Is he happy with them?  What recourse is open to a person who does not receive an answer from the Taoiseach's Department within three days or 15 days?  That is a specific question that he will want to answer.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I hope those targets are being met.  My officials are doing their utmost.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	32	On what has happened with regard to regulation generally, a unit in my Department is working across the whole OECD area and the 2001 report.  It is actively driving implementation and working with other Departments in trying to move it on.  In some cases, it is the regulators who have the responsibilities.  In other cases, a number of regulatory bodies are involved in respect of the professions and all the reports relate to range of professions.  I have previously replied to Deputy Kenny in respect of this.In respect of the reports specifically mentioned by Deputy Kenny, ComReg's latest quarterly data covering the fourth quarter of last year details what is happening in the telecommunications area.  There is a long list of data.  It provides an update of what is happening in the Irish market and what happened last year with regard to Smart Telecom and all the other areas.  They have followed up these issues.In the energy sector, there have been communications between the Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the ESB.  They have followed up with regard to Bord Gáis and the tariffs and so on.  There has been follow through on all these areas covered in the 2001 paper.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Is this the issue relating to Smart Telecom?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Yes.  On that issue, one will never stop a company from running into difficulties.  One will encounter more of that given the huge range of operators in the market.  There will be change and rationalisation; some will pull out of the market, while others will expand and there will also be takeovers.  This will not stop.The study of this has moved on and we have looked at the detail.  A study by either the Economic and Social Research Institute or the National Economic and Social Council on the area of regulations will come out shortly.  This is a Europe-wide issue.  We have done a considerable amount of work over the past five years, but the EU has demanded that for business regulation the burden imposed on businesses should be reduced by 25% for administrative purposes and for EU legislation.  An examination across Departments all over Europe is taking place to seek to reduce the burdens that arise from EU legislation.  There is a demand that we should try to do this in our own countries as well, which is what we have been doing since 2001.  Our view is that the Commission should focus on the 25% target at EU level before it considers how we can deal with reducing the burdens here.  Germany is doing a considerable job on this at the moment.  I believe it has 120 statisticians going through all its legislation.We have carried out a similar exercise here.  The small unit in my Department is driving the change and reform.  I have recently gone through the details of much of this with the unit.  There are too many regulatory bodies and regulations.  We have 130 different regulators, including local authorities.  It is a very cumbersome area.  There is a job to try to streamline this.  It is the first time the unit has gone through all our Acts, legislation and agencies and identified the regulations.  It has done a very good job in putting it all together and has consulted with business on this.There is much that could be done in respect of old legislation.  Every new Act must go through a regulatory impact analysis.  In reply to Deputy Kenny's question, there are communications between the regulatory impact analysis and various agents and regulatory bodies.  In respect of existing Acts of the Oireachtas, there are far too many bodies.  Every year, we add to this by passing Acts.  The area needs to be streamlined.  The unit in my Department that is doing this is small, but it is doing a good job in trying to narrow down the amount of regulation and bring it together.  We will not drop anything that is useful but we should at least remove some of the burdens from people.  Much work remains to be done in this area.  Perhaps it is easier with major areas such as gas and energy in general because there is much focus on them currently and CER has its own offices and staff.A great deal of legislation and regulation is involved in some of the other areas and this is proving to be hugely cumbersome.  We have a clear picture of what remains to be done.  Some good work has been done in regard to the proposed pharmacies' legislation that is going through the Houses currently.  A report is currently being carried out on solicitors.  Reports have outlined action that has been taken across a range of bodies.  They provide an indication of the amount of regulatory issues involved and we hope to dispose of many of them.  When we bring forward new legislation, we should be slow to build up these things if they are unnecessary.  It is ridiculous that we have 120 regulatory bodies.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The Taoiseach did not answer Deputy Kenny's specific question about the number of recommendations from the 2001 OECD report that have been implemented by the Government either wholly or partially and the ones that remain untouched.  It is important this information is provided to the House.Does the Taoiseach accept Deputy Kenny's point regarding the Statute Law Revision Bill that it will have little impact on many of the impediments that still exist in terms of over-regulation because most of the laws being tackled under that Bill predate the type of mania in regulation that has come from Acts of this House, especially in recent years?The Taoiseach referred to the existence of too many regulators.  Is it not the case that his Government passed most of the legislation bringing many of these regulators into existence?  It appears regulators have been used as a shield to hide behind to prevent questions being answered in this House?  I cite the example of the electricity regulator not allowing renewable energy onto the national grid.  If the Taoiseach is sincere about reducing the number of regulators, will we see legislation in this area in the near future?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Deputy Boyle has got the wrong idea.  I did not refer to the number of regulators who were recently established.  I refer to our overall legislation which brought into existence approximately 120 regulatory authorities.  I do not refer to a handful of regulators.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Is the Government not adding to them?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	38	We are; last year, we added 11 more.  We have been trying to reduce the number of regulators in recent years.  Instead of appointing new regulators, we have been trying to assign new duties.  Many of the existing regulatory authorities are local authorities such as urban councils.  However, there are too many in terms of trying to do business or answer to them.I do not have precise figures on the number of OECD report recommendations that have been implemented.  However, although all the recommendations have not been completed, action has commenced in all of the areas.  All of the work on regulatory impact analysis has been done.  That work is almost concluded across most of the professional areas.The Competition Authority completed a report on the engineering profession in December 2004.  The report on the architects' profession was completed in March 2006.  The report on the optometry profession was completed in June 2006.  The report on the legal profession was completed in December 2006.  A preliminary report on the dental profession was published in December 2005 and a final report is due later this year.  A preliminary report on veterinary surgeons will be published this year.  The final profession awaiting a report is medical practitioners and this is due in 2008.  Reports on all of the major areas that required focus will be finished by next year.I did not refer to progress on the reform of the legal profession.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced the establishment on a statutory basis of a legal services ombudsman to provide for independent statute-based supervision of the complaints system for both solicitors and barristers.  The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill includes required provisions to establish a legal services ombudsman.  While work has not been fully completed, it has commenced in most of the areas.  Much work has been done on the decision-making processes of regulators.  The Deputy's question was on regulators.  The Enterprise Strategy Group published a report — Ahead of the Curve, Ireland's Place in the Global Economy — and made suggestions on how best we could deal with regulators and the idea of a super-regulator.  This raised the question of the best way to address this.  The Director of Consumer Affairs, the Competition Authority and the White Paper are examining this but the matter is not so simple.  The report made the point that some regulations are minor whereas others, to do with building power stations, are wide.  The best way of dealing with it has yet to be teased out.  We cannot continue appointing regulators willy-nilly.  It must be tightened and, to get expertise, perhaps we should create expert offices that can deal with a broad range of areas.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which implement national spatial strategy principles and policies at regional level, comprise the principal framework for the sustainable development of the greater Dublin area.  Their objective is to consolidate the physical and population growth of Dublin within the metropolitan area, and to provide for concentrated development elsewhere in the greater Dublin area at key strategic towns, particularly those along public transport corridors.  Significant investment under Transport 21 in improving public transport services and links, together with other targeted national development plan investment, is now being made in support of these recommended guideline objectives to create more sustainable growth patterns in the greater Dublin area.My Department's housing completion statistics for 2006 show that some consolidation is now occurring, with housing output rising by over 10% last year on 2005 in Dublin city and significant increases also recorded in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Moreover, my Department's review of the 1999 residential density guidelines, in light of the experiences to date, will further assist planning authorities to deliver higher density and more sustainable communities.Since the publication of the national spatial strategy I and my predecessors have guided local authorities to ensure that their development plan policies are consistent with the strategy.  This has taken the form of formal directions in the case of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Laois, and advisory letters in the case of a number of other counties including Meath and Monaghan.  In this regard, there is an onus on all political parties at both national and local level to work towards these objectives.  Similarly, in recognising the need to increase residential densities in the existing Dublin metropolitan area I expect general support for the objective.  There is little point in political parties advocating an end to urban sprawl at national level if, at the same time, they oppose increased height and density within the built up areas or, as has happened in the counties I have mentioned, they seek to rezone massive areas for speculative development.

Have the Minister's policies failed dismally?  While the population of Dublin city has fallen by 2% in 2002-06, the population in Fingal has increased by 22%, in Meath by 21% and in Kildare by 14%.  The price of housing is driving people out of the city.  A commuter from these counties spends 12 to 14 hours a day between work and getting to and from the office.  The Minister is not doing enough to ensure brownfield sites are developed for adequate high density apartment blocks, large enough to be suitable for families and with high amenity value.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	41	The last point is a good one and should be included in the debate.  I am anxious that apartment blocks should be more family appropriate.  I welcome support from Deputy O'Dowd and his party for greater densities because that is the way to go. He is right to say it is the way to go.  If we do not go up we will go out.  That has been a problem.  We must have some sort of regulation when local authorities make extraordinary attempts to rezone massive areas of land and encourage speculative development of, for example, small villages to a state that could not be supported.  There must be more regulation in this area. Deputy O'Dowd is right to say that Dublin's footprint is extraordinarily large.  There are relatively low densities and the way to go forward is to look for better density and better quality.A comparison of housing completions in 2006 and 2005 indicates a welcome change.  In Dublin city, for example, the building was up 10%, largely because brownfield development sites were brought on stream.  There has been an extraordinary renaissance in that type of development.  Building in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown is up34%.  There may be different reasons for that.

Building in south Dublin is down 1.9%.  Interestingly, it is down in Wicklow and Meath but up in Kildare.  A pattern of sorts is emerging.  I support the Deputy's point that brownfield sites should be brought on stream and I agree that in areas such as the Dublin docklands greater densities would be appropriate and suitable housing units should be built.

The population of Cork city has fallen by 3.2% while that of Cork county has increased by more than 11%.  In Limerick there was a 2.7% fall in the population of the city and an 8% increase in the county.  People are moving out because the Minister is not providing affordable and social housing.I wish to correct the Minister on one point.  I said I am in favour of high density, high quality build and high value amenities for our society.  We do not want seven storey blocks with no amenities, no recreational facilities and no jobs.  The Minister's policy must change to become a proactive planning policy that mixes housing with work and recreation in one area, if possible, to encourage people to cycle and walk to work rather than use their cars.  The statistics prove that the Minister's policies are an abject and total failure.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The Deputy is entitled to his views.  The question was about Dublin, not Limerick and Cork.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	52	On 15 December 2006, the chairman of the planning tribunal on his own initiative wrote to me to advise that the tribunal's public hearings would not be completed by 31 March 2007, the target date for the termination of the tribunal's work identified in 2004.  The chairman stated that he anticipated that the tribunal would be involved in public hearings until the end of 2007 and possibly into the early months of 2008.  Since this communication I have been in correspondence with the chairman regarding the duration and cost of the tribunal's work and have accepted an invitation to meet him to discuss these issues.  I do not consider it appropriate at this time to publish this ongoing correspondence.I am advised by the tribunal that it is engaged in five modules of investigation.  The cost of the planning tribunal amounted to more than €62 million to the end of 2006.  Expenditure in 2006 was nearly €16.2 million, of which €6.62 million related to the legal costs of third parties represented before the tribunal in the period 1997-2002.  It is estimated that outstanding third party bills relating to this period might amount to some €5 million.  The operational cost of the tribunal is approximately €10 million annually.My Department does not have access to the detailed records of the tribunal which would be a necessary starting point for any accurate estimation of the overall cost of the tribunal.  On the matter of costs it is interesting to note the contribution of the Comptroller and Auditor General to the Committee of Public Accounts last week where he spoke of the difficulties in estimating accurately the contingent liabilities of commissions and tribunals, commenting that he "may decide that it is not possible to do this".
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Total costs, including third party costs up to the end of 2002, appear to be less than €100 million according to the information provided by the chairman of the tribunal.  That is much less than €1 billion.  Did the tribunal indicate to the Minister the likely costs for the period from 2002 to date?Is it not inappropriate for the Minister to meet the chairman of the tribunal to discuss matters relating to costs and the additional modules to be investigated because the House, not the Government, established the tribunal?  The tribunal was required to decide by May 2005 what modules were to go to public investigation.  Do I understand the Minister to have said that five additional modules will go to public investigation and if so has the tribunal informed him what those matters are?Will he publish the correspondence between himself and the Mahon tribunal?  The Mahon tribunal was established by the House not the Minister.  The correspondence between the tribunal and the Minister is the property of the House.  The Minister is the agent of the House and, with the greatest of respect the correspondence, on all these matters should be made available to the House and put into the Oireachtas Library.  This is the business of the House not that of the Minister.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	54	All correspondence is covered by a confidentiality requirement.  My natural disposition is to be open on the issue of correspondence.  The correspondence is not completed and to break confidentiality I would show discourtesy to the tribunal.  It is also more important that I complete this issue and then I will visit the issue of making all material available.I do not disagree with the Deputy's thesis that the Minister is here to do the will of the House but the Minister also has a responsibility — as the Deputy has rightly pointed out — to keep in mind the issue of costs and finality in the tribunals.  My correspondence with Mr. Justice Mahon has been respectful and cordial although I have read commentary to the effect that it is otherwise.Mr. Justice Mahon has invited me to meet him and it would be the height of discourtesy to refuse that.  We must decide how to determine what issues can be discussed.  The House can be confident that I will be as forthcoming and as open with House as possible.  It would, however, be misleading and discourteous to release incomplete correspondence.  The Deputy correctly pointed out that this House determined the new arrangements that would apply after 2004.  I will discuss the remaining issues with Judge Mahon.  At the end of that process the Deputy might wish to probe further about the issue through a parliamentary question.

It was expected the public hearings would conclude on that date.  There were reports in the newspapers this morning that the Minister was to bring a memorandum on this matter to Government today and that the Government was going to consider it.  Has a decision been made on the legal fees to be paid to the tribunal lawyers, and what is that decision?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	56	The Deputy is correct that a decision was made that, from 31 March 2007, different, lower per diem rates would be paid.  The point can fairly be made from the point of view of the tribunal, and this is part of the ongoing dialogue, that while the tribunal would have anticipated a timetable for 2007, there has been a series of legal actions which have impeded or prevented the completion of that work.  No decision was made today to change the decision made previously.  In fact, I will refer back to the Government after I have had my discussions with Judge Mahon.

There is to be a dialogue between me and the tribunal on the timetable issue.  The tribunal can fairly put forward a case that legal actions have impeded its work.  The tribunal has a case to make and we must listen to it.  I ask the Deputy not to press me to anticipate what will happen following my discussion with the tribunal.The Deputy correctly points out that the tribunal was set up by this House.  The tribunal was given a task and we should support it in completing that task as efficiently, effectively and economically as possible.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The Government's waste management strategy has delivered demonstrable and successful results, including the achievement of domestic and EU targets well ahead of schedule.  This strategy, as formulated in successive policy documents, has been framed against the background of EU objectives to move to specified recovery rates for various waste streams and to divert biodegradable waste from landfill.Our municipal recycling rate has increased nationally from just 9% in 1998 to 35% by 2005.  In fact, in 2005 we passed the target set for this country for 2013, which was, by any standard, a significant achievement.  With regard to specific waste streams, we have worked successfully with industry through a range of producer responsibility initiatives.  Our recycling of packaging waste rose from 15% in 1998 to 60% in 2005, comfortably exceeding the 50% EU target set for 2005 and attaining the EU 2011 target.  A total of 87% of construction and demolition waste was recycled in 2005, exceeding the national target set for 2013.  Ireland was one of the few member states to implement the WEEE directive on time in 2005, and in the first year of operation we greatly exceeded the collection target set by the EU.  We are 50% ahead of the EU target for 2008.The Government is determined to drive forward and build on these recycling achievements, supported by appropriate infrastructure to deal with waste that cannot be prevented or recycled.  Waste to energy treatment can make an environmentally valuable contribution in this context.  Given EU requirements on diversion of waste from landfill, it will be particularly important in the future.  It is worth looking at the contribution of the Comptroller and Auditor General last week on this issue.  Against this background, the Dublin waste to energy plant is being procured as a public private partnership by Dublin City Council, acting on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities and within the framework of the statutory regional waste management plan.Dublin City Council has informed my Department that the selected service provider for the project has been seeking significant changes in the financial and commercial terms originally agreed.  This matter is the subject of continuing negotiations between the council and the prospective service provider, and I do not propose to speculate about the outcome of those discussions at this stage.  The applications for planning permission to An Bord Pleanála, and for a waste licence to the EPA, are sponsored by Dublin City Council, not the service provider, and are being maintained.

It is hard to know from the soundbites and U-turns of the Minister and the coalition partners over the last few days.  Does the Minister accept that we are sending as much municipal waste, if not more, to landfill as ten years ago?  Does he accept that Ireland is producing more municipal waste than any other EU country surveyed by the European Environment Agency?  Would he accept that the debacle over the Ringsend project will mean the authorities will have to seek a three year extension for the landfill at Kill in County Kildare?  Does he accept that householders are being swamped under an avalanche of packaging waste at present?  I regularly hear stories of householders having to jump up and down on the top of their green bin to fit the packaging waste into it.  That is no way to run a waste strategy.  It is the wrong strategy for the Government to pursue.  Surely the Government can regulate, legislate and mandate that packaging waste be reduced, so the poor unfortunate householder is not reduced to having to jump on top of the green bin.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The answer to most of the Deputy's rhetorical questions is "No".  There is a degree of extraordinary hypocrisy in the Green Party's stance on this issue.  I was pleased last week that, in the course of the debate, Deputy Quinn made it clear that incineration or waste to energy will have to be part of any integrated waste strategy for the future.  Recovery and reduction of waste will also have to be part of the strategy.  There is no simple one-way solution.  Tragically, there is no zero waste solution and we cannot simply legislate waste away.We must be honest with the public.  If we wish to achieve the same high environmental standards as those countries in Europe that are always held up as the exemplars, we must have the same infrastructure as they have.  I agree that far too much waste in this country goes into landfill.  I wish I was in the same position today as the Deputy's colleague in the Green Party who was the Minister with responsibility for the environment in the last German Government who went to a Council meeting of Environment Ministers and boasted he had passed a ministerial order preventing further waste going to landfill until it had been heat treated.We must be honest about this issue.  Waste goes hand in hand with economic development.  If we are to achieve the same levels of high environmental performance and recovery as the countries rightly used by the Deputy and others as exemplars, we must put in place the same type of infrastructure.  It is dishonest to suggest there is some simple way of wishing the problem away.  There is not.

The householder is suffering as a result of the lack of determination on the Government's part to reduce the amount of waste created and to recycle waste.  The Government is not determined to examine many innovative approaches adopted in other European countries such as standardised packaging and the promotion of markets in recycled products.  The Minister has made a late conversion towards the three R principles and he should get his own house in order first.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Ireland will deliver fully on its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.  While the relevant Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, report shows the downward trend in greenhouse gas emissions was interrupted in 2005, this was expected and was in line with projections published by the Department in 2006.  The report notes much of the 2005 increase in emissions can be attributed to two factors, the full commissioning in 2005 of new peat-powered electricity plants and the increase in private car ownership.In several sectors, notably the waste, residential and agriculture sectors, emissions are either stable or are on a decreasing trend.  Lower emissions in the waste sector can be attributed to the success of the Department's policies on maximising waste diversion from landfill.  Lower emissions in the agriculture sector can be attributed to lower livestock levels and decreased fertiliser use.The stabilisation of greenhouse gas emissions in the residential sector must be considered in the context of 81,000 house completions in 2005.  Energy performance standards for buildings have increased three times since 1997.  I will shortly announce a further review of the regulations to improve house energy efficiency by up to 40% or more.  This will ensure Ireland's standards are among the highest in the EU and make the maximum practical contribution to our Kyoto Protocol commitments.On the policies and measures already agreed, Ireland is positioned to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 14.6 million tonnes per annum between 2008 and 2012.  I am preparing a revised national climate change strategy, for publication by April 2007, which will set out the additional measures that will be implemented to close the remaining projected gap for compliance with Ireland's Kyoto Protocol commitments.  From our advanced calculations, we will not just close the gap but go beyond our target.

Will the Minister agree he has failed to control emissions in this sector and they have increased by 140%?  The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has failed to meet the Kyoto targets.  Its failure also extends to public transport and planning policies and how people get to and from work.  There is no metro line to Dublin Airport, the Luas system is not joined up, no rural transport scheme is in place and the existing bus network is woefully inadequate.  Will the Minister agree that new and radical thinking is required in the Department and across Government to tackle the failure to meet the Kyoto targets in transport emissions?  Ireland is one of the worst European countries in this regard because of the Minister’s lack of interest and involvement.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I do not agree that Ireland is one of the worst countries in Europe.  The Deputy should examine other comparisons.  The Deputy is correct that there have been significant increases in emissions in the transport area.  One reason is there are more cars on the road but there are other factors.  The Deputy is correct that there is no rail link to Dublin Airport.  However, there are advanced proposals for a metro line.In the past five years, however, the Government has put substantial additional funding into public transport.  In one year, 20 times more was allocated than when Fine Gael was last in Government and held the transport portfolio.  I am not clapping ourselves on the back for this because for generations there was far too little investment in public transport.  The Luas has been brought on stream.  The DART's capacity has been more than doubled and its network extended.  Additional commuter rail services have been provided for and the bus service has seen major investment.A great deal has been done and much more remains to be done.  The chances, however, of it being done are far greater under this Government than they would be under any alternative.

People must get up at 5 a.m. to commute to Dublin city to work because no park-and-ride facilities are available.  Commuters must sit in traffic queues for hours.  People are drifting out of the cities, living in the commuting counties and spending hours away from their families getting to work.  Notwithstanding the money the Government has spent on public transport, its policies have failed dismally.  Is it not time the Minister led joined-up thinking in the Government to have a real coherent policy to tackle climate change?  Will he agree the Government is a failure and deserves to be kicked out of office?

It is calculated in Luxembourg's emissions as drivers in neighbouring countries go there to buy fuel.  I can provide the Deputy with statistics on this matter.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	84	For many years, the Government, through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, has committed significant resources to assessing the incidence of radon gas, highlighting public awareness of it and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high concentrations.During the 1990s, the RPII carried out a nationwide survey of radon gas in domestic dwellings.  Based on its results, the RPII estimated that 91,000 houses, approximately 7% of the national housing stock, have radon concentration levels in excess of the national reference level of 200 Bq/m3.  This is the reference level adopted by the Government for houses, and the level above which it is recommended that radon remediation works should be considered.  The nature of the survey does not make it possible to estimate the number of occupants, whether they are elderly people or people in receipt of social welfare payments, living in houses estimated to have radon levels above the reference level.The testing of houses for radon is a straightforward, non-invasive and inexpensive process, costing approximately €50.  Furthermore, in many situations, relatively straightforward and inexpensive remediation measures, such as improved ventilation, can be effective in reducing radon concentration levels.I understand from the RPII that in recent years, information has been provided to it from the public and contractors that enables it to keep general track of the cost of remediation work.  On that basis, the average cost of remediation is between €2,000 and €3,000 per house.  The most expensive remediation work brought to the Department's attention cost €8,000, and that was a unique case.The RPII keeps a list of contractors who provide remediation services.  That list is offered as a public service.  The RPII recommends that any householder planning to carry out remediation should contact several such contractors to get the most competitive quotation.There is no provision for a State grant to assist in remediation work; nor had that been included in the types of works covered in the past by the essential repairs grant or the special housing aid for the elderly scheme.  However, in the context of the new housing aid for older people scheme, which is to be introduced later this year, and in deference to the Deputy, I will have the Department examine the possibility that where a suite of works is grant-aided to make an older person's home habitable and radon levels are of serious concern, radon remediation measures might be allowable.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I welcome the last part of the answer; the rest I knew fairly well already, having asked the question perhaps 15 times in the course of the Government's life.  I am a very strong believer in pursuing matters to the point where the responsible person is caught.I thank the Minister for his helpful inclusion of radon remediation under the grant scheme.  Perhaps we might go a little further.  Will the Minister also consider the very similar community works scheme under which doors, windows and draught exclusion measures are provided to keep older people warm?  While ventilation is important, the type available in the houses of which I speak would not be sufficient to exclude radon gas, as I am sure the Minister is aware.  Does he agree that we cannot continue spending taxpayers' money making houses comfortable and warm for old people but leaving them in a situation where they could die as a result of the additional insulation provided?  Previously, draughts would have allowed radon gas to blow out of houses.There is a very easy way of measuring numbers.  If one includes radon gas in the schemes of home improvement for the elderly, including the essential repairs grant and the community works scheme, one will get the figures very quickly.  Perhaps the Minister of State might respond.

However, I temper my answer by saying this.

Even where people are aware that radon levels are high and that assistance is available, it is surprising how low uptake has been.  Denmark in particular, having examined its scheme's cost-effectiveness, decided that a far better mechanism to save lives would be to concentrate on getting individuals to give up smoking.  The Deputy will understand where I am coming from.  The Danes have concentrated on that issue, since in more than 90% of deaths arising in a situation where radon is present, the victims are smokers.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	91	It is important that we do not allow a red herring to be drawn across the trail.  The Minister of State will be aware of many international studies on radon gas and smoking.  Even where there is an overlap, the evidence is very clear that radon gas is a lethal killer, causing lung cancer; in Ireland, it is estimated to cause 200 deaths per year.  It is quite extraordinary that we do not pay more attention to that entirely preventable list of deaths, particularly in the case of older people who cannot afford remedial work.  I am very surprised at the figures and would love to know from which contractors the Minister got them, since I have seen estimates of €10,000 to €12,000 to retro-fit a standard house.  I have come across that several times rather than in only one case.  To fit in the first instance is not that costly.I urge the Minister to look favourably on the essential repairs grant, the disabled person's grant and the community works scheme as they apply to people on low incomes who might not be able to afford this.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Regarding the figures that I quoted, we tell people to shop around, and we have a list of contractors.  Our evidence is that the general norm is €2,000 to €3,000.  If a contractor is charging €8,000 or €9,000, we would like to see evidence of those charges, and we will deal with them and inform customers where they might secure much better value for money.  I do not want to underestimate the dangers associated with radon gas.  Given our concern, I am quite willing to take suggestions on board.  We will examine them and consider the feasibility of including them in the new scheme.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 138 together.In law, the preparation of the register of electors is a matter for each local registration authority.  It is its duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the co-operation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.Authorities were required to publish the final register for 2007-08 by 1 February last and did so.  In working to compile the register, authorities undertook and completed the most extensive registration campaign in decades, and we are all indebted to them for their great effort.  Figures received by my Department from them indicate that, in that work, some 555,000 names were removed from last year's register and 523,000 names added.  Overall, the register for 2007-08 contains more than 32,000 fewer names than last year.  Regarding those eligible to vote at Dáil elections, the new register contains some 62,000 fewer names than last year.Since the publication of the draft register in November, local authorities have continued to make corrections, with the result that the final register contains approximately 93,000 more names than at draft stage, or 86,000 more in the case of Dáil elections.  On the basis of the work undertaken, I am satisfied that there has been a very significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.The final register for 2007-08 is now available for checking, and individuals not on the register can avail themselves of supplementary registration procedures until 15 days before next polling day.  We still have a few weeks to get people on the register.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	94	We will not really know how accurate the register is until polling day, when people turn up to vote.  Has the Minister considered the number of voters in each constituency and the apparent inconsistencies in the new register?  For example, I appreciate that Dáil representation is based on population, and it appears that most constituencies have approximately 18,000 to 20,000 voters per Deputy.  However, there are very significant variations.  In Dublin city, for example, Dublin Central, Dublin Mid-West, Dublin North-West and Dublin South-East all have ratios of 1:14,000 or 1:15,000 as against the norm of approximately 1:18,000.  If one looks at some of the adjoining constituencies, one finds that Dublin Central has a ratio of 1:14,000 while Dublin North-Central has 1:20,000.  Dublin North-West has 1:15,000 whereas Dublin North has a ratio of one TD per 20,000 voters.  I appreciate that there are some demographic differences but in those adjoining constituencies they would not give rise to that degree of variation.  It suggests to me that, notwithstanding the efforts that have been made to get the register right, in urban areas the numbers of registered voters are significantly lower than the norm.  Even within urban areas there are wide variations which cannot be explained by demographic differences across those constituencies.Limerick east is another constituency in which there is a surprisingly low ratio.  One would not expect Dublin Central and Dublin North-Central to have the kind of variation that is presented in these figures.  I wonder if any inquiry has been carried out into what has given rise to such variations.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	95	The Deputy is correct.  In fact, the more one studies this matter the more one becomes aware of some quite extraordinary factors.  I wish to place a few more statistics on the record of the House.  As the Deputy knows, there is an academic hypothesis that the total number of people on the electoral register should be roughly the equivalent of 85% of the 18 plus population. That would mean that we still have significant over-registration.  There may be all sorts of reasons for that.  There is a tradition in Ireland that when a son or daughter comes up to Dublin to work, they keep them on the register at home.  Theoretically, that is not a valid thing to do.  That has been the case since 1974 but old habits die hard.  The Deputy is correct in saying that there are some quite surprising variations between urban and rural areas in terms of the proportion of people aged 18 plus on the register.  For example, in Cork city the registration figure is the equivalent of 87% of those aged 18 plus, whereas in Dublin it is the equivalent of 82%.  However, in Galway it is 74%, in Limerick 84% and in Waterford 75%.  It is hard to explain with any degree of certainty why those variations exist.The Deputy asked if any inquiry was made, which is a fair question.  There was such an inquiry.  We know, for example, that in Waterford city there was a huge number of removals.  That was not necessarily a bad thing because it turned out that there was a disproportionate number of deceased persons on the register.  No matter how one approaches this matter, there will be a continuing challenge with the voter registration process.  The process we have reflects more the 19th than the 21st century.  I have already indicated my view that in future there should be a rolling register.  In addition, we should examine marrying the register with other databases, although it is not something we can do on this occasion.  It would be disingenuous, however, if I did not put on record the fact that I am extremely grateful to most local authorities that did a very good job.  One or two would not necessarily receive any accolades or gold stars and the Deputy knows of one such that I have in mind.

Let us not quibble about it.  Voter registration is a challenging issue, as is the question of registration fraud.

I am discovering that many young people who turned 18 after November 2006 are not registered.  One of the difficulties is that when one gives them the supplementary register form and tells them they must go to the local Garda station, they are somewhat reluctant to do so.  They want to be sure they will be welcome at a Garda station.  In that context there should be certain hours during which a designated officer can deal with these matters.  In that way, young people would not feel intimidated by the process.  Alternatively, a garda could attend local authority offices on certain days in order to make the system less formal.  At the same time, however, young people wishing to access the supplementary register must produce proof of identity.  That is a key issue.The Minister mentioned the possibility of a new publicity campaign but he should aim it at those who have recently turned 18 or will do so by polling day.  In a survey of approximately 120 houses in my constituency, we found over 40 young people who had recently reached 18 years of age but were not registered to vote.  They should be encouraged to get on the electoral register.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I do not disagree with anything the Deputy said.  The whole point of introducing the supplementary register arrangements a few years ago was specifically to try to assist those people who had reached the age of majority to get on the voting register.  We should examine anything that would make it easier for legitimate voters to register.  The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, has told me that community gardaí could play a role in that respect, as could civilian staff.

There is a short timeframe during which people can apply for inclusion on the supplementary register.  Would the Minister consider changing the format of the supplementary register whereby people could apply to a local authority and then appeal to the county registrar, pending the introduction of a rolling register?  I would rather see a rolling register than the current fixed-time process.  Given the turmoil we have come through, there are many people who are entitled to vote but who are not yet on the register.  In order to facilitate them, the Minister should change the format for applying for inclusion on the supplementary register.  That would offer an opportunity for such people to exercise their franchise.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	109	There may well be some merit in the Deputy's point but it would require primary legislation.  The Deputy will recall the debate we had in this House on that subject.  One of the extraordinary things we discovered was that when we tried to make a modest change to allow for an extension of dates, which was something everyone in the House supported, we had to do so by legislation.  We discovered that the electoral registration process is rigidly protected in primary law, and rightly so.  We got the balance about right in terms of the supplementary register.  Some protections must be in place, otherwise it would be wide open to abuse.  I agree, however, that after the election we should all sit down in this House, and hopefully I will be in this seat at that time——

We are still not sure if the register is accurate.  Does the Minister regret not having accepted the recommendation by the Labour Party at the beginning of last year whereby all this could have been avoided?  We could have an accurate register now if the Minister had used the census system to assemble it.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Some 239 waste water schemes have been completed since 1997 under my Department's water services investment programme at an Exchequer cost of around €2.3 billion.  This investment has transformed the quality, scale and coverage of our national waste water infrastructure.  It has resulted in major progress in preserving and improving environmental standards and facilitated the unprecedented social and economic growth and development in every part of the country.The environmental benefits of the new infrastructure include increased compliance with the requirements of the EU urban waste water treatment directive.  This has risen from 25% in 2000 to 90% at present and the remaining schemes necessary for full compliance with the directive are included in my Department's current water services investment programme.  The new infrastructure has brought about a reduction of 45,000 tonnes per annum in the pollutant load from municipal discharges to rivers, lakes and seas in a period of unprecedented economic growth.  The percentage of river channels that are unpolluted has risen from 67% to 70% and there are more blue flag beaches and bathing areas.  In 2006, 84 blue flags were awarded — the highest number ever and which compares to 70 in 1997.  The new infrastructure has brought about additional waste water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of an additional population of 3.3 million.Investment in new sewerage schemes has also underpinned record levels of new house building and job creation, along with economic expansion at a rate which we have never experienced at any time in our past.The new National Development Plan 2007-2013 provides for a €1 billion increase on the corresponding provision for water services in the last plan.  This will ensure that our achievements to date will continue to be built on in the years ahead.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I have no wish to play politics with the issue I wish to raise with the Taoiseach today.  I am deeply concerned at the breaking news that allegedly involves a 14 year old boy at the centre of a paedophile ring in Dublin.  Apparently this young boy's mother became aware of extremely inappropriate texts on his mobile phone and, having quizzed the young boy, it became apparent that he was being sexually abused by up to ten men.  He has given detailed evidence of his experience.  It is alleged that among the ten men in question were a member of the teaching profession and a fully attested garda.There is no worse tag in society than that of paedophile and there is no worse nightmare for a parent than that of paedophilia.  How many parents in this country have asked their children, over the years, to contact a garda if they had information or difficulties in this regard?  I do not wish to discuss the case under investigation but it would make a parent's blood run cold.I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that a certain seediness has crept into Irish society and it is now the case that the sexuality of young children is being commodified.  These reports, if true, make a mockery of the safeguards and criteria we lay down to protect our children.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could indicate any current reports he has on this matter as it is of such import.  If it is true that a 14 year old boy has been sexually abused by a paedophile ring of ten men, it may be that there are others, perhaps a significant number, who have been abused similarly.  From that perspective, this is a most distressing incident and one that is of very serious import for thousands of parents and children and the Government.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	132	On some matters I can give details to the House, while on others I cannot do so.  I join with Deputy Kenny in saying that this is a very disturbing and worrying matter and the information, in so far as I have it, fits both categories.  The House can be assured that the Garda is conducting a painstaking investigation into the serious allegations that have been made.  The reports, as outlined by the Deputy, are at least partially true.  In so far as I have the facts, at the end of last week, the mother of the boy in question, having seen the abusive, sexually-orientated messages on his mobile telephone, went in to Santry Garda station and handed the telephone over to the Garda.  She did the right thing.  Following an investigation over the weekend, I can confirm that a serving member of the Garda Síochána has been suspended and is under investigation along with a number of other persons.  I cannot confirm reports as to the professions or identities of the other people but I can confirm a number of other people are under investigation.  The investigation is at a critical stage and, as one would expect, the Garda will not give any information.  It would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment, other than to say the case is being treated very seriously by the Commissioner and senior gardaí.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I hope the Garda investigation is full and comprehensive.  I suggest that the Minister for Education and Science, through her Department, run an information campaign on this danger to young people, making particular use of the schools network.  I also suggest the Taoiseach speak to the chief executives of the mobile telephone companies.  From speaking to a number of them in the past, I am aware that it is possible to block pornographic material on mobile telephones.  Just as it is possible to block collections or forms of words on computers in schools, so too it may be possible to do something in respect of mobile telephone text messages.  That is not the main issue, however, in the sense that at least two members of noble professions are allegedly involved in this case.In December 2003, Deputy Enright made a series of proposals in respect of vetting those working with children.  Vetting is crucial given the number of parents over the years who have advised their children to speak to a garda if they have a difficulty or problem.  This matter is most distressing.As I pointed out last week, this issue is about protection and information about protection.  Did the Taoiseach consider issues arising from the referendum on protection for children over the weekend?  No difficulties arise in respect of the zone of absolute protection or the criteria which can be laid down for the use of soft information.  Perhaps the Taoiseach has considered having the matter dealt with speedily in view of the fact that the proposal is not opposed in the House.I hope this most serious development will be followed through by the Garda as urgently as possible.  I also hope that no other unfortunate children have been caught in this paedophile ring and that, arising from the Garda investigation, all necessary steps will be taken to deal with this most insidious destruction of innocence.  The issue extends beyond politics and concerns every public representative and parent.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I acknowledge the correctness and speed with which the mother in this case acted.  It has been difficult for her.  Obviously the Garda must undertake a painstaking investigation into very serious allegations which are being treated in a very serious manner.  People in positions of trust must understand that they have to be seen to be far removed from anything that breaks that trust.  This is the reason that early reports on the case in question, on which I do not have all the facts, paint a disturbing, worrying and sinister picture.On the broader question raised by the Deputy, a number of excellent campaigns about the safety of children were recently launched by the Minister of State with special responsibility for children and the National Children's Office.  A campaign was launched in education about the safety of the Internet and information and communications technology.  As of this year or last year, all new teachers have been vetted and the Garda has procedures in place.  As Deputy Kenny will be aware, it is not always easy to find these people in vetting systems.  The Garda investigation into this case has moved very quickly.  These matters only came to light last week.  The Garda is at a critical stage and is following through its investigations.The Minister of State with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is anxious to talk to Opposition spokespersons to try to come to a conclusion on the constitutional referendum.  I am hopeful this can be done over the next few days.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	135	Has the Government altered or varied in any way the Cabinet decision of last June concerning the siting of the national children's hospital?  Did the Taoiseach read today's edition of the Irish Examiner, which has secured information under the Freedom of Information Act to the effect that the Government was counselled during the month immediately prior to the Cabinet decision that the most feasible solution was a hospital under single governance with a campus on the north and south sides of Dublin?  I refer to the advice of Professor Denis Gill, a kidney specialist, who wrote to the Taoiseach stating that such a solution would make historical, geographical, religious and, perhaps, political sense.  He also stated that it is difficult to envisage there not being a paediatric service on both sides of the River Liffey.  Having regard to the controversy caused by the decision made on the site of the new hospital, the acute distress caused to many parents by the prospect of having to travel in today’s congested traffic conditions to a single inner city site, and the decision of the board of Our Lady’s Hospital for Sick Children at Crumlin, will the Taoiseach state clearly whether the Cabinet decision of last June stands or has been varied?Will the Taoiseach comment on the fact that when one reads more deeply into this matter, one finds that McKinsey & Company consultants were brought in and recommended a single, 300-bed hospital as the ideal solution for a population of 4.2 million?  The previous Government plans for the relocation of Temple Street and Crumlin hospitals show it was planned to construct 650 beds.  Consultants were then brought in, however, and we were told that 300 beds would be the ideal solution.It seems the Government can no longer make any decision without relying on an extremely expensive consultants' report, or hiding behind it as the case may be.  In many instances these consultants — I do not necessarily refer to McKinsey Consultants — are told by some senior person what answer is sought.  When they produce that answer, they get bucket loads of money in return.  One hears some of these consultants on the radio telling us that although their names decorated the notepaper on which the reports are written——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	142	There has been no review of the decision of last summer.  The position some years ago was that there were three children's hospitals in Dublin, each providing secondary care services for their respective catchment areas, and two providing tertiary care services on a national basis.Following its establishment, the HSE set up an external review of paediatric tertiary services.  This review found that the population and projected demands of the State could support only one world-class tertiary paediatric hospital.  The joint HSE and Department of Health and Children group was established to progress the necessary actions to set up a world-class tertiary paediatric hospital.  That was the decision and the process that took place.  There is no change in this regard.This means that the children's wing of Tallaght Hospital will continue to function except for the national element, that is, work that cannot be done other than in a state-of-the-art facility.  Children's beds will continue to be provided in several hospitals around the country.  The recommendation, however, is that there should be only one centre of excellence to deal with specialised cases.  Two units are not required.Prior to this recommendation, the position was that Crumlin Hospital would either stay where it was or that Temple Street Hospital would move to the Mater campus and that both would handle what would be considered sophisticated and more complex cases.  The review group said "No" to this option on the basis that it was not necessary for a country this size.  The recommendation was that simple cases would be facilitated in several locations, which, in Dublin, would include Tallaght Hospital, and that specialist work should be done in one unit.  Negotiations are ongoing between the various groups because there is not agreement in this regard.The Deputy is correct that Professor Gill gave me the advice that there should be two sites, which is what was going to happen before the external review was undertaken.  Professor Gill's view was that agreement would never be reached between the medics on two separate locations.  Previous to that, there was concern that the position of Temple Street Hospital would be eroded and that all the work would move to Crumlin.  This issue has been ongoing for some years.  Following the external review, the recommendation was that our population and the State's projected demands could support only one world-class tertiary paediatric hospital, wherever it was to be located.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	143	Nobody is disputing that complex and specialist medical procedures ought to be done at one site.  The issue raised by Professor Gill is whether it is feasible not to have a campus both northside and southside, taking into account also that some 40% of the children seeking treatment will come from outside Dublin.  Has Professor Gill's view not been borne out?  The Government's position sounds credible enough until one looks at it closely.  The Government is sheltering behind the review group which, as the Taoiseach put it, said "No" to the original plan.  Prior to that, however, other Government bodies recommended 650 beds in two locations.So what if the review group recommended one site with 300 beds?  The Government was previously proceeding with the plan to provide 650 beds on two sites and a large amount of money had already been spent on the Mater site as part of this plan.  We are now proceeding on the basis that Tallaght Hospital has been seriously downgraded and commitments given on the charter are not being observed.  Crumlin Hospital says it refuses to be "shoehorned" into the site at the Mater.  There is serious traffic congestion in Dublin city and one cannot park a bicycle at the Mater Hospital.  Yet the Taoiseach says there is no change in the Government decision and that it will go ahead with a single-site solution based at the Mater Hospital.I do not believe this decision will persist regardless of which parties are on that side of the House after the election.  There is widespread acute distress among thousands of parents in west Dublin, north Kildare and west Wicklow about the deprivation of services at Tallaght Hospital.  In respect of the catchment area and high reputation of Crumlin Hospital, nobody knows what will happen in circumstances where it refuses to co-operate with what is now proposed.  The Taoiseach has not told me much that is new.  I am surprised to hear him reaffirming the Government decision.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	144	The Deputy asked me whether there is a change in the position and I said there is not.  I am sorry I cannot tell him anything new.  The Deputy is well aware of the history of this issue, as am I.  The position several years ago was that we had three hospitals in Dublin providing secondary care services for their respective catchment areas.  I do not see any change in the Tallaght position, whatever happens.  Tallaght Hospital has not undertaken sophisticated specialised work and so there is no change in its position.  There was a question, since Harcourt Street Hospital closed down, whether cases have been taken in either Temple Street or Crumlin hospitals.  There is no question that both of these are excellent hospitals.Before the establishment of the HSE, the intention and plan, for some 20 years, was to move the Temple Street site to the Mater campus and set up a new unit there, something I strongly supported.  The view was that Crumlin Hospital, because it was an old hospital built when the State had few resources, should be rebuilt on that or some other site and should continue as a children's hospital.  The HSE's view, however, was that to go ahead and build new hospitals at the Mater and Crumlin was the wrong action to take.  This was the professional view of Professor Drumm and others.  The HSE brought in an international team to examine the issue and it formed the view that there should be only one specialist unit — not one children's hospital — to do the sophisticated work.  That is its position and there is no change from that.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	155	A shocking report published today by the European Environment Agency states that in Ireland, greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector since 1990 were almost six times higher than the European Union average.  This confirms the report last week by the Environmental Protection Agency that ten years after minimal targets were agreed in Kyoto, ten years during which this Government was in power, this country has doubled those emissions.  Worryingly, it was not just in the early days of this Government but in 2004, 2005 and 2006 that the increases continued apace, with transport being the biggest contributor, particularly road transport, while emissions from air transport have also drastically increased.The Environmental Protection Agency puts the increases down to increasing vehicle numbers, larger vehicles, increased reliance on private cars and increasing road freight.  It points out that emissions from energy generation in the State are also a factor.  Does this not reflect a total failure by the Government in its ten years in power to make any serious effort to implement definitive policies that would drastically cut carbon emissions?Specifically, the Taoiseach is presiding over the complete winding down of rail freight transport.  The Government has failed to transform public transport infrastructure to enable tens of thousands of people in cities and towns, and I include myself, to change from being forced into private transport to taking public transport.  The Government has not curbed the crazy situation where airlines are allowed to relentlessly advertise in competition with each other to convince us to go everywhere every second weekend just to blow our noses, while attacking workers' conditions to maximise their profits.A third of the population lives in Dublin so why do buses from the hugely populated suburbs such as Swords or Ongar still proceed at a snail's pace daily, mired in traffic while meandering like Wanderly Wagon around estates before getting to the city centre, when an efficient system could be implemented, with continuous bus corridors and enough buses that would get people from Clonee to Dublin city in 35 minutes, enabling tens of thousands to transfer to public transport?  That is the way forward, why is it not being done in a proactive way?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	156	As usual, I do not agree with Deputy Joe Higgins.  It has been the success of the economy and the generation of growth and employment which has brought us to this position, not the opposite.On the growth in transport emissions, we are behind most European countries in car ownership but increased prosperity has brought about increased car ownership rates, one of the main reasons the country is above the target for greenhouse gas emissions that we must meet in the next few years.Transport emissions pose a particular challenge to this country but they are only one element of greenhouse gas emissions.  Seven of the EU 15, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain, are much further from the EU targets than Ireland in the report the Deputy referred to.  Our progress is reflected in the emissions intensity of the economy.  In 2004, emissions per unit of GDP were only 48% of what they were at the 1990 level, while the equivalent figure in the European Union is 78%.  The growth in transport emissions reflects that a significant volume of fuel, petrol and diesel sold for use outside the State is accounted for in our country's emissions.Our massive investment in public transport under Transport 21 covered the issues the Deputy raised.  It is central to putting transport on a more sustainable footing in Ireland.  In addition we continue to take measures to incentivise low emission vehicles and bio-fuels.  In the budget in December, we announced a rebalancing of vehicle registration tax and road tax.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	158	From January carbon dioxide emissions rather than engine size will provide the basis for these taxes.  The proposals and rebalancing initiatives are currently open for public consultation.I agree about the bus corridors, that is why we bought over 100 new buses.  I also agree with the Deputy about rail transport, that is why we bought 60 new rail cars, with 12 being introduced this month.  There are other plans to buy more buses.

Why are public transport subsidies among the lowest in the European Union under this Government over the last ten years?  Why are our electricity generating stations burning more peat now when alternative energy sources have been available for years and have not been sufficiently invested in by the State to replace carbon emitting generation?Is it not extraordinary that in this country and internationally, faced with this real crisis that everyone agrees threatens ecosystems and humanity, the political establishment will establish a stock exchange in carbon emissions to move the issue into another speculators' charter, buying and selling the right to pollute?  Is that not an incredible indictment of the approach of this and other Governments?Two Ministers last week were out pretending to be champions of the taxpayer with regard to the legal costs of the planning tribunal, one of whom has responsibility for emissions.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	166	No, I am merely contrasting that with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government ignoring the massive fines and waste of taxpayers' money he is leaving the country exposed to by virtue of not cutting emissions back.Instead of these transport plans for 2015 or whenever, could we have practical, immediate measures, particularly with regard to bus services in this and other cities, that will enable us all to make the switch by tens of thousands to public transport, giving us a better quality of life in the process?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	167	In the past year we have invested more than €80 million into Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus — I believe it will be the same this year — and there are the new Korean trains.  The Deputy cannot make those arguments without acknowledging that there is huge investment.  It is not in the future, in ten or 15 years' time.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	169	It is happening now.  There has probably been more investment in the past two years than there was at any period over the decades.  It is an enormous amount.  The entire public transport budget for this year is not much short of €800 million.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	172	The Lanesboro peat station and the peat station in the midlands both operate with new technology which is highly efficient.  Security of supply is obviously enormously important.  The Finns, who are on top of the list in all these issues, use peat because of their resources.  If the Deputy believes we should not be doing that, he has the wrong end of it.  We have a high reliance on fossil fuels for power generation.  Last week I spelt out what we are doing in the agricultural sector and cement production.  We also have a high level of fuel purchases for use outside the State.  It is estimated that 10% of petrol and 25% of diesel sold in this country was consumed outside the State.  Those figures, of course, are put in as 18% of total emissions from road transport.On the question of things being done now, we have set a steeply ambitious target to deliver one third of electricity from renewable sources of energy.  We have maximum use of new technologies for co-generation of power stations.  We have biomass and planning for the use of carbon capture and clean coal generation, all of which is happening now.  Creating opportunity for farmers in bio-fuel production, creating a new bio-fuel industry in the country, introducing a minimum requirement for the use of bio-fuels in State-owned and public transport vehicles, starting with Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, both of which have been instructed to move all their existing fleet to 5% biodiesel blend——

Will the Taoiseach comment on the statement by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the St. Andrews Agreement would not have happened were it not for the fact that he was in Government?  I am sure the body language around the Cabinet table was very interesting on that matter.

The Government's view is that both issues are necessary and essential and we should do both together.  I would like to put them to the people in the short term but if that is not possible I will put them to the people in the long term.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am pleased to present the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2007 for the consideration of the House.  This Bill is important.  Not only will it provide a framework for critical services such as an emergency call answering service, but when enacted, it will greatly strengthen the powers of ComReg, the communications regulator, to enable greater competition in the electronic communications market.The Commission for Communications Regulation, or ComReg, as it is more commonly known, was established in 1996 as the then Office of the Director of Telecoms Regulation.  We have come a long way since then.  The market was fully liberalised in 1999 and the communications landscape has been completely overhauled and transformed in the past decade.  We now have more than 300 private operators in the communications arena and a mobile phone penetration rate of 100%.  Consumers now have choices in terms of products and services that would have been undreamt of previously.  Communications are an integral part of our daily lives.  They drive businesses forward, open new and strengthen existing networks, and negate many of the disadvantages of being an island nation.  They are a strategically important part of our economy.Creating an open and competitive market is a key challenge.  The current regulatory framework is based on competition law principles and aims to ensure fair competition between service providers, some of whom dominate for historical structural reasons.  However, the evidence to date does not show the market to be moving towards a fully competitive state.  ComReg's market analyses have found significant market power in both the fixed and mobile markets.Regulatory remedies are key to realising the benefits of a competitive market and the Bill aims to enhance ComReg's powers in this regard.  The Bill confers on ComReg competition law powers similar to that of the Competition Authority, so that it can investigate and prosecute restrictive agreements and practices, but only in regard to the communications sector.  These powers are similar to the powers of the UK regulatory authority in regard to the telecoms sector and which have proven very effective in opening up the broadband market in the UK.  Strong powers to prosecute specific anti-competitive behaviour are needed to encourage compliance among market players, especially the larger players.The communications sector is a fast paced and exciting one.  Terms such as broadband, texting, convergence, and Internet hotspots are now ubiquitous.  Whether we like it or not, texting has even introduced its own form of language.  One term, however, with which we are all too familiar is that of local loop unbundling, LLU.  Local loop unbundling is a key requirement to stimulate more competition in Ireland's broadband market and to increase broadband take-up.  It has been legally mandated since 2000 but has been difficult to implement in practice, despite the regulatory steps taken by ComReg.  Latest figures for LLU in Ireland remain low.  Approximately 20,000 lines were unbundled by the end of 2006.  This is not good enough.Delays in unbundling create serious economic and operational problems for other operators, and militate against customers being able to benefit from the innovation, choice and prices available in other markets such as the UK, France, etc.  LLU has worked in other countries.  One can ask what is so different here.  There have been calls from many quarters, even from the Opposition, to give ComReg enhanced powers, so as "to give the regulator teeth" and "to unleash the watchdog".  Competitiveness in the communications sector is a significant factor in determining national competitiveness and it is essential that we get the regulatory balance right.  The proposals in the Bill were drafted in consultation with ComReg and there has been full consultation with the key players in the market.  The Bill is a measured and proportionate step towards this goal.While the primary purpose of the Bill is to strengthen ComReg's enforcement powers so that it can better achieve its function of promoting competition, and confers on ComReg competition law powers similar to the Competition Authority, the Bill also provides for information gathering powers, the establishment of an emergency call handling service and the regulation by ComReg of the ".ie" Internet domain name.I will highlight the main provisions of the Bill for the House.  The legislation is divided into four parts.  Part 1 contains standard preliminary provisions.  Part 2 contains the main provisions giving additional functions and enforcement powers to ComReg.  Part 3 amends the Electronic Commerce Act to provide for the regulation by ComReg of the ".ie" domain name.  Part 4 of the Bill amends the Competition Act to give ComReg powers under that Act to investigate and prosecute offences such as abuse of dominance.Part 2 of the Bill amends the Communications Regulation Act, hereafter referred to as the principal Act, to confer some additional functions on ComReg.  It will monitor the operation of the emergency call answering service that is to be established in lieu of the service currently provided and paid for by Eircom.  It is proposed that the provision of the new service will be tendered for and funded by a per call fee to be determined by ComReg and paid by public access telecommunications providers who forward emergency calls to the centre.  It is also proposed that ComReg will monitor the quality of the service and report annually to me, as the Minister with responsibility for communications, on its operation.ComReg may collect and disseminate information from undertakings for the purpose of contributing to an open and competitive market and for statistical purposes.  Information is key to effective regulation.  ComReg's current information gathering powers were not expressly designed for general statistical purposes.  The Bill now expressly gives ComReg powers in this regard.  Deficiencies or delays associated with the provision of information to ComReg have a direct effect on its ability to share information with other organisations, such as the European Commission or the OECD.  ComReg is mindful of the burden that data collection imposes on operators and has sought to assist operators by specifying particular data requirements that do not apply to them.  ComReg's function to carry out investigations as a result of complaints from undertakings and consumers is being broadened to include the ability to carry out investigations on its own initiative.  This will increase ComReg's effectiveness as the regulator of the industry.Section 6 of the Bill provides that I, as Minister, can obtain information from ComReg and undertakings that will assist me in formulating policies and plans to deal with any network security issues that may arise.  This is important because of the growing reliance we place on the telecommunications networks as individuals and as a society.  It is vital that, in order to formulate policies regarding the security of the networks, I have the most relevant information possible at my disposal.  ComReg is also granted certain information gathering powers to be exercised in the pursuance of its functions.Section 7 provides protection for whistleblowers who disclose appropriate information to ComReg.  This is line with Government policy to provide such protection in new legislation and should encourage employees of undertakings to expose and report wrongdoing they reasonably believe to be occurring.  Protection for operators is also provided for by creating an offence of knowingly providing incorrect information.In the interests of transparency, section 9 of the Bill requires ComReg to publish annual plans and associated budgets relating to the principal work items it proposes to undertake in the following year.  These will complement the existing financial information in its annual report and the strategies outlined in its strategy statement and will be of interest not just to the industry who funds these strategies, but also to a wider audience.  It is reasonable that companies in the communications and postal sector that fund ComReg's activities should have more information as to how the levies paid to ComReg are spent.The Bill inserts a new part in the principal Act that will allow ComReg to require persons to appear before it to give evidence or produce a document that relates to a matter concerning the performance or exercise of any of its functions or objectives.  This is based on a similar provision in the Competition Act that empowers the Competition Authority to require witnesses to attend before it and is in addition to ComReg's authorised officers powers, thereby substantially increasing the effectiveness of ComReg's investigatory powers, which is important in the context of proper enforcement.  This provision allows ComReg to put the onus on an operator to give evidence or produce documents, rather than ComReg having to search for them, and like the Competition Act, protections and privileges are built into this section for anyone required to attend before ComReg.Section 13 of the Bill creates a new offence for overcharging consumers.  I do not suggest there is widespread overcharging in the market but it is appropriate, given ComReg's overarching regulatory remit in the communications sector, to remedy any absence of power in this area.  This provision is essentially about consumer protection.Section 14 of the Bill is the cornerstone of enhancing ComReg's enforcement powers.  In addition to the principal Act, the current regulatory regime derives from the directives transposed in 2003 under the European Communities Act 1972.  Summary proceedings are provided for, with a maximum fine of €3,000 and the option of civil proceedings for non-compliance with obligations under that regime.  There are no indictable offences as these are prohibited under the 1972 Act.  However, enforcement is a key part of effective regulation and appropriate remedies and sanctions are vital to secure regulatory compliance.  Penalties for summary offences may be of little consequence to operators in such a high value industry and have little deterrent effect.  Section 14 of the Bill provides an enabling mechanism whereby the Minister with responsibility for communications can, by regulation, provide for offences under those regulations to be tried on indictment, with penalties of up to €4 million or 10% of turnover, whichever is greater.  Penalties of this magnitude are necessary in an industry where total revenues for the fixed, mobile and broadcasting markets stand at an estimated €4 billion per annum.In a fast changing, dynamic industry such as the electronic communications sector, it is important to be able to legislate in a timely and effective manner.  For example, the current EU framework, which comprised five directives and was only transposed in 2003, is already under review and the EU Commission will propose changes to it later this year.  Any proposed changes will need to be implemented speedily if competition in the market is to be strengthened and maintained.I am confident that this provision for making regulations with the possibility of indictable proceedings, limited to the communications sector, is a progressive step and will help improve the regulatory framework in Ireland.  Any regulations made under the principal Act, as amended by this Bill, will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and be subject to scrutiny and annulment within 21 days.Section 14 also provides for some enhancements for prosecution procedures under this Act.  These provisions relate to the admissibility of expert evidence, the provision of documents to juries, presumption as to the authenticity of certain documents, and statements within documents.  They are based on similar provisions in competition law and will prove useful because legal proceedings in this sector can be technical and specialised.Section 15 of the Bill will allow ComReg to ensure access for operators to physical infrastructure by extending ComReg's remit here to cover situations where the physical infrastructure owner, such as a property developer, is not bound by general authorisation conditions.  Ensuring access to physical infrastructure is an important element of the communications framework because much of the infrastructure in this sector is not easily replicable for reasons of scale, investment, and natural monopoly.  ComReg will now be able to enforce access against owners of physical infrastructure, such as property developers, by seeking a court order.  This will help ensure more choice for consumers, particularly in new property developments, where exclusive contracts restrict consumers' choice.Section 16 of the Bill inserts a new Part 6 into the principal Act that provides for me as the Minister to enter into a contract with an undertaking for the provision of an emergency call answering service.  This section also provides for ComReg to regulate the price the undertaking shall charge for the handling of emergency calls.  It also provides for a payment regime where the undertaking shall charge the operator who forwards emergency calls on a per call basis.Part 3 of the Bill amends the Electronic Commerce Act 2000 to provide for the regulation of the .ie domain by ComReg.  It provides for the powers given to me as Minister, pursuant to the Electronic Commerce Act, to be transferred to ComReg.  This part also provides ComReg with powers to designate an interim authority and to have access to the registry files to ensure that the functioning of the .ie Internet domain name is secure at all times.The European regulatory framework for communications is based on competition law principles.  Following discussion with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am introducing in this Bill provisions to give ComReg powers similar to those of the Competition Authority so that it can investigate and prosecute restrictive agreements and practices, but only in respect of the communications sector.The Competition Authority is charged with enforcing competition law in the whole of the economy, not just the telecommunications area.  Giving ComReg similar powers enables it to prioritise competition investigations in the communications industry, which is where its expertise lies.  Provision is made for a co-operation agreement between both bodies so that there is no duplication of resources, and so that expertise and experience can be shared.The communications sector is of major importance to the economy and therefore, it is important that abuse of dominance issues are adequately addressed.  The promotion of competition in the sector will enhance the attractiveness of the sector for investors, and provide more choice for consumers.The Bill provides for increased penalties for obligations that already exist under the EU regulatory framework of 2003 and provisions to facilitate more effective prosecutions by ComReg.  Compliant operators have nothing to fear.  Aside from compliance with the new information gathering powers for both the Minister and ComReg, emergency call handling fees and the obligation not to overcharge, there are no new obligations for operators in the Bill.The Government's communications regulation policy is to create a legislative framework, in line with the EU regulatory framework, that provides for the development of strategic and competitive communications networks and services.  This Bill is a timely enhancement of the regulator's powers.  It will give ComReg the necessary tools to ensure the development of competition in the market and will provide the regulatory certainty that will encourage new investment by existing operators and entice new entrants into the market.Over the coming period, we will look to the regulator to deliver on its commitments and to the operators to deliver on their obligations.  I will propose several amendments on Committee Stage, but these should not substantially alter the nature of the Bill.  I look forward to hearing the views of the Members of this House on the Bill and their assistance in facilitating its early passage into law.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I would like to be able to welcome the Bill because for the past four or five years there has been much debate about the need for regulation that benefits the consumer in the telecommunications area.  The Bill, however, is ineffective because it is too little too late, and the proposals it contains are unlikely to reverse the slide that has taken place in this area over the past six or seven years.  I do not blame the Minister for that but it is opportune for us now to examine the extent to which this country has fallen so far from its leading position ten years ago.  It is now trailing among the back markers.  There was no reason for that to happen.It happened because the regulatory system of EU law transposed into Irish law does not protect the consumer.  Instead it creates situations in which the consumer suffers considerably.  Last year, for example, at the time of the Smart Telecom problem, we on this side of the House approached the regulator to find out what went wrong, and why the Minister had not been aware of this beforehand and issued a warning to the 80,000 or 100,000 customers left without service overnight.  While I mean no disrespect to the regulator and recognise the difficult position it was in, the response we received was that the regulator was aware of the problem and had tried to bring it along as best it could.  That is not good enough.In parts of the country the local overground cabling for broadband and other services is tied up by a piece of rope to a tree.  I can bring photographic confirmation of that into the House if necessary.  That in itself is not the issue but indicates a more deep-rooted problem, going back to 1969, 1970 and 1979 when the telecommunications industry here was falling apart and needed major investment.  That has been forgotten.  The regulatory system over the past eight or nine years has allowed the infrastructure to drift to such an extent that many customers around the country are screaming for assistance to get broadband.  I am informed that in some parts of the country ducting for cabling has been put down but nothing else has happened.  Provision has been made in theory but the connections have not been made.A former Member of this House was asked many years ago to provide a telephone kiosk in a particular constituency, which he duly did.  When people complained that the telephone in the kiosk did not work he asked why and they said there were no cables.  His response was that nobody said anything about cables.  They were not part of the deal.  The situation today is similar.  I do not blame the Minister for that but he is in the driving seat and somebody must accept responsibility for whatever happens.  If Deputy Broughan or I were sitting in the Minister's place and he was in ours he would be one of the first to point the finger and ask what we had been doing and why we had not delivered the goods.  He would ask the cause of the late conversion and activity to deal with issues that should have been dealt with before now.Business people and industries around the country are moving from one location to another because they cannot get access to modern broadband facilities and a proper telecommunications service where they are.  That is an appalling indictment of the country in the 21st century, when it should be one of the leading lights in Europe.  Where has it all gone wrong?  Why was action not taken sooner?  The regulator, sadly, is the meat in the sandwich, not being a Minister, a regulator or a service provider.  He or she is, sadly, in all camps and in none.  After all, the regulator cannot offend the Government.  Who could offend the Government and expect to live after it?  That would be an appalling thought.  Nor can it be seen to offend the service providers too much.  There are a number of potential service providers and offending one could enhance the position of the other and vice versa.  That is a difficult situation.  Who suffers at the end of the day?  The unfortunate consumer pays the price.There was outlandish carry-on in the communications committee recently.  A major investigation took place into how to provide telecommunications services in some parts of the country, such as the Black Valley in Kerry, parts of the midlands and other areas where there are no communications whatsoever.  If they had a mobile telephone service, they might get some other services.  An internal investigation took place as to how best to deal with the situation.  In God's name, what are we at?  Surely we should know these things.  It should be possible to make a telephone call and inquire from somebody how the service will be provided and when it will be provided.  We should not have the current stupid situation where there is a stream of reports, Ministers running around the constituencies and even the poor chairman of the communications committee being dragged down on a wet afternoon to walk around the countryside in an effort to find out why proper communications cannot be provided in, for example, the Black Valley.  There are other parts of the country where battery systems are still being used for communications.It is appalling that in the century after humans put a man on the moon we are unable to provide communications on land in a relatively small country.  I accept there are deep ravines in Kerry and along the western and eastern seaboards, but I am sure there are equally deep ravines on the moon.  However, we succeeded in putting communications on the moon and receiving a signal back from there.  What, therefore, is going on here?A number of issues are not dealt with in the Bill, even though they could have been dealt with.  The Bill should be broader and should encompass far more than it does.  The same problem applies to the broadcasting Bill.  We have been discussing that Bill for the past four or five years.  When it appeared, however, it was merely a truncated version of what we had hoped for and intended in the first instance.Let us consider how competition has and has not worked in this sector.  Look at Smart Telecom, for example.  A large number of customers were discommoded and instantly left without services.  They did not know that there had been an ongoing row between two service providers for some time.  It should not have been allowed to go on for that time.  The customers should have been alerted to what was happening.  The Minister should also have been alerted.  I do not know if he was but if he was, he remained silent.  He should indicate why he remained silent.  What happened afterwards?  My information is that 80% of those whose service was discontinued at that time returned to one service provider.  Is that competition and regulation?  Is that how they should work?  I think not.  It is a serious indictment of how this system is working.It is generally agreed that to provide a proper communications system there is an ongoing requirement for annual investment in line with the value of the company and in keeping with the requirements of the modern consumer.  It is necessary to bring the company's infrastructure up to date on an annual basis by ensuring there is an annual investment that will keep that company sharp, at the leading edge and in a position to deliver high quality service to the consumer.  There is nothing about that or even remotely associated with it in the Bill.It seems to be possible to do it in other countries.  I am sick of listening to people tell me that we cannot have things here because of regulations, European legislation or some other reason.  Eastern European countries came late to this industry but they are now ahead of us.  It affects a plethora of disciplines.  In medicine, for example, a modern, efficient and effective telecommunications system is vital.  It is important that video case conferences can take place.  Operations can be performed on one side of the world while advice is simultaneously received from the other side, provided communications are readily available.  The financial services sector is also dependent on communications.So many areas need attention in terms of modernisation it is embarrassing.  In the past 12 months I was talking to a group of people who, ten or 15 years ago, hosted people from the business and banking sector abroad who came to this country to see what was happening and to get inspiration and advice.  Now, however, they are being told by their hosts that this country is not as up to speed as it was formerly.  Sadly, that is the situation.I put down numerous questions, which were disallowed, regarding the relevance of the communications sector to, and asking the Minister to take action on, the use of the Internet for pornographic purposes and for the abuse of children either through bullying or being pursued by paedophiles and so forth.  The Minister indicated to the Taoiseach today that legislation is already in place.  It is not.  The technical know-how is available to track these activities, which are the subject of much discussion at present.Policing is a separate matter; it occurs after the event.  To be able to spot a risk before it happens or before it becomes an epidemic is when the technology is called into play.  The EU Commission has already indicated its preference that the industry adopts the most modern technology to ensure that sexual predators on the Internet are spotted at an early stage and put out of business.  It is that simple.  It is not rocket science.  We talk about these problems and say something should be done, yet nothing is done.  Children and women become victims as a result.  A great deal more could have been included in this Bill to cover a huge range of areas.  Instead, it barely touches the surface of those issues when it could be far more effective.I already referred to ComReg as the meat or jam in the sandwich.  I do not wish to be offensive to ComReg.  However, the unfolding situation requires something different to address the issues I have mentioned.  We have options.  We can do nothing, avoid the issue, say everything is fine and claim that in five or seven years we will be better off.  I have bad news for people of that view.  The communications area is part of the backbone of our economy and if we do not take action at an early date we will give the wrong signal — no pun intended — to those involved in this and other industries, which are huge investment areas in this country at present.  Many large international business concerns see our telecommunications system as a weakness.  While it is fine to recognise the weakness, the means and wherewithal to address it are more important.  Our telecommunications system is from an old-fashioned era, while across the world, the telecommunications industry is rising to the challenge, meeting the requirements and attending to the needs of its customers.Applying for a telephone line to one's house is a similar process to what it was in 1979.  Then one had to be gifted to get service.  What has gone wrong?

Why, every day, do Opposition Members receive so many letters from people who cannot get broadband or even a telephone?  Technologically, Ireland was supposed to have gone ahead in leaps and bounds to be world leader in this area.  Why, instead of ducking and diving, is the problem not tackled head on?What went wrong with local loop unbundling?  Great claims were made of EU legislation in this area and how it would be of benefit to the consumer.  Local loop unbundling is a joke and does not work the way it was intended to.  I appreciate the main service providers will try to hold on to what they can.  There is no sense in pretending we have a new system that will deliver to the consumer.  Why is the telecommunications sector still stick in a rut while every other EU country is progressing?  Ten years ago our telecommunications system was ahead of that in the UK but now it is ahead of us.  People will argue it has a different system.  The Minister will argue that we cannot do what we would like to in enforcement.  There are those who will claim enforcement is too harsh yet ineffective at the same time.  That is a deliberate contradiction.Over the past few years, I have pointed out the degree to which Ministers will devolve responsibility to others who will not be required to seek the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a dangerous situation and part of the Bill's proposals will do this.  The Minister will claim we cannot have it both ways but neither can the other parties in the telecommunications sector.  Best parliamentary practice should be followed as to how such matters are dealt with.  In the telecommunications area, best practice should be that if draconian measures are to be taken and someone is put out of or into business, it should be specifically provided for by way of approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Recommendations for regulation should not necessarily be laid in the Oireachtas Library for 21 days, hoping that no one notices and they slip through.Recent EU legislation highlighted the dangers involved in the transposition of EU regulations into Irish law.  During a debate on EU regulations, I pointed out that the poor Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government could have been imprisoned as a result of not doing his job.  That would be terrible.  No Member would want to see the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government imprisoned for the manner in which EU law was transposed.  This is another weakness in the Bill.The Minister claims that even the Opposition was calling for legislation in this area.  I do not know what he means by "even the Opposition".  It brings to mind the lines, "Even the ranks of Tuscany could scarce forbear to cheer".  In this situation, they will not be cheering at all.

It is not personal because I really am fond of them but can someone impress upon them the seriousness of the telecommunications situation?  Ireland, one of the wealthiest states in the world — some even claim it is the wealthiest — cannot get its telecommunications systems up and running.  Other Members will illustrate how daft is the situation and the ends to which people must go to get telephone lines installed.The Bill does not provide for a director of enforcement, specifically responsible for the enforcement of communications regulations.  The Minister will claim this is provided for in existing competition legislation.  I do not believe this will work because I fear it may take some time for several bodies — the Minister, the service providers, the Competition Authority, for example — to reach a conclusion and take any action.The Minister claims the Bill will enhance enforcement and investigating powers for ComReg.  What investigation took place over the Smart Telecom events several months ago?  What powers were exercised by ComReg and what action was taken to protect the consumers' cause?  What action was taken to protect business customers who were affected, not just domestically but internationally?  What provision was made to protect the customer who wished to transmit information just ten miles down the road?  None.  The Minister claims that while the Bill proposes to create indictable offences for breaches of enforcement measures imposed by ComReg, enforcement is a key part of effective regulation and appropriate remedies and sanctions are vital to secure regulatory compliance.  That sounds very good, and it is true, but it does not happen.  The Bill also provides ComReg with competition powers similar to those of the Competition Authority in the telecommunications sector that would allow ComReg to investigate and take action on issues such as the abuse of dominance.  I thought some alarm bells would have rung in recent years to indicate something wrong.  Perhaps we did not address the situation in this country to the extent we should have done.What worries me most is this.  Some believe we have reached a crisis in the delivery of such services as broadband as part of a modern communications service.  If there is a crisis, serious action must be taken.  If, as the Minister has admitted many times, for some reason it has not been possible to deliver services to the widest possible community nationwide without restriction or qualification, we must identify the precise issues or obstacles.  That is not rocket science; it is simple.  I mean identifying and then addressing the reasons we have been unable to provide the service.  Sadly, it looks like that will not happen, and there is nothing in the Bill to suggest any intention to take serious action in the area.I wonder whether the Minister and the regulator recognise the implications of continued complacency in the sector.  Communications are the backbone of a modern, developing economy.  The degree to which services of cutting-edge, state-of-the-art quality can be provided when necessary is a hallmark by which the country's economy may well be judged.  We must look very carefully at what we have done and left undone.  It reminds me of the poster on which were the words "A lot done, more to do".  In this case, one might say "An awful lot undone, an awful lot more still left to do, and very little time left in which to do it".I remember a few years ago, when the Minister had notions of establishing an independent telecommunications structure.  We were told, for example, that there would be a separation of Eircom's retail and wholesale business.  Although that was trotted out some time ago, it has never happened, and it now looks like it never will.  One could say at this stage that we are no further in dealing with such issues than four or five years ago.  It is obvious that until such time as the Minister recognises that and directs the separation of some of this country's service infrastructure, we will not have the degree of independence and competition necessary to benefit the consumer.

We have waited an exceptionally long time for it; I believe it was first mooted as long ago as 2002, not long after the original 2002 Act.  It is uncanny, if not eerie, that the Act it amends was also passed in the dying days of an outgoing Government.  That Government was of course returned, but the Bill was passed very late in the parliamentary session.In the interim, the Irish telecommunications sector has often been marked by chaotic and obstructive behaviour on the part of operators and serious allegations of collusion, with the result that there have been astonishingly low levels of customer service from many.  That has played a major role in the disastrous broadband deficit that continues to afflict Ireland and leaves us languishing at the bottom of every international broadband league table.Lethargy regarding regulatory reform during most of the Government's time in office has meant the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, his predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government generally have stifled the growth and innovation necessary to maintain a world-beating communications sector.  The Government's ennui on this matter continues to threaten our national competitiveness and long-term economic prosperity.  For example, a few weeks ago, Magnet Networks reported it was moving its emphasis from consumer-based broadband services provided through local loop unbundling, LLU, to other products, in other words, from households to commercial firms, because of its basic inability to operate effectively and profitably in a sector where LLU was still so underdeveloped.Also last week, BT once again criticised the difficult regulatory market for the Irish telecommunications industry.  There was media speculation that the losses of €1 billion recently posted by the company could lead to job losses, since broadband roll-out and services development have been hampered so much by the flawed regulatory environment.  We could name many other examples of companies floundering in this market owing to Government failures.For those reasons, almost two years ago, the Labour Party and I published a document entitled Enabling Ireland's Future.  In it I laid out the policies I felt should form the basis of the telecommunications market.  Since several of those policies are in the Bill before us, we generally welcome what the Minister has presented.  Regarding comments made by Deputy Durkan's colleague last week, we know the Minister and his civil servants are avid readers of Opposition policies.  I particularly welcome the fact the Minister has agreed to implement the policies we advocated two years ago on co-competition powers for ComReg, fines up to 10% of turnover, an emergency call-answering service, and greater regulation of the .ie domain registry.I am only sorry that it has taken the Minister so long to produce this critical legislation.  There are 12 or 14 matters we would like to address in amendments.  I thank the civil servants from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for the excellent briefing they gave me and the other spokespersons.

Deputy Durkan will remember we spent the entire first part of a two-day debate on the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2006 in committee discussing the phenomenon whereby the same operator can now offer a land line, perhaps a mobile telephone, broadband, and video on demand.  One must therefore ask if the Bill before us should not have gone much further.  I suggested we consider a single regulator covering most of the non-content communications landscape, given the speed with which the market has developed.Another difficulty the Opposition has with the Bill is the new Part 7 and Schedule 1, the miscellaneous provisions section, which detail a wide range of enactments and statutory instruments for which no detailed background information is to hand.  It is therefore quite difficult to invigilate those elements.One of the most serious examples of massive regulatory failure to have occurred in Ireland was the recent Smart Telecom debacle.  On Tuesday, 3 October 2006, more than 45,000 Smart Telecom business and domestic customers awoke to find their telephone and Internet services suspended.  They included families across the country and businesses such as medical centres with no telephone or Internet access for patients to contact them.  It was incredible that tens of thousands of customers could be summarily cut off and left with absolutely no telecommunications service.  That happened under the Minister's regime.  Where were the Minister and the regulator during the affair?  How was it allowed to happen?  Has the Minister received any report on this matter and, if so, will he present it to the House?During the later hearings by the Joint Committee on Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources on this mess, ComReg signally failed to adequately address its role in the fiasco or explain why no advance warning was provided for Smart Telecom customers.  ComReg did indicate, however, that it would like to see the development of a statutory basis for notice of withdrawal of service by any telecoms operator.  At the time I indicated that the Labour Party would support and encourage such a measure as a key element of an effective telecommunications policy.  The Bill provides for investigation and information powers but why is such a direct measure not included in the legislation?  In the middle of the Smart Telecom fiasco, the Minister told us during Question Time that he would rush through emergency legislation but I cannot see anything to address that type of debacle in the Bill before us.

When my great constituency predecessor, Conor Cruise O'Brien, was Minister, one could get a phone line faster than under the current Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey.My colleague, Deputy Stagg, has told me of local residents in Griffinrath, Maynooth; Easton Gardens, Leixlip; the Beeches in Straffan; and Ryebridge in Kilcock who have been left hanging on for months for essential phone lines.  Those areas are not exactly on top of a mountain; in fact, they are on the edge of the greater Dublin area.  A few weeks ago on the Joe Duffy show, we heard irate customers of NTL and Perlico making serious complaints about services.  The Minister may say that the Bill will change that situation and hopefully it will, but the problems remain.  In recent days, Mr. Gerry Ryan's excellent radio show on 2FM has allowed consumers to ventilate major grievances over delays in installing phone lines.Last week, ComReg released a report on the provision of the universal service by Eircom — the company's key responsibility for landlines — which detailed that 99% of residential public service telephone network provision requests are granted within 115 working days and in an astonishing 171 working days during the previous quarter.

The outgoing Minister has presided over this track record, but it is not one of which he can be proud.  The Minister should have inserted provisions in the Bill to address these unacceptably long waiting times.The communications regulator, Mr. Mike Byrne, said it takes ten days for a line to migrate from Eircom to a landline competitor.  He asked why it should take so long and why it should not be instantaneous.  We could have inserted in the Bill a general requirement for companies in this regard.Parallel to the service contract failures that I have already mentioned is one of the most critical failures arising from the regulator's weak powers — that is the absolutely disastrous roll out of broadband.  I understand that we are now reaching approximately 500,000 lines but that only amounts to 12% of the total and leaves us way down at the bottom of the table.A recent ComReg survey showed that 33% of narrowband users have attempted to get a broadband connection at home and have been told that it is not available to them.  This broadband blackout rate soars to 42% in the Connacht-Ulster region and 39% in Munster.  These statistics reveal an astonishing failure rate.  The figure is lower in Dublin but it is still remarkable that approximately 15% of Dublin narrowband users surveyed had been told that broadband is simply not available to them.In OECD broadband scorecards, we are consistently at the bottom of the pile.  Only states such as Turkey, Greece, Mexico, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Hungary usually perform worse than Ireland across the 30 OECD member states.The Minister will recall that I represented some of his constituents in east Meath who were waiting patiently for broadband.  Eventually, they had to resort to a wireless system in the Stamullen area.  There are various problems underlying broadband roll-out but three critical issues are line failure, distance from the exchange, and the lack of local loop unbundling or LLU.  The lack of LLU has in effect given Eircom a stranglehold on DSL broadband services and other operators are reduced to selling on Eircom's original product.ln November, BT's chief executive office, Mr. Danny McLaughlin, described the ongoing LLU situation as "torturous".  In my own broadband policy document, entitled Enabling Ireland's Future, I quoted John McManus of The Irish Times who compared the process of freeing the vice-like grip of Eircom over the last mile to the retreat of the German army from the Soviet Union during the Second World War.  Mr. McManus wrote: “Defeat is inevitable but every foot of ground will be fought over and paid for in blood.”  Sadly, the outgoing Government has presided over these circumstances.In the United Kingdom, the regulator, Ofcom, threatened extreme action against the incumbent BT if it did not act positively in the national interest.  A settlement was eventually made between Ofcom and the UK Government to ensure proper access to the network.  Ofcom was established many years ago with the kind of powers we are only now granting.  As a result, the British broadband market has now soared ahead to become one of the best performing broadband environments across the European Union.In contrast ComReg's actions in the broadband arena have been more like those of a poodle than a rottweiler.  The institutional culture of ComReg currently displays too much deference to the wishes of the incumbent, Eircom.  Eircom's position in the market involves endless spin about consultations on market failures that lead nowhere.The Minister should have considered legislating for a universal service obligation for broadband.  Why does every Irish household and business not have a legal right to a broadband connection?  There is no excuse for procrastination or messing by the incumbent or any other operators.  I will seek to amend the Bill in that regard on Committee Stage.One of the main lacunae in the Bill is that it does not deal with the issue of convergence.  Operators, including NTL and Eircom, are increasingly offering mobile, fixed-line, broadband, video-on-demand and other services.  Today, we heard of a development whereby mobile handsets might be used to read bar codes.  In Japan, people can apparently check the price of items with their mobile phones.

Recently, we have received bitter complaints from senior citizens and other vulnerable people about the proposed €2 extra charge per bill for consumers who will not sign up to a direct debit system.  NTL has backtracked somewhat on that plan but it is also imposing a new charge of €7.68 on customers who are late in paying their bills.  This morning, on my constituency rounds, a postman raised this issue with me.  Nonetheless, I was not permitted to raised NTL's treatment of its customers in this Chamber last week.

The matter is not dealt with in the Bill, which totally ignores convergence.  It should be addressed in the Bill but its absence means the legislation has failed in this regard.  When I met NTL's representatives, they informed me that they planned to invest approximately €85 million in their network this year and a similar figure next year.  They should be encouraged to behave in a more competitive way, however.Due to the major problems afflicting the telecoms sector, I have outlined a series of regulatory reforms in my document Enabling Ireland's Future, which should be undertaken urgently.  The first measure I proposed was to reform the level of financial penalties that could be imposed, and to allow ComReg to fine any operator for breaches by up to 10% of company turnover without first seeking a court order.  I therefore welcome the provision in section 15, which amends section 46 of the principal Act, to enhance the financial penalties ComReg can impose.Section 15, the old section 46A (6), allows for fines of 10% of turnover or €4 million.  Why did the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, choose the figure of €4 million?  It seems a rather arbitrary and inequitable figure, given the €800 million to €1.5 billion in turnover posted by the largest mobile phone operator and largest land line operator in this country.A key weakness of the Bill is the apparent inability of ComReg to directly levy significant fines without recourse to court action and I would like the Minister to address this.  Will we have the prospect of more tortuous cat and mouse games between ComReg and various operators?  I meant to ask the civil servants from the Department what will happen to the electronic communications appeals panel, ECAP.  Obviously due process and the right to appeal must be taken into account but the current system is very cumbersome and favours the rights of telecoms operators to the detriment of the whole telecoms sector.  I wonder if ComReg will still be quite hamstrung by the modus operandi presented in the Bill.Would the Minister agree to ask the Government to establish a statutory division of court that would deal solely with regulatory matters and would be mandated to deal swiftly with any appeals to decisions made by regulators such as ComReg?  This is a broader question than can be addressed today but it is something that could be investigated.The other major plank of the Labour Party's regulatory reform policy was the implementation of concurrent powers between ComReg and the Competition Authority.  In 2002 ComReg and the Competition Authority entered a co-operation agreement that formalised the existing informal relationship between the two organisations.  However, the British regulator, Ofcom, has concurrent powers with the Office of Fair Trading to exercise competition Act powers for the communications sector.  We developed this policy because we believe that co-competition powers for ComReg are essential and I welcome the section of the Bill before us, especially Part 4, which amends the Competition Act 2002 and gives ComReg co-competition powers in the telecoms sector.  I caution the Minister to ensure ComReg and the Competition Authority are properly invigilated, given the farce we saw regarding Topaz and Statoil when the Competition Authority missed a key deadline that is also within this portfolio.The principle within the new Part 4A is extremely praiseworthy but when one looks at the new sections 47G, 47E, 47F and 47G there may be concerns that the exercise of concurrent powers may be very cumbersome.  For example, section 47G requires that the Competition Authority and ComReg avoid duplication and ensure consistency between their approaches but a co-operation agreement will still be required along with the involvement of the Ministers in the Departments concerned.One of the key definitions of this Bill is the definition of the end user, the consumer, but the history of telecommunications, particularly over recent years, has been one of continual reports of the abuse of end-users and consumers.  I believe that ComReg needs to be reformed to make sure that it addresses the negative and sometimes illegal behaviour that is carried out by some operators and experienced by individual householders and businesses.Unlike the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, ComReg has a consumer panel, yet many consumers are exasperated by the brick wall they face when trying to deal with problems in the telecoms area.  I received a typical e-mail in this regard from a constituent yesterday.  She said that ComReg was entirely useless in dealing with her complaint about the failure of one of the operators.  How closely does ComReg work with the Office of Consumer Affairs and is this relationship something that should be included in this Bill?  There is the  callcost.ie website, run by ComReg, but in the UK Ofcom has developed a more comprehensive and efficient model for dealing with individual complaints against operators.  The response to recent complaints is that there is nothing ComReg can do with its present powers.I warmly welcome section 7 which inserts section 24A to section 24C and facilitates the protection of whistleblowers.  I believe that these new sections will offer protection to any well-intentioned citizen to make ComReg aware of uncompetitive or potentially illegal behaviour by telecoms operators.  My party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, introduced the whistleblowers' Bill and wanted to apply a whistleblowers' charter to all public sector agencies.  The Taoiseach said he would introduce the measure on a sectoral basis but at least we have it in the telecommunications sector.I welcome the action plan in section 10 which amends section 31 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002.  However I believe that the Houses of the Oireachtas should also have input into this action plan as representatives of citizens across the country so I hope it will be laid before the Oireachtas and that we and our successors will have the right to invigilate it.

This could prevent the kind of debacle seen in the case of Smart Telecom.It is important, in the light of recent allegations of widespread collusion among mobile operators, to keep mobile roaming and termination data hidden and that information-obtaining powers are effectively used by this Minister.  I hope all of the information on termination charges will be open to invigilation by the Department and ComReg because last week, at a committee hearing on this matter, it was clear the Department was not aware of roaming charges and termination rates.The European consumers' organisation, Beuc, and the French consumer group, Union Fédérale des Consommateurs, UFC, — Que Choisir released a damning report on the roaming charges that are levied by mobile operators.  They spoke of organised collusion on a massive scale throughout Europe and this is a matter that this Bill might begin to address.

Although roaming Vodafone and O2 clients make use of the same group network and tariffs as would apply in the home market, Beuc reports that Vodafone Ireland charges the same tariffs as O2 and Meteor for incoming calls.  O2 charges the same rates for incoming and outgoing calls as Vodafone and Meteor.  These are matters that this new legislation should address and I am hopeful that information on termination rates will at last be available.I welcome Part 6 of this Bill which deals with the establishment of a new emergency call answering service, ECAS.  Last February I received a number of complaints about the prospective transfer of the 999 service from Dublin to Ballyshannon as Eircom was apparently no longer willing to continue running it due to the cost of its operation and ongoing losses in that sector of the company.  Section 58B empowers the Minister to enter into the contract for the operation of the emergency call answering service.  Have many operators shown an interest in running the 999 service?  Is there not an argument for maintaining it as part of the universal service obligation?One of the provisions that I greatly welcome is the measure relating to the .ie domain outlined in Part 4 of the Bill.  Since the emergence of .ie Domain Registry Limited, IEDR, on the University College Dublin, UCD, campus in 2000 to administer the .ie domain system, there have been many problems and general industry dissatisfaction with the company's handling of billing issues, domain administration and the overall high costs of registering an Irish domain name.Take-up on the .ie domain name was stagnating for a long time due to high prices and at the end of 2005 registering an .ie domain ran from between €60 and €120.  This cost is around €70 for my own website while the .eu domain costs around €10 and .com €8 or less, depending on the company hosting the website.Reports at the beginning of last year indicated that there are 138,000 limited companies and 254,000 registered business names but only 50,000 registered .ie domains.  This makes it clear that many Irish businesses do not have a .ie domain and this legislation is, therefore, timely.  Will the Minister consider whether it would be appropriate to address the cost of the ie. domain?  I intend to table an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.Section 33 includes a provision to allow ComReg to impose a levy for overseeing the .ie domain.  This cost may be passed on to customers and thereby push up the price of the ie. domain.  The measures to empower ComReg to oversee the .ie domain are necessary to maintain price competitiveness.On the invigilation of premium rate calls, I echo comments made by Deputy Durkan.  While ComReg has responsibility for issuing the telephone number ranges — generally 1520 or 1580 numbers — for premium rate calls, it does not have a role in regulating the content, promotion or pricing information of these services.  This is the function of another regulator, RegTel, a self-regulatory body financed by the premium rate services industry.  In recent years, we have heard many stories of premium rate service operators engaging in questionable practices.  For example, last year an investigation on the "Today with Pat Kenny" radio show illustrated the extent of the problem when the programme's reporter quickly ran up charges of €228 after calling some premium rate lines.  My office regularly receives reports from people who believe they have been overcharged and ripped off as a result of the claims made about these services.  Will the Minister place RegTel on a statutory footing, either as an independent body or as part of ComReg?  I intend to table an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.While RegTel, within its limited remit, has instigated some excellent initiatives, the nature of the industry provides considerable scope for unscrupulous operators to exploit young and vulnerable people.  Slightly more than a year ago the Director of Consumer Affairs, Carmel Foley, urged the Government to crack down on certain promotional activities in which the premium rate telephone line companies engage and examine the possibility of introducing legislation to curb the exorbitant rates they charge and the exploitative practices many of them use.  I ask the Minister to address these matters.The Bill is vital for the communications industry and for consumers.  The Labour Party would have commended the Minister if he had introduced it much earlier.  It is regrettable he has waited until the final 80 or 90 days of the Government's term to do so.  I ask him to address the ten or 12 matters I have raised, on which I intend to introduce amendments on Committee Stage.  It is not clear whether the enactment of the Bill will result in greater protection for consumers or fundamentally change the turgid regulatory structure and market failure that have characterised much of the telecoms sector over the past of five to seven years.  Nevertheless, it is welcome.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	281	While I welcome many aspects of the Bill, I will focus on several areas in which it could be strengthened.  I examined the legislation from the point of view of whether its application in practice will resolve certain serious problems.  For example, I examined the provision to amend the Competition Act 2002 to enable the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, to investigate breaches of competition law in the telecommunications sector.  It is difficult to ascertain how this would make a difference to the cable television sector, which lacks competition because parts of it are carved up between companies.  Until a few years ago, cable television companies were licensed for approximately seven years and in the event that a company failed to fully comply with the licence, the redress open to the authorities was to revoke the licence or place conditions on its renewal.  The introduction of EU legislation tilted the balance in favour of the pursuit of competition.  Consumers were overlooked as the regulation of competition between companies was given priority.I did not expect to have to deal with problems with cable television services.  A number of my constituents were left without cable television services for days on end and several of them were concerned they would be left without a service over Christmas.  It is a serious problem when people are so dependent on a service.  We monitored the response of a cable television company to customer queries and found that customers could spend 20 minutes or half an hour listening to piped music as they tried to get through to customer services.  When they finally spoke to someone, the company had no record of receiving previous complaints.  This is a highly unsatisfactory position from a consumer point of view.  Where in the Bill are consumer issues addressed?Even when people have an option to switch cable services between Sky, NTL, Chorus and so forth, the services available are not comparable.  For example, one service may not provide Teletext or may be more expensive.  I have contacted ComReg on several occasions and while it was helpful, it was also toothless because it has little control over consumer issues.A new section will be required to address the rip-off of consumers through costly unsolicited text messages.  Last week, a "Prime Time" programme included an excellent feature on the problem.  When I investigated several complaints I received on the issue, I discovered that numerous complaints have been made about unsolicited text messages.  Is it possible to amend the Bill to place an obligation on service providers to address this problem?The case of Smart Telecom, which provides a service to my constituency office, highlighted a most unsatisfactory circumstance in which the owner of the telecommunications network competes with other service providers.  We have not learned lessons from this development, although it is possible it is still under investigation.  I ask the Minister to comment on how it is proposed to address the problem.  Many people will not risk switching to a competing service provider because they fear losing their service.  This was essentially the message to emerge from the Smart Telecom debacle.I assume Government Deputies are also contacted by constituents who are unable to obtain a telephone line.  Some of my constituents have been waiting for more than 12 months for a line.  They do not live on mountainsides but in housing estates where the residents face protracted delays in obtaining a telephone line.  It is all very well to talk about legislation, regulation and control or providing ComReg with more teeth to deal with competition issues but the inability of people to secure a basic service such as a telephone demonstrates the urgency of taking action.When seeking European Union funding the Government used to argue that it was essential to have in place proper infrastructure, such as roads, public transport, water, and waste water facilities, to secure jobs and make areas attractive.  Our communications networks are key, but we are in serious trouble in several areas.  Other Members spoke about the inadequacy in some locations of the provision and even speed of broadband services.  My concern is that we will have good regulation but will forget about the consumer.  The focus will be on the major players in the market without looking at those who will have the service delivered, or not delivered as is often the case.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is welcome because it will strengthen the power of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, to enable greater competition in the electronic communications market.  There should be no opposition to its passage though the House because it is the result of consultation between the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, ComReg, the main market players and others in the industry.We must get to the stage where there is an open and competitive market.  That is a matter for ComReg.  The privatisation of Eircom in its entirety is almost universally seen as a mistake.  That mistake is most glaring when one considers the absence of the roll-out of broadband throughout the State.  We are now consistently told that the provision of broadband is primarily a matter for Eircom.  However, the latter is not taking action with any degree of urgency or uniformity.  Huge chunks of the country are without broadband and there are areas where, because it is not possible to enable other exchanges, broadband cannot be provided.The demand for broadband is not being met.  Business people who want to work from home cannot do so because of the absence of broadband.  Students in rural areas who would benefit greatly from having a broadband service are greatly disadvantaged because that service is absent.  The Government must come forward with a solution to this problem of providing broadband to rural areas.  It is possible to do it and people in rural areas are entitled to the same service as their urban counterparts.I will now address the scandal of the absence of fibre optic broadband in Tuam in my constituency.  Under the national spatial strategy, Tuam was designated as a hub town.  All Departments and State agencies were expected to take this strategy into account in framing their policies.  It is an indication of the standing of the national spatial strategy, however, that although Tuam is the only town in County Galway designated as a hub town, it was omitted when several towns in Galway were being provided with a metropolitan area network, MAN, infrastructure.This raises serious questions about the Government's commitment either to the national spatial strategy or to east Galway.  We are told the reason Tuam was omitted was that a pilot experimental scheme was being tried by the ESB in Tuam at the time.  However, the Minister and his Department know this ESB pilot scheme proved to be a failure long ago.  The reality is that the only town in County Galway designated a hub town under the national spatial strategy is left without a MAN that would facilitate the provision of fibre optic broadband.Is there a political reason Tuam does not have a MAN?  Is an announcement of the decision to provide a MAN being delayed to fit into the schedule for a ministerial visit to east Galway and Tuam at election time?  Whatever the reason for the refusal to provide a MAN for Tuam, the reality is that business in Tuam is suffering.  Progress that could be made is not being made.  It is no longer a question of whether a MAN should be provided to Tuam but a matter of when the announcement will be made.I urge the Minister to make that announcement now.  I ask him to show his and his Government's commitment to the west and to the national spatial strategy.  He must prove that the words spoken at the launch of that strategy and subsequently mean something.  Will he show that Government policies can complement each other after all and that there is a synergy and some degree of cohesion between those policies?
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	283	One of the main objectives of this Bill is to give more power to ComReg to regulate the communications sector, particularly Eircom as the major player.  The need for such regulation is an acceptance of the fact that the private sector obviously cannot be trusted to act in the interests of citizens at large through the provision of optimum communications technology on a universal scale.  Eircom, as a private monopoly, was essentially given a free rein, and the promised advantages of privatisation in increased competitiveness, improved product quality and service and cheaper costs have failed to materialise.Instead, we have some of the highest mobile and fixed line telephone charges, most expensive Internet and broadband prices and slowest speeds in Europe, not to mention Ireland's poor broadband take-up.  That prices still in no way compare to those in the rest of Europe is the key area of concern for the public.  Other speakers spoke about how we have fallen behind in the telecommunications race.  Most people, however, are mainly concerned that they are being ripped off with these charges.  It seems there is no attempt by anyone to rein in these companies.This is the legacy left by the Government's disastrous decision to privatise Telecom Éireann in 1999.  It has failed miserably in attempting to rectify this disaster.  Deregulation only benefited Eircom venture capitalists, who have chased huge profits with near impunity.  The market has totally failed to ensure universal access to high-quality and high-speed broadband.  Many areas in the State that have poor or non-existent roll-out of broadband find it almost impossible to attract new industries and businesses to their locality because they lack such basic telecommunications facilities.  The Government tends to be timid and quiet about the fact there are entire sweeps of the country that cannot attract business because of this failure of the system.  I agree with Deputy Broughan in calling for a universal service obligation in regard to broadband and so on.  The Government is failing even to maintain never mind increase Ireland's competitiveness.Eircom has been a law unto itself these past several years in ignoring Government pleadings to invest in telecommunications infrastructure.  When Telecom Éireann was in existence it at least provided some infrastructure.  The Government has created its own technological communications Frankenstein by privatising Telecom Éireann.  It is only now, at this belated stage, that the Government is attempting to control it in some form.  The national interest of investing in technological communications infrastructure has taken a back-seat to the insatiable lust for profit from Eircom's major shareholders, while we languish at the bottom of Europe's broadband table.The Minister said this Bill will extend ComReg's consumer protection role by assigning it powers to investigate specific instances of overcharging.  Does the Minister believe this new legislation will safeguard customers from mobile telephone companies and their notorious record of overcharging people through roaming charges, for example?  Mobile telephone roaming charges and overcharging are scandalous.  Charges remain mysteriously high even though progress was allegedly made on roaming costs.  People are being ripped off with hidden costs, especially when travelling to the North.  Will ComReg challenge this or does it have the power to put a halt to this rip-off?Will the Minister assure us that provisions in this new legislation will prevent another disaster such as when Smart Telecom's 45,000 customers found themselves without telephone access while thousands could not even make emergency calls?  Can the Minister explain in detail how another such fiasco will be prevented?

Ba mhaith liom an deis seo a ghlacadh an rún seo a chur os comhair an Tí.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh, ag deireadh na díospóireachta, na Teachtaí ar fad sa Teach ag tacú leis agus go dtarraingeoidh an Rialtas siar an leasú scannalach a chuir sé os a chomhair.De shíor bíonn an Rialtas seo, an tAire Dlí agus Cirt go háirithe, ag ligean air go bhfuil sé crua i dtaobh coireanna ach níl ann ach posers.  Ní gá ach smaoineamh ar na mná, na páistí agus na fir a bheas ionsaithe ina mbaile, ina leaba nó ina gcistin anocht, agus gan ach fíor-bheagán déanta ag an Rialtas faoi.  Tá teipthe ar an Rialtas seo agus na Rialtais roimhe an tosaíocht chuí a thabhairt do choireanna foréigin theaghlaigh.  Dá mbeadh sin tarlaithe, bheadh muinín acu siúd atá buailte, ciaptha agus céasta ina dteach cónaithe dul go dtí na gardaí cosaint a lorg agus a gcás a thógaint.This Government and successive Governments have failed to treat crimes of domestic violence with the priority they require.  If they had there would be no need for this motion.  The Government amendment is an insult to the victims, their families and the organisations that must deal with the effects of domestic violence.  Victims should have faith that the judicial system, from the gardaí to the courts, would protect them, defend them and ensure that they, as victims, are paramount.  That is not the case and that is why many victims continue in abusive situations.  That is why many women and men put up with the daily hidings, the physical and psychological abuse, and why they lie to family and friends about their injuries.  They are afraid for themselves and their kids and feel all alone.  If this motion is taken seriously they should no longer feel that society does not care.Gangland crime and anti-social behaviour are popular topics for media coverage and have prompted no end of pontificating and endless legislative proposals from the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, most of which are no more than soundbites or are ineffective and unnecessary.  However, this most prevalent of serious crimes — domestic violence — rarely features at all on the Government's agenda.  Where is the Government's plan to secure convictions against these most violent of offenders?  Where is the Tánaiste's 50 point proposal?  Is it any wonder the justice system fails to treat domestic violence as the serious crime it is if the Government fails to do so?The following statistics, both national and international, gathered by Women's Aid, along with those detailed in the motion, give an indication of the scale and extent of crimes of domestic violence.  Nearly a quarter of violent sexual offenders against women are partners or ex-partners.  One in eight pregnant women experiences abuse.  On average a woman will be assaulted 35 times by her partner or ex-partner before reporting it to the police, an indictment in itself.  Domestic violence has the highest rate of repeat offending.Our motion calls for an effective and consistent sanctioning system, essential if offenders are to be held accountable for their crimes and if the incidence of such crimes is to be substantially reduced.  A clear message must be sent to domestic violence offenders that there will be serious consequences for their actions.The gardaí and DPP, therefore, should treat domestic violence as they would other violent crimes.  Wherever possible, they should build cases to try crimes of domestic violence on indictment, laying charges such as assault, assault causing harm, threats to kill or cause serious harm.  Indictable offences carry much weightier penalties, including custodial sentences, than would be the case where offenders are merely pursued for breaching a civil protection or safety order or where, in the first instance, an application for an order is the sole judicial response to crimes of violence which have already been committed.Garda practice must be standardised, with the same recording method, approach to complaints and urgency as for other violent crime.  There must be the same thorough approach to investigating the crime and charging the perpetrator as there would be if the Minister had been attacked.Garda domestic violence policy must be monitored, supported and applied consistently.  We can no longer tolerate gardaí asking an offender to go for a walk to cool off or sending a woman home from the station to sort things out with her husband herself.  Are they mad?  Who would ever dream of asking a victim of a common assault to go find the stranger who mugged him and sort it out himself?  Who would ask somebody who attempted murder to go away and cool down?The Garda Síochána policing plan for 2007 must be revised to explicitly name domestic violence and sexual violence as policing priorities.  The current policing plan gives priority focus to terrorism, road traffic law and illegal immigration but not domestic and sexual violence.  This telling deficiency must be rectified in the plan for 2008 and in future Garda plans.The positive news is that in today's Ireland the incidence of domestic violence can be greatly reduced and victims can be afforded the support and protection they need.  All that is required is political will, the political will to lead, to legislate and to resource.  That is what the Sinn Féin motion is all about.  It was drawn up on the basis of consultation with the expert organisations working in the field, some of which made impressive and compelling contributions to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights last month.  These organisations work in the field alongside and in support of victims; they are well placed to identify the legislative, systems and funding shortcomings that inhibit the achievement of victim safety and offender accountability.  The motion builds on their learning.This Government, along with the rest of the House, must lead by making it clear that domestic violence is a serious crime and that it will be treated as such.  We must legislate to give the relevant agencies, including the gardaí, the DPP and the probation service, clear statutory roles and responsibilities and eliminate overly-restrictive requirements which prevent certain victims from accessing legal protections.  We must resource the front line services that are working on a shoestring to meet the needs of victims.  One extremely dedicated worker in the Dublin 12 domestic violence service worked in the absence of employment security on successive contracts lasting a month, three weeks and then three months due to the ad hoc nature of funding available to this crucial community service.  The Government must guarantee core funding to front line services on a multi-annual basis to allow for the strategic development and delivery of these essential supports.Beidh mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Martin Ferris, ag leagan amach an gá le leasaithe reachtúla agus leasaithe chórais atá á moladh againn.  Amárach déanfaidh an Teachta Seán Crowe an gá le gealltanais fad-téarmach maoinithe do na heagrais agus do na tionscnaimh atá dírithe ar an fhadhb mhór seo dár sochaí.  Beidh an Teachta Arthur Morgan ag plé na teipe déileáil le lóistín éigeandálach, sealadach agus fad-téarmach atá de dhíth orthu siúd atá buailte ag foréigean teaghlaigh.I urge everyone in this House to support our motion and I urge the Government to rethink its amendment and withdraw it.  This is a criticism of this Government and other Governments but it is also a call for us to take this aspect of Irish society seriously and give it the priority required.  Anyone who sits in advice clinics has met victims of domestic violence, has seen the fear in their eyes and told them to go the gardaí.  They ask, however, who will protect them and what use a protection order is if the gardaí in the station do not support them.I urge the Government to withdraw its amendment, give support to the motion and in particular to do something on this issue.  The Government should give it priority, fund the organisations and support agencies.  The message needs to go out from this House that we as legislators will be tough on domestic violence.  We will tackle it head on to ensure that all the services are resourced properly.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	285	Women's Aid, the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency and the Law Reform Commission have all called for legislative reform to address the restrictions caused by the residency requirements of the Domestic Violence Act 1996.  The motion, which we urge all parties to support, calls on the Government to produce and schedule time for legislation to make the necessary reforms without delay.In its report on the rights and duties of cohabitants published last December, the Law Reform Commission argued that the eligibility criteria applicable to co-habiting but non-married persons restrict the grounds on which such persons can seek protection in the form of domestic violence orders.  It noted: "In an analysis of the response of the legal system to victims of domestic violence, it was estimated in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court that approximately 10 cases a week were ruled out at preliminary interview stage on grounds of eligibility."  This highlights the urgent need for reform.  The impact of the residency requirement on individual victims should not be underestimated.  An unmarried woman who is living with an abusive partner cannot be granted a barring order until they have been living together for at least six months.  In the case of joint tenants of a local authority house, a complicated procedure must be undertaken to grant tenancy solely to the victim, particularly if the abusive partner is not prepared to surrender tenancy voluntarily.Further reform is also necessary to ensure that protective orders are available to victims who no longer live with their abusive ex-partner.  As noted by the Law Reform Commission report, a British study of 200 women who had experienced domestic violence found that after the relationship had ended 76% were subjected to emotional and verbal abuse, 41% were subjected to serious threats to either themselves or their children, 23% were subjected to physical violence and 6% were subjected to sexual violence.  Likewise a study by Women's Aid here found that violent men used access to children to further abuse and control their former partners.  On a regular basis Deputies of all parties meet in their constituency offices victims of domestic abuse seeking help and support.  In cases where barring orders have been secured and the victim returns to the family home, the barring order often does not get the necessary attention because the authorities believe the violent partner will return again.  That should not be the case.  We must at all times recognise the vulnerability of the victim, often in refuge centres with three, four or five young children.  Without any support mechanism it is almost inevitable that they will return to the home.The necessary legislative reforms cannot wait any longer.  Policy and legislative reform and systems change are necessitated not only by the variation in Garda practice, identified by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, but also by the variation in judicial practice.  There are significant variations in the granting of domestic violence order applications.  Some 44% are granted nationally but this ranges from 33% in Dublin to 59% in the eastern region.  The range in terms of barring orders specifically is even greater, with 28% granted in the Dublin region and 70% in the northern region.  Legislation and guidelines detailing the relevant criteria and the standard and types of proof necessary for the granting of domestic violence orders must be introduced urgently.Judges are making decisions in the dark.  There is an urgent need to reintroduce a role for the probation service in the family courts, producing safety reports and risk assessments to guide the decision-making of judges.  This need has been recognised by the National Crime Council, the Law Reform Commission and the Law Society at various times dating back to 1999.  The Government has not acted on any of their recommendations and has no excuse for this failure.The National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency has introduced and developed a number of system changes in its pilot area of the Bray and Dún Laoghaire District Courts since 2003.  The initiatives included developing an aide memoire for gardaí responding to domestic violence incidents and completing risk reports for the courts at post-conviction stage.  An independent evaluation of the project commissioned by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, published in early 2006, details the benefits of the pilot project and concluded positively that the interagency work model assists victims to stay with the legal process.  This is despite the fact that the project has been hindered from an early stage by the ad hoc and insecure nature of its funding.I accept that the victims of abuse can be men as well as women.  Like women who are abused, men are constantly harassed, criticised and compared unfavourably to others.  Physical violence can also occur.  As in any relationship, much of this is witnessed by the children.  The impact of the abuse on men includes low self-esteem, depression and insomnia, and can also impact negatively on their relationship with their children.  Men are aware that if they separate from their wives or partners they may lose their homes and will no longer be in a position to care for and protect their children.The NDVIA was scandalously forced to suspend the receipt of referrals and pushed to the brink of closure again this year by the failure of the Minister and his Department to make a timely judgment on its future funding.  I understand a decision is still pending.  The motion we have tabled calls for the extension across the State of the interagency work model that has been developed and piloted by the NDVIA.Like any caring person, I would say that any man who lifts his hand and abuses a woman verbally or physically is nothing but a coward and a bully.  That message needs to leave this House loudly and clearly.  More importantly, there is an onus on the Government to introduce legislation to ensure that protection will be to the forefront.  We need a mechanism to help people overcome an abusive and violent relationship.

Domestic violence happens and we see its signs and symptoms.  We are only looking at the tip of the iceberg.  People do not seek help after the first episode of domestic violence.  It has been mentioned earlier that it is upwards of 45 times on average before people seek help.  Some never seek help.  When we think of domestic violence we automatically think of physical violence and forget about psychological, emotional, financial abuse and controlling situations.  These are all forms of violence that can have a devastating effect on the partner who is suffering it.The better off tend to seek help and learn enabling skills to help them to cope.  As mentioned earlier, if people learn to cope with the situation and show it is not affecting them as badly as it might, that in itself leads to a reduction in the amount of violence these people suffer.If one challenges a bully he will lie down.  One can challenge him in the house or by stating that one will seek professional help.  That is the last thing a bully wants.  He does not want the violence to leave his controlled area which is his bedroom, living room or his own house.  He is familiar with that territory and is happy to have the bullying and violence take place in that particular patch.The main sufferers in all of this violence are the children of such relationships.  It is usual for the family unit to consist of four or five children.  They are the people who really suffer from this violence.  Children should also be allowed to access help and, perhaps, they should be taught that through the school curriculum.  I suppose all difficult situations are heaped on the teacher in the school.  This is one of the times the child is out of the home and is impressionable.  The teacher is a person they respect.  I suggest the matter be included as part of the transition year programme in schools.It is clear from the statistics on domestic violence that women do not avail of the therapeutic services available, particularly for their children.  The tragedy is that they need the consent of both parents before they can access the services.  I cannot see a violent father allowing his children to receive counselling to learn how to cope with his violence.  That is a difficulty.  The consent of one parent should be more than adequate to allow them access to a particular counsellor.  This is a learned behaviour and it often stays with families.  If children see it in their own family it is likely they will carry it on because they see it as a form of normal behaviour in a household.  We must stop this type of behaviour as early as possible in the cycle.According to last year's statistics, from the excellent report of the National Crime Council, the first major study in this area, domestic violence has reached epidemic proportions.  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, Tearmann Domestic Violence Service deals with women and men but refer the men on to the Amen centre.  The service had 127 new clients from County Monaghan last year.  Some 932 telephone calls were made to the helpline.  However, in the Cavan part of my constituency there is no such office.  I have no doubt the outpatient service in Cavan is availed of to the fullest extent.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	287	The one place in the world where most people would expect to feel safe is at home.  For a significant number of people, the one in five Irish women who experiences domestic violence, that is not the case.  One in three of those who picks up the telephone to seek help finds the call is not answered.  In a country as wealthy as Ireland we have our priorities wrong if this issue is not seen as an area that requires good quality services, backed up by good legislation.Like other Members, the people, predominantly women, who come to my clinic about issues of domestic violence fall into two categories.  First, there are those who require immediate assistance.  That such people walk into my constituency office or other constituency offices as the first port of call speaks volumes.  That highlights the unavailability of services.  Often the agencies have to fundraise to keep the show on the road.  Those in the second group try to plan their way out of domestic violence.  They are trying to keep the children in school and maintain some normality while trying to find a way out of the appalling situation in which they have found themselves.  The problems they experience are the practical remedies of finding another home to go to while trying to remain in the locality where their children are at school.  Such practical solutions will have to be put in place if this problem is to be addressed.Another group who approach me are foreign nationals.  They often come from very violent countries and different cultures.  We have to make adjustments to ensure the language issue is not a barrier to reporting.  I have read the SAVI report on sexual violence.  Of the women who are subject to domestic violence, a significant number are also subject to sexual violence.  According to the SAVI report 44% were dissatisfied with the Garda who did not adequately explain why certain procedures were conducted.  There was a perception that they were to blame for the assaults.  That is part of the reason for a low level of reporting.  That is a serious problem.In the main it is women who contact me.  It takes a great deal of courage and confidence to tell somebody that something so private is going on in one's own home.  While I have not come across them, I acknowledge there is a cohort of men who suffer domestic abuse in the range of different forms in which it manifests itself.  If practical solutions are being put in place they will have to be available to men and women.  When abuse takes place in the home it extends beyond the partner to the children.  One can spend a lifetime picking up the pieces if one does not deal with the issue at source.  That is another aspect to which consideration must be given.A few weeks ago the national domestic violence agency was on the brink of collapse because of inadequate funding.  The agency cannot continue from one crisis to another without core funding being put in place.  We must recognise there is a range of different forms of abuse and not one size that fits all.  There is a good deal of information available at the national domestic violence agency that needs to be considered.  Following on from its report we need to put in place practical systems and legislation to tackle the problem in a serious manner.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	288	We are all aware of domestic violence through personal experience, visitors to our clinics, anecdotal evidence and information supplied to us by non-governmental agencies.  Unfortunately, while we are aware that domestic violence occurs all too frequently in our society, we lack sufficient official statistics on it.  We also lack an official infrastructure to deal with its effects.  In its amendment to this timely and much-needed motion, the Government seems to be avoiding the central issue.  The mechanisms we have as a society for dealing with domestic violence are far too dependent on Government actions which, of themselves, are too ad hoc, haphazard and akin to a Band-Aid solution and do not take a sufficiently long-term approach to deal with a deep-seated problem in our society.  We see this all too vividly with the pantomime that existed in respect of ongoing funding for the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency, NDVIA.  It should not have been a case that an NGO, which had been receiving support from the State but never on an multi-annual basis and never with an ongoing thought towards its own future despite the valuable work it was doing, had to make 16 requests to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to seek the funding it needed to continue its work and received a response to that request at the eleventh hour, with that response being only a three-month reprieve.  It is not good enough for the State to support vital agencies in this way.  It gives the impression that the issue of domestic violence is of only half-hearted concern to this Government.The lack of any type of real statistics on domestic violence and our dependence on statistics given to us by NGOs is a gap that should be filled as soon as possible.  In 1999, Women's Aid pointed out that up to one in every five women experienced domestic violence.  It has already been said in this debate that violence is largely of a physical nature.  However, domestic violence can be and is verbal and psychological.  It can and does involve women who are subjected to controlling means of whatever type.  The fact that it exists at all in our society is a blight and the fact that it exists to such prevalence is a shame.  It requires appropriate Government action to make sure the problem is tackled.Despite the revelation of this statistic eight years ago, which we largely still use, there is little indication that the incidence and prevalence of domestic violence has changed at all in our society.  That seems to indicate that the lack of an appropriate Government response has been one of the main factors.The lack of resources for the various helplines has also been mentioned.  The lack of people to man helplines very often means that victims cannot get a direct response on a real-time basis and contact with another human being who can help them through crises.  We know that the Women's Aid national freephone helpline receives over 8,000 calls.  One refuge in Rathmines deals with an average of ten emergency calls every day.  The Garda domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit receives an average of 6,000 calls per year.  OSS Cork and Sexual Violence Centre Cork, which followed on from the Cork Rape Crisis Centre, would say that similar statistics exist in my own constituency and city.  They are not statistics in which I take pride.Apart from the funding crisis in the NDVIA provoked by the Government recently, there are scores of similar crises waiting to come to a head because of the lack of clear thinking by the Government in this area.  This should be a problem which we could tackle with appropriate political will.  It is certainly something we all have a responsibility to tackle, yet sadly all we get is muddled thinking and a lack of long-term vision.Not only should we highlight the recent circumstances of the NDVIA, but we also need to point out that it has been and remains a pilot project.  The use of the term "pilot project" by the Government in social interventions speaks volumes about its social policies in general and indicates that these are matters to which it needs to be seen to respond, but it never really gets to the bottom of these problems and never has the long-term vision needed to deal with them once and for all.  I find this approach sad.The pilot project was and is an innovative project.  It could bear being turned into a mainstream project with a wider application throughout the country by State agencies such as the Garda Síochána, the Courts Service, the probation and welfare service, the HSE and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  An interagency response involves doing things in an innovative way that would not otherwise happen, certainly would not with each of these State agencies on its own.  It is hard to believe the crisis with the NDVIA occurred at all, given the organisation's great success in 2005 and 2006.  There is a need for a political response as to how the Government allowed that situation to develop and a willingness to put in place a proper long-term response.The wider issue of assisting victims of domestic violence is a cause for huge concern.  The debate, quite properly, has involved the support structures which are under-resourced and need to be given greater strength.  The real tragedy of domestic violence is the situations in which individual women — it is largely women who are affected — and their children find themselves.  There is little to indicate that a wider support service is in place.  The institutional barriers, the lack of appropriate bed and dwelling space and the attitude very often shown by officials in different State agencies do as much to entrench the violence these women experience in their domestic situation as they do to help them get away from it.  While these attitudes persist, the ability to change to the extent required is probably further away than ever.The Government will probably use the opportunity offered by this debate to sing its own praises, as it invariably does during Private Members' Business.  I like to think it might use this opportunity for a more thoughtful approach which goes beyond the election in three months' time and might be slightly better than the regular type of report we see in this area, which ends up on a shelf with no action taken on foot of it.  What we need to hear in this House is an honest response which admits the scale of the problem and then admits that the resources made available are still far from adequate, even if they have been increasing.  Finally, we need to see a willingness to work with the entire political system to bring about the appropriate responses.  At the end of the day, while there are many Government failings on this issue, it is really a failing of the political system itself.  We have seen changes of Government and will probably see further changes in a few months' time.  The question has to be whether those changes have any effect on the lives of the women who find themselves in situations of domestic violence and whether they will alter the position of the NDVIA and other organisations.

These Acts provide for the protection of any spouse, any children and other dependent persons and persons in other domestic relationships whose safety or welfare requires it because of the conduct of another person in the domestic relationship.  The Act of 1996 prescribes that where the court, on application to it, is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing the safety or welfare of the applicant or any dependent person so requires, it may make either a barring order, a protection order or a safety order.  In the case of the granting of an interim barring order, that is, an order made between the making of an application for a barring order and its determination, under the 1996 Act the court must be of the opinion that, (a) there is an immediate risk of significant harm to the applicant or any dependent person if the order is not made immediately, and (b) that the granting of a protection order would not be sufficient to protect the applicant or any dependent person.In the Act of 2002 the Tánaiste, in response to some legal difficulties with the operation of the 1996 Act, made provision that the application for an interim barring order must be made either on affidavit or on sworn information and, if the order is made ex parte, a note of the evidence given, together with the court order and the affidavit or sworn information, must be served on the respondent as soon as practicable.The importance of the Domestic Violence Acts is that they are premised on the basis of the safety and welfare of vulnerable persons, including children, in the home.  Where children are concerned, the Acts already ensure that the courts may, of their own motion, or on the application of any person concerned, adjourn proceedings and direct the Health Service Executive to undertake any necessary investigations of the circumstances of the child.  In addition, the court may give such directions, under the Child Care Act 1991, as it sees fit, as to the care and the custody of the child.  The court may also make a supervision order under the 1991 Act in respect of the parent of the child, pending any investigation.  That power of the court exists under the 1991 Act, whether in the context of associated proceedings under the Domestic Violence Acts or otherwise.As the House will be aware, violence against women requires a co-ordinated response across a number of Departments.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and its agencies make the protection of barring orders available to women who experience violence and prosecute the perpetrators of violence through a comprehensive and well formulated response by the Garda Síochána and the courts.The Legal Aid Board provides legal services in domestic violence cases to those who are financially eligible.  Applications involving domestic violence are prioritised and applicants are given an appointment to see a law centre solicitor or given a legal aid certificate to allow them to retain a private solicitor from a panel within a couple of days of first making contact.  In Dublin, application can be made to any of the board's seven law centres located in the city or to the board's private practitioner centre located at Montague Court, Montague Street, Dublin 2.  Outside of Dublin, application should be made to any of the board's remaining 23 law centres.  Contact details for the board's centres are available on its website.The board does not distinguish between the applicant and the respondent in domestic violence cases.  Thus the board may equally provide representation to an alleged perpetrator as it may to a victim.  The board has also published a series of information leaflets on its services and on the core areas of its work.  These include a leaflet on domestic violence, leaflets on other areas of family law and a leaflet setting out the financial eligibility criteria for its services.District Court staff will help with the completion of application forms under the Domestic Violence Acts.  They cannot offer legal advice but offer whatever assistance they can.  The Courts Service provides assistance from its information office on how to prepare an application to the court for protection under the Acts, information on what happens in court on the day of the full hearing of an application and the role of the judge.  It directs applicants to the services available from the Legal Aid Board and other Government agencies and non-governmental support services.Criminal law sanctions exist for breaches of safety orders, barring orders, interim barring orders and protection orders under the Acts of 1996 and 2002.  The punishment is a fine or imprisonment or both.  These sanctions operate without prejudice to the law as to contempt of court or any other liability, whether civil or criminal that may be incurred by the perpetrator concerned.  Where a member of the Garda Síochána suspects there has been a contravention of the terms of an order by the respondent, on a complaint being made to him or her in that regard by or on behalf of the applicant, the member may arrest the respondent without warrant.  For that purpose, the member may enter, if need be by force, and search any place where he suspects the respondent to be.Statistics from the Courts Service for 2005 show that it granted 1,037 safety orders, 2,622 protection orders, 550 interim barring orders and 1,265 barring orders.  The statistics also show that 115 safety orders, 71 protection orders, 34 interim barring orders and 100 barring orders were refused last year.  Of the numbers of applications which were withdrawn or struck out, these numbered 1,714 barring orders, 157 protection orders, 38 interim barring orders and 1,818 barring orders, all of which were withdrawn or struck out last year.  The numbers of applications withdrawn or struck out are noteworthy.  They demonstrate uniquely among applications to court the extent to which there is equivocation on behalf of the applicant.  Behind the figures is a state of mind and, no doubt, turmoil in the home that changes by the time of the hearing of a case.Domestic violence is a serious crime but too often it is a hidden crime in our society.  We must never lose sight of the fact that it is a heinous crime.  All sides of this House are in total agreement with the Government's policy which fully recognises this crime and the need to punish offenders most severely.  It is for this reason that there is a substantial range of laws that can apply to crimes in the home.  These are contained in the Criminal Law (Rape) Amendment Act 1990, the Domestic Violence Acts, 1996 and 2002, in so far as breaches of orders under the Acts are concerned, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, the Domestic Violence (Amendment) Act 2002, the Sex Offenders Act 2001, the Criminal Justice Act 2006, and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006.There have been calls from Women's Aid to remove the residency requirement in the Domestic Violence Acts, under which partners must establish a certain period of cohabitation.  That request has not been met by successive Governments because of legal difficulties.  The position remains that there are no proposals to extend the civil law policy of the Acts of 1996 and 2002 to non-domestic abusive relationships which can be the subject of sanctions under the criminal law.  In particular, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 covers a wide range of situations, including domestic abuse, harassment, and stalking.  Relief is available to people who are not married to or living with the abuser for the previous six months and are not entitled to avail of protection under the Domestic Violence Acts.  In any event, operation of the law on the civil law protection of persons in relationships continues to be kept under review in my Department.Members of the Garda Síochána are trained to the highest standard in dealing with incidents of domestic violence.  Lectures relating to offences committed within the family are given at phases 1, 3 and 5 of training at the Garda College.  The lectures cover all matters relevant to the Domestic Violence Acts.  Powers of entry, use of force, arrest and prosecution of offenders are all covered during training.  Moreover, the contextual policing aspect of training deals with the rights of victims in situations of domestic violence.  Throughout training, students and probationers undertake role-play exercises with scenarios which depict practical incidents they may encounter relating to domestic violence.  This role-play type training develops skills and competencies in dealing with all aspects of domestic violence.In the Garda Síochána, the domestic violence and sexual assault unit was established to have a national role in 1997.  The Garda has a written policy on domestic violence intervention which is arrest oriented and recognises the vulnerable circumstances in which the victims find themselves.  Any evidence of fear or harassment is brought to the attention of the court in the event of a bail application.  This domestic violence policy is an integral part of Garda training and is reinforced continuously.  All the feedback on this policy is positive.  Nonetheless, the Garda has undertaken a review of this policy with a view to modernising and honing its procedures further.In 1996, the Chief Justice established the Judicial Studies Institute to oversee judicial training.  The Judicial Studies Institute has organised professional training seminars and conferences for the Judiciary and exchange visits with other jurisdictions.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no function in prescribing the content and nature of training provided to the Judiciary.  This is due to the independence of the courts under the Constitution.  However, the Department has always assisted with initiatives which the Judiciary has brought forward in the area of training.  Funds have always been available to judges at all levels to enable them to attend training seminars and conferences both at home and abroad.  The Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, provide funds for the training and education of judges.  This Act also provides that persons wishing to be considered for judicial appointment must give their agreement, if appointed to judicial office, to undertake such course or courses of training or education as may be required by the Chief Justice or President of the Court to which that person is appointed.The probation service recognises the importance of addressing the issue of domestic violence in working with offenders towards increasing public safety and helping offenders to avoid re-offending.  One of the key responsibilities of probation officers is to provide the courts with probation reports to assist in sentencing decisions.  These reports assess the risk of re-offending and the capacity and motivation of an offender to address and change offending behaviour.  The probation service is supported in this by means of a risk assessment tool.In addition to assessment, the service has a role in the management of offenders in the community.  In support of this work, the service is represented on a number of multi-agency fora including the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency steering group and regional steering groups.  Probation service staff are also involved on the north-east domestic violence intervention programme and in similar multi-agency groups in the Wexford-Waterford area.  In addition, the Department provides a grant to Men Overcoming Violence, MOVE Ireland, through the probation service.The Government's key aims with regard to domestic violence are to bring perpetrators to justice and to help victims, who are most frequently women but can include men, to come forward to seek help and redress and to provide them with the support they and their families need.  Another Government aim is to stamp out this dreadful crime by creating awareness among people of all ages and by changing the culture of anger and violence that can infiltrate intimate partner relationships.We must create a culture where every man, woman and child in our country enjoys the right to live in peace and harmony in his or her home.  We must also create awareness among all people in Ireland that domestic violence can take place behind closed doors in houses in every suburb, town and village.  It happens in the homes of the affluent and the homes of those who may have to struggle to make ends meet and is a crime without social class.The excellent report published by the National Crime Council in 2005 showed that 15% of women, approximately one in seven, have experienced severely abusive behaviour of a physical, sexual or emotional nature from a partner at some time in their lives.  The survey suggests that some 213,000 women in Ireland have been severely abused by a partner at some point in their lives.  Accordingly, we must ensure that support is available so that female victims of violence can seek support and redress through the legal system and other support services without experiencing embarrassment and shame.Much has been achieved since the 1997 task force report on violence against women was published as a blueprint, recommending new structures and comprehensive services to bring perpetrators to justice and to support victims.  I chair the national steering committee on violence against women, which brings together all Departments and the State bodies and non-governmental organisations that work with victims of violence.  The committee works to implement the recommendations of the task force report.I was pleased the Government made a very significant increase in funding in budget 2007 to the non-governmental organisations that offer important frontline services to support victims of violence against women.  This complements the health care and personal social services victims may also require.  The increase of €4.5 million made available to the Department of Health and Children for the Health Service Executive means that these groups will have over €16 million available this year to provide enhanced support services to help combat and to respond to domestic violence.  I accept that there was no increase for a number of years, a major mistake.  This was balanced by the increase of €4.5 million in this year's budget.I must pay tribute to those in the voluntary and State sectors who work selflessly with the victims of domestic violence.  I am equally happy to acknowledge the increased funding in excess of €2.1 million granted to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to increase the availability of perpetrator programmes provided by NGOs and to enable us to undertake further awareness raising campaigns.Members may have seen the extensive media campaign that the Department ran in November and December to coincide with the international 16 days of action on violence against women.  This was very well received by the sector and we understand that the campaign reached a considerable audience.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government makes capital and current funding available to voluntary housing bodies and the local authorities respectively for accommodation for homeless people, including those who are victims of domestic violence and are forced to leave the family home because of a violent partner.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, together with the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service, plays a major role in the responses to domestic violence of the civil and criminal justice systems.  Domestic violence is a difficult crime to deal with because there can be barriers of influence, authority, shame and even affection between the perpetrator and victim, which can militate against reporting and prosecution of the offence.  Tackling these barriers is crucial and the Garda Síochána ensures that domestic violence is dealt with as a serious criminal matter.Although there has been progress, the level of reporting of incidents of domestic violence remains low.  The National Crime Council report found that a little under a quarter of all people surveyed who had experienced severe domestic abuse had reported it to the Garda Síochána.  The reasons for not reporting are complex and include a belief that it was not serious enough, that it was the victim's fault or that reporting could end the relationship.This highlights the complexity and the need to build up the confidence of victims and their awareness of the supports open to them.  This is being done in a number of ways, including support to the victims as they proceed through the legal channels and work with the perpetrators of violence to make them understand the gravity of such violence as a crime and to enable them to change their behaviour towards the partner.The Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime within my Department provides funding to Women's Aid and to the Rape Crisis Centres to assist with running court accompaniment services which assist the victims.  The Department also funds perpetrator programmes designed to promote changes in personal behaviour and to prevent future abuse.  This type of work both here and internationally is relatively new and is far from straightforward but in some instances, with the right safeguards, it has a role to play in tackling domestic violence.  We have undertaken a review of the existing programmes and the recommendations are being considered and will guide our policy decisions.The final report of the completed pilot project by the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency, NDVIA, was received at the end of January 2007.  Further funding for the project on an interim basis was agreed by the Department and the NDVIA.  Officials in the Department are now reviewing this final report, together with the 2006 external evaluation of the pilot project.  The aim of this local pilot project was to develop an integrated response to domestic violence.  We are considering how we might progress such an approach on a nationwide basis.  In response to certain comments, I wish to emphasise that this was a pilot project in one area of the country, namely in Dún Laoghaire and Bray.  The project, which was intended to run for one year, cost €530,000.  In the course of the four years for which it ran fewer than 40 victims and perpetrators were assisted.  Much media attention suggested that it was a national programme.  This was not so.I expect that proposals will be brought to Government very shortly on the establishment of a domestic violence agency which will ensure the development of a well co-ordinated whole of Government response to violence against women.In addition, the Department is in discussions with the National Crime Council about the appointment of a researcher who would specialise in this area and keep all our policy-makers informed on best practice in other countries.  The present debate is timely as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform last year commissioned a study which would review the work of the national steering committee on violence against women and the implementation of the 1997 task force, and would develop a new strategic action plan for the committee.  The national steering committee is considering the final report from the consultants.  We hope to publish that report in the coming weeks.I agree with the comments made by all Deputies that domestic violence is a heinous crime.  State agencies and service providers such as the Rape Crisis Centre and Women's Aid have tackled it.  The new office which I will propose soon to Government will incorporate all of the Departments and agencies in one office along the lines of the Office for Children or the Office for Juvenile Justice.  This will bring about a significant improvement in the provision of services to the victims of domestic violence from here on in.  There are many areas of concern in our community and we have worked diligently over the past 18 months, since I took over as chairman of the national committee, to address those issues.  The agencies have welcomed the extra resources made available.  These agencies include the national Rape Crisis Network centres, Women's Aid and the national body representing women's refuges.  We are on a strong footing to provide a much better support service for victims of domestic violence, and to ensure that the perpetrators of violence are brought to justice quickly and effectively by the regime the Garda Síochána has put in place.I thank the House for the opportunity to discuss this important topic this evening and I commend the amendment to the House.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I propose to share time with Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Connaughton.  I did not think that I would support a motion on violence in this House proposed by Sinn Féin but I am glad to support this motion on domestic violence.  While I differ from the party on the detail of some aspects of the motion I am substantially ad idem with it on the issues outlined in support of the motion. We are largely discussing violence against women which is understandable because most domestic violence arises against women.  We must recognise, however, that there are incidents of violence against men too which have been highlighted by journalists such as John Waters in The Irish Times and organisations such as Amen.  There are other instances of domestic violence involving children against parents and there is evidence of domestic violence between same sex partners.  While these examples exist, 90% or more of domestic violence occurs against women.This is not simply because women are generally physically weaker than men.  Much of the violence may not necessarily be physical.  There is also emotional, psychological and financial abuse.  It is no harm for us to recall the position of women in our society, and our views on the position of women in Islamic society including, for example, the honour killings in Pakistan, parts of India and elsewhere, the wearing of the burka in some countries, pursuit by vice police in others, and the effect of organisations such as the Taliban.  We might think we are in a superior position here being a Christian or, some would say, post-Christian society but it is not so long since our law held that women were not equal.  Only in 1882 did the Law of Property Act allow married women to own property.  The Married Women's Status Act 1956 attempted to put legal shape on the notion of equality, and that is relatively recent.We carry a great deal of historical baggage from the point of view of the role of women in society.  While in legal terms the issues of equality have been resolved, there remain traditional and historical attitudes that have not been confronted.  It is salutary to consider the statistics highlighted during this debate, some of which were mentioned in the Sinn Féin motion.  It is horrifying to hear of the number of women killed violently, often by their partners or ex-partners, and the number of incidents of domestic violence recorded by the Garda each day while accepting that only a fraction of the incidents are reported at all.  While one may dispute or question some of the figures, it is clear that there is a high incidence of domestic violence in our country.The issue is to a significant degree unrecognised, much of it unreported, and inadequately confronted by the Executive or the Legislature.  It is some time since we even debated this issue.  What should be done?  First, we must admit the scale of the problem and ensure there is general recognition of its enormous scale.  Second, adequate resources, including finance, must be allocated to the various agencies, governmental and non-governmental, trying to deal with the problem.  Third, we must try to encourage a change of attitude, whereby everybody realises that this will not be tolerated in our society.With due respect to the Minister, his speech is an indication of where part of the problem arises.  It was a speech without commitment, passion or real vision.  It indicated a pedestrian approach to a problem of such enormity.  The figures bear repetition.  The worst is the huge number of calls made to the Women's Aid helpline.  In 2005 there were over 25,000 calls.  The helpline was only able to respond to 15,000; over 10,000 were not dealt with for the simple reason that Women's Aid did not have the resources or finances to respond.  That is unacceptable and inexcusable.The Minister spoke rather grandly about the money being made available.  It is a couple of million here and a couple of million there.  The money was largely capped from 2002.  A few million extra was provided in the current Estimates.  However, when one adds the figures, it is a miserable amount of money, given the size of the problem.  In the budget we no longer talk about millions or hundreds of millions but about billions of euro.  The Minister proudly proclaims there is €2.4 million for extra services.  It is a little extra but buttons, given the size of the problem.  I am most unimpressed with the Government's attitude now that the issue has been put before the House in such stark terms by previous speakers.  This laid back response gives the impression that it does not really care.  That is worrying.Telling us about the civil law which was largely put in place by the rainbow Government ten years ago is not an answer to the figures mentioned in this debate.  The Minister has said there will shortly be a proposal for a co-ordinated response.  The Government is dying on its feet; it will not be there shortly.  It will be gone in seven or ten weeks.  Very little has been done, even though there is a huge amount to be done.  The Government has a hopeless record in dealing with this enormous problem.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  It is a hugely complex and difficult social problem.  It is certainly not easy to legislate for domestic violence and almost impossible to predict or prevent it.  It is often seen as a single dimensional problem, that is, violence against women but domestic violence can take many forms.  There is often violence by women against men, while violence by teenagers against their parents is common.  Violence by adults against elderly parents is an emerging problem.  Sadly, violence against children regularly occurs.Violence can take many forms.  It is not always physical but can be intimidation or emotional violence.  Sexual violence is also very common.  As society becomes less cohesive and more mobile, there is a loosening of the controls in place in the past.  These include the fear of public opinion, the church and institutions of the State.  That fear has lessened its grip.  We have created a culture where domestic violence can grow and thrive.  Therefore, there is all the more reason to be extremely vigilant.Households are increasingly being formed not on the basis of marriage but more casual relationships.  Where a relationship is casual and perhaps not properly planned, unforeseen violence can erupt, often tragically for those involved.  It is a growing problem with no single solution.  It is apposite that we should discuss it now, ten years after the passing of the Domestic Violence Act.  We can see the flaws and gaps that have emerged in that legislation and where the State, in so far as it can, might plug these gaps and strengthen the law.It is the prime responsibility of the State to protect its citizens.  If the crime takes place in the home, it does not lessen the State's responsibility or reduce the seriousness of the crime.  That is particularly the case when vulnerable people, especially children, are at risk.  In the past there was a reluctance to deal with violence in the home.  If there was not a reluctance, there was certainly a walking on eggshells approach by the Garda.  Certainly, there was a sense that the same vigour was not brought to the pursuit of domestic violence cases as to attacks on people in the street.  That culture has changed in the Garda but there is a lingering sense in society that these crimes are not as serious as general assault crimes.The State must be clear about this.  The rights of the family are and should be strong but they do not extend a right to family members to beat each other up.  That does not show respect for or strengthen families.  It diminishes the family unit when we turn a blind eye to what happens, simply because it happens behind the closed doors of the family home.  It is the responsibility of the State to convey the message that domestic violence is unacceptable.  Victims of domestic violence are often ambivalent about the crimes perpetrated on them.  The system must be structured in such a way that when cases are reported, they are acted on promptly and the perpetrators charged and convicted.  It is accepted that only a small percentage of cases are reported.  When they are, they must be taken seriously.We have a mobile society and a large immigrant population.  The message must be conveyed to immigrants that whatever might have been acceptable in their home countries and whatever their cultures or norms might have been, domestic violence is not acceptable in this society.We are aware and have seen recent examples that having strong laws that are enforced changes behaviour.  It is desperately important that the law in this area is enforced.  It can then act as a deterrent.  It is better to deter this crime and create a culture in which it is unacceptable than try to deal with it afterwards and pick up the pieces of broken families and bodies.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I thank Sinn Féin for tabling this motion as it is some time since the House debated this issue.  Domestic violence is like a creeping paralysis.  One horrendous aspect to domestic violence is the unimaginable case of a woman being abused in any one of ten different ways but, because of her dignity and pride in her family, she would nearly do anything under the rising sun rather than turn in the perpetrator.As a public representative I have been contacted from time to time on the matter.  While the prevalence of domestic violence is much greater in the cities than in rural areas, it happens everywhere.  Some victims believe they must put up with it.  They are fit for sainthood for the trouble they have gone through to cover up their terrible situations.  Our attitude to the perpetrators of domestic violence must change.  It is difficult for any Government to get to the bottom of this problem.Women's Aid and other organisations do Trojan work in this area.  The very least that can be done is to ensure adequate resources are available to them.  Last year, they received 10,000 telephone calls from victims of domestic violence that they could not answer.  The victims must have asked themselves if they were living in a society that cares for them.  The answer is they are not.Over indulgence of alcohol is a base issue in domestic violence.  The dignity to which every human being is entitled must be ensured.  There are a myriad of ways in how this can be approached.  I hope there will be other occasions after this debate when we can return to discuss the more detailed and technical measures that can be put into operation to tackle the issue.  Like with drink-driving, the message must be sent out that violence against women in simply not on and the perpetrators must suffer badly for whatever injuries they inflict on helpless women and children.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	293	Domestic violence is an important issue that I have encountered closely.  The long-term effect it can have on a victim can last a lifetime.  Apart from the physical injury and intimidation, it can limit a woman's confidence, making it difficult for her to emerge from it in subsequent times.  This debate is timely.  I recall at the start of the Twenty-Ninth Dáil, emergency legislation on domestic violence was introduced on foot of a court's judgment on the original Domestic Violence Act.  The debate surrounding the legislation was worthwhile and I was pleased the Government could deal with the matter speedily.A cross-departmental approach is important in tackling domestic violence.  I have had many representations from organisations, particularly Women's Aid with which I was involved on a charity basis before being elected.  Their concerns not only relate to resources but to a cross-departmental approach.  They have highlighted how the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other Departments are involved in the provision of emergency refuges for women who are victims of domestic violence.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs is responsible for interim payments.  There is also an issue surrounding awareness of rights, available supports and protections.Gaining access to the legal system can be an intimidating process for some.  It can be doubly so when one has been the victim of a crime that goes to the core of what we believe.  The family is the bedrock of one's existence.  It is the family in which we have the most confidence and rely on in a time of a crisis.  If the crisis has emerged from that source, one can be shaken to one's core.  The last thing a victim can deal with it is an archaic and difficult legal system and a courts service that lacks transparency.  It is important that domestic violence victims know where to access their rights, the applications, such as ex parte, they can make and their various levels from safety orders to barring orders.  A large degree of legislation already exists in the Domestic Violence (Amendment) Act and criminal justice legislation providing protection to the victim.The Constitution gives the family based on marriage precedence, and rightly so.  However, there are different types of family arrangements of which we have so much experience.  Many children are born to families not based on marriage.  The protection of a cohabitee from domestic violence is as important.  However, a delicate balance is taken by the courts in those situations.  If a couple is recently living together, the courts are inclined to take a lesser view of the relationship and the protections that could be afforded in those circumstances.A stigma is associated with reporting domestic violence incidents.  On a weekly basis, we hear calls in the House for education for children in transition year on driver safety, first aid and so forth.  However, it would very much be worthwhile if we dealt with this issue among young people and highlighted the fact that they need not accept such approaches, intimidation, or even the very lowest level of violence perpetrated in certain families.  I have seen on many occasions what happens when young people have that confidence.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Communications frequently arise in my constituency office, as I am sure they do in that of every Deputy.  A necessary concern for modern communications, business and enterprise is broadband, which shows a substantial deficit across the State.  Forfás has stated that broadband services are critical to attracting direct investment, developing indigenous industry and promoting our so-called knowledge-based economy.  Ireland's poor broadband record does not bode well for the future.Emergency services telephone calls being put out to tender concerns me.  Leaving such services to the private sector is unwise, judging by the sometimes poor levels of service that frustrate telephone-users throughout the State.  Access to emergency call services can be a matter of life and death and should be run with optimal efficiency and accountability rather than simply being put out to tender for anyone to operate.Regarding the recording of telephone calls from private operators, what protections are there?  For instance, telephone calls are reportedly recorded for training purposes, a widespread practice that I find excessively obtrusive.  What protections, if any, exist against such practices?  Perhaps the Minister might enlighten us in his reply.A stark illustration of the lack of regulation in communications is provided by premium-rate mobile telephone text messages.  Those currently come under the auspices of the so-called independent regulator, RegTel.  However, that is a complete misrepresentation of the position.  RegTel is a creature of the very companies that it is supposed to regulate.  Despite the presence on its board of eminently respectable people, including one of our esteemed colleagues in the Seanad, it is neither independent or regulatory.As my colleague, Deputy Ferris, revealed some months ago, and as illustrated in a recent "Prime Time" documentary, the premium-rate mobile text market is rife with abuse.  Tens of thousands of people have been ripped off to the tune of millions of euros by scams involving unsolicited text messages subject to reverse charges at premium rates.  Often the "mark", as I believe confidence tricksters term their victims, is unaware that he or she has been taken advantage of, unless the person happens to keep a constant check on what credit remains over an extended period.  People told Deputy Ferris of having been on the receiving end of such practices over a period of a year, with one person estimating that as much as €300 had been deducted.It is an absolute disgrace that it should be allowed to happen, and even worse that there seems to be no redress.  People who contact RegTel in the belief that it is an honest broker rarely receive any satisfaction, and many are afterwards astounded to be contacted directly by such companies as Realm Communications that operate such so-called services.  Nor does the Data Protection Commissioner seem to have had much success, although I am aware that similar scams operated in Britain led to companies that rent lines such as Opera Telecom being fined large amounts.  I wish that happened in Ireland.All that points to the urgent necessity for ComReg to assume responsibility for the area and end the farcical situation whereby the chancers who operate such capers are allowed to regulate themselves, which is akin to appointing muggers as judges in cases of street robbery.  There must also be regulation of price-charging regarding such companies as ntl Ireland, which is pushing ahead with charging customers who do not pay through direct debit, something that has caused much anger among the public.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	299	This Bill will pass relatively easily, since in recent years many Deputies have sought more power for the regulator.  I hope that when it passes, some of the wrongs that we see will be righted.There is no doubt that communications are at the heart of the economy, for a variety of reasons that I will shortly detail.  The current emphasis worldwide is on instant communication, and that is certainly true here.  There has been a sea change in the way we do business in this country, particularly since 1996 or 1997.Many Deputies have said that one need only think of the numbers of mobile telephones relative to the Irish population.  I recently heard that we had broken all records.  Not only has every living person now got a mobile telephone; some have two or three, since we now have more such telephones than residents recorded at the census.  Nothing brought things home to me more starkly than a young mother whom I saw a few evenings ago.  She had three children under ten, and they had four mobile telephones between them.Good or bad, that is the communications system that we will have in coming years.  However, as with everything else, when there is such a great expansion in modern technology, there must be an independent watchdog.  I have been in this House long enough to remember the time when one had to apply for a land-line telephone that one would receive in two years' time.

It was with a great sense of relief and rejoicing, particularly in rural areas, that one was connected with a land-line telephone 15 or 20 years ago.  We had great difficulty at that stage.Strangely enough, some of the problems now beginning to emanate from the system go back that far.  When the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was in control, before the advent of Eircom, there were checks and balances, since it was State-operated.  Good or bad, at least someone was answerable for it.  There was hue and cry at the time of privatisation, a policy that I supported on the basis it would lead to more investment and better infrastructure.  I am just referring to landlines.  There is no doubt that there was major investment over the years but greedy shareholders are now beginning to appear over the fence and in large areas of the country line work is being run down.  If I interpret the Bill correctly, I hope the regulator will be able to put manners on some sectors of the telecommunications sector.  We will see how he will manage the situation.  Some companies have become so strong that they are able to put two fingers up to anybody.  I hope I am wrong, however, and that great changes will come about as a result of this legislation.In the commercial world one would think that the consumer should be king but it is not always so.  Simple mistakes can occur, such as overcharging on phone bills.  Three weeks ago, I attempted to contact the people concerned about such an error.  I made 24 calls but did not get an answer.  I got through to several answering machines and was told to go from A to B, all over the country.  I thought I was ringing Galway city but I would get through to somebody in Cork or Dundalk.  I was directed all over the place but that is not good enough for ordinary consumers who might have problems with their telephone bills.Certain people, although few in number, do not have landline phones and may wish to apply for them.  In recent years, one could get a landline almost instantly but that is not the case now.  I have heard of surcharges being imposed for customers in rural areas, which is a dangerous precedent.  If the ESB had done that over the years it would mean that someone living in Bangor Erris or Caherciveen would have had to pay higher installation costs that people in Galway city or Dublin.  That would be neither fair nor reasonable.  People should not be penalised for where they live.  Now that we are granting the regulator greater powers, he will have plenty of opportunity to show what can be done.Line maintenance is another aspect of this sector.  It is a bit like having possession in football.  If one has the ball, one has a great chance of winning the match.  With the ESB, as with Eircom, the company that owns the lines and various installations has a great chance of deciding the course of action to be taken.  Much has been said about open competition but I have always had a sneaking suspicion that Eircom still calls the tune, although I may not be able to prove it.  We have competition and companies are springing up all over the place but how independent are they?  How competitive, sure and safe are they?  Smart Telecom was not very safe.  In that context, a root and branch investigation needs to be undertaken into how the system works.Small things can be a huge irritant, especially down the country.  When local authorities decide to widen a road or ease a bend to make it less dangerous there might be a telephone pole standing on the side of the road.  It may take five years to decide who is responsible for removing it.  They all want to ensure that the person whose house was built on that site will carry the can.  That is not good enough, however, because the person who built a house recently will have had nothing to do with erecting the pole originally.  In national politics that may not amount to a big issue, but it is certainly an irritant.  Many such matters will have to be dealt with by the parent company that inherited the lines, poles and wires.  Who owns the company now and is there any correlation between the two?  In this particular case, it is said that if the county council widened the road it should be responsible for moving the pole.  The council states, however, that it is concerned with road widening and road safety so it has nothing to do with the delivery of a telephone service.  Before one knows it, they will turn around and say "If you want that pole shifted, you do it".  I saw a tender for a simple job to relocate a telephone pole that would have cost almost €10,000.  That is the kind of money we are talking about.  ComReg will have a fair bit of business to do in finding out who should pay for it.The roll-out of broadband has been referred to many times in the debate.  There is no magic in broadband.  We all know it is a super-highway and we understand the necessity for the speed it provides.  For many years, we have also understood that if businesses are to be competitive they must have high-grade broadband.  There is never any trouble finding providers in Dublin or Galway city because there is a concentration of business in those centres.  In other words, there is money and profit in it, which means there will be activity.  The problem starts when one decides to go out into the rural areas.Over the years, I have always made a strong case for cottage industries.  It makes no difference whether one is in Blarney, Connemara or Ardee in County Louth.  If a person's business can be done from home and if it relies on broadband, there is no reason it cannot be carried out.  Businesses run from home mean that there is less traffic on the road because the people concerned do not have to commute.  In certain parts of the country, however, people will not be able to get broadband because there is a row over who will pay the piper.  At business breakfasts, I have been told by various companies that technically it is possible to install broadband anywhere.  The expertise and enthusiasm are there but until someone pays the extra cost nothing will happen.  A few months ago, the Government withdrew funding for broadband in remote areas.  It will take two and a half years before there is another attempt to introduce a similar scheme.  I cannot understand why this should take so long, although I certainly understand that many towns and villages in remote areas will never reach their full potential until this broadband issue is solved.  I hope this legislation will make a significant difference.I do not have a great personal knowledge of the growth of unsolicited calls but from what people tell me, it appears that many are being cleaned out financially as a result.  There is a certain element of innocence and I am a firm believer that anybody can be caught once but it is one's own fault to be caught a second time.  For some strange reason, people incur huge bills that they cannot afford to pay and something will have to be done in response to this issue.Regarding texting, some controls must be set in this area so people can feel safe.  The issue raised may not apply directly to this Bill but it is something ComReg will have to take note of in time.  I do not understand the technical provisions necessary to make the changes but there is a darker side to society and use is made of texts and mobile phones for anti-social purposes.  It is important families know that somebody is in control of these matters and that the people in control have the full power to address them.One of the main aims of this Bill is to create the so-called competition that I spoke of earlier.  I hope the powers ComReg will get as a result of this legislation will be on a par with those of the Competition Authority.  I have reason to believe that some of the efforts it has made mean that similar powers would be important to ComReg.It is important that the enforcement powers ComReg receives as a result of this Bill are clear, transparent and sharp.  Consumers must be able to understand them and there must be remedies that ensure people found guilty of anti-competitive behaviour are punished.  Fairly hefty fines are proposed in this Bill and anything less would be of no use because of the huge amounts of money involved.Another provision is a civil enforcement procedure to enable ComReg to enforce obligations relating to the sharing of physical infrastructure against non-undertakings.  I do not have much time at my disposal but I would like to think that someone will put the boot into the warring factions involved in the mobile phone industry when they get around to deciding where to place their masts in the country.  I hope that the existing masts reach optimum use and are multifunctional so that we do not see a scattering of unnecessary masts around the country.  There is evidence, to this day, of local authorities deciding not to grant planning permission only to see the decision overturned by An Bord Pleanála and I would like to see transparency in this regard.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I will respond on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, and I thank Members for their contributions.  I welcome the opportunity to comment on the various observations made on the provisions of this important Bill.The Bill is necessary, as Deputies have said, to ensure that the independent regulator, ComReg, has the tools required to ensure that the electronic communications sector is open and competitive  and that the individual and business consumer benefits from increased choice and lower prices for the services they need.  As the Minister outlined in his opening statement, the Bill contains a number of provisions designed to achieve this objective.  In this regard, the provisions for creating indictable offences with proportionate and dissuasive financial penalties and for competition law powers for ComReg are particularly important.  I note the general support of the House for these provisions.  Effective investigatory and enforcement powers are essential if ComReg is to carry out its function of ensuring compliance by all operators with their obligations under the regulatory framework.Deputy Durkan said that the Bill's provisions are too little, too late, but it gives ComReg significantly enhanced enforcement and investigative powers.  It provides for severe penalties for serious offences and no other regulator has the power that ComReg will have under this Bill.The Minister agrees that investment in infrastructure is important, but investment decisions are primarily commercial ones made by the operators.  Strong regulation of the market will provide operators with the certainty they require to underpin investment decisions and the Minister is satisfied that the Bill will provide this certainty.Deputy Broughan generally welcomed the provisions of the Bill, such as those for higher penalties and competition law powers.  The Deputy suggested a single regulator for the communications industry but given the complexity of communications and broadcasting issues, this could prove very difficult to achieve.The Smart Telecom issue related to contract debt between private sector companies and while it was most regrettable, ComReg had no power to intervene in the matter.  However, ComReg made great efforts to bring about a satisfactory outcome for the subscribers involved.  The Minister has requested ComReg to examine how such a situation can be avoided in the future.  ComReg now has a protocol in place to help protect consumers should a similar situation arise in the future.Deputy Broughan also mentioned low broadband penetration and the inclusion of competition law powers, together with serious financial penalties, should lead to an improvement in this area.  The rate of growth in broadband has accelerated in recent months compared to earlier growth rates.  There was an increase of over 60,000 in the third quarter of 2006, compared to an average increase of about 20,000 per quarter in 2005.Deputies made reference to delays by Eircom in the provision of telephone lines.  There can be a variety of reasons for delays in meeting requests for applications and individual cases must be considered on their merits.  ComReg has stated that it has concerns over the small number of applications that are not met in a reasonable timeframe and it has signalled its intention to set binding performance targets, as distinct from guidelines, for aspects of the universal service obligation, including installations.  The legislation requires ComReg to hold a public consultation before setting such targets and also provides for an enforcement mechanism should there be persistent failure to meet performance targets.  In the event of non-observation of a direction to comply with performance targets, ComReg may apply to the High Court for an order requiring compliance.Deputy Durkan referred to coverage in the Black Valley in County Kerry.  I am pleased to note his concern about one of the most beautiful areas in the country.  Telecommunications coverage and provision of services have been a problem in the valley due to its remote location.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	306	A recent report confirmed that service to the area, which is supplied by Eircom, is not adequate.  ComReg has encouraged Eircom to provide a solution which will satisfy the needs of the local population.  Eircom has an obligation to provide basic telephony services and functional Internet access to all consumers.  ComReg is in the process of formally assessing whether the current telephony service meets the requirements of Eircom's universal service obligations.  Depending on the outcome of the assessment and whether Eircom has provided a solution in the meantime, ComReg may consider an enforcement action.  I will ask officials to convey to Eircom the Deputy's concern about the matter.Deputies Catherine Murphy and Broughan raised the issue of a regulator of premium rate telephone services.  RegTel is a self-regulatory industry body which authorises and supervises content and promotion of the premium rate telecom services.  Neither the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources nor ComReg has a role with regard to content and RegTel does not report to the Minister.  In addition, the Data Protection Commissioner has strong investigative and protection powers with regard to unsolicited electronic communications.  The European Commission, in its consultation on safer mobile telephone use, recently stated that, where efficiently implemented, self-regulation by the industry is preferable to statutory intervention.  However, if there is a strong case for strengthening regulation in this area, it can be examined.The Minister is aware of recent coverage of customer dissatisfaction with NTL, particularly the company's introduction of new charging methods.  Neither the Minister nor ComReg has a role in this matter.  I understand the new National Consumer Agency and NTL have been in discussions to review the company's decision to charge a late payment fee.On the level of interest in providing the national emergency call answering service, the legislation proposes tendering for the provision of this service.  It is too early to know how many undertakings will be interested in providing the service.  The provisions relating to the establishment of an emergency call handling service and the regulation of the ie. domain name are important measures and I welcome Deputies' support for them.Deputy Connaughton is correct that Eircom provides poor customer service and I have asked officials to raise the matter with the company.  This is a source of serious frustration to customers nationwide.  I have also asked officials to raise the issue of telegraph poles being left in the middle of roads in counties in the west where planning permission has been granted for new houses but Eircom and the relevant local authority cannot agree on who should remove the poles.  I will ask officials to respond to Deputy Connaughton on the matter.I thank Deputies for their contributions and the interest they have shown in the Bill.  I welcome the support of the House for its provisions and look forward to its consideration on Committee and Report Stages, when the overall objective will be to place it on the Statute Book as soon as possible.

It is an issue I raised on the Adjournment almost two years ago on Thursday, 23 June 2005.  On that occasion, the project in question, a Bris project under the Garda's youth diversion programme, had just been suspended peremptorily without explanation.  Matters have worsened since then.  I know I only have five minutes and I am anxious to give the basis for my raising the matter.The Bris project was located in the deprived Westside area of Galway city.  One day gardaí arrived and took the equipment from the project, without explaining why, casting a shadow over the project and the community worker who was running it.  After that, an internal inquiry was conducted.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated he would not publish the results and that it was being examined by the Garda Síochána.The local organisation, Le Chéile, funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was sued before a rights commissioner for the difference between the minimum statutory redundancy and what was a reasonable payment to the community worker.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform refused to pay up.  I raised this issue as recently as yesterday with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Ministers of State, and was told recently that for several weeks the file was on the desk of the Secretary General of the Department.  I received a letter suggesting the Department was taking legal opinion as to whether or not it would pay the community worker.  I sought legal opinion which stated the Department has a clear duty to pay and should have done so.The letters that have been sent by the Department in the course of this matter are incredible.  A letter dated 18 August 2006 stated:Dear Deputy,In the absence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I wish to refer further to your correspondence in relation to Parliamentary Question No. 538 of 6 July 2006.The Bris project has been the subject of an independent evaluation report.  It is not proposed to publish this report.  The report is currently being examined by the Garda Authorities and will be forwarded to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform together with recommendations.Until the Minister has received and examined the final report and recommendations of the Garda authorities, it would be inappropriate for him to comment further.The reason for ending the project has not been explained and shadows have been left hanging over it.  In addition, a report was commissioned almost two years ago and it has been suggested that report will not be published.  Furthermore, an evaluation was to be carried out and a tender process established for a replacement project.Cutting to the chase, this project involved the VEC and voluntary workers and involved organising a football tournament, all of which was suddenly ended without explanation.  It was initially suggested that another group might take over from the group originally engaged by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.It is interesting and most shameful that after Ms Janet Hughes, the rights commissioner, had given an award to John Middleton, the former community worker, the Garda Síochána wrote to say it had no responsibility in this matter as it was not the employer, pointing out that it was a matter for the agency, Le Chéile.  The Garda Síochána sought to wash its hands of the matter.  Le Chéile wrote to the union who represented Mr. Middleton stating:Further to our telephone conversation, I am writing to confirm that Le Chéile Westside Limited has referred the recommendation of the rights commissioner, Janet Hughes, in this matter to the Department of Justice through Galway Gardaí.As you are aware, Le Chéile facilitated the Department by putting Mr. Middleton on its payroll to keep PAYE and PRSI in order but at all times the Gardaí controlled the finances.  Le Chéile is a voluntary community group with no assets.I trust this clarifies the situation for you.The Department and the Minister have left the project unfunded, the people of the Westside without a project, the community worker without satisfaction and now refuse to pay an award made against them by a rights commissioner.  What a shameful performance by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I thank Deputy Michael D. Higgins for raising this issue on the Adjournment.Garda youth diversion projects are a vital and integral part of our youth justice system and operate as community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives.  They seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour.  The projects provide activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve the prospects of employment for the participants.  Apart from the direct benefits to the participants, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing the relationship between the Garda Síochána and local communities.The projects are funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Their overall administration is the responsibility of the community relations section of the Garda Síochána.  The individual projects are run by a number of service providers which directly employ the project co-ordinator and are responsible for programming, staffing and day-to-day operation of their project.The projects are established by the Garda Síochána, following a process of consultation with local community interests and youth service providers, in response to local crime problems.  They have the objective of giving local communities some degree of ownership of a solution to the problems facing their areas.  The management committees, therefore, seek to represent the various interests involved, including the community.  Participation in the projects is voluntary.Guidelines for the operation of the projects deal with their establishment, their ongoing operation, setting up of management structures, administration procedures, financial controls and accountability mechanisms, and the monitoring and evaluation process and must be adhered to in all cases.Since 1991 when they were first established, the number of projects has grown to 84, with the announcement of ten new projects on 4 January.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is committed to the development and expansion of the diversion programme and has set a target of 100 projects by the end of this year.  A demonstration of the commitment of this Government to the diversion projects is the fact that the total amount of funding for them in 2007 is €9.8 million.  This represents an increase of 48% over funding allocated to the projects in 2006.  This funding is part of an overall funding of €120 million which has been secured under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 for the development and expansion of the diversion programme.  This funding will allow for the expansion of the number of projects to 130 during the lifetime of the plan.Alongside the expansion process, a system of evaluation will be developed and implemented by the youth justice service of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to measure the effectiveness of the programme.  The remit of the service is the management and development of all services relating to young people who offend.Turning to the specific issue that is the subject of the Deputy's request, it is important to outline some of the history of the project in question.  The project was established on 14 May 2001.  The voluntary organisation referred to by the Deputy agreed to become the employer of the project staff.  As such, it was responsible for all issues regarding contract of employment, salary and supervisory management.

The project was terminated on 31 May 2005.  It was the understanding of the Garda authorities that the project co-ordinator had been offered a severance package by the employing organisation.

A copy of the determination of the rights commissioner had not been forwarded to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or to the Garda Síochána at that time.

The recommendation clearly stated that this payment should be made by the employing agency itself.The Minister is unaware of what, if any, correspondence or dealings the former co-ordinator has had since then with the employing agency to secure this enhanced redundancy payment but it is apparent from representations made on behalf of the former co-ordinator that, to date, no such payment has been made.The Minister obtained preliminary legal advice on this matter today to which he will give his urgent consideration and he will keep the Deputy informed of any developments in this regard.

This is due to be announced within the next two months.I concur with Deputy Higgins that a project is required in the area.  I am anxious that we secure approval to commence a new project in Westside and would be delighted to have the Deputy's co-operation in the establishment of this project.

It is based in a building that is due to be demolished and refurbished as part of an overall programme for the area.  The crèche has room for approximately 24 children and has 12 staff all of whom are on the community employment scheme.  They all love their work and seem to be very popular with the children and their parents.  We were contacted earlier this week and advised of its imminent closure.  There is disbelief locally.  People cannot believe that in a time when we need to increase the number of crèche facilities we could be closing a community-run crèche.  It does not make sense.Some of the women on the scheme are in their 50s and my understanding of the scheme is that they would normally have worked for between six and seven years.  There are also women in their 40s with up to three years and women in their 30s with two to two and a half years.  It does not make sense to take the women from this facility.  It is reasonably priced.  Many of the people with children at the crèche are on low incomes.  Some of them are in employment and others are in full-time education.  Their difficulty is that there is no alternative.  They will not be able to afford private sector child care and they are at a loss as to why any State body would close a crèche in this day and age.One of the workers was told in a supermarket that the crèche would close.  The workers received a phone call from someone in FÁS, but they have not received anything officially in writing.  There is disbelief and confusion locally.  We have been asked to report back to staff on Monday, hopefully with some reasonable explanation as to why the crèche will close.  The Departments responsible need to wake up to the crisis that will face the families in the area.  While we are all in favour of people moving on to education etc., if we do not have the facilities in place, that education will fall by the wayside.  I hope the Minister of State has answers for us.  There is a crisis in the area and people do not know where to go.  Some of the women who are in their 50s will find it difficult to move on.  They love their work and want to continue at it.  Some time next year I believe the site of the existing facility will become a €1.5 million community centre.  A youth and ladies club will operate at the new St. Muirin's community centre.  In the meantime if this crèche closes the community will face a crisis and everyone wants to know why.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue along with my fellow Tallaght-based colleague, Deputy Crowe.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to raise this important issue on a day when he clearly had many items on his desk.  I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and I hope he has answers for us.As Deputy Crowe has outlined, this crèche has been operating for 16 years and has 24 children currently.  Many devastated parents have contacted us in the past week since Thursday's edition of The Echo broke the story.  With other colleagues I was in St. Muirin’s House yesterday — it was not the first time I visited the facility — and I sat down with the children who were drawing, painting and having a good time in a very safe environment.  It is easy to understand how successful the crèche has been.  I have had a long-term contact with that project.  When I was first elected to the council for Tallaght-Central in 1999, St. Muirin’s featured as an issue being brought to our attention.  As Deputy Crowe said there was a campaign for a new facility and I am glad that we, as members of the council, were present to see it to fruition.  I hope that next year we will see the new facility built and opened.Meanwhile today's crisis is the crèche.  The committee and workers met executives of FÁS last night.  Despite that meeting and certain statements from FÁS, the workers' situation remains unclear.  We want absolute clarification and I hope FÁS has fully briefed the Minister of State.  We need to be able to go back to the workers and advise them how safe their jobs are and confirm absolutely that the crèche will continue to operate.  It is a vital service locally.  It is Government policy based on social inclusion criteria to help people get back to the workplace.  I do not want to make a political point.  There are jobs and, thank God, in recent years Tallaght has benefited from employment opportunities.  As my colleague has said while we want people to take work we cannot provide crèche places.  In this case what appears to be a very happy and safe crèche is being jeopardised because of what appears to be FÁS red tape.  If the Minister of State wants to correct me on that presumption, I will stand corrected.I received a large number of calls on this important issue over the weekend.  I went to the crèche yesterday and saw the position for myself.  I spoke to people who gave me testimonials.  One lady said she has tremendous experience from working in the FÁS finance project and she does not want to leave.  Another trainee told me she had asked if she could do a training course and her supervisor told her no money was available to her and that she should write to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to ask for the money.  I did not hear that FÁS had problems in that regard and did not hear FÁS being challenged in that regard.I look forward to the statement of the Minister of State.  I will certainly make contact with the Minister in the next few days.  I hope that by the time we meet the parents again next Monday we can give them an absolute guarantee that this project is safe, that the children will have their crèche places and everything will be normal.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Community employment is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary basis.  Community employment helps unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and by assisting them to develop their technical and personal skills.Community employment as an active labour market programme has the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed to this end with primary regard to the needs of participants and the community.  In addition, this programme with its focus on the needs of disadvantaged persons, forms a major response by FÁS to tackling the social exclusion of such groups as persons with a disability, lone parents, long-term unemployed and drug mis-users with a view to their re-integration into the labour market.In July 2006 my Department published its sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005.  One of the key highlights of this plan is to increase participation rates of people with disabilities on community employment over the period of the plan and to raise the community employment participation limits for people with disabilities.  In order to provide additional training to assist progression to employment for people with disabilities under 55 years of age, the participation limit has been raised by one year from three to four years, and for people with disabilities over 55 years of age, the participation limit has also been raised by one year from six to seven years.FÁS is continuing to develop the content of the community employment programme.  The new approach involves the introduction of an "individual learner planning process" which is focusing on meeting the learning needs of participants.  The individual learner plan is providing for the planning, organising and recording of the work experience, training and development that each participant receives while working on community employment.  It also includes further training and development for supervisors, a new application process and quality assurance procedures.Support for this individualised approach is the hallmark of the Education and Qualifications Act 1999, with its focus on individual access, transfer and progression towards accredited and quality assured learning.  Under the Act, FÁS has proposed new FETAC awards relevant to community employment and JI learners.  The two awards are a certificate in personal and social employment skills and a certificate in vocational employment skills.  These new awards will facilitate all the planned learning completed on community employment or JI by each participant being rolled up into the achievement of a FETAC award.  This will provide added value to the learner and will support their progression onto further training or employment.Funding for community employment in 2007 has been provided with a view to maintaining overall numbers on FÁS schemes at 2006 levels.  There are more than 22,000 people employed on community employment schemes nationally, a figure which has been maintained throughout 2006.  It is anticipated that FÁS will utilise its full allocation in this area during 2007.Operationally, in delivering these places, FÁS operates flexibly in the management of this allocation in order to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.  This provision of places is managed through a standardised application process between regional FÁS offices and local sponsor-community organisations and any issues regarding the allocation of places are dealt with in this context.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.I am informed by FÁS that the position in relation to St. Muirin's House crèche, Avonbeg, Tallaght, Dublin is that FÁS and the local management committee have agreed to keep the crèche running until a new creche facility is provided in the area early next year.An acting supervisor will be appointed and local people, in conjunction with FÁS and South Dublin County Council, will initiate a temporary refurbishment of the current crèche and concentrated efforts will be made to improve the surrounding area.After many years I am glad to be able to give good news on an Adjournment debate.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, has good news for me also.Last Friday I met workers from the airport and was shocked at the way in which they reacted to what is happening.  They feel let down, demoralised and wronged by what is happening with regard to the cost-cutting measures.  They feel particularly let down by the Government and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen.  Many of our local Fianna Fáil representatives, and the Taoiseach, criticise the cuts made by the Dublin Airport Authority and local management at Shannon when it was the Government who appointed the Dublin Airport Authority with the task in the first place.Apart from this, what is happening at Shannon is that a profit-cutting exercise has become a cost-cutting exercise.  Last September the Marsh Bar, the only public bar at Shannon Airport, was closed.  This had the effect of reducing revenues and profits.  In other words, the move has increased costs.  It has also meant the loss of a venue at Shannon Airport particularly for the non-travelling public.  Every time I pass those closed doors I see the sign, "Closed until further notice.  We apologise for any inconvenience caused."  If the Dublin Airport Authority is so apologetic, why does it not reopen the bar?  Given that the Taoiseach described the move as petty I ask him to intervene and restore Shannon Airport to its former state.  Some time later the Estuary restaurant had its hours curtailed, now closing at 3 p.m.  I invite the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and Mr. Collier to Shannon Airport any day of the week to explain to customers at 3.05 p.m. the reason no hot food is available.  At present workers on the ground have to apologise for the lack of service.  This is another example of revenue and profit cutting and increasing costs.  Last week 23 staff members got notice that Londis in Shannon will close and also that the Estuary restaurant could close.  A few years ago the tourism board warned that the fáilte was disappearing from Irish life and this would have a negative effect on tourism.  I can see no better example of this than what is happening at Shannon Airport.Shannon is synonymous with catering, friendliness and good food and staff do their utmost to accommodate the needs of passengers.  In the past workers have gone beyond the call of duty.  They are proud of their jobs, Shannon Airport and the role it plays in the mid-west.  Into the atmosphere of goodwill has come the swinging and demoralising cuts.  This is because talks concluded with the management.  The management went on local radio last week and said the time for talking is over.  The time for talking is never over in these disputes.  Is it any wonder the offer from the management was turned down by an overwhelming majority of staff who did not just see their jobs at stake but a whole life at Shannon Airport and a unique asset?I have asked the Minister for Transport to intervene previously.  I ask him again now.  Just because out-sourcing appears to be the buzzword it does not necessarily mean a better business model.  It does not serve the customer better and it does not create a better airport.We all know about the rip off prices from the fast food outlets at other airports which the travelling public experience from time to time.  We in the mid-west do not want a yellow pack airport as some of the other airports in Continental Europe have become.  Shannon has a vibrant and profitable catering business and valuable in-flight catering contracts.  We realise Shannon has to be put on a competitive footing and the workers are willing to negotiate.  They have adopted this approach previously and will do so again if allowed enter talks as partners and not already on the back foot.On the issue of competitors, I ask the Minister if the Government is planning for another U-turn in its commitment that Shannon's debt be absorbed by the Dublin Airport Authority as it did with Cork Airport last week.I turn to the economic and tourism development plan for the airport and the region.  The Minister ignored the recommendation of the Sorensen and Dukes report and calls for an economic impact study on the effect of Open Skies on Shannon.  What he has promised is an economic and tourism development plan but we have heard little about this plan since its launch in June 2006.  In October 2006 the Minister stated that preparation of this plan was at an advanced staged and the various submissions were being considered.  Four months later I would appreciate if the Minister of State would enlighten me as to the state of progress on the plan and when it will be implemented.The mid-west needs Shannon Airport to continue as a major gateway and a hub for the region.  With this in mind I ask the Government to take its responsibility seriously for balanced regional development and to convey these sentiments to the Minister.  I hope there will be a move tomorrow in the Labour Relations Commission and that Shannon Airport can be protected.  We do not want another situation that will damage the airport for the forthcoming summer season.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	322	Gabhaim buíochas don Teachta Breen as ucht na deise a thabhairt dom an cheist seo a phlé.  If Shannon Airport is to develop as a successful and sustainable business, it is clear that one of the issues which must be addressed in its business plan is the airport's uncompetitive cost base.  When that obstacle is overcome, the airport has a real opportunity to develop new markets and attract the airline customers it needs for its commercial future.While industrial relations at Shannon Airport are a matter for the Dublin Airport Authority and local management, I understand that the company, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, has made substantial efforts over a long period to find agreement with the trade unions involved on how the airport could operate efficiently and in a sustainable manner.  Unfortunately, even though the process had the assistance of the LRC, I understand that it has not been possible so far to find agreement on the way forward.  I am sure Deputy Pat Breen will join with me in hoping that the right climate to initiate meaningful negotiations between the parties may emerge as soon as possible so that the issues around the sustainability of Shannon Airport can be addressed once and for all.The Deputy referred to the proposed tourism and economic development plan.  It is important to state that this plan was initiated in the context of the ongoing EU-US open skies negotiations.  In preparing the plan, the Department of Transport has consulted with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance.  A separate liaison group established by the Mid West Regional Authority has also submitted a report on the development of the Shannon region for consideration.  It is hoped to bring the tourism and economic development plan to fruition in the context of the finalisation of the ongoing EU-US open skies negotiations, which will include transitional arrangements for Shannon.

This is a critical element of our ongoing accreditation to ISO 14001 which we achieved for our headquarters offices in 2003.  We are working towards achieving this certification for all our offices.My Department's policy is to use a number of energy saving devices such as energy efficient lights, powersave function on electrical office equipment and photocopiers with duplex facilities.  This has led to energy consumption in the Department's headquarters decreasing from 982,000 kilo Watt hours in 2003 to just over 948,000 kilo Watt hours in 2005.My Department has committed to obtaining its electricity from renewable sources and following a tender process, under the auspices of the Office of Public Works, a contract is now in place with Energia for the supply of electricity from renewable sources to the Department's main offices.Under the Government's decentralisation programme, the bulk of my Department's Dublin based operations are being decentralised to four locations in the South East.  In collaboration with the OPW, my Department has set very high environmental specifications for its decentralised offices.  It is intended that the new offices will incorporate many of the latest developments in sustainable construction, energy conservation and use of renewable energy sources.While the day to day operation of the Agencies are a matter for the Agencies themselves, I am advised that in keeping with Government policy on energy efficiency, most of the Agencies under the remit of my Department are active in promoting energy conservation in their offices including, for example, the use of low energy light fittings, solar panels and other renewable sources of energy.  In some instances, heating systems are modified to facilitate temperature control in individual offices.  My Department is also undertaking a review of the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Residential Density to take account of changing population and settlement patterns and the extensive experience built up since the introduction of the 1999 guidelines in the design, assessment and development of higher density proposals.I have noted that many of the policies and measures outlined by the Urban Forum in their recent paper, such as NSS alignment of NDP expenditure, implementation of the Regional Planning Guidelines and the Atlantic Gateways Initiative, are already being addressed by my Department.  I am confident that the continuing implementation of these policies outlined above will have a positive influence on bringing about more compact urban design and sustainable development within the consolidated area of the capital into the future.

I am committed to updating these standards on a continuous and regular basis in accordance with the requirements of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. (2002/91/EC).This Government has improved the energy performance of buildings three times since 1997. I will shortly be announcing the further review of these standards with the intention of improving energy efficiency of new Irish homes by 40% or more relative to current standards. Once adopted, the revised Regulations will apply nationally.The approach adopted by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in regard to energy efficiency in housing schemes of more than 10 houses will be useful in the review of the existing standards.  The approach adopted by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown was commended by my Department.It should be noted that Ireland's building energy standards compare very well internationally. Data produced by the European Insulation Manufacturers Association showed that Ireland's insulation standards are among the highest in the EU. We have the second lowest energy loss through walls behind Sweden and the lowest loss of energy through roofs.On the broader energy efficiency issue, I noted German newspaper reports last week that a study by the German Economic Institute showed that Ireland was the most energy efficient nation among industrial nations studied by the Institute.

Determination of management fees is primarily a matter for the management company.  My Department does not have a role in this or other aspects of company governance.The Director of Corporate Enforcement published a report on the operation of management companies in December 2006, which includes guidance for company directors and members on company governance.  I understand that changes to simplify company law applying to management companies are also proposed.  A consultation paper dealing with a range of issues relating to property management in multi-unit developments was published by the Law Reform Commission in December 2006.  Both of these papers are currently subject to a public consultation process.The Government have already decided that property managing agents will be regulated by the Property Services Regulatory Authority being established by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This Authority will regulate property service providers, including property managing agents, which are commercial firms engaged by management companies to provide management and maintenance services for which management fees are paid. I understand that legislation to establish the Authority is being prepared and that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is also convening an inter-Departmental committee to assist in the development of a legislative response to issues generally relating to property management companies.  My Department will be represented on this committee and will make every possible contribution to its work.

The Commission made it clear that many of its recommendations involve only relatively minor modifications or additions to the system.In response to the report, the Government has established a Cabinet Committee on Electronic Voting, which I chair, to consider the report in detail; to report to the Government on the full implications of the Commission recommendations; consider the composition of a peer review group  — drawn from international electoral reform bodies and the IT industry — to supervise any software redesign work; report to the Government on confidence building measures; and identify any other improvements that might be built into the system.The Cabinet Committee also includes the Tánaiste and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The work of the Committee, which met most recently earlier this month, is underway to address the important and complex issues involved.The timing of the further use of the system depends on the outcome of the ongoing work of the Committee, the associated decisions arising in this regard, and the dates at which future polls may be held.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	327	Details of the revised housing adaptation grant schemes for older people and people with a disability were announced recently as part of My Department's new housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.  The revised schemes are based on the outcome of the review of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme which was recently completed within my Department.  The review also incorporated the conditions governing the Essential Repairs Grant scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly scheme.As part of the new conditions, a revised grant scheme to be known as the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, will be introduced.  The scheme will assist in the provision/adaptation of accommodation to meet the needs of people with a disability.  The maximum grant available will be €30,000.Significant improvements have been made to the terms and conditions of the grant scheme for people with disabilities in recent years.  In 2001, the percentage of works covered by the grant was increased from two-thirds to 90%.  Under the revised scheme the Housing Adaptation Grant has been further improved and may now cover up to 95% of the approved cost of works.The Housing Adaptation Grant Scheme for People with a Disability is intended, like a number of other housing grant schemes operated by my Department, to assist works which provide additional or adapted accommodation in private houses.  However, it is not designed to cover the full cost of works for all applicants. Local authorities may provide reconstruction loans to qualified applicants who have difficulty in obtaining finance to meet the balance of the cost.  The grant may cover the full cost of the works to local authority dwellings.The revised scheme will become operational during 2007 and I intend to issue detailed administrative guidance later this year to all local authorities.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 109 and 190 together.The Review of Local Government Financing by Indecon Economic Consultants estimated, on the basis of different methods of projecting expenditure, that by 2010 local authority expenditure would increase by €1 billion to €2 billion in nominal terms over 2004 levels.  Funding this expenditure will be met by a combination of the buoyancy in the existing funding system, some additional funding and the achievement of efficiencies over the period.Indecon estimated that commercial rates income and motor tax income would increase in line with the consumer price index.  However, there is significant natural buoyancy in the current revenue sources, with the valuation bases of local authorities growing substantially as a result of continued economic growth.  In addition, revenue from motor taxation — which is paid directly into the Local Government Fund — continues to increase without any increases in the rates of this taxation; in 2006, motor tax revenues totalled €879.7m, an increase of 9.6% above 2005 levels.  The combined additional income from rates and motor tax alone will substantially address the Indecon income gap projections.Since the publication of the Indecon Report, I have put in place a number of measures to supplement local authority income and to enhance efficiencies across the sector.For 2007, I have allocated some €948m in general purpose grants to local authorities, an increase of 8% over the record amount provided in 2006. General purpose grants are my Department's contribution towards meeting the cost to local authorities of providing an acceptable level of day to day services to their customers.Under the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006, local authorities can now collect entry year property levies on newly valued commercial property from the date of their valuation rather than the next rating year, as was the case heretofore.  This provision is expected to generate some €20m in additional revenue to local authorities each year.The Indecon report acknowledged that local authorities have achieved significant efficiencies in a number of areas and are focused on pursuing ongoing improvements. They are utilising new integrated financial management systems, incorporating modern accounting practices.  A shared service approach is being promoted, for example in regional waste management planning and water management.  Annual reporting on performance over a range of 42 service areas provides an innovative insight into the functioning of local authorities and represents an important step in measuring performance across the entire local government sector.Measures to combat motor tax evasion are being continued and stepped up. I am also considering ways of bringing planning fees, which are fixed by Regulations, into line with the economic cost of dealing with planning applications. In addition, the Value for Money Unit in my Department will continue to undertake in-depth analyses of local authority activities and identify "best practice".In line with a recommendation in the Indecon report, I have amended the Local Government Act 2001 to provide for the mandatory establishment of audit committees to ensure a more comprehensive audit function in local authorities.  These committees, to be established this year, will have an independent role in advising the Council on financial reporting processes, internal control, risk management and audit matters, as part of the systematic review of the control environment and governance procedures of local authorities.I am also developing a new costing system for the local government sector which will deliver enhanced management information, particularly in relation to unit costs.  This will facilitate local authorities in assessing their unit costs over time and in comparing costs with other local authorities.

I recognise the need to ensure that the efforts and commitment of the vast majority of retailers are not undermined by the non-compliance of a few. Therefore, my Department has written to local authorities asking them to carry out inspections of retail outlets with a view to improving current practices in relation to the implementation of the Plastic Bag Levy Regulations. An enforcement network of local authority officers has been established to monitor and co-ordinate the enforcement drive.The relevant enforcement officers have extensive powers to enter any retail premises, to conduct any searches or investigations considered necessary, and to inspect or remove any records, books and documents for the purposes of any proceedings in relation to the levy.All complaints received in my Department concerning non-compliance are forwarded to the relevant local authority and the Revenue Commissioners. The operation of the levy is also subject to the normal Revenue Commissioner auditing arrangements.Where information in relation to possible non-compliance arises, this should be notified to the relevant local authority. Alternatively the Deputy may wish to notify my Department who will forward any information supplied to the relevant authorities.Deputies will be aware of my decision this week to raise the plastic bag levy to 22 cent under new Regulations which take effect from 1 July. There has been no increase in the levy since its inception and I am anxious to ensure that its impact is not diminished. Income from the levy has been increasing in the recent past and data from levies remitted and population estimates provided by the Central Statistics Office would indicate that plastic bag usage rose from the initial rate of 21 bags per capita following introduction of the levy in 2002 to 30 currently.I am increasing the levy to the maximum of 22 cent allowable under the existing legislation. I believe that it will have the desired effect in stemming the pattern of increased usage of plastic bags that has been evident.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 184 and 576 together.There are a number of social housing options available to households who cannot meet their own accommodation needs.  The main options are social rented accommodation provided by local authorities, by voluntary and co-operative housing bodies or under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).A statutory assessment of housing need is undertaken by local authorities on a triennial basis.  The most recent assessment of need for social housing was undertaken by local authorities in March 2005.  The results of that assessment indicated that there were 43,684 households on local authority housing waiting lists.  More comprehensive data in relation to the 2005 assessment at an individual local authority level was published in the Annual Bulletin of Housing Statistics, a copy of which is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.My Department does not have figures on the number of applicants for voluntary or community housing; however, some 75% of householders accommodation by this sector are taken from local authority waiting lists.RAS caters for the accommodation needs of households in receipt of rent supplement who have a long-term housing need.  The target group for RAS is the number of households on rent supplement for more than 18 months.  The target national figure, for the end of 2006, is 31,959 households.  There is, however, a significant overlap between households in receipt of rent supplement and those on local authority waiting lists.An objective and comprehensive assessment of a person or family's housing need is an essential first step in putting in place a modern system of housing supports.  As part of the social housing reform programme outlined in Delivering Homes; Sustaining Communities, a new means of assessment is being developed to provide an improved basis for policy development and service delivery.  This new means of assessment has been the subject of consultation with local authorities through the CCMA and the social partners through the Housing Forum and is currently being discussed with relevant special needs groups.  The key components of the new approach include:an objective set of criteria to enable local authorities to assess need for housing support;a rigorous but fair and consistent approach to means testing;early assessment by housing authorities to build up individual case histories of requirements and support responses; andmaintenance of a record of household preferences to reflect as far as possible individual choice.The total Exchequer provision for housing in 2007 is almost €1.5 billion — an increase of 9% on the 2006 provision.  Specifically, resources available this year will allow for over 6,600 local authority houses to be started/acquired; some 2,000 starts by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector and continuing implementation of the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  In addition, NDP 2007-2013 announced a €18 billion investment programme in housing over the next seven years. This programme sets targets of 60,000 new units of social housing together with some 40,000 affordable homes to be delivered over the Plan period.

They operate in accordance with local government and other legislation, as well as national policy, directions and guidelines as provided for in such legislation.   In their day-to-day activities, local authorities are accountable on an on-going basis to their elected members, who in turn are accountable to the electorate every five years through the election process.Within this framework, arrangements have been put in place by my Department to oversee and monitor the operations of local authorities; these include ongoing formal and informal liaison between the Minister, the Department and local authorities (at elected member and senior management levels).  Local authorities are also subject to audit by the Local Government Audit Service, and, to review by the Office of the Ombudsman.  They are, in addition, subject to the Freedom of Information Act.The programme of modernisation in local government, which has been underway for over 10 years, incorporates many elements that strengthen the accountability of local authorities.  These include—An emphasis on the role of elected members in determining policy and in monitoring and overseeing the implementation of such policy by management, especially through Strategic Policy Committees and Corporate Policy GroupsThe introduction of an ethics framework for elected members and senior staff in local authoritiesThe introduction of modern financial management and accounting systems, as well as new audit committeesA focus on improving the quality of services provided to the public, including greater use of customer consultation, improved complaints procedures, and the requirement to report publicly on performance across a range of service indicators.I am satisfied that these arrangements ensure a level of accountability compatible with the independent standing of local authorities and in the broader context of the principle of subsidiarity.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 123 together.The Green Paper on European Energy Policy, published in March 2006 by the European Commission, recognised that the use of nuclear power was a matter for decision by each Member State.While it is a matter for the UK to decide on its energy mix, the issues for Ireland arising from decisions made by the UK on nuclear policy are well known and long standing. The issue of reprocessing operations at Sellafield raises particular concerns for Ireland and the Energy Review as published was silent on any future role for reprocessing in the context of UK new build. This issue was particularly addressed in a submission by my Department to the UK Energy Review Consultation that also reiterated Ireland's concerns on radioactive discharges to the Irish Sea, the danger of accidents, the continued reprocessing of spent fuel, the threat of terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities, proliferation issues, marine transports of nuclear fuel as well as waste and the risks arising from the proximity of nuclear power stations located in the UK to Ireland itself.These issues are raised directly and regularly at official and Ministerial level with the UK and most recently were addressed by me in my meeting with Alistair Darling, M.P., Secretary of State for the Department of Trade and Industry on 9 January.I am aware of the recent judicial review by the UK courts of the Energy Review consultation which determined that the consultation process was inadequate. As this finding was procedural rather than substantive, it would not appear to offer any new approach to pursuing Ireland's concerns. These will continue to be pressed through the channels referred to above.

These action plans identify priority needs and provide a coherent and coordinated response to those needs across all housing sectors, including the voluntary and co-operative sector, and translate the objectives for social and affordable housing identified in the housing strategies into specific target driven delivery programmes.Because the action plans are focused on delivery, my Department has introduced three year rolling implementation programmes to support the process and meets with individual local authorities annually to review progress. I propose to issue updated guidelines on action plans to local authorities later this year to take account of the experience gained in the current round of the action plans and of the policy direction of the Housing Policy Statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.

Ireland also co-operates on this issue with like minded coastal States at international fora such as the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Our concerns relate to safety, security and environmental risk from an accident or incident.Arising from our efforts over the years, information is made available to Ireland on a voluntary and confidential basis by the Governments of shipping States, principally, Japan, France and the UK, in relation to shipments of radioactive material including MOX fuel.  The Irish Government in response makes clear that such shipments are unwelcome, and seeks and obtains assurances from shipping States that such shipments will not enter Irish territorial waters and that they comply with the stringent system of regulation established in line with internationally agreed standards and practices.The information received is transmitted for operational reasons to relevant Government Authorities such as the Coast Guard Service. The Coast Guard has access to Naval resources (and other resources of the State) as and when required to address operational requirements on a case by case basis.Any potential accident or incident involving these shipments would be covered by the Bi-Lateral Agreement on Early Notification of a Nuclear Incident between Ireland and the UK, and there is a highly developed co-operation and co-ordination relationship between the respective Coast Guards of Ireland and the UK in relation to all potential maritime emergencies.  Additionally, I understand that the company undertaking these marine shipments has in place standing emergency response teams and procedures providing continuous cover on all aspects of emergency response should the need arise.

I welcomed the presentation by the Commission of its communications Limiting Global Climate Change to 2 Degrees Celsius — the way ahead for 2020 and beyond and An Energy Policy for Europe, which formed the basis for our discussions.The Council reaffirmed the position that developed countries should collectively reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the order of 30% by 2020 compared to 1990.In that context, we agreed that the EU is willing to commit to a reduction of 30% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 as its contribution to a global and comprehensive agreement for the period beyond 2012, provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emissions reductions, and that economically more advanced developing countries adequately contribute according to their responsibilities and respective capabilities.Furthermore, we decided that, until a global and comprehensive post-2012 agreement is concluded, and without prejudice to its position to the EU's position in international negotiations, the EU should make an independent commitment to achieve at least a 20% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990.We also decided that a differentiated approach to the contributions of the Member States to these targets, that reflects fairness and transparency and taking into account national circumstances, is needed. The Commission and the Member States will work closely on an analysis of criteria to form the basis of further discussions, which will contribute to the formulation of individual commitments of the Member States, including Ireland.

This sum is in addition to €20 million provided in my Department's Vote in 2006.According to Greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe 2006, published by the European Environment Agency, ten EU Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) have decided to use the flexible mechanisms to meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. Total financial resources of approximately €2,830 million have been allocated for the five-year Kyoto Protocol commitment period to meet a combined purchasing commitment of 552.5 million allowances for the period. This corresponds to about one third of the required emissions reduction of 8% for the EU-15.In 2006, Ireland invested €20 million in Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund operated by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Five other EU Member States have invested in this fund; Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg, Spain and Sweden. Ireland has also signed agreements to invest €20 million in funds operated by the World Bank. As these funds have not yet been launched, I am not in a position at this time to say which other EU Member States may have invested in these funds.The types of projects that are supported by funds operated by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank include:renewable energy projects such as solar, biomass, wind, and geothermal initiatives.energy efficiency projects that reduce consumption of fossil fuels.recovery and use of methane from, for example, waste landfills and waste-water treatment.switching to fuels with lesser greenhouse gas intensity, for example from coal to natural gas.While the purchase of allowances by parties to the Kyoto Protocol does not lead to domestic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for those parties, the flexible mechanism facility in the Kyoto Protocol recognises the equivalence in impact of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that take place anywhere in the world.  The flexible mechanisms provide an essential nucleus for the development of a global carbon market and also promote the transfer of clean technology to developing countries.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I propose to take Questions Nos. 104, 140, 159 and 178 together.A broad range of policies and measures is being implemented to address pressures in the urban environs of Dublin and promote balanced regional development across the country.   A key policy response has been the National Spatial Strategy (NSS), which was published in November 2002.The NSS acknowledges that it is not sustainable for Dublin to continue to spread outwards into counties on its periphery and beyond, and that imbalanced development impacts on quality of life through, for example, long-distance commuting patterns and people living further away from where they work.The NSS seeks to distribute the anticipated growth in population across all regions and to generate the economic and social benefits closer to where people live.  The target is to consolidate the future growth of the capital through more compact development and to strengthen the other gateway cities to enable them to grow to their full potential and provide more spatially balanced patterns of development around the country.Similarly, the Regional Planning Guidelines for the Greater Dublin Area, prioritise the consolidation of development within the Metropolitan Area, allowing for the accommodation of a greater population than at present, together with a much-enhanced public transport system.  Outside the Metropolitan Area, the concentration of development at key identified towns, with higher residential development densities, particularly in locations close to public transport corridors, will over time lead to a more compact urban form, relative to the size of population, and should reduce the growth in overall demand for travel.Furthermore, to secure more balanced regional development across the western and southern parts of the island of Ireland, complementing the growth currently being experienced in the Greater Dublin Area and along the East Coast, the NSS recommends the development of an Atlantic Gateways corridor, linking the gateway cities of Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford, to create an inter-connected network of co-operating and complementary cities.  The Atlantic Gateways Initiative report was published in September 2006 and its findings are being implemented.The alignment of the recently published National Development Plan with the principles and objectives of the NSS, places the NSS at the heart of future investment decisions by Government Departments and Agencies.  Furthermore, linking the NSS with other Government policies, such as Transport 21, enables future residential and commercial developments to be concentrated as close as possible to existing and forthcoming public transport systems.My Department is also undertaking a review of the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Residential Density to take account of changing population and settlement patterns and the extensive experience built up since the introduction of the 1999 guidelines in the design, assessment and development of higher density proposals.I have noted that many of the policies and measures outlined by the Urban Forum in their recent paper, such as NSS alignment of NDP expenditure, implementation of the Regional Planning Guidelines and the Atlantic Gateways Initiative, are already being addressed by my Department.  I am confident that the continuing implementation of these policies outlined above will have a positive influence on bringing about more compact urban design and sustainable development within the consolidated area of the capital into the future.

Local authorities are also required to ensure that social inclusion is properly addressed in their Corporate Plans and supporting annual Business Plans.Through the local government reform programme, local authorities have expanded their social inclusion and community development role, particularly through the establishment of Community and Enterprise Sections and their lead role on the County and City Development Boards (CDBs) and the Boards' supporting Social Inclusion Measures Working Groups.  The national to local linkage is a key focus for the CDBs, which also comprises the State Agencies, local development bodies and social partners operating locally, and whose main function is to co-ordinate the delivery of services at local level.My Department also works with a range of organisations to enhance and support local government's capacity in tackling poverty and promoting social inclusion, including with the Combat Poverty Agency.  In this context, my Department chairs a national Social Inclusion Steering Group comprising representatives from the Agency, the Office for Social Inclusion, Local Government Management Services Board, County/City Managers Association, Institute of Public Administration and the Department of Community, Rural & Gaeltacht Affairs.  This group supports and will continue to support the development of a strong anti-poverty focus within local government, including in relation to local social inclusion strategies referred to in the report.  In addition, I note that some pilot work, within local government, on poverty impact assessment is being undertaken by the Agency, in conjunction with the Office for Social Inclusion, and that this work is being overseen by the Steering Group.Local authorities are giving effect to national policies and programmes at local level through the implementation of a range of initiatives.  For example:Local authorities participate in delivering the National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPs) and the new National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAP Incl.);Pilot Social Inclusion Units were established in seven local authorities in 2002 with funding from my Department.  These units have now been placed on a permanent footing and the programme, with the support of my Department, will be extended to half of all county/city councils by the end of 2008 in line with a commitment in Towards 2016;The Local Government Anti-Poverty Learning Network, representative of elected members and officials, was established in 2000 by my Department in conjunction with Combat Poverty Agency and Office of Social Inclusion, to provide a forum for sharing information and exchanging different local experiences and best practice on anti-poverty measures;Local authorities support the national RAPID (Revitalising Areas by Planning Investment and Development) Programme, which is targeted at the most disadvantaged areas in the country and under which such areas are prioritised for investment to tackle social exclusion.  The cost to local authorities of employing the local co-ordinators in RAPID areas is met directly by my Department (€2.8m per annum);Community & Voluntary Fora, established in each city and county in 2000 with funding of over €1.3m per annum from my Department, are also supported by local authorities.  The Fora are involved in promoting social inclusion and in facilitating community representation on public sector structures.

The protocol provides for a review of the impact of the agreed measures in July.  Local authorities around the country have been asked to monitor and report on the level of compliance with the protocol, and its impact on litter levels, prior to this review.  Anecdotal evidence gathered over the Christmas and New Year period suggests that software changes made to ATM machines have helped significantly to reduce litter arising from ATM advice slips over this busy period.Retail receipts account for only some 0.69% of litter composition countrywide, and it is not proposed to prioritise agreement with the retail sector in this regard.  Priority will be given this year to finalising agreement with the fast-food sector to tackle the problem of litter arising from take-away packaging.

The primary purpose of the proposed legislation is to provide for a "use it or lose it" scheme which could be deployed by planning authorities on a selective basis to accelerate the development of appropriate land that is already zoned for housing.The General Scheme of the Bill provides for—powers for planning authorities to enter into a binding agreement with, or  impose requirements on, the owners of designated land in order to bring such land into housing development;an amended compensation mechanism whereby designated land, if not developed in agreement with, or in accordance with requirements imposed by, the relevant planning authority, could be compulsorily acquired at below market value; andas a possible alternative to compulsory acquisition, provision for the imposition by planning authorities of an annual development incentive levy on designated land.The General Scheme also provides for mandatory registration of, and the imposition of a levy on, land purchase options.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	343	The Government has provided some €90.2 million, through my Department towards the local authority public library service over the years 1997 to 2006.On foot of this expenditure, supplemented by local authorities from their own resources, 57 new library buildings were opened by the end of 2006.  In addition, the investment has also contributed to the provision and development of ICT including:automation of the public library service,cataloguing,1,400 public access Internet PCs,optical scanning facilities,colour printers to allow printing of OSI maps.The development and population of the Ask About Ireland website and the digitisation of library authorities' local studies material has also been supported.The library service was the subject of a major review in 1997/1998, which resulted in the publication of Branching Out: A New Public Library Service in 1998.  This report put forward a series of recommendations designed to bring the public library service into the 21st century.  One of the key recommendations in the report was that an eight-year capital programme be undertaken and that recommendation, along with the others in the report, was approved by Government.A full review of Branching Out, in the light of Ireland's current economic and social climate, is currently nearing completion.  On the basis of this review, I will shortly be publishing an updated policy and vision for the public library service over the next 6 years.

Following a public consultation on this review, I am preparing a revised National Climate Change Strategy which will take account, inter alia, of commitments in Budget 2007, the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and actions for the energy sector which will be announced shortly in a white paper to be published by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	346	My Department is currently participating in, and will continue to contribute proactively to, discussions at EU level on a new Waste Framework Directive, which will include provisions in relation to waste prevention across all waste streams.  It is likely that legislation will be required to transpose the new waste framework directive into Irish law once agreement has been reached by Member States and it has come into effect.The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Waste Report 2005, which was published in January 2007, reported that 925,221 tonnes of packaging waste was generated in that year, up from 850,911 tonnes in 2004 and from 819,863 tonnes in 2003.  While the evidence is that the trend over the period 2003-2005 in the production of packaging waste was upwards, there has also been a rapid increase in the population of this country, coupled with unprecedented economic growth and a significant rise in single person household occupancy.  All of these are contributory factors towards the recent growth in packaging waste arisings.There are positive trends, however: Ireland has enjoyed considerable success in recent years in meeting targets for the recovery and recycling of this significant waste stream.  Data from the EPA shows that the 25% recovery target for 2001 set under Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste was achieved and also that, with 59.9% recycling of packaging waste in 2005, Ireland has not only exceeded the 2005 recovery target of 50% set under the Directive but reached the 60% target required by end 2011, a full six years ahead of schedule.It is important to appreciate that Ireland's recycling rate for packaging waste now compares favourably with many EU countries who have long been regarded as leaders in environmental protection. As the following table shows Ireland is in sixth place amongst EU Member States in 2004, finishing higher than countries like Sweden, France, Denmark and Finland.  It must also be borne in mind that the countries which have higher recovery rates than Ireland have, in general, achieved this through thermal treatment with energy recovery, an option not yet available in Ireland.Despite these positive trends, I acknowledge that we must further reduce our reliance on landfill.  I am pleased therefore that the National Strategy Group on Packaging Waste Recycling, which comprises key public / private stakeholders such as Repak, IBEC, producers, waste collectors, reprocessors, local authorities the EPA and my Department, is currently developing a five-year strategy to achieve new higher targets for recovering and recycling packaging waste.  I have made it clear that prevention and minimisation measures must be at the heart of that strategy.On foot of recommendations from the Packaging Waste Strategy Group, I have recently forwarded new draft packaging regulations to the EU Commission which aim to bring greater clarity, transparency and accessibility to the packaging waste regulatory regime.  The draft regulations also introduce a range of integrated measures aimed at optimising the recovery and recycling of packaging waste in Ireland.  In the light of the proposed changes to the existing regulatory regime and the success achieved to date in meeting and exceeding targets for the recovering and recycling packaging waste, I am confident that with the continued support of stakeholders, particularly householders, that these draft Regulations will allow Ireland to maintain and improve its position among the high performing countries in Europe.CountryRecycling%1Belgium76.42Germany69.63Austria66.24Luxembourg61.05Netherlands58.56Ireland56.47Czech Republic55.78Italy53.39Denmark53.210France50.711Sweden49.812United Kingdom49.713Spain47.414Latvia45.615Hungary43.316Portugal41.017Finland39.918Slovakia37.619Greece36.720Slovenia34.321Estonia33.522Lithuania32.723Poland28.324Cyprus22.025Malta0.0

The NDP envelope provides for an investment programme of some €21 billion, including the provision of €3 billion for SWA Rent Supplement.As agreed in Towards 2016, some 27,000 new social homes will be commenced or acquired and 17,000 new affordable units will be delivered in the initial 2007-2009 period. The resources being made available under the NDP will allow for similar levels of activity post 2009 and in total, it is estimated that the needs of some 140,000 households will be met over the full period of the Plan. The actual delivery will be determined as part of the mid-term review of the NDP in accordance with the commitment in Towards 2016 to review progress taking account of market developments and capacity.The total Exchequer provision for housing in 2007 is €1.495 billion. In addition, more than €700m in non-Exchequer finance will be available to local authorities primarily in the form of HFA loan finance for on lending to purchasers under the various affordable housing schemes. The Department of Social and Family Affairs provision for SWA Rent Supplement in 2007 is €405m and it is estimated that mortgage interest relief in 2007 will cost some €480m.Full details of the 2007 Exchequer and non-Exchequer investment programme for housing are set out in the Revised Estimates for the Public Services 2007 and the Public Capital Programme 2007 which were published on 22 February 2007.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	350	Earlier this month, I published a new housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, the central objective of which is the creation of sustainable communities — places where people want to live and work, now and in the future.  A key element of the sustainable communities agenda is the achievement of integrated housing developments meeting the needs of people from a variety of social backgrounds.A broad programme of actions is being implemented to support the realisation of that sustainable communities vision.  Among the key elements involved is the effective implementation of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006.Under Part V, each planning authority is required to prepare a housing strategy to ensure that the authority's Development Plan, into which the strategy is incorporated, provides for the housing requirements of the existing and future population of the area.  Among the factors which planning authorities are statutorily obliged to take into account when preparing housing strategies are the need to ensure that housing is available for persons with different levels of income and the need to counteract undue social segregation in housing.In the context of finalising individual agreements with developers under Part V, each planning authority must give careful consideration to its housing strategy.  In particular, where the agreement would provide for Part V to be satisfied by means other than the provision of land on-site, the planning authority must consider a range of factors, including whether the agreement will contribute effectively and efficiently to the achievement of the objectives of the housing strategy, and whether the agreement would constitute the best use of the resources available to the authority to ensure an adequate supply of housing.On the basis of the information available, I am satisfied that, in overall terms, Part V is being implemented in a manner which delivers effectively on social integration objectives.

However, it was agreed under Housing Policy Framework — Building Sustainable Communities that consideration would be given, in consultation with the voluntary and co-operative sector, to pilot a tenant purchase scheme for some new  voluntary homes under the scheme.The modalities of such a scheme have been the subject of ongoing discussion between my Department and representatives of the voluntary and co-operative sector including the Irish Council for Social Housing and the National Association of Building Co-operatives. Submissions received from a number of these organisations with regard to a pilot tenant purchase scheme have been examined in my Department.  A number of issues have been identified by the voluntary and co-operative sector which require further examination and consultation. The introduction of such a scheme including its timing and possible location, will be determined in the coming months.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I propose to take Questions Nos. 121, 144 and 201 together.Recent annual reports by the Environmental Protection Agency on the quality of drinking water in Ireland indicate a sustained increase in the overall rate of compliance with all prescribed standards, from 96.1% in 2003 to 96.4% in 2004, and up to 96.7% in its most recently published report for 2005.  Notwithstanding high overall compliance rates, the reports nevertheless, have drawn attention to water quality problems in certain private group water schemes in particular, and to the shortfall in the levels of monitoring by local authorities of water supplies, particularly in these group schemes.Statutory controls are being strengthened to underpin comprehensive supervision and monitoring regimes for both local authority and group water scheme supplies. The Water Services Bill 2003, which is currently awaiting Dail Report Stage, provides for the introduction of a licensing system for group water scheme supplies, under local authority supervision. The Bill also provides for the amendment of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 to provide for supervision of local authority water supplies by the Agency.  In each case, the relevant supervisory authority will have new powers of direct intervention, if required, to ensure that measures are taken to achieve compliance with prescribed water quality standards.As an interim measure, pending the introduction and implementation of the new arrangements provided for under the Water Services Bill, I propose to make amending Regulations to strengthen the existing Drinking Water Regulations. These will provide for supervision by the Agency of local authorities' functions in relation to monitoring and management of drinking water generally.I envisage that these provisions will strengthen considerably the level of monitoring and enforcement in relation to drinking water supplies, and will ensure adequacy and consistency in monitoring performance in drinking water supplies throughout the State.The Government continues to invest very considerable resources in water services infrastructure, with some €4.7 billion provided under the new National Development Plan (2007 to 2013), in addition to the unprecedented investment of €3.7 billion in infrastructure already put in place under the previous Plan. Significant increases in water treatment capacity and improvements in distribution systems will be achieved as a result.  Water supply schemes completed in the period 1997 to 2006 have already produced additional drinking water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of some 1.2 million.Substantially increased sums have been invested in resolving group scheme difficulties in meeting drinking water standards.  Some €130 million was invested in the Rural Water Programme in 2006 — twice what was spent in 2002, and three times more than the corresponding expenditure in 2000.A comprehensive overhaul of sewage collection and treatment infrastructure has also been undertaken nationally to tackle pollution of surface and ground water from which water supplies are abstracted, and the capacity of Ireland's wastewater treatment infrastructure was increased by a population equivalent of 3.1m under the last National Development Plan.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	354	I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 171 together.The Government decision to proceed with the movement of the electronic voting equipment to centralised premises was made taking into account a range of factors, including costs of current and centralised arrangements and the likely benefits to be realised.  In this regard, the Commission on Electronic Voting in its Second Report concluded that, as the current arrangements under which voting equipment is stored at 25 locations are likely to give rise to continuing variations in the implementation of security and related control measures, together with replication of similar costs of implementation of these measures which are not insignificant across individual centres, enhanced and more uniform security and greater economy of security costs could be achieved through the rationalisation of storage on a regional or centralised basis.The Commission also concluded in its Second Report that it can recommend the voting and counting equipment for use at elections in Ireland, subject to further work it has recommended. The Commission made it clear that many of its recommendations involve only relatively minor modifications or additions to the system.In response to the report, the Government has established a Cabinet Committee on Electronic Voting, which I chair, to consider the report in detail; report to the Government on the full implications of the Commission recommendations; consider the composition of a peer review group  — drawn from international electoral reform bodies and the IT industry — to supervise any software redesign work; report to the Government on confidence building measures; and identify any other improvements that might be built into the system.The Cabinet Committee, which also includes the Tánaiste and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, met on 31 July 2006 and 13 February 2007.  The Committee will report to Government when its work is completed.

As part of the process of preparing the new Strategy, a National Homeless Consultative Committee is being established under the aegis of the Housing Forum which was set up under the social partnership process.The Consultative Committee, including representatives from the providers of local homeless services, will provide input into the development of the revised Homeless Strategy and ongoing Government policy on addressing homelessness. Nominations for membership of the Committee have been sought and depending on the availability of the members, I anticipate that the first meeting of the Committee will be held next month. While the initial task of the Committee will be to provide input into the finalisation of the revised homeless strategy which will be published later this year, it is expected that the Committee will continue to meet periodically thereafter, in order to provide an ongoing input into the development and monitoring of Government policy on homelessness.

A range of guidance documents to support the building of sustainable communities will issue to local authorities. These will include guidance building on the existing suite of best practice guidance on urban planning and reinforcing the need to make connections with transport, schools and other social infrastructure.  Resources are being provided under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 to support transport infrastructure, servicing of land and social infrastructure.Sustainable communities provide a means for newcomers to integrate and participate fully in society. A focus on building sustainable communities should ensure better social integration, which will enhance the vibrancy of communities for all. To inform evolving policy in this area my Department is supporting research under the auspices of the National Consultative Council on Racism and Inter-Culturalism to consider issues arising for neighbourhood planning, housing provision and estate management policy from increased ethnic and cultural diversity.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	358	Three area-based tax incentive renewal schemes were introduced since 1997. These were the 1999 Urban Renewal Scheme, the 2000 Town Renewal Scheme and the 2001 Living Over the Shop (LOTS) scheme.The three schemes were subject to a detailed review in 2005, carried out by Goodbody Economic Consultants on behalf of the Department of Finance.  The relevant report was published in February 2006 and is accessible on www.finance.gov.ie.The review found that by the end of 2004, the Urban Renewal Scheme had delivered 4,257 residential units, while the Town Renewal Scheme had delivered 971 residential units.  It projected the delivery of, respectively, 15,538 units and 2,905 units under these two schemes by end-June 2006, the date at which the schemes were then scheduled to end.  At the end of 2004, the LOTS scheme had resulted in the development of 155 residential units, with 440 completions projected by June 2006.Tax forgone to June 2006 under each scheme was estimated as follows—Urban Renewal Scheme €1,423 millionTown Renewal Scheme €148 millionLOTS Scheme €36 millionMy Department is currently collecting and compiling data from local authorities on progress under the three schemes in the period up to 31 December 2006.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 191 together.The Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992 place statutory responsibility for dog control and licensing services on local authorities.  The implementation of the Acts is vested in local authorities who have power to appoint dog wardens, to provide shelters for stray and other dogs, to impose on-the-spot fines for a number of offences and to take prosecutions.  Local authorities may also may bye-laws in relation to the control of dogs within their functional areas.The Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 made under the above Acts, place controls on ten breeds of dogs including the American Pit Bull Terrier, and the English and Staffordshire Bull Terrier breeds.  The controls, which must be observed when the dog is in a public place, require that these dogs, or types and crosses thereof, must be kept on a short lead by a person over 16 years of age who is capable of controlling them and that they are securely muzzled.  Furthermore, the Control of Dogs Act 1986 gives specific powers to the courts to order that a dog, which the court considers dangerous, must be kept under proper control or be destroyed.I consider that these arrangements provide a workable regulatory framework for enforcement by local authorities and I do not propose to ban the owning of any particular dog breed at this stage. However, I propose to review existing control measures to consider, for example, if the micro-chipping of dogs could bring benefits to dog control.

The Scheme, which came into effect on 15 August 2005, sets out how the Department will give effect over a three-year period to the provisions of the Official Languages Act, taking into account what is reasonably practicable within the timescale.Progress is measured on an annual basis in relation to the implementation of the Scheme and this is reported on in the Department's Annual Report.  To date progress has included, for example, the provision of a wide range of information resources — core policy documents, leaflets, advertisements and interactive services — in Irish, and the availability of language supports, including Irish language training, for staff.Following the first year of implementation of the Scheme, a report was prepared for An Coimisinéir Teanga and my Department also met with the Coimisinéir's office.  In the letter's subsequent assessment, the good progress made in relation to many aspects of the Scheme was noted.  Recommendations and advice were also provided on its ongoing implementation.Substantial costs are incurred by my Department in the translation, advertising, and publishing of documents bilingually, in advertising in the Irish language media and in providing Irish language training for staff.  However, the total amount of money spent on this is not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.  A commitment is given in the Department's Language Scheme, however, that the Department will consider during 2007 the need to provide an in-house translation service having regard to the demand for services through Irish.  In order to determine the need for such a service, information will be compiled as part of the Department's annual progress report on implementation of the Scheme on costs associated with translation.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	361	Over the years, the Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), has committed significant resources to assessing the incidence of radon throughout the country and highlighting public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high concentrations.The RPII continues to actively promote public awareness of radon and to encourage householders and employers to have their homes and workplaces tested for radon and to undertake radon remediation works where necessary. In this regard, the RPII's activities include:Producing and publishing information brochures and documents in relation to radon;Publishing reports on radon;Issuing press releases and giving radio and TV interviews;Undertaking a series of nationwide public information seminars, or roadshows, on the dangers of radon which are targeted at selected high radon areas;Setting up information stands at public events, for example, the National Ploughing Championship;Organising the National Radon Forum, of which the fifth of these took place in Galway in November 2006;Producing a radio advertisement for use on local radio in High Radon Areas.In addition, the RPII publishes detailed information about radon on its website. It should be noted that the number of website hits for the RPII has grown over the last number of years as both the public and employers increasingly use websites to garner more information on matters such as radon.The actual cost to the RPII of these activities is not separately quantified in their accounts. However, the RPII would estimate expenditure on these activities in 2006 at approximately €40,000.I understand recent research commissioned by the RPII has found that 75% of the general population are aware of radon. In addition, over the past two years, there has been a significant increase in the number of radon measurements undertaken by householders compared with previous years.In addition to activities undertaken by the RPII, my Department has also undertaken a number of initiatives to promote further awareness of radon among the general public and for tackling the radon problem. My Department has published a booklet entitled Radon in Existing Buildings — Corrective Options advising designers, builders and home owners on remediation options for reducing radon in existing houses to, or below, the national reference level of 200 Bq/m3. In addition, up-graded building regulations, introduced in June 1997 by my Department, require all new houses commencing construction on or after 1 July 1998 to incorporate radon protection measures. My Department published an updated edition of its Technical Guidance Document C on Part C of the Building Regulations (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing construction on or after 1 April 2005. This new guidance document is aimed at ensuring that the 1997 radon protection measures are carried out more effectively.Considerable resources are therefore being expended by Government and the RPII on promoting public awareness of radon and to addressing the radon problem. Both the RPII and my Department will continue to use all appropriate opportunities to raise public awareness on this issue.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	362	The provision and improvement of non-national roads is a matter for local authorities to be funded from their own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department.There have been significant increases in recent years in the level of State funding provided to local authorities for the provision, improvement and maintenance of non-national roads.  State funding in 2007 for non-national roads, at over €607.5 million, is at its highest ever level, and represents a very substantial increase of 9% on last year's record allocation, or an increase of almost €50 million.As regards my Department's pavement restoration programme, the results of a Pavement Condition Study on non-national roads, which was carried out by consultants and completed in 2005, show that there has been a very large growth in traffic volumes, including numbers of heavy goods vehicles, on our roads over the last 10 years and that the combination of growth in traffic volumes and damaging power has dramatically increased the structural loading on the non-national roads network. The study concluded that the economic boom, since the first study was carried out in 1996, has fundamentally changed the loading regime on the non-national roads network, with much higher and more frequent loading by heavier vehicles now being the norm.The rate of occurrence of potholes and road disintegration has effectively halved since 1996 as a result of the €1.5 billion investment in Restoration Improvement and Maintenance works over the 1997 to 2004 period. However, the instance of other defects, such as rutting and edge cracking, has increased since 1996 as a result of growth in traffic on the network — particularly that of heavier and wider commercial vehicles.On foot of the findings of the study, I have increased the grants available to County Councils for Restoration Improvement works to almost €225 million in 2007, which is an increase of almost €20 million, or 9.6%, on the 2006 allocation. This very substantial increase means that significant progress can be made in allocating funds to address the deficiencies identified by the Pavement Condition Study. I have also allocated grants totalling €81 million for Restoration Maintenance works this year. This represents an increase of €6 million, or 8%, on the 2006 allocation.In addition to the pavement restoration programme, my Department also provides grants to local authorities for works on non-national roads under a number of other grant categories. In determining the annual non-national road grant allocations, the overall objective is to resource each local authority appropriately in relation to their ongoing and special needs.  The process is guided by a range of criteria, including road pavement conditions, length of road network, population and eligibility in relation to specific projects such as Specific Improvements Schemes.Details of total non-national road grants paid by my Department for each of the years 1994 to 2006 and the initial allocation for 2007 are set out in the following table:Grant Payment€1994139,036,3191995159,920,9721996186,476,2741997225,819,1081998261,112,5761999307,510,3972000341,229,4072001400,917,7902002435,457,0002003436,592,0002004480,200,0002005501,270,0002006557,730,0002007 (allocation)607,525,000
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Irish waste management policy is based on the internationally recognised integrated approach which places the main emphasis on waste prevention, reuse and recycling.  The local authorities have the statutory responsibility for waste management planning, generally on a regional basis. Control to these plans is the need to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to manage our waste properly and in accordance with international best practice.This approach is now delivering demonstrable and successful results. In 1998 Ireland had a recycling rate of just 9% but this had risen to 35% by 2005, reaching a national target set for 2013. Our recycling of packaging waste over the same period rose from 15% to 60%, comfortably exceeding the 50% EU target set for 2005 and reaching the EU 2011 target.The Government is determined to build on these achievements to create a recycling society supported by appropriate infrastructure to deal with waste that cannot be prevented or recycled.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	364	The amount collected in development contributions has increased significantly in recent years, from €122m in 2001 to €519m in 2005 (based on information supplied for Annual Planning Statistics). This reflects to the large increase in construction activity (which in turn led to increased demands for infrastructure), as well as the impact of the now, schemes of development levies finalised by planning authorities in 2004.The €519 million collected in development contributions for 2005 represents approximately 10.6% of the total local authority capital income for that year which was some €4.9 billion.Prior to the enactment of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities could require payment of a development contribution, as a condition of a planning permission, on a discretionary basis.  From 2004, in order to introduce transparency and openness to the system, each planning authority was required to adopt a development contribution scheme stating the basis for determining the contributions to be paid in respect of public infrastructure and facilities in its area and indicating the contribution to be paid for different types of infrastructure.Development contribution schemes are adopted by the elected members of planning authorities after a public consultation process.  I consider that the current system, endorsed by the Oireachtas, which helps to ensure that contributions are levied appropriately across all sectors of development, is fair and transparent.The money raised locally by development contributions is one of the fundamental sources of financing for the infrastructure that underpins and facilitates all new development.   The legislation requires local authorities to base the contributions on the actual estimated cost of providing the infrastructure in question. As that cost will differ among authorities, depending on local need for infrastructure investment and rates of development, it is inevitable that there will be variation in development contribution rates.However, my Department advised planning authorities, in circular letter PD 4/2003, that they should be mindful of the policies adopted by other authorities in their immediate area so as to avoid a major divergence in the level of contributions charged.  Planning authorities were also advised in that Circular that while it is expected that developers should make an appropriate contribution towards the costs of public infrastructure and facilities, care should be taken to avoid development contributions that are excessively high.  My Department also has the opportunity to comment on draft schemes before they are adopted.Circular letter PD 4/2003 also stated that it would be advisable to review the scheme at 2 to 3 year intervals at least, where the scheme is adopted for a longer period.My Department has set up an interdepartmental committee to examine issues raised by interested parties in relation to the operation of the contribution schemes. The committee is due to complete its work shortly and it is expected that this will provide the basis for further guidance to be issued to planning authorities.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I propose to take Questions Nos. 141, 531 and 541 together.In 1998 the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic agreed to a strategy to reduce discharges of radioactivity.  The so-called Sintra Strategy requires all Contracting Parties to the Convention to prevent pollution of the maritime area from ionizing radiation through progressive and substantial reductions of discharges, emissions and losses of radioactive substances with the ultimate aim of achieving concentrations in the environment that are near background levels for naturally occurring radioactive substances and close to zero for artificial radioactive substances.  A date of 2020 was set for the achievement of these targets. Ireland and the UK are among the Contracting Parties to the Convention.In 2006 the Radioactive Substances Committee (RSC) of OSPAR undertook an evaluation of the extent to which the reductions in radioactive discharges required under the Sintra Strategy were being achieved.  This evaluation concluded that, for the nuclear sector as a whole, there was no clear evidence that discharges were either increasing or decreasing and that more data was required before firm conclusions could be drawn.In the specific case of discharges of radioactivity to the Irish Sea, the principal source is the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield. These discharges, which are authorised by the UK's Environment Agency, peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s.  Subsequently, as a result of the introduction of modern abatement technologies, discharges were significantly reduced.  Strong pressure by the Irish and Norwegian Governments resulted in further modifications to reduce the discharge of technetium-99 to the Irish Sea from 2004 onwards.  The most recent data from the north east coastline for technetium-99 in seawater shows a further reduction following the implementation of these technologies at Sellafield.The RSC evaluation also considered the extent to which discharges from the Sellafield reprocessing facility had been reduced since 1998.  The evaluation showed that in the period up to 2005 the pattern is uneven. While the discharges of some radionuclides have decreased over these years, the discharges of plutonium have shown a statistically significant increase.The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland implements a comprehensive programme of monitoring of radioactivity in the Irish marine environment so as to assess the level of radiation exposure to the Irish population resulting from discharges to the marine environment.  The monitoring programme involves the routine sampling and testing for radioactivity of fish, shellfish, seawater, seaweed and marine sediments.  Fish and shellfish are sampled from commercial landings at east coast ports and major ports from the south and west coasts.  Seawater and marine sediments are routinely collected from coastal locations and from the western Irish Sea with particular emphasis being placed on sampling at the north east ports of Carlingford, Clogherhead and Howth due to the relative proximity to Sellafield.The highest annual mean concentration of Tc-99 in fish from northeast ports was 0.5 Bq/kg (1998).  In 2005 the equivalent figure was 0.1 Bq/kg fresh. The highest concentration of Tc-99 in seaweed from Balbriggan was 7,985 Bq/kg dry (November, 1997).  The mean concentration for 2003 was 2,012 Bq/kg dry.Since the inception of this monitoring programme in the early nineteen eighties, the RPII annually assess the radiation doses to notional typical and heavy fish consumers.  These assessments have shown that year on year the exposure to the Irish population has fallen steadily until about 2000 and has remained relatively constant since then and the current levels of anthropogenic radioactivity in the Irish environment do not pose a significant risk to human health.The Sellafield site holds large volumes of all types of radioactive waste in many forms including very significant volumes of liquid High Level Waste. The UK Regulator, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) recognises that the storage of this volume of liquid high level waste does not represent best practice and imposed a condition on the operator that will reduce this to a small buffer stock by 2015. Progress is being made in the reduction of the liquid volumes in compliance with the schedule imposed by the Regulator but there remains a large liquid volume of HLW awaiting treatment. With very large volumes of radioactive waste held on site, the need for safety, waste reduction and environmentally acceptable decommissioning programmes is paramount. While there have been no recent significant accidents or incidents that have resulted in the escape of radioactive contamination to the environment, the long standing poor safety record highlighted by the THORP incident in 2005, the high volumes of treated and untreated waste on site, the continuing generation of additional waste through ongoing reprocessing operations and the consequent radioactive discharges to the marine environment underscore the reasons the Government continues to regard the existence of Sellafield as an unacceptable risk to Ireland.

The schemes included in the Programme are derived mainly from regular assessments of needs undertaken by local authorities, at my Department's request, as an input to the overall strategy for meeting wastewater collection and treatment requirements.  The Programme also includes schemes that will provide new or improved infrastructure to resolve all incidences of point source pollution from municipal wastewater discharges identified in the Environmental Protection Agency's report "Water Quality in Ireland 2001 — 2003", published in 2005.Subsequently, local authorities were requested by my Department in 2006 to carry out updated assessments of needs to inform future investment priorities under the Water Services Investment Programme.  In carrying out the assessments, authorities were asked to take particular account of:national and EU environmental and public health requirements and standards, including the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive and the Urban Wastewater Treatment Regulations, 2001,relevant reports produced by the Environmental Protection Agency, including Water Quality in Ireland 2001 — 2003 and Urban Wastewater Discharges in Ireland: A Report for the years 2002/2003reports and studies such as the National Urban Waste Water Study,  County Sludge Management Plans and any other relevant studies/reports commissioned locally,the provisions of their Development Plans or any draft Development Plans and any strategic regional planning guidelines or local area plans,National Spatial Strategy objectives,the adequacy of existing collection networks and, in the case of anticipated development, the adequacy of the capacity of existing treatment plants,the need for continued support for social and economic activity and development,the need to address infrastructural deficits in small rural towns, andRiver Basin District Management Projects and Characterisation Reports completed in 2005 under the Water Framework Directive.The priorities adopted by the elected members of the various local authorities in their 2006 needs assessments will inform project selection under the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme.

This material also issued to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for transmission to the Prison Service who are responsible for practical implementation of the new arrangements within the prisons, including the designation of relevant officials to perform specified functions in the registration and voting processes. In addition, to ensure that the new arrangements were publicised as widely as possible, my Department placed prominent advertisements in the main national newspapers on four dates in advance of the public notice period: on Saturday and Sunday 13 and 14 January and on Wednesday and Thursday 17 and 18 January.The latest date for receipt of applications for inclusion on the 2007/2008 prisoners postal voters list was 14 February 2007.The compilation of the register of electors is the responsibility of the registration authorities. Preliminary figures from the registration authorities indicate that some 400 prisoners applied by the closing date of 14 February for inclusion on the 2007/2008 postal voters list. The applications are currently being examined by the registration authorities who will notify prisoners of decisions on applications when they have been fully considered.  Details of the numbers of prisoners on the 2007/8 postal voters list will be available when this process is finalised.A prisoner from whom an application was not received by 14 February may apply for inclusion on the supplement to the 2007/2008 postal voters list.

There will also be direct investment of some €25 billion under the following NDP sub-programmes which will directly benefit environmental sustainability:Public Transport Sub-Programme €13 billion;Water Services Sub-Programme €4.7 billion;Waste Management Sub-Programme €753 million;Climate Change Sub-Programme €270 million;Sustainable Energy Sub-Programme €276m (which includes development of wind energy capacity and alternative energy sources such as bio-mass and bio-fuels, ocean energy and solar and geothermal technologies);Agriculture and Food Sub-Programme €6 billion (which includes afforestation, agri-environment, compensatory allowance and farm waste management measures);Natural Heritage Sub-Programme €167 million (which will fund purchase of Natura 2000 sites and acquisition of habitat-rich sites and designated raised bogs);Built Heritage Sub-Programme €373 million;Coastal Protection Sub-Programme €23 million; andEnvironmental Research €93 million.The NDP recognises that the public realm is a key element of the overall urban fabric and an important contributor to visual amenity, safety and a sense of place. The Community Infrastructure Sub-Programme provides for investment of some €895m under the NDP, including investment in urban and village renewal. Funding for urban renewal initiatives will be targeted at projects encompassing and demonstrating good urban design, innovation, appropriate scale and cost effectiveness.€373m will be invested in a range of measures to support architectural and archaeological heritage protection under the NDP's Built Heritage Sub-Programme which will include:work on major heritage properties undertaken by the OPW on behalf of my Department;the Heritage Council in respect of the capital grants scheme operated by the Council for heritage buildings at risk;the scheme of grants administered by the local authorities for works to properties on their Records of Protected Structures;the Irish Heritage Trust.The Sub-Programme will also fund expenditure by my Department on the continuing roll out of the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage and the scheme of grants administered directly by the Department for the restoration and conservation of buildings of significant architectural heritage merit which are in public ownership or open to the public generally.

However, it was subsequently decided to implement this increase in a single step and draft Part L Regulations and draft Technical Guidance Document L were issued in 2001 for public consultation. Following the completion of the consultation process amending Part L Regulations were made in 2002 for new dwellings commencing on or after I January 2003. It is estimated that the enhanced standards will reduce CO2 emissions by at least 250,000 tonnes per annum by the end of 2012, in line with the estimate contained in the NCCS.Part L was again amended in 2005 to require higher thermal performance and insulation standards for new non-domestic buildings which commenced on or after July 2006. It is estimated that these enhanced standards will result in a further reduction in CO2 emissions of 45,000 tonnes per annum by the end of 2012.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	374	Since the enactment of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, each local authority has adopted two successive Traveller Accommodation Programmes. In the course of the first programmes, 2000 to 2004, some 1,371 additional Traveller families were provided with permanent, secure accommodation. Over the same period there was a 50% reduction in the number of families living on unauthorised sites, down from 1207 families at the start of the programmes to 601 families at their completion.One of the significant developments during the period of both Traveller Accommodation Programmes has been the establishment of structures and mechanisms at both national and local level to ensure that all services provided to Travellers by statutory agencies, including accommodation, are delivered in a more effective and co-ordinated way. At national level the High Level Group on Traveller Issues, chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, works closely with my Department to ensure effective co-ordination, at local level, of the provision of all services to Travellers. The local authorities, through the County Development Boards, are actively engaged in putting the necessary structures in place to ensure effective liaison and co-ordination of services provision to Travellers, using an inter-agency approach.My Department, in partnership with the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, will continue to facilitate the development of strategies at national level to further improve the accommodation position of Travellers and to accelerate its provision. A particular priority for the new Committee, which takes up office on 5 March next, will be to consider how families on unauthorised sites can be provided with permanent accommodation as soon as possible and how Travellers can develop self-supporting approaches to meeting their own needs.

While the relevant EPA report shows that the downward trend in greenhouse gas emissions was interrupted in 2005, this was expected and in line with projections published by my Department in 2006.  The report notes that much of the 2005 increase in Ireland's emissions can be attributed to two factors — the full commissioning in 2005 of new peat-powered electricity plants and the increase in private car ownership.In a number of sectors, notably the waste, residential and agriculture sectors, emissions are either stable or are on a decreasing trend. Lower emissions in the waste sector can be attributed to the success of my Department's policies on maximising waste diversion from landfill. Lower emissions in the agriculture sector can be attributed to lower livestock levels and decreased fertiliser use.The stabilisation of greenhouse gas emissions in the residential sector must be put in the context of 81,000 house completions in 2005. I am committed to further strengthening the energy efficiency standards in the Building Regulations and a full review of the scope and structure of the current regulations will underpin the next amendment due in 2008. This will ensure that Ireland's standards are among the biggest in the European Union and that they make the maximum practical contribution to Ireland's Kyoto Protocol commitments.On the basis of policies and measures already agreed, Ireland is now positioned to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 14.6 million tonnes per annum over the 2008-2012 period.  I am preparing a revised National Climate Change Strategy, for publication by April 2007, which will set out the additional measures that will be implemented to close the remaining projected gap for compliance with Ireland's Kyoto Protocol commitments.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	381	Ireland has been very successful in recent years in meeting both national and international targets for recycling across a number of specified waste streams.  Almost 35%, or a remarkable 964,367 tonnes, of our municipal waste (i.e. household and commercial waste) was recycled in 2005 indicating that our national recycling target of 35% for 2013, as set out in the 1998 Changing Our Ways policy statement on waste management, was achieved a full eight years ahead of schedule.While Ireland is required to report to the European Commission in respect of our progress on a wide range of EU Directives, no composite up-to-date information in relation to overall waste recycling is available for Member States across the EU.  Data in relation to the original EU 15 Member States is available for municipal solid waste in respect of the years 1999/2000 — see following table — but as can be seen  Ireland has made rapid progress since this data was compiled.Ireland's recycling rate (60%) for packaging waste compares favourably with many EU countries who have long been regarded as leaders in environmental protection.  As the attached table shows, Ireland is in sixth place amongst EU Member States on the basis of the data available for 2004, finishing higher than countries such as Sweden, France, Denmark and Finland. It must be borne in mind that countries that have higher recovery rates than Ireland have, in general, achieved this through thermal treatment with energy recovery, an option not available in Ireland.Country/Recycling(%)1 Belgium76.42 Germany69.63 Austria66.24 Luxembourg61.05 Netherlands58.56 Ireland56.47 Czech Republic55.78 Italy53.39 Denmark53.210 France50.711 Sweden49.812 United Kingdom49.713 Spain47.414 Latvia45.615 Hungary43.316 Portugal41.017 Finland39.918 Slovakia37.619 Greece36.720 Slovenia34.321 Estonia33.522 Lithuania32.723 Poland28.324 Cyprus22.025 MaltaN/ACountry/Recycling(%)1.

In line with this, my Department, acting on a proposal made to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Housing, Infrastructure and PPPs, requested the Affordable Homes Partnership to initiate a process in late 2006 to source 500 new homes in the Greater Dublin Area, with a view to making these available at discounted prices.Advertisements were published earlier this month inviting applications for the first 416 of these homes.  In general, the homes involved were purchased at prices in the range of €300,000 to €380,000 and are being made available at discounted prices in the range of €200,000 to €280,000.  The discounts are being funded by the Exchequer and will be subject to the normal 20-year clawback arrangements that apply to the sale of affordable homes generally. The numbers and locations of the advertised homes are set out in the following table.This initiative will assist in addressing the difficulties faced by a particular category of eligible applicants in the Greater Dublin Area, where affordability difficulties are most acute.  It is additional to the range of other delivery mechanisms, including the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme, the Part V mechanism and projects on State and local authority lands, through which the needs of a broad range of affordable home purchasers, particularly those on lower incomes, are being addressed.I expect that the remaining 84 homes in the 500 home programme will be advertised shortly.  The bulk of the 500 homes are scheduled to be completed this year, commencing in April.  The possibility of undertaking further purchases under this initiative remains under consideration.DevelopmentNumber of homes

Further funding is proposed for climate change related research under the Science, Technology and Innovation Programme in the current National Development Plan, in line with the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation. I will announce further funding for climate change research when I publish a revised National Climate Change Strategy in April 2007.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	384	Earlier this month, I published a new housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, the central objective of which is the creation of sustainable communities — places where people want to live and work, now and in the future.  A key element of the sustainable communities agenda is the achievement of a better housing mix, particularly in terms of the mix of different types of homes to meet a broad range of housing requirements.At local level, each local authority, through its Housing Action Plan, sets out its broad approach to addressing the range of social and affordable housing needs in its area.  In that context, local authorities employ a range of instruments, of which the mechanism under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006 is just one.In implementing Part V, each planning authority is required to prepare a housing strategy to ensure that the authority's Development Plan, into which the strategy is incorporated, provides for the housing requirements of the existing and future population of the area.  Among the factors which planning authorities are statutorily obliged to take into account when preparing housing strategies is the need to ensure that a mixture of house types and sizes is developed to reasonably match the requirements of different categories of households.The finalisation of individual agreements with developers under Part V is a matter for each individual planning authority, subject to considering a range of factors specified in the relevant legislation.  In particular, if a planning authority proposes to make an agreement which would result in the delivery of completed homes, the factors which it would have to consider include whether the agreement would contribute effectively and efficiently to the achievement of the objectives of its housing strategy, including the provisions in relation to the mix of house types and sizes.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 and 212 together.The total number of licensed cars increased by 7% in 2006 and 5% in 2005. This growth is being driven, inter alia, by increasing population and rising employment and this is contributing to higher transport emissions.On Budget day (6 December, 2006) I announced proposals which will provide an incentive through the motor tax system for the motoring public to drive cleaner cars by using CO2 emission ratings, in addition to the normal engine c.c. value, in the calculation of motor tax. This approach will rebalance tax payments in favour of cars with lower CO2 emission levels, at the expense of cars with high emission levels. The new system will be applied to any new or pre-owned imported vehicle, registered in this country on or after 1 January, 2008 and taxed within the ‘Private Car' motor tax class, which make up about 75% of vehicles registered each year. Cars, which are registered prior to 1 January 2008, will continue to be taxed under current arrangements and CO2 ratings will not apply to these vehicles. SUVs do not constitute a specific category of vehicle for motor tax purposes and are taxed on the basis of engine capacity.The timeframe for introduction of CO2 based motor tax charges for vehicles in the Private Car category is influenced primarily by operational considerations. These include the lead-in time for comprehensive software adjustments to the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) which supports all motor tax application processing including the on-line motor tax service as well as the need to evaluate submissions from interested parties to the public consultation paper which I published on 6 December 2006. The period of consultation will conclude on 1 March 2007.The NVDF does not have CO2 values for all pre 2008 cars, as these data are only comprehensively available on the NVDF since the middle of   2004.

Following consideration of the comments and submissions received, it is intended to finalise the guidelines for publication as soon as possible thereafter.The primary aim of the draft Guidelines is to promote sustainable urban housing by ensuring that the design and layout of new apartments will provide satisfactory accommodation for a variety of household types and sizes — including families with children — over the medium to long term.  The new guidelines will form part of a suite of guidance being prepared by the Department within a wider housing/planning context, which will also include:new draft sustainable residential development guidelines which will incorporate a revision of the 1999 residential density guidelines;a new best practice handbook on urban design and housing layouts which will illustrate, with examples drawn from current practice, how the policies set out in the planning guidelines might be implemented; anda revision of the 1999 Social Housing Design Guidelines.The final guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  This will require planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to have regard to them in the performance of their functions.  However, pending finalisation of the guidelines, planning authorities are being requested to have regard to the recommended standards for new apartment schemes, when preparing or varying development plans and local area plans, particularly when their current plans incorporate older standards.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	391	Local authorities are required to recover from all non-domestic water consumers the full costs incurred in the provision of water services to those consumers.  The application of the polluter pays principle, as required by Article 9.1 of the EU Water Framework Directive, entails the metering of non-domestic consumers so that a volumetric charge can be applied, with the cost of meter installation being borne by the metered consumers.I have met farming representatives on a number of occasions in the past year about their concerns on the issue of water charges. In response to representations on the cost of metering, and following a pilot billing project in one local authority area, I arranged for my Department to issue billing guidance to local authorities in December 2006, including a request that authorities consider the necessity for special discounting arrangements in the case of multiple water meters on fragmented small farm holdings.  Furthermore, in response to the position of farm holdings with fragmented holdings, the guidance recommends that the total metering charge in such instances should not exceed 180% of the cost of the first connection irrespective of the number of meters.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I met with the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, in the Custom House on 16 February. Dr. El Baradei who had met the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs separately earlier that day, was in Dublin at the invitation of the Trinity College Philosophical Society.I took the opportunity to emphasise Ireland's opposition to nuclear as a source of energy. I stated that Ireland's opposition to nuclear is borne out of genuine concerns about safety. A major accident at an installation abroad could have the potential to impact on public health and the environment and could damage Ireland's economy significantly. I referred to Ireland's concerns about Sellafield, in particular, the poor safety practices at the plant borne out by numerous incidents down the years.Dr. El Baradei foresaw an inevitable expansion in nuclear energy capacity over the next 20 years, driven by energy needs and concerns about climate change. He respects Ireland's position and is aware that Ireland works closely with the IAEA on safety matters. Given the likely expansion of nuclear, he considers that there is a need for the IAEA to put even more emphasis on safety aspects also.I referred to the recent ECJ judgment in regard to Ireland's legal action against the UK and stated that, in the light of the judgment, I have stressed to the EU Commission that it should exercise its responsibilities and assume a greater supervisory role in regard to safety of nuclear facilities.Regarding the THORP leak, I informed the Director that I had sought from the UK an international expert peer review of the safety case for re-opening THORP but the UK has not responded positively. Dr. El Baradei was also informed of my recent meeting with Mr. Alastair Darling M.P., Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, where I raised this issue.Dr. El Baradei stated that the IAEA does everything in its power to improve safety standards but it does not have the statutory right to inspect facilities. The IAEA provides a Peer Review service to States if asked to do so by the State and the IAEA tries to encourage use of this service.I conveyed Ireland's concerns about the recent US-India Agreement referring to the fact that Ireland strongly supported the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) regime to which India is not a party. I referred to a meeting I had with the Indian Prime Minister's Special Envoy in Dublin recently in which I had conveyed Ireland's concerns. Dr. El Baradei said he had earlier discussed this Agreement with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Dr. El Baradei considered that the Agreement had a zero impact on the NPT but felt that there are positive aspects on the safety and environmental side.I believe that the meeting and discussion was constructive and that Dr. El Baradei has a clear understanding of Ireland's position on nuclear matters as well as an appreciation of our constructive engagement in the IAEA.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.There are two fuel reprocessing plants at Sellafield. The Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP) reprocesses uranium oxide fuel used in nuclear reactors in UK, Europe and Japan, while the Magnox reprocessing plant reprocesses spent fuel from Magnox reactors primarily in the UK. The current stated position of the UK Government is that based on current contracts the THORP Plant (subject to its early reopening by mid 2007) will complete its reprocessing operations in 2010 while the Magnox plant will complete in 2012. No new contracts are currently foreseen and in the event of the UK Government proposing further contracts, it will consultwidely.I met Secretary of State for the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr. Alistair Darling, in London, on 9 January 2007.  The meeting focused on issues relating to Sellafield and in particular the THORP plant.  While our meeting was cordial there was a very frank exchange of views.I made very clear to the Secretary of State the extent of this Government's concerns regarding Sellafield. I strongly underlined our view that the operations there are uneconomic, environmentally damaging and have a particularly poor track record in safety.  I also emphasised our particular concerns regarding THORP, which has been closed for nearly two years following a serious leak.   I impressed upon the Secretary of State the Irish Government's strong view that the operating life of THORP should not be extended and called upon the UK Government to undertake an international expert peer review of the safety case prior to the reopening of the THORP Plant. The response of the UK Secretary of State to this proposal was, regrettably, less than positive.In the context of the outcome to the UK Energy Review, I also advised the Secretary of State that adverse consequences have arisen for Ireland as a result of nuclear policy decisions and actions taken by the UK in the past and the building of any new nuclear power stations in the UK would be viewed by us in that context. I also sought and received assurances from the Secretary of State that new nuclear build was not proposed for Northern Ireland.I have little doubt that it is the diplomatic and legal initiatives of this Government in regard to Sellafield that have resulted in the greatly increased recognition by the UK Government and its Agencies of the priority accorded to the issue of Sellafield by the Irish Government.  I am confident that my meeting with Secretary of State Darling served to highlight, again, the Government's concerns and to reiterate our ongoing commitment to securing the safe and orderly closure of the Sellafield Plant.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	394	National waste statistics for all waste streams are published by the Environmental Protection Agency with the most recent National Waste Report being in respect of 2005.  As outlined in successive National Waste Reports, the general situation in Ireland is that we rely significantly on foreign based materials recycling infrastructure, which dealt with 83% of recycled waste in 2005. Europe accounts for 86% of all recyclable waste exported from Ireland.While there has been recent progress in the provision of more infrastructure within Ireland to process materials recovered for recycling, for example, in the development of new facilities to process waste electrical and electronic equipment, it should be noted that clean segregated materials are a sought after resource which are freely traded under EU and international law.  This is supported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Decision of C(92)39 Final on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Wastes Destined for Recovery Operations which notes that the recovery of valuable materials and energy from wastes is an integral part of the international economic system and that well established markets exist for, and can contribute to, the collection and processing of such materials within OECD member countries.While international trade in waste is consistent with Government policy insofar as it supports improved performance in recycling, the Government also recognises the value of developing markets for recyclates in Ireland.  To this end, a Market Development Group was established in 2004 and has been working on the development of a National Market Development Programme.  Sub-committees were established by the Market Development Group to deal specifically with market development for both recovered paper waste and for plastics.  It is intended to publish the National Market Development Programme shortly, and its roll-out and effective implementation will be an important priority for my Department.My Department has also been working with the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland with a view to developing all-island market development strategies. Both Departments have co-funded an all-island paper mill study which was published in 2006. The study provides valuable research and information for businesses interested in investing in this field. I hope that the report will help pave the way for the possibility of greater paper recycling through increased efficiency and added market value.

The Island, and the surrounding intertidals flats, are variously designated as a candidate Special Area of Conservation, as a candidate Special Protection Area for birds and as a Statutory Nature Reserve.  The Island therefore forms part of Ireland's contribution of sites to the European network of nature conservation sites — NATURA 2000.   In addition, North Bull Island is also a Wildfowl Sanctuary, a Ramsar Convention site, a Biogenetic Reserve, a Biosphere Reserve and a Special Area Amenity Order site.  The site is used regularly for educational purposes and there is a staffed interpretative centre on the island.  The North Bull Island therefore plays an important role in the conservation of Ireland's biodiversity.

We will be engaging in detailed discussions on the proposal in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform.The Government is fully aware of the importance of effective deterrents for breaches of environmental law and the provisions of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the Waste Management Act 1996 and the Water Services Bill 2003, among other legislation, provide for significant penalties for such breaches.Having regard to the need for penalties for breaches of EU law to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and in response to court judgments and to the concerns of the European Commission about levels of penalties, the Government is in the process of making an amendment to the European Communities Act 1972 to make provision for the creation on indictable offences in regulations transposing EU law. The maximum penalties provided for are up to three years imprisonment and a fine of up to €500,000.    This proposed amending legislation is currently before the Dail.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	398	The Independent Review of the Implementation of Homeless Strategies, which I published last year and copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library, examined the implementation of the Government's Integrated and Preventative Homeless Strategies and concluded that the Integrated and Preventative Strategies should be amalgamated and revised.The Review specifically recommended that the resultant revised strategy should have an overarching goal to eliminate long-term homelessness in Ireland by a defined date in the future and should include clearly defined objectives, actions, projected outcomes, timescales for delivery and an appropriate monitoring mechanism to track progress. The Government have accepted the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Independent Review and work is underway on the preparation of a revised and updated Strategy on Homelessness, having regard to the recommendations of the Independent Review.The social partnership agreement Towards 2016 contains a commitment to the elimination of the long-term occupancy of emergency homeless accommodation by 2010. Indeed, it should also be noted that in Dublin the Homeless Agency had already defined as its overarching goal the elimination of long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough in Dublin by 2010. In this context, it should be noted that long term is generally taken to mean any period greater than six months, i.e. that persons should not occupy emergency homeless accommodation for any longer than six months.Very significant resources are being made available to address the issue of homelessness at national level in a comprehensive and co-ordinated manner. Since 2000, the Government through my Department and the Department of Health and Children have provided in the order of €450 million in capital and current funding nationally for the provision of accommodation and care related services for homeless people.Recent assessments indicate that there has been a welcome decrease in the overall numbers of homeless persons in Dublin over recent years. Counted In 2005, the Homeless Agency's most recent assessment of homelessness in the Dublin area was 1,361 comprising some 2,015 persons and that this represented a 19% reduction in the number of homeless households since the previous assessment in 2002. This was comparable with the experience of the Dublin Homeless Persons Unit which saw a 20% decrease in the number of households presenting as homeless in the same period.Nationally, through the vital work of the local homeless fora, there has also been significant progress in reducing the numbers of homeless persons. In the Housing Needs Assessment 2005, local authorities recorded a 46% fall in the numbers of homeless persons nationally, from 5,581 persons in 2002 to 3,031 persons in 2005.There is now a wide range of accommodation and services for homeless persons across the country — from emergency hostels, transitional accommodation programmes to outreach and resettlement services and long term supported accommodation. A key task and a particular focus of attention in the future is to assist homeless persons who can live independently into mainstream long-term accommodation as soon as possible. This will involve the refocusing of efforts on the provision of accommodation in the social, voluntary and private rented housing sectors. The Rental Accommodation Scheme has significant potential in this area. This increased supply, together with appropriate outreach and resettlement support is essential in assisting people out of homelessness altogether.

I allocated some €948m in general purpose grants to local authorities for 2007.  This represents an increase of 8% over the record amount provided in 2006 and is almost three times the amount provided in 1997. General purpose grants are my Department's contribution towards meeting the cost to local authorities of providing an acceptable level of day to day services to their customers.Allocating this funding on a per capita basis in 2005, 2006 and 2007 would have substantially reduced the overall amount made available to the local authorities in County Mayo. In the case of Mayo County Council, the reduction would have been some €13.3m in 2005, €14.48m in 2006 and €16.16m in 2007, or an overall reduction of nearly €44 million on the total allocation of €105.75 million over the period.In allocating general purpose grants, I have regard to each local authority's expenditure on, and income from, each service, the overall amount of funding available for these grants and the need to provide each local authority with a baseline allocation that will ensure its financial stability.  Local authorities cost and income bases vary significantly from one another and calculating an appropriate distribution of these grants is complex. Any system designed to align funding solely or mainly on a per capita basis would ignore important differences between local authority cost and income bases.The very significant increase in funding in real terms to local authorities in recent years is an indication of this Government's firm commitment to the sector.  This funding, together with the continued rates buoyancy from the greatly strengthened commercial base supported by the Government's successful economic policies, will enable local authorities to continue to improve the range and quality of the services they provide to their local and business communities.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	400	Statutory responsibility for the making and implementation of regional waste management plans, including in respect of the provision of recycling infrastructure, rests with the local authority, or local authorities, concerned.Since 2002 my Department has allocated almost €100 million in capital grants to assist local authorities in the provision of recycling and recovery services. The projects assisted include bring bank networks, civic amenity sites, materials recovery, composting and biological treatment facilities. This funding is provided from a number of sources including the Exchequer, the European Regional Development Fund and the Environment Fund, and is normally on the basis of my Department meeting 75% of the cost and the relevant local authority funding the balance.I am conscious of the escalating costs to local authorities of operating the substantially increased network of recycling facilities and my Department has allocated some €29 million since 2003 to the authorities concerned to assist with the operating costs of these facilities. The costs incurred by local authorities are regularly reviewed to ensure that the available funding is distributed in an equitable manner.An objective of the new National Development Plan is to continue to support local authority provision of infrastructure that will maximise the value recovered in waste recycling.

As part of the implementation of this policy, my Department has allocated funding of over €8 million to County and City Councils for the development of new, or refurbishment of existing, playgrounds since 2004.  The location of the playgrounds which benefit from these moneys is a matter for the local authority to decide.In May 2005, I introduced a new initiative for the provision of skateboard facilities by local authorities.  Each City and County Council was invited to submit expressions of interest for grant assistance towards the provision of a skateboard park in its area.  Applications were assessed in my Department in conjunction with the National Children's Office and some 21 projects in 21 different local authority areas were recommended for grant aid.  A sum of €1 million had initially been earmarked for the scheme in 2005 but, in light of the number and quality of submissions received, I approved all 21 projects in November 2005 and increased the funding allocation to over €2 million which is expected to be spent over the two year period 2006 and 2007.The position regarding the provision of these playground and skateboard park facilities is being monitored by my Department and the question of inviting further proposals from local authorities will be kept under review in the light of progress.

This represents a 20% increase on the corresponding level of delivery achieved in 2005.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	404	Ireland's housing stock is comparatively the newest and fastest growing in Europe.  Building regulations have represented an important policy instrument for ensuring satisfactory standards of thermal insulation and other energy performance features in new housing stock.  Part L Building Regulation insulation standards for new dwellings have been in operation since 1 June 1992 with revisions taking place in 1998 and again in 2003.The Irish National Survey of Housing Quality  (2001-2002) indicated that 82% of the housing stock had roof insulation by 2001/2002.  The survey also suggested that there was evidence of a high level of energy-related home improvements in recent years.While my Department does not operate a grants scheme specifically for thermal upgrading of houses, Sustainable Energy Ireland, under the auspices of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, operates a Low Income Housing Programme.  This was set up to help establish and implement a national plan of action to address the problem of fuel poverty.  Core delivery is through the Warmer Homes Scheme.   This programme aims to improve the energy efficiency and comfort conditions of homes occupied by low-income households and at establishing the systems and growing the capacity in Ireland to install such measures which include attic insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets, energy efficient lighting, cavity wall insulation and energy advice.The Government in the Statement on Housing Policy Delivering Homes Sustaining Communities  (February 2007), places particular emphasis on the importance of rejuvenating existing social housing and this is supported by an investment of close to €2 billion under the new National Development Plan 2007-2013.As part of this rejuvenation, my Department financially assists local authorities in upgrading, renovating and re-developing their housing stock through the Remedial Works Scheme and funding for regeneration and redevelopment projects.  Works under the Remedial Works Scheme must comply with Building Regulations and where an extensive programme of refurbishment is carried out, measures are taken to improve thermal insulation in accordance with Building Regulations.In addition, my Department operates a number of targeted options to assist vulnerable groups, such as lower income households and elderly persons, to secure necessary improvement works to their homes.  These include the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the disabled persons and essential repairs grant scheme, the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme and a Central Heating Programme, all administered by local authorities, and the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly which is administered by the Health Services Executive.The Essential Repairs Grant and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Grant Scheme has been reviewed recently and will be replaced by the Scheme of Housing Aid for Older People, to be administered by local authorities, during 2007.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I have allocated record funding of some €948 million to local authorities for 2007 through general purpose grants from the Local Government Fund.  This represents an increase of 8% over the record amount provided in 2006, and is well ahead of the projected level of inflation for the year.  The 2007 funding represents an increase of 60% over the €592 million provided in 2002, and is substantially ahead of inflation of some 25% over the period January 2002 to December 2006.Local authorities will spend in excess of €9 billion in 2007 between their current and capital programmes.  General purpose grants are provided through the Local Government Fund which funds over 30% of local authorities' current spending.  These grants are my Department's contribution to each local authority towards the cost of providing its day-to-day services.The increased funding provided, together with the continued rates buoyancy from the greatly strengthened commercial base supported by the Government's successful economic policies, will enable local authorities to continue to improve the range and quality of services to their local and business communities.

Community policing is a central feature and core value of policing policy by local Garda management, who are aware of the difficulties being experienced by local residents with anti-social behaviour in the area.Additional foot, mobile and mountain bike patrols carried out by uniform and plain clothes Gardaí are in place in the area and these have resulted in a number of persons being prosecuted for anti-social behaviour and public disorder type offences. Members of the local Community Policing Unit regularly meet with local residents and the Residents' Associations.Current policing plans in the area are predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property and public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a policing service to the area referred to.

These Regulations apply to all EU citizens who move to and reside in Ireland.  The Regulations mean, inter alia, that EU citizens can enter Ireland on production of a valid passport or national identity card without the need for visas and may remain permanently in Ireland after residing here for a continuous period of 5 years.Regulation 6(2)(a) provides as follows:Subject to Regulation 20, a Union citizen may reside in the State for a period longer than 3 months if he or she —(i)  is in employment or is self-employed in the State,(ii) has sufficient resources to support himself or herself, his or her spouse and any accompanying dependants, and has comprehensive sickness insurance in respect of himself or herself, his or her spouse and any accompanying dependants,(iii) is enrolled in an educational establishment in the State for the principal purpose of following a course of study there, including a vocational training course, and has comprehensive sickness insurance in respect of himself or herself, his or her spouse and any accompanying dependants, or(iv) subject to paragraph (3), is a family member accompanying or joining a Union citizen who satisfies one or more of the conditions referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii).It is noted that the person concerned was a student in Ireland prior to the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007.  Non-EEA nationals who have permission to remain in the State as students are currently entitled to take up casual employment (defined as 20 hours per week during school term time and up to 40 hours per week during school holidays) for the duration of their permission to remain as a student. However, while this represents the current position,  "Towards 2016" provides that employment of non-EEA students will become subject to an application for an employment permit.Bulgarian and Romanian nationals are subject to the work restriction announced by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 24 October 2006. This means that Bulgarian and Romanian nationals, will continue to require a permit to take up employment in Ireland and the job will continue to be subject of the current requirement for a labour market test.  However, those nationals who already had the right to work full-time in the State for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer prior to the 31 December 2006 will not need an employment permit.  From the information furnished by the Deputy it would appear that the person concerned would require a work permit if she wished to enter the labour market in a full-time capacity.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks) of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the Stations referred to in the Deputy's questions are in the Waterford, Dungarvan, Tramore and Fermoy Garda Districts.

The 2006 figure represents an increase of 44, or nearly 10%, in the number of gardaí assigned to community policing duties over the previous year's figure.  Of course, all uniformed gardaí carry out community policing functions.  The term community garda describes a member of the Garda Síochána working full-time in a specified area and assuming responsibilities and performing duties which relate to that area.  It is designed to give neighbourhoods and communities a more personalised and comprehensive Garda service.  By its nature, it is the cities and larger towns which benefit most from the adoption of Community Policing.  Areas which have not had regular contact with the Garda Síochána get the opportunity to know and build up a relationship with a member of the force.  A review of Community Policing in Ireland is being carried out and it is anticipated that the review will be completed in 2007.  This review will take into account international best practice in this area.  When completed, the finished review will inform a National Model of Community Policing, which is a Strategic Goal in the Garda Síochána's corporate strategy.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Palmerstown area of Dublin 20 is covered by Ronanstown and Clondalkin Garda stations. The personnel strength of the Community Policing Unit in the stations on 31 December 2000 to 2006 was as follows:YearRonanstownClondalkin2000118200199200212820031310200416122005131620061110The Deputy should appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.  I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that four Community Gardaí have been assigned to the Palmerstown area in each of the years 2000 to 2006.  I know that the Garda Commissioner will take full account of the needs of Community Policing in his allocation of the considerable increase under way in the strength of the Force.  The attested strength has increased by well over 2,000 since June 1997 — which is more than 20% of an increase.  There are now  more than 14,000 attested members and recruits in training and this means that Community Policing and other operational areas in the force will continue to grow in strength.

It would be extremely difficult, and involve a disproportionate use of resources, to attempt to quantify the time spent by Gardaí in Court and the cost of same.  I am further informed that the Garda authorities commenced a Court Presenter System as a pilot scheme in 1997.  This System was designed to bring about greater efficiency in the deployment of garda resources by allowing Gardaí to give evidence by way of certificate of arrest, charge and caution with the purpose of relieving them of the obligation to attend court in person to give evidence orally.  The Court Presenter System was extended to all Dublin District Courts in 1999.  There are currently 14 Sergeants in the position of Court Presenter within the Dublin District Court Areas, as follows:StationNumberBridewell6 SergeantsKilmainham1 SergeantCloverhill2 SergeantsTallaght2 SergeantsSwords1 SergeantDún Laoghaire2 Sergeants

In so far as Civil Legal Aid is concerned, the position is that the Legal Aid Board provides legal advice and assistance, including Refugee Legal Services, mainly through the solicitors it employs on a full-time basis in its law centre network nationwide.  In 2006, the total remuneration paid to these solicitors amounted to €8.24 million.  In order to ensure that clients receive a timely service, the Board has also established panels of solicitors in private practice to complement the service provided by the law centres.  These solicitors provide services in certain family law matters that come before the courts and also in appeals before the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The private solicitors remunerated by the Legal Aid Board in 2006 and the total amount paid in each case is set out in Appendix A.  In certain instances these payments include financial provision for the employment of barristers where required by the solicitor in question.  The total paid amounted to approximately €1.77 million.  The amounts paid to solicitors in 2006 in respect of claims made on foot of legal aid certificates granted by the Courts under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 is provided in Appendix B. Information pertaining to the amounts paid to solicitors in respect of the non-statutory legal aid scheme (CAB) and the non-statutory Garda Station free legal advice scheme is not readily available and will be forwarded to the Deputy when compiled.NameAmount Paid€Comyn Kelleher Tobin & Company86,685James M Sweeney85,912James Watters & Company82,377Behan Barry Solicitors72,377Margaret Horan &

Applications received in the second half of 2004 are currently being processed and there are approximately 10,000 applications awaiting processing before that of the applicant.  Such applications are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest method.  The case was recently submitted to me for a decision as to whether it might be expedited.  However, as no reason has been put forward by the Deputy which would justify the application being dealt with ahead of other applicants, I have decided that it should be processed in the normal manner.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of designated full-time Community Gardaí assigned at 31 December, 2005 and 2006 was 453 and 497 respectively.  The 2006 figure represents an increase of 44, or nearly 10%, in the number of Gardaí assigned to community policing duties over the previous year's figure.  Of course, all uniformed Gardaí carry out community policing functions.  The term Community Garda describes a member of An Garda Síochána working full-time in a specified area and assuming responsibilities and performing duties which relate to that area.  It is designed to give local neighbourhoods and communities a more personalised and comprehensive Garda service.  By its nature, it is the cities and larger towns which benefit most from the adoption of Community Policing.  Areas which have not had regular contact with An Garda Síochána get the opportunity to know and build up a relationship with a member of the force.A review of Community Policing in Ireland is being carried out and it is anticipated that the review will be completed in 2007.  This review will take into account international best practice in this area.  When completed, the finished review will inform a National Model of Community Policing, which is a Strategic Goal in An Garda Síochána's Corporate Strategy.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the areas referred to in the Deputy's question are in the Clontarf sub-district and that there are six Gardaí from the Community Policing Unit assigned to these areas where they offer assistance and crime prevention advice on matters reported to them.  The community Gardaí involved have a good working relationship with the residents.  The residents and local Neighbourhood Watch Committee will continue to receive regular attention and support from the Gardaí at Clontarf.  I know that the Garda Commissioner will take full account of the needs of Community Policing in his allocation of the very considerable increase currently under way in the strength of the Force.  The attested strength has increased by well over 2,000 since June 1997 — which is more than 20% of an increase.  There are now  more than 14,000 attested members and recruits in training and this means that Community Policing and other operational areas in the force will continue to grow in strength.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, that the personnel strength of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The combined strength of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000.  The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met.  The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that it would not be the optimum use of Garda resources to provide a full-time Immigration Unit at Knock (Ireland West) Airport.  This is based on an analysis of the volume of passengers travelling through the Airport.  I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that the Knock (Ireland West) Airport is policed by personnel from the Swinford District and this factor is taken into account when allocating resources to the Swinford District.  Furthermore, the Garda authorities consider that the opening of a Garda Station at Knock (Ireland West) Airport would necessitate the employment of additional personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.  I should also say that the Mayo Division's resources are further augmented by a number of National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), other specialised units and the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), all of which have had increased resources to provide a comprehensive policing service to the public. Garda management state that the next allocation of Probationer Gardaí will take place on 14 March 2007.  The needs of the Mayo Garda Division, which includes the Swinford Garda District, will be fully considered in this allocation, within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.

I have arranged to forward to the Deputy the appropriate application form which should be completed and returned to my office by the person concerned.  I should, however, bring to the Deputy's attention the fact that the 1995 High Court Judgement on petitions stated that the power of clemency which I may exercise must be used sparingly and only in special and exceptional circumstances.

This Scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems.  The scheme operates at two levels: Stage 1 for pre-development proposals and Stage 2 for fully developed proposals.  The requirements under Stage 1 are less onerous than those for Stage 2.  Pobal has been engaged to administer the Scheme on behalf of my Department.  Details of the assessment criteria are set out in the Community Based CCTV Scheme Guidelines for the Application and Appraisals Process which can be found on both the Pobal website, www.pobal.ie, and on my Department’s website, www.justice.ie.Interest in the first round of the scheme was high with a total of 13 successful groups approved to receive Stage 2 grants totalling €1 million to be matched, in RAPID areas, by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Payment of these grants to the successful applicants is underway and progressing well.  In addition, a total of 24 successful groups received Stage 1 grants totalling €115,665 during 2006.  Pobal invited all groups who received Stage 1 grants to submit Stage 2 proposals and grants to successful applicants (subject to the Garda Commissioner's authorisation under section 38(3)(c) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005) are expected to be announced by the end of March 2007.  In addition, a new round of funding under the Community Based CCTV Scheme (both stage 1 and stage 2) was advertised on 1st December, 2006 with a closing date of 28th February, 2007.  As the closing date for receipt of applications has not yet been reached, the total number of applications that will be received is not yet known.  Accordingly, it is not possible at this stage to predict when grant announcements will be made but I can assure the Deputy there will be no undue delay in the evaluation and approval process.

They are being evaluated by Pobal.  Grants for successful applicants (subject to the Garda Commissioner's authorisation under section 38(3)(c) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005) are expected to be announced by the end of March 2007.  In addition, a new round of funding under the Community Based CCTV Scheme was advertised on 1st December 2006 with a closing date for applications of 28th February 2007.  As outlined above, there is considerable interest and response to the scheme as it stands and funding is provided on the basis that appropriate arrangements are in place for the ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the schemes.  That said, I am open to consider the matter when the scheme next falls to be reviewed.

Accordingly, I can inform him that there are four institutions under the administration of the Irish Prison Service in the constituency area in question.  These are:-Mountjoy Prison — (Male and Female Prison) — North Circular Road, Dublin 7.St. Patrick's Institution —  North Circular Road, Dublin 7.Training Unit — Glengarriff Parade, Dublin 7.Arbour Hill Prison — Arbour Hill, Dublin 7.In addition, my Department provides funding to a range of voluntary bodies which provide services to offenders in local communities.  There are twelve such community based projects located in the Dublin Central Constituency area, one of which has a residential component as follows:Tús Nua, 136 North Circular Road, Dublin 7Tús Nua, managed by DePaul Trust, provides residential accommodation and support for female ex-offenders on probation type supervision in the community or on discharge from custody.I can also inform the Deputy that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform through the Reception and Integration Agency has responsibility for the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers while their applications for asylum are being processed.  The details of these centres within the Dublin Central Constituency will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.

A number of minor works are, however, being carried out on a site adjacent to the prison, which was recently transferred from the Department of Defence to the Irish Prison Service.

Through direct provision, asylum seekers are provided with full board accommodation and ancillary services. The accommodation centre at Kinsale Road also provides Community Welfare Services, medical supports and VEC training on-site for residents.In addition to direct provision accommodation, the Agency operates a very limited number of self-catering accommodation centres in certain parts of the country. There are no centres of this type in Cork City. This accommodation is reserved for special needs and extreme medical cases in the main.The Agency received a request from the persons referred to in the details supplied for a move to self-catering accommodation dated 18th December, 2006. As the request was made on medical grounds, the Agency referred the details of the request to a Medical Referee for recommendation. The view of the Medical Referee in this case was that there was no clear indication to support a change to self catering accommodation.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Gardaí stationed in Tallaght, Rathfarnham and Terenure Garda Stations on 31 December, 1997 to 2006 and on 31 January, 2007 was as set out in the following table:TallaghtRathfarnhamTerenure31/12/97133634931/12/98139574631/12/99142636031/12/00159636731/12/01159676631/12/02159748431/12/03166718731/12/04173769131/12/05167709731/12/06178729831/01/0717772101Increase since 31/12/9744 (or 33%)9 (or 14%)52 (or 106%)I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.

The Garda Síochána Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, I am pleased to note that the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quarters of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.  I have requested the CSO to provide the information sought by the Deputy directly to him.

These three towns were chosen as representative of the average size of a Garda Síochána CCTV system, containing a good cross-section of the type of urban area in which Garda CCTV is typically deployed.I recently announced that it is planned for tenders to issue very shortly for a further 14 centres and Mullingar is included in this announcement.  Other centres (in alphabetical order) are Athlone, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, and Waterford.A request for tender (RFT) will issue to the marketplace very shortly for the installation of the systems with Mullingar included in this tender.  Depending on the tender responses received it is anticipated that the system will be installed in 2007.  Until the responses are received from the market, it is not possible to indicate the cost for each location.  However, I can say that over €7.5m has been provided in the Garda Vote for 2007 for these projects.

All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation and with support of local Garda District and Divisional Officers.  Such applications are then be submitted by the Divisional Officer to the Garda Advisory Committee for consideration and evaluation on the basis of Garda operational needs.I understand, however, that there are a number of CCTV cameras in operation on Main Street, Longford which were funded and installed by local business people and are operated voluntarily.  Neither the Garda authorities nor my Department have any involvement with this CCTV system.I am further informed that an application for grant-aid funding under my Department's Community Based CCTV Scheme was received from Longford Town Council.  This Scheme is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  I understand that following a thorough assessment of their application, Longford Town Council's application for funding was deemed not to reach the qualifying standard for grant funding.  I am further advised that Pobal provided feedback on applications directly to all unsuccessful applicants under the Scheme, including Longford Town Council.I announced a new round of funding under the Community Based CCTV Scheme on 1 December 2006.  Notices have been published in the national and Sunday newspapers bringing the Scheme to the attention of the public. The closing date for applications has been set at 28 February 2007.The application documentation for the Scheme has been revised to be more user-friendly and also take account of the requirements of section 38 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005. All application documentation is published on the websites of both Pobal and my Department.

This Scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems. The scheme operates at two levels: Stage 1 for pre-development proposals and Stage 2 for fully developed proposals. Pobal have been engaged to administer the Scheme on behalf of my Department.Interest in the first Round of the Scheme, which concluded in September 2005, was quite high.  24 successful groups received Stage 1 grants totalling €115,665 during 2006 including the areas referred to the Deputy as follows:Dublin 7 CCTV Action Group (including Mountpelier);North West Inner City RAPID AIT Sub-Group; andNorth East Inner City RAPID AIT.Following an assessment of all applications received by Pobal grants for successful applicants (subject to the Garda Commissioner's authorisation under section 38(3)(c) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005) are expected to be announced by the end of March 2007.Pobal further state that while Dublin 7 CCTV Action Group (including Mountpelier) did not apply for Stage 2 funding in this round, they intend to prepare a new application under Stage 2 of the next round, which was advertised on 1st December, 2006 with a closing date of 28th February, 2007.

Those decisions will depend on a range of factors including the requirements of my Department at the time and the specific circumstances associated with each building such as its location, quality and design, tenure, office area and whether it is leasehold or freehold.  Accordingly, it is not possible, at this stage of the programme, to be precise as to how these buildings will be used. The particular details of the decentralising offices requested by the Deputy are set out below.Thurles  — Sections of Garda Headquarters (114 posts), Phoenix Park and Capel Street, Dublin 1.Portarlington — Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (22 posts), Irish Life Centre, Dublin 1 and Equality Tribunal (32 posts), 3 Clonmel Street, Dublin 2.Roscrea — Equality Authority (54 posts), 2 Clonmel Street, Dublin 2 and Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission* (23 posts).Longford — Irish Prison Service (141 posts), S.I.A.C.

The two kinds of disclosure are qualitatively different and are intended for quite distinct purposes.A vetting service is provided by the GCVU to selected registered recruiting organisations in respect of persons who would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults as a means of safeguarding these vulnerable client groups.  In general, such vetting allows for the disclosure of information relating to criminal convictions and criminal prosecutions, successful or unsuccessful, only and not Garda cautions.In contrast, under data protection legislation, a person may apply for a copy of personal data maintained on the Garda Criminal Records Database for his/her personal use only.  Such a disclosure states, inter alia, that the document does not constitute a Garda ‘clearance'.  In general, such personal data would include information relating to criminal convictions and Garda cautions.  This reflects the purpose of data protection legislation, which is not a means of vetting but, rather, is designed to protect individuals with regard to the automatic processing of their personal data.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	456	The position is that a resident artist, whose income exceeds the VAT registration threshold for small businesses, in this case €35,000, must register and account for VAT on their income. A resident artist whose income is below the registration threshold is outside the scope of VAT. The VAT Directive precludes the granting of such a threshold to non-resident taxable persons and consequently it is not possible to apply such a threshold to a non-resident artist. The VAT rate applicable to both resident and non-resident artists is the standard rate of 21%. It is not possible under EU law to zero rate or to apply a reduced rate to such services.I would add that the VAT Act lists a range of activities that are exempt from VAT.  Included in this list is the promotion of and admissions to live theatrical or musical performances. This very broad exemption applies to both commercial and non-profit making organisations. In effect this means that the promoter realises the full value of the admission fee as no VAT is applied to admission fees. In this regard, the current exemption is already very generous covering a broad range of activities accessible to the wider public and it applies equally to commercial and non-profit organisations. In contrast, I understand that most, other Member States charge VAT on admission fees.

To get the Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions:(a)  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;(b)  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;(c)  be without both hands or without both arms;(d) be without one or both legs;(e) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;(f) have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.The Senior Medical Officer (SMO) for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the SMO to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.A special Interdepartmental Review Group reviewed the operation of the Disabled Drivers Scheme.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.The Group's Report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.

In carrying out such works, OPW was acting solely as an agent of the County Council.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no specific tax incentives available for the development of schools of music.  However, if a school of music is being run as a business and generating taxable income, the general position under tax law is that expenses that are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business are deductible in arriving at taxable profits.  Relief is also available for capital expenditure incurred on items regarded as plant and machinery that are used for the purposes of the business.Tax relief, in the form of capital allowances, was previously available for expenditure incurred on the construction and equipping of buildings used for the purposes of third level education.  It was, therefore, open to a third level educational institution with a music department or school of music to avail of this scheme. In line with property incentives generally, the scheme which provided relief to investors in third level educational facilities, is now being phased out and will finally end on 31 July 2008. However, for new projects it has already come to an end and the July 2008 deadline applies only to pipeline projects meeting a number of transitional conditions.In addition, Section 848A (Part 2 of Schedule 26A) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief on donations to approved bodies which have been granted approval for education in the arts.  Relief from either income tax or corporation tax applies where an individual or company make a donation of money, of at least €250 in a tax year, to an "approved body" for the purpose of assisting that body to promote the advancement in the State of an "approved subject". Subject to certain conditions there is no upper limit on the amount that can be donated.An "approved body" is a body approved the Minister for Finance for the purposes of the section, which is essentially a third level college, university or other body concerned solely with the advancement in the State, on a national or regional basis, of one or more specified "approved subjects" and cannot distribute its profits or assets to its members.The "approved subjects" are actually listed in the legislation but can and have been added to by the Minister for Finance.  The list of approved subjects appearing in the legislation is as follows:(a) the practice of architecture,(b) the practice of art and design,(c) the practice of music and musical composition,(d) the practice of theatre arts,(e) the practice of film arts, or(f) any other subject approved of the purposes of this section by the Minister for Finance.

The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.The Group's Report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get the Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions:(a) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;(b) be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;(c) be without both hands or without both arms;(d) be without one or both legs;(e) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;(f) have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.The Senior Medical Officer (SMO) for the relevant local Health Service Executive (HSE) administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the SMO to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.Consequently, my Department is not in a position to outline the number of amputees that have applied for the scheme, such information falls under the remit of the HSE. However, the Revenue Commissioners have informed me that there are some 800 amputees currently on the scheme.

Consequently, the information requested is not available.The standard VAT rate of 21% applies to condoms. Under EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply, it is not possible to introduce new zero rates of VAT, as we can only retain the zero rating that was in existence on 1 January 1991. Therefore it would not be possible to apply the zero rate of VAT to condoms.Member States are however permitted to apply the reduced VAT rate to goods or services listed in Annex III of the EU VAT Directive. In Ireland the reduced VAT rate is 13.5%. Certain pharmaceutical products including condoms are included in Annex III. It would therefore be possible to apply the reduced rate of VAT to condoms.In any event, if there was a reduction in the rate of VAT applying to condoms, I am not convinced, given the mark ups in the sector, that any rate reduction would necessarily be fully reflected in retail prices for condoms.

If the current thresholds were increased in line with inflation, they would rise to around €36,900 for services and €73,800 for goods.However, I should point out that I have significantly increased the VAT registration thresholds over the last two budgets. In last year's budget the VAT registration thresholds were increased from €25,500 to €27,500 for services and from €51,000 to €55,000 for goods. In this year's budget these threshold were increased further to €35,000 in the case of services and €70,000 in the case of goods. Taken together these increases have raised the VAT registration thresholds by some 37% over the last two years. Furthermore, these increases are in line with the recommendation contained in the Small Business Forum report published last year.In relation to the level of thresholds operated here versus or European counterparts, It should be recognised that Ireland operates the third highest registration threshold for goods and the second highest threshold for services in the EU. Indeed, some Member States do not operate any VAT registration threshold, requiring all businesses to register.Finally, registration thresholds reduce the administrative burden on both small businesses often at the developmental stage and on the Revenue authorities. However, registration thresholds are not intended as a means of keeping small businesses permanently outside the VAT system. Therefore in setting registration thresholds levels, the objective is to strike an appropriate balance between the desirability of reducing the administrative burden on small businesses and the Revenue authorities and the need to avoid undermining tax compliance or causing competitive distortions relative to registered firms.

Any approach for flood mitigation works that would meet these criteria will be considered.In the specific case referred to by the Deputy, the relevant channel has been maintained to its design level by the Commissioners.  However, it has been found that some land flooding has persisted.  The Commissioners will therefore carry out works to the channel this year to address this problem, provided any necessary consents can be obtained from other landowners and subject to there being no unacceptable environmental impacts.

The farmer subsequently requested that two invoices, which he had submitted in support of the claims, be returned to him for use in connection with a grant application to the Department of Agriculture and Food.  One of these invoices has since been returned by the Revenue Commissioners, but unfortunately it has not been possible to locate the other invoice, despite an extensive search. However, the Revenue Commissioners have been in touch with the Department of Agriculture and Food on the matter and I understand that the grant application will be processed taking account of the invoice in question.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I propose to take Questions Nos. 301 and 357 together.In 2005, a process was begun to examine all aspects of the drugs supply chain with a view to achieving greater value for money in the pricing and supply of drugs and medicines to the health services and the GMS and community drugs schemes, consistent with patient safety and continuity of supply. This process was agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health.  A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children negotiating team was put in place to advance this process.In mid-2006, the negotiating team reached agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI). Discussions then began with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributors' Federation (PDF), as part of the agreed process on supply to community pharmacies and the health services.  However, PDF advised the State that a legal issue precluded it from negotiating a new margin for distribution to community pharmacies.  The negotiating team then obtained legal advice, which subsequent legal advice to the Department confirmed, that this issue also had implications for negotiations with community pharmacists.The legal advice to the Minister and the HSE indicates that:Section 4(1) of the Competition Act, 2002 prohibits all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the restriction or distortion of competition, including agreements to fix prices, unless the agreement, decision or concerted practice meets certain conditions. Those conditions are not met in this case.Wholesalers and pharmacy contractors are undertakings.  PDF and the IPU are associations of undertakings under Section 4(1) of the Act.The coming together of wholesalers under PDF or pharmacy contractors under the IPU to negotiate prices would be a breach of Section 4(1).Entering into an agreement, making a decision or being involved in a concerted practice in contravention of Section 4(1) is a criminal offence and would expose those parties, their directors, managers and officers to the risk of criminal prosecution.In light of the above, it is not possible for the HSE to engage in negotiations with PDF or the IPU in relation to fees or margins.  The HSE has written to all community pharmacy contractors, setting out the position in relation to these issues in detail.  The negotiation team has been examining how best to address this issue for pharmacy contractor services.   To this end, the team engaged with the IPU to clarify the legal position and the situation in relation to contract negotiations.   The team has now discussed with the IPU proposals to examine ways of carrying out a contract review that would comply fully with competition law.It is necessary also to ensure that any future contractual arrangements entered into by the HSE for the provision of primary care services, and the process by which they are arrived at, comply with the terms of the Competition Act 2002.   In this context, further legal advice is being sought in relation to the permissibility of negotiating contractual fee arrangements with organisations representing other self-employed health professionals. My Department and the HSE will consider this advice, when received, in order to determine the most appropriate way in which to advance the putting in place of contractual arrangements which facilitate the delivery of modern, high-quality and accountable primary care services.With regard to IPU representation of pharmacists, both my Department and the HSE recognise the IPU as the collective representative body for its members.   There is, and will continue to be, ongoing dialogue with the IPU, within the constraints of the legal advice provided.  I wish to see that dialogue continuing in a constructive manner.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	473	Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the number of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of the Actual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

In the case of dental services the Health (Amendment) Act 1994 and the Health (Dental Services for Children) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 248 of 2000) also applies.  Section 66 (3) of the Health Act, 1970 states that ‘When the governing body of a school which is not a national school so requests, a health board may at its discretion by order apply this section to the school'.The Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006, contains provision for the amendment of Section 66 of the Health Act, 1970 to provide for a health examination and treatment service for pupils attending any primary school.  The Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006, also contains provision for the amendment of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1994 to provide dental health services to children attending any primary school.  My officials are currently in discussion with the Health Service Executive with a view to ensuring an early commencement of the relevant sections of the Act.

I have allocated additional revenue funding of €8 million for this year to meet the additional costs involved.  I have approved an additional 69 posts for roll-out.  BreastCheck appointed the Clinical Directors for the South and West last November and has recently appointed three Consultant Radiologists, two Consultant Surgeons and two Consultant Histopathologists, all with a special interest in breast disease.  The recruitment of Radiographers and other staff is underway.I have also made available an additional €26.7m capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of five additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.  The first round of screening will commence in the West in the Spring which will take around 27 months to complete.  The BreastCheck Programme is designed to offer repeat screening within an interval of 21-27 months.In relation to the roll out to specific counties, my Department has requested the Director of the Programme to respond directly to the Deputy.

Persons who apply may receive any amount up to a maximum of €300 per week. The payment of subvention is subject to means-testing.  In addition, the HSE may pay an enhanced subvention to people who cannot afford to meet the cost of care. An extra €30 million has been provided in 2007 for this purpose.The HSE has recently finalised National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme.  These were circulated to all Local Health Office subvention officers at the end of January, and are available on the HSE's website.  Under the guidelines, the assessment of means will now be carried out using a national standard financial assessment method.  The Guidelines also detail a number of improvements to the subvention scheme and in light of these improvements the HSE will re-assess those in receipt of a nursing home subvention.The HSE will write to all those currently in receipt of a nursing home subvention. Residents in private nursing homes, who are not presently in receipt of a subvention, may also apply to the HSE for an assessment. It is estimated that as many as 1,800 people who did not previously qualify for a subvention may now be eligible for a payment.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	491	The Action Plan for Dementia, published in 1999, outlines the complexity and range of issues involved in the effective management of dementia. The plan emphasises the need for the development of co-ordinated, multi-layered and well-resourced services, which are responsive to the individual needs of people with dementia and of those who care for them. The Action Plan describes a model of best practice for the provision and planning of dementia care in Ireland.  The recommendations in the plan include increased funding, changes to service delivery mechanisms, expanded Old Age Psychiatry services, increased support for family carers and provision of day care and respite services.Since the report was published, community supports have been enhanced over the years and increased levels of funding have been made available to develop a wide range of community based services, including community nursing, paramedical services, home help services, and support to family carers.Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  In 2006 a total of 2,000 additional Home Care packages were provided at a full year cost of €55m and a similar increase in the number of packages is being provided in 2007, benefitting some 4,000 people.  An extra €18m was provided in Budget 2007 to fund the cost of some 780,000 additional Home Help this year. This brings the total funding allocated to the Home Help service to approximately €171 million per annum. An additional €3.5m was also allocated to provide an additional 1,100 places in Day/Respite care.In terms of dementia specific services, new day care centres and residential units have been designed and developed in partnership with the Alzheimer's Society. Home care services have also been specifically developed to meet the needs of persons with Alzheimer's and their carers.  The additional funding provided under Home Care Packages and the Home Help Scheme will further enhance the supports available to families caring for people with dementia at home.In August 2006 the Alzheimer Society of Ireland published "Perceptions of Stigma in Dementia: An Exploratory Study" in conjunction with the School of Nursing and Midwifery, Trinity College, Dublin.  The HSE has advised that it will work closely with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, as is the case at present, in examining the various recommendations of this report.

These regulations transpose EU Directives on the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes and ensure that Ireland is in line with international best practice.Under the Act, experiments on live animals can only be performed by persons licensed by the Authority (Minister for Health and Children) and in premises registered for that purpose. Each licence applicant must satisfy the Authority that they have the appropriate education and training (including instruction in a relevant scientific discipline) for the task, are competent to perform the task in accordance with the conditions specified in the licence and have the appropriate competence to handle and take care of the experimental animals specified in the application.Section 5 of the Act deals with the general requirements for the care and accommodation of experimental animals and provides, inter alia, that: all experimental animals shall be provided with housing, an environment, at least some freedom of movement, food water and care that are appropriate to their health and well being; any restriction on the extent to which an experimental animal can satisfy its physiological and ethological needs shall be limited to the absolute minimum; the environmental conditions in which experimental animals are bred, kept or housed shall be checked daily; the well-being and state of health of experimental animals shall be observed by a veterinary surgeon or other suitably qualified person in order to prevent pain or avoidable suffering, distress or lasting harm; and arrangements shall be made to ensure that any defect or suffering discovered is eliminated as quickly as possible.Inspections of registered user establishments are carried out in accordance with Section 10 of the Act.  The Act provides for all registered establishments to be visited from time to time by inspectors for the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of the Act.  Veterinary staff of the Department of Agriculture and Food act as inspectors.  Officials of my Department do not carry out these inspections. It is a function of the inspector to report to the Authority any case of non-compliance with the provisions of the Act and no such report has been received in the period referred to by the Deputy.

RKW will be advising on a range of issues which will help to inform the design of the new hospital.  They will be advising, for example, on the preferred model of care, on the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and on the additional range of services to be provided outside of the main hospital. RKW have also been requested to advise, as a priority, on the range of services which should be provided outside of the main hospital through the urgent / ambulatory care service, taking account of international best practice in the planning of children's hospital services.  The framework brief will also inform decisions in relation to the size and type of accommodation to be provided at the new hospital, for both patients and their parents or guardians.RKW will be consulting widely in the course of its work, and the input of stakeholders will be of benefit in ensuring the delivery of our shared objective of providing a world-class hospital for the children of this country, including those children who have special needs.

Direct funding has already been provided under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for the provision of backbone infrastructure and to upgrade local access infrastructure.The Government has also taken the initiative to address market failure through investment in the construction of the high speed, open-access Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), while also grant aiding rural broadband projects under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS).However, despite Government and private investment in broadband there are parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. It is planned to address the question of availability of broadband to the remaining 10-15 per cent via a new scheme which, when it is fully rolled out, will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in unserved areas are met. A Steering Group comprising representatives of my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed scheme and work on the design of an appropriate tender is under way.

I am aware that, despite Government and private investment in broadband, there are areas of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. Accordingly, I have announced a new scheme, which will aim to provide a broadband service to these areas. This scheme will be confined to areas of the country that are not yet served by any broadband service provider, currently thought to be 10-15% of the population. This scheme will, when it is fully rolled out, ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in these unserved areas are met.A Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed scheme and work on the design of an appropriate tender is under way.

For this reason, the Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme (No. 2) Regulations 2006 do not identify a surplus of fish available for harvest in 2007.During 2007 fish stock assessment studies will be undertaken in order to forecast the position for 2008 and beyond. I am aware that the Southern Regional Fisheries Board has received a proposal from snap net fishermen representatives to participate in scientific research efforts and this offer is being considered at the moment.The Regional Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute will monitor the stocks in developing a management plan for the River Suir with a view to identifying the extent of the recovery, if any, arising from the cessation of the mixed stock commercial fishery and any stock rehabilitation works undertaken.In the future event that stocks recover in each of the rivers of the Waterford Estuary, and it is established from the results of the Genetic Stock Identification Project that significant numbers of fish destined for other rivers are not intercepted within the rivers and estuary, it should be possible to exploit the identified surplus by all methods (including snap-nets) but within the constraints permitted by the Habitats Directive as transposed by the European Communities (National Habitats) Regulations 1997 (S.I. No. 94 of 1997).The Government has put in place a Hardship Fund for those affected by the compulsory cessation of indiscriminate mixed stock salmon fishing at sea. This will be available to snap net fishermen on the River Suir who held a licence for the 2006 season. Details of the scheme are being finalised at present and will be advertised in the national press in the near future.

The intention is to co-locate the Department and BIM in separate buildings in a campus style development in the town. To this end a 3.5 acre (approximately) site has been acquired to house both the Department's functions and those of BIM. Design and layout of accommodation have been agreed with both the Department and BIM and a planning application has been lodged and considered by the Local Authority. I understand from the Office of Public Works that additional information sought by the local authority was submitted last month and that the planning process is continuing.The latest information from the Public Appointments Service (PAS) is that the demand for posts in Clonakilty substantially exceeds the number of posts available in my Department in that location. In addition, staff surveys in BIM indicate that at least 16 staff may be willing to relocate.

The programme also includes the decentralisation of Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) with 95 posts to Clonakilty, the Central Fisheries Board (CFB) with 62 Posts to Carrick-on-Shannon and Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) with 47 posts to Dundalk.The entire Dublin-based Department, which is due for decentralisation, has been based in three locations, Leeson Lane, Dublin 2, 29-31 Adelaide Road, Dublin 2 and Tom Johnson House, Haddington Road, Dublin 4. BIM is based at Crofton Road, Dún Laoghaire Co. Dublin. The CFB at Swords Business Campus, Co. Dublin and SEI in Glasnevin, Dublin 9.The acquisition of suitable properties to facilitate proposed decentralisation moves is a matter for the Office of Public Works OPW), as is any future use of Dublin buildings post-decentralisation.  I can inform the House that to date my Department's interactions with OPW on the acquisition of properties are well progressed.  A 10.5-acre site has been acquired in Cavan Town to accommodate the Headquarters functions and my Department is working with OPW towards the lodging of a planning application ahead of the Decentralisation Implementation Group timeframe for relocation of late 2009. In the meantime I opened offices last year for a significant advance party in Cavan Town. There are currently 28 staff working in the Town covering Corporate Services, Domestic Policy Co-ordination, EU Co-ordination, North-South Co-ordination, Freedom Of Information Services as well as several important financial management functions. Plans to increase numbers in Cavan in 2007 are well advanced.In relation to Clonakilty a 3.5 acre (approx.) site has been acquired to house both the Departments functions and those of BIM. A planning application has been lodged and considered by the Local Authority. I understand from OPW that additional information sought by the Local Authority was submitted last month and that the planning process is continuing.There are 50 staff delivering a range of Seafood and Coastal Zone services currently operating out of interim accommodation in the town since June 2006. We are committed to having a full complement of DCMNR staff in interim accommodation in the town by June this year. In addition, the establishment of the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) in January will result in an increase in staff numbers to be relocated to Clonakilty and plans to house the SFPA in interim accommodation in the town by June 2007 are well advanced. It is anticipated that some 135 posts will be decentralised to Clonakilty by June 2007 rather than the Departmental 91 first mooted. This is in addition to the 95 BIM posts.As the Deputy will be aware in relation to the CFB, following a major review of the inland fisheries sector, the Government is acting to establish a single National Inland Fisheries Authority (NIFA) from both the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards.The creation of NIFA is a significant undertaking and efforts have been focussed on the legislative structure to underpin NIFA and consideration of the administrative structure of the new body.As regards SEI, both my Department and the Agency are liaising closely with OPW in relation to a permanent site within the Energy Zone described in SEI's 2020 policy.  So far no SEI, BIM or CFB staff have relocated to Dundalk, Clonakilty or Carrick-on-Shannon, respectively.

However, it has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband. My Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. The networks offer towns opportunities to attract inward investment in advanced technology and knowledge based enterprises.Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under Phase One and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity. The second phase of the MANs programme included a number of towns with populations greater than 1,500 that were not being offered a broadband option by the private sector.  Although Clonakilty is not part of the current rollout it may be included in further phases subject to the necessary approvals and Exchequer funding being made available.

Such funding may include provision for healthcare costs for volunteer development workers arising from their travel.  Any Irish registered charity or non-governmental organisation may apply for project funding under two schemes administered by Irish Aid, namely, the Civil Society Fund and the Micro Projects Scheme.The project funding available under both of these schemes can support reasonable health costs associated with volunteers' development work. This support is normally requested as an integral part of the personnel costs associated with the implementation of a particular project.  I have arranged for details of the relevant Civil Society funding schemes to be forwarded to the Deputy.

As I have informed him in response to his previous Parliamentary Questions on Cuba, the European Union's Common Position on Cuba, negotiated during our 1996 EU Presidency, is at the core of Ireland's policy. The overriding objective of Ireland and our EU partners in our relations with Cuba is to encourage — and not to enforce by external coercion — a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The European Union believes that critical engagement with the Cuban Government, alongside dialogue with wider Cuban civil society, is the most effective way to promote peaceful change in Cuba.The validity of the 1996 Common Position was most recently reaffirmed by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 12 June 2006. The European Union has emphasised its willingness to cooperate with Cuba on the basis of a dialogue with the Cuban Government and Cuban civil society, as soon as the Cuban Government shows the political will to engage in a dialogue aiming at tangible results, especially in the field of human rights and political freedom, the restriction of which remains a matter of deep concern. In this regard, I would again urge the Cuban Government to release all prisoners of conscience and to respect internationally acknowledged principles and practices, including in respect of judicial process.I would also recall that Ireland, along with our EU partners, again voted on 8 November, 2006 in the United Nations General Assembly in favour of the annual Cuban-tabled resolution related to ending the US economic embargo, since it is our view that the embargo seriously hampers the economic development of Cuba and negatively affects its entire people. The EU rejects unilateral measures against Cuba which are contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade.The US Embassy in Dublin has not communicated with me or my Department on the visit of the named individual. I determine my own diary.

Ceasefire violations by all parties, including banditry, inter-tribal conflicts and the bombing of civilian sites by the Sudanese airforce are undermining efforts to revitalise the peace process and have dire humanitarian consequences. The Government is making use of all avenues, bilaterally, through the EU and through the UN, to focus urgent international attention on the crisis in Darfur and work towards a resolution, and will continue to do so. During my visit to the Middle East this month I took the opportunity, while in Cairo, to discuss the situation in Darfur with the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Aboul Gheit, and the Arab League Secretary-General, Amr Mussa, in an effort to revive momentum towards a resolution. I know the Oireachtas is also deeply concerned about this situation, as reflected in the all-party motion which was passed on 28 November 2006.The UN and the African Union are coordinating international efforts to revitalise the May 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement and strengthen peacekeeping. The two organisations' Special Envoys for Darfur, Mr Jan Eliasson and Dr Salim Salim, are actively trying to get negotiations under way between the parties to this Agreement and non-signatory rebel groups. The international community must present a united front in demanding that the Sudanese Government and the rebel groups negotiate without preconditions. The EU, for its part, has implemented a comprehensive arms embargo against Sudan since 1994, and also applies individual sanctions against four individuals designated by the Security Council under Resolution 1591(2005).I spoke on 24 January with the UN Special Envoy on Darfur, Mr. Jan Eliasson, about the situation in Darfur, and assured him of Ireland's support for his efforts and those of his UN colleagues, in terms of peacekeeping, humanitarian aid and work to revitalise the peace process. The UN's involvement is crucial to improving the situation on the ground in Darfur.The African Union's ceasefire observation mission in Darfur (AMIS) is being strengthened in a phased manner with UN support, aiming towards deployment of a strong AU-UN hybrid force later this year. Already some 100 UN military, police and civilian personnel are in place, under the first phase of UN support. In December 2006 President Bashir of Sudan gave his approval in principle to this phased approach to strengthening AMIS. However, regrettably, he has not as yet specifically endorsed the deployment of the AU-UN hybrid force which is intended to be the third and final phase of the process. On 22 January and on 12 February, EU Foreign Ministers expressed their The African Union's ceasefire observation mission in Darfur (AMIS) is being strengthened in a phased manner with UN support, aiming towards deployment of a strong AU-UN hybrid force later this year. Already some 100 UN military, police and civilian personnel are in place, under the first phase of UN support. In December 2006 President Bashir of Sudan gave his approval in principle to this phased approach to strengthening AMIS. However, regrettably, he has not as yet specifically endorsed the deployment of the AU-UN hybrid force which is intended to be the third and final phase of the process. On 22 January and on 12 February, EU Foreign Ministers expressed their readiness to consider further measures, notably in the UN framework, against any party which obstructs implementation of the phased approach to strengthening AMIS and to establishing the AU-UN hybrid force.The work of the UN Human Rights Council High-Level Assessment Mission to Darfur, which took up its task on 9 February, is of great importance in giving the international community a true picture of the impact of the conflict in Darfur on people's lives. It is worrying that all members of the mission were not given visas, and the Mission has thus been able to visit Sudan.Since 2004, Ireland has provided over €16 million in emergency aid to Darfur, including €3 million for AMIS. A further €2.1 million in humanitarian support has been approved to date in 2007, and further financial support for AMIS is being considered. Three members of the Permanent Defence Forces serve in support of AMIS.I will continue to avail of every possible opportunity to emphasise the urgent need for unhindered provision of humanitarian support to all those in need in Darfur, and the speedy deployment of a well- resourced peacekeeping operation under UN auspices with a strong mandate for protecting civilians. The present situation is simply unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue.

The closing date for receipt of application forms and required documentation, including evidence of title, was November 24th 2006. An application under the programme was submitted by the club in question.In relation to the lands in question, on which the club wishes to place the facility which is the subject of its application under the 2007 sports capital programme, the position is that the organisation which owns the lands was provisionally allocated grants of €100,000 in 2004 and €80,000 in 2006 under the sports capital programme.One of the requirements in order to draw down payment of sports capital grants, is the invoking of a Deed of Covenant and Charge. The Deed provides, inter alia, for a repayment of the grant in the event of the grant-aided property not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated.  My Department's legal advisers, the Chief State Solicitor's Office (CSSO), deal with the grantee's solicitor in executing this Deed.A deed of covenant and charge was agreed on the title to the property to cover the 2004 grant allocation to the organisation which owns the site.  This deed is currently being updated to include the 2006 grant allocation.  In this context, my Department received a letter from the CCSO on 5 December last, outlining that the grantee now wished to lease one acre of their site to the club in question for a period of fifty years.  As is normal practice, my Department wrote to the CSSO on December 11th last asking for a valuation to be carried out to ensure that the of the remaining portion of land is sufficient to cover the repayment of the grants allocated should that be required.  The CSSO informed my Department on December 13th that it had requested said valuation from the organisation's solicitor.  I am informed by the CSSO that no further communication has been received on this matter from the organisation through its solicitor.

The programme provides for a maximum grant level of €3.8million.  Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, supported and submitted by the local authority.Before supporting a project, the local authority would have to be satisfied that the proposal is viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project is available and that the project when completed, would have a suitable level of public access.  Consequently, the question of the location or operation of public swimming pools in any particular area is a matter for the relevant local authority.The following table details the projects have been or are being dealt with in the Dublin area to date under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.Pool ProjectStatusFunding allocated€mFinglas (replacement pool)Completed3.8Ballymun (replacement pool)Completed3.8Ballyfermot (replacement pool)under construction3.8Jobstown (new)Completed3.8Clondalkin (replacement)under construction3.8St. Michael’s House (new)under construction3.7Skerries (new)preparing contract documents*Glenalbyn (refurbishment)preparing contract documents*Dundrum (replacement)preparing tender documents*St. Joseph’s House (refurbishment)preparing preliminary report**Grant aid is formally allocated at the stage when the tender for the project is approved.The priority under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme is to continue to support those projects remaining within the programme.

The Review is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  The Review is currently being finalised and it is my intention to publish it as soon as possible.  Following consideration of the recommendations in the review it is my intention to launch a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  When the Programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities including South Dublin County Council to submit applications under the terms that will apply.In relation to the development of other sports facilities in north Dublin, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department.  Applications under the programme must be related directly to the provision of sport and recreational facilities and be of a capital nature.  While figures are not available on a sub-county basis, over €129.5 million in capital funding has been allocated to sports projects in County Dublin since 1998.The Sports Capital Programme is advertised on an annual basis.

However the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting clubs and organizations and to voluntary and community organizations in respect of projects directly related to the provision of sports and recreational sports facilities.  The projects must be of a capital nature, which, for the purpose of the programme, is defined as: expenditure on the improvement or construction of an asset and includes any costs directly incurred in this process;  or purchase of permanently based sports equipment, that is, it is securely housed, and will remain in use for five years or more.The programme is advertised on an annual basis.  The closing date for receipt of applications under the 2007 sports capital programme was 24 November 24 2006 and a total of 1,531 applications were received.  These are currently being assessed and I hope to announce the successful applications shortly. The organisation in question did not submit an application under the scheme.  It is intended that the 2008 sports capital programme will be advertised towards the end of this year and it will be open to the organisation to submit an application under that programme should it have a project which is in line with the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.My Department's ACCESS scheme provides capital grants for arts and culture infrastructure around the country.  Eligible facilities include integrated arts centres, theatres, and galleries as well as arts studios and creative and performance spaces.  The primary focus of the scheme will be the refurbishment and enhancement of existing arts and culture facilities.  A total of 155 applications for funding were received under the current scheme, ACCESS II 2007 to 2009.  The organisation in question did not submit an application and the programme is now closed for applications. An independent selection committee is currently assessing the applications received.

Responsibility for the resolution of trade disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement machinery free of charge to assist the dispute resolution process, which, in line with the general principles of industrial relations in Ireland, is voluntary in nature.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing an extensive set of legislative conditions on the parties to a trade dispute.For disputes involving grievance and disciplinary matters relating to individuals, the Labour Relations Commission, in consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, IBEC, the ICTU, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Health and Safety Authority, prepared a Code of Practice on Grievance and Disciplinary Procedures.  This code of practice was given effect through S.I. No. 146 of 2000.The code of practice dictates best practice for addressing grievance and disciplinary issues.  The code includes a provision to the effect that the grievance and disciplinary procedures of a company must comply with the general principles of natural justice and fair procedures, including the rights of the employee to a fair and impartial determination of the issues concerned.This code of practice states that the principles and procedures set out in the code should apply unless alternative agreed procedures exist in the workplace, which conform to the code's general provisions for dealing with grievance and disciplinary issues.  The courts and employment rights and dispute settling bodies of the State must take account of the provisions of this code of practice when considering cases brought before them.  The services of the Labour Relations Commission can be availed of if a grievance or disciplinary matter cannot be resolved internally.As regards the long-term future of the company, I understand that Enterprise Ireland maintains regular contact with the Group, of which the company in question is part,  as it does with companies generally across the sector concerned. Depending on a company's needs, the Industrial Development agencies will assist in whatever way they can to secure a company's long term future in this country.

Specific worker protection Regulations regarding the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos fibres while at work have been in place since 1989.  The most up-to-date Regulations are the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 386 of 2006), which are enforced by the Health and Safety Authority.  These Regulations place obligations on employers and employees to ensure that the risk of exposure to asbestos is eliminated or reduced to a minimum and that any remaining residual risk is adequately controlled in accordance with the legislation.  The Health and Safety Authority is working to ensure those persons who are at risk from existing asbestos materials in workplaces, or who work with such materials, know the best way to control and prevent exposure occurring. By improving compliance with best practices, the risk from asbestos fibres being released is controlled and prevented and any residual risk is then controlled and reduced.I understand that under the Occupational Injuries Scheme operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs benefits may be payable in respect of insured workers affected by contact with asbestos.

The majority are based in the following locations:256: 27-33 Upper Baggot Street, Dublin 4.46: Canal House, 563 South Circular Road, Dublin 818: Clyde Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin 45: Adelaide Chambers, Peter Street, Dublin 8.21: National Contact Centre, Edenderry, Co. Offaly.Once staff in the above buildings have decentralised there will be no staff based in these offices and the lease on these buildings will be returned to their owners.There are also 37 Head Office staff in 9 FÁS centres throughout the country.  The decentralisation of these staff to Birr will not have any effect on the status of these buildings.The number of Enterprise Ireland staff based in Dublin prior to decentralisation is approximately 600 and the number of staff based in Dublin post decentralisation will be approximately 300.Enterprise Ireland is moving out of four separate Dublin sites, including their HQ at Glasnevin, into one site at East Point early in 2008.Enterprise Ireland will vacate the Glasnevin site early in 2008.  The future of the site will be determined in consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.When Enterprise Ireland vacates its three leased offices in Dublin, new occupancy will be a matter for the owners/principal leaseholders of these buildings.The current postal address for E.I. H.Q. is:Enterprise Ireland, Head Office, Glasnevin, Dublin 9The Health and Safety Authority's Dublin office and Headquarters is located at the Metropolitan Building, James Joyce Street, Dublin 1, where 121 staff are currently located.  The Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny as part of the decentralisation programme.In advance of decentralising to Thomastown, in August 2006 the Authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city to facilitate the transfer of existing staff and the recruitment of new staff to the decentralisation area, including staff recruited for the REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) strategy.  The number serving in the interim office has increased steadily since then and full occupancy (25/30 staff) is expected later this year.The Authority is in close contact with the Office of Public Works regarding the property management (site acquisition) and project management (design and build) aspects of the Thomastown location.  Precise timelines have yet to be finalised.I am informed that the Health and Safety Authority's Dublin Office is held on a limited lease.  The lease provides for the sub-letting of space and, as it is proposed that the Authority will retain a regional presence in Dublin post decentralisation, some of the existing space will be retained for that purpose.  Once the situation regarding timelines etc. for decentralisation become clearer the Authority will review the options available to it as regards space and numbers at that point.The National Standards Authority of Ireland is to move 132 posts to Arklow, Co. Wicklow.  The postal address for the National Standards Authority of Ireland is:Ballymun Road, Glasnevin, Dublin 9.The number of staff based there prior to decentralisation is 132 and the number of staff that will be based there post-decentralisation is nil.  The subsequent utilization or disposal of facilities currently occupied by the Authority will be a matter for the OPW.

It is expected that the European Court of Justice will give its judgement in the coming months.In 2006 approximately 39 million payments were issued to social welfare customers through post offices at a cost of €48 million.  Recognising the essential payment delivery service which An Post currently provides for my Department, and pending the judgement from the European Court of Justice, An Post continues to provide these services.An Post and my Department have been partners in the delivery of social welfare payments since the foundation of the State and there is no reason to believe that An Post and the network of post offices will not continue to play a significant role in the delivery of social welfare payments in the future.  The post office network, and the position of any individual Post Office, is a matter in the first instance for An Post.

Following a review his claim was disallowed by a Deciding Officer, with effect from 28 June 2006, on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking employment.  This decision was upheld by an Appeals Officer following an oral hearing on 19 October 2006.The person concerned had been in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance while his jobseeker's allowance claim and subsequent appeal were being processed.  He was in receipt of the basic supplementary allowance from 11th July 2006 to 11th December 2006 at a rate of €165.80 per week.  The Executive terminated payment of the weekly supplementary welfare allowance in December 2006 on the grounds that, in its opinion and in the light of the outcome of the appeal, the person concerned had not subsequently made reasonable efforts to seek employment.  The Executive has advised that the person concerned was informed of his right to appeal this decision to the designated Appeals Officer and that no appeal has been received to date.The person concerned lodged another claim for jobseeker's allowance on 12 February 2007.  If the person concerned wishes to again apply for supplementary welfare allowance, he should contact his local Community Welfare Officer.

This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person's basic income.Assistance in the form of an urgent needs payment (UNP) can be also made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA, to assist, for example in cases of flood damage, with immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and perhaps shelter.  Assistance can be provided in cash or in kind.My Department's role in the response to the recent flooding will primarily involve supporting the community welfare service in the provision of ENP and UNP funding in the short term and other supports where applicable to cater for the long term effects of the flooding.  Any support given will relate to damage to a person's home or loss of essential items and will not extend to business or commercial losses.  Local community welfare officers are available to provide assistance on an individual basis where that is warranted.  If any person is experiencing hardship as a result of the recent flooding, they should contact their local Community Welfare Officer in the first instance.

I have recently announced the implementation of the all-Ireland free travel scheme commencing from 2 April.  This scheme will enable pensioners resident here and in Northern Ireland to travel free of charge on all eligible transport services on the island.The scheme will extend the existing cross-border free travel arrangements by allowing pensioners over the age of 66 and resident here to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland.  Likewise, pensioners in Northern Ireland will travel free of charge on transport services in this State.  Some 600,000 customers are in receipt of free travel in the Republic of Ireland, of which 430,000 are aged over 66 years.  The All-Ireland Free Travel scheme is based on the existence of criteria of entitlements to free travel North and South for pensioners over 66 and applies only to this category.The extension of the scheme to an all-island free scheme for over 66s represents a significant extension in travel opportunities.  I will continue to examine any opportunities to further improve and expand on what will, from April 2 be a very comprehensive, seamless free travel scheme.  Any such additional developments would have to be worked out in conjunction with the authorities in Northern Ireland.The existing cross-border free travel scheme, introduced in July 1995, continues to apply to all Free Travel Pass holders, to enable them make journeys from a point in the Republic of Ireland to a destination in Northern Ireland.

There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.  In the case of normal requirements, in general, people are expected to meet these as they arise from their household income.The Dublin / Mid-Leinster Area of the Executive has advised that it has received an application in the last week from the person concerned for an exceptional needs payment.  The application will now be examined by the Executive and the person concerned will be notified of the position.

Where a licence is granted, operators are required to perform the services in accordance with the conditions on their licence.  These conditions specify such matters as the timetable and route to be operated and other general matters such as requiring the licensee and or his subcontractors to hold a valid Road Passenger Transport Operators licence (RPTOL) for the duration of the passenger licence, compliance with all lawful orders and regulations relating to vehicles and their roadworthiness, compliance with road traffic requirements and drivers hours.  Any alleged breaches of licences are a matter for the Garda Síochána.Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann are not governed by the Road Transport Act 1932 but by Sections 24 and 25 of the Transport Act 1958 which requires both companies to obtain my approval in advance should the companies wish to operate in competition with an existing licensed service.  Any alleged breach would then be investigated by my Department and the companies would be bound by my decision in the matter.  Separately the question of a breach of competition law by a licensed operator or by Bus Éireann or Dublin Bus may also be a matter for investigation by the Competition Authority.With regard to the Deputy's query about tax certificates, my Department must be satisfied that, before a passenger licence is issued to a bus operator, that the bus operator concerned holds a valid Road Passenger Transport Operators Licence (RPTOL).  In order to meet the criteria for obtaining that licence, the operator has to produce a Tax Clearance/C2 Certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.

The installation of barrier free tolling is a crucial element of the M50 upgrade which is under way at present.

Under this initiative, public bodies and voluntary organisations may sponsor projects at local level.  In the Gaeltacht areas, Údarás na Gaeltachta sponsors 18 such schemes, employing 18 supervisors and approximately 360 participants.I also understand from Údarás na Gaeltachta that supervisors are employed on a contract basis and that no superannuation contributions are made in respect of such contracts.  However, supervisors and participants are made aware that they can partake in pension funds such as PRSA and that Údarás can facilitate this option by deduction of the relevant amount and payment into the relevant pension funds.I have been informed that the person in question has referred his case to the Pensions Ombudsman and that enquiries are ongoing.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the ruling of the Pensions Ombudsman is binding on all parties, subject to the right of appeal and, therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further in the matter.

It is a matter for each Department to respond to issues of funding within their area of responsibility.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has primary responsibility for funding community-based CCTV systems.  Pobal administers the scheme on behalf of that Department.  Additional funding is provided to such projects in RAPID designated areas from the Leverage Fund scheme operated by my Department.  I understand that this group has made an application under the community CCTV scheme administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The area in question is not in the RAPID Programme and will therefore not qualify for additional funding from the Leverage Fund scheme operated by my Department.

Mar shampla, leagtar síos go n-úsáidfear an Ghaeilge a mhéid is féidir nuair a bheidh a fheidhmeanna á gcomhlíonadh ag an Údarás agus thar a cheann (alt 8(1) d'Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta 1979).  Anuas air sin, i ndáil le cúnamh airgid ón Údarás chun críocha tionscail, leagtar síos in ailt 10(7) agus 10(8) d'Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta 1979 (arna chur isteach ag alt 5 d'Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú) (Uimh. 2) 1999) go n-áireofar coinníoll maidir leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus a úsáid a mhéid is féidir mar phríomh-mheán cumarsáide sa tionscal nó sa scéim fostaíochta iomchuí.Dá réir sin, is é an polasaí atá ag an Údarás coinníollacha maidir leis an nGaeilge a chur san áireamh ina chuid comhaontuithe deontais agus béim a chur ar chlár nó plean forbartha teanga atá aontaithe idir an tÚdarás agus na tionscadail sin.  Maidir leis na coinníollacha fostaíochta, mar shampla, leagtar síos go dtabharfar tús áite do chainteoirí Gaeilge.  Mura féidir cainteoirí Gaeilge a fháil leis na scileanna cuí, is féidir go mbeadh daoine gan Ghaeilge líofa á bhfostú ach, sa chás sin, cuirtear cúrsaí Gaeilge ar fáil chun cuidiú leo líofacht a bhaint amach sa teanga.  Dar ndóigh, cuireann an tÚdarás treoir, comhairle agus tacaíocht ar fáil chun cláir agus pleananna teanga a chur i bhfeidhm i dtionscadail sa Ghaeltacht a dtugann sé cúnamh dóibh.Tugtar tacaíocht freisin do chomharchumainn agus d'eagrais phobalbhunaithe, agus do chomhlachtaí ar nós Comhar Naíonraí na Gaeltachta Teo agus Óige na Gaeltachta Teo.  Mar a bheifí ag súil leis, bíonn na heagrais seo tiomanta go mór do chur chun cinn na Gaeilge ina ngníomhaíochtaí féin.Is mar an gcéanna atá an scéal maidir le haon chúnamh a chuireann mo Roinn féin ar fáil d'eagraíochtaí atá ag saothrú sa Ghaeltacht agus ar na hoileáin Ghaeltachta, d'fhonn tacú leis an nGaeilge féin agus le pobail Ghaeltachta a bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar theanga chumarsáide iontu. Sna cásanna sin uile, bheadh mo Roinnse ag súil leis gur trí Ghaeilge a reachtáilfí gníomhaíochtaí na n-eagraíochtaí sin agus gur cainteoirí Gaeilge a bheadh fostaithe chun na críche sin.Maidir le heagraíochtaí sa Ghaeltacht a bheadh ag fáil tacaíochta ó mo Roinnse ar mhaithe le cuspóirí nach mbaineann go sonrach leis an nGaeilge féin (e.g. forbairt tuaithe), bheifí ag súil leis go ndéanfaí gach iarracht chun gnó na n-eagraíochtaí sin a reachtáil ar bhealach a chinnteodh go mbeadh a gcuid seirbhísí ar fáil trí Ghaeilge. Tá go leor samplaí suntasacha d'eagraíochtaí — Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, mar shampla — a n-éiríonn leo a leithéid a dhéanamh ar bhealach an-éifeachtach.

In addition, RAPID priority status was extended to Ballyfermot in 2006. My Department, with the support of Pobal, has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the RAPID programme. It is a matter for each Department to respond to issues of funding within their area of responsibility.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has primary responsibility for funding community-based CCTV systems.  Pobal administers the scheme on behalf of that Department.  Additional funding is provided to projects in RAPID designated areas from the Leverage Fund scheme operated by my Department.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has confirmed that applications in respect of the named areas have been received.I understand that once Pobal has assessed the applications, recommendations will be made to the Community Based CCTV Project Board before decisions are made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Once decisions are made, the successful applications will qualify for additional support from my Department's leverage funds.

A total of some 150 posts are involved in the move.  It will be a matter for the Office of Public Works to decide how the building in Mespil Road will be used after decentralisation.As a precursor to the move to Knock Airport, 70 posts have been relocated to temporary rented offices at Teeling Street, Tubbercurry, Co. Sligo which opened in July 2006.  To date 9 posts have also relocated to Na Forbacha, Galway.Pobal have assigned 23 posts to Milliner Buildings, Clifden, Co. Galway. As the posts concerned were in respect of new business, all staff except for 1 post were recruited locally and there are no implications for office space currently used in Dublin.Foras na Gaeilge  is based in Merrion Square, Dublin 2. The decentralisation of 30 posts to Gaoth Dobhar is still at the planning stage and no staff have moved as yet.  In the circumstances, it is not possible to say what implications this has for the office space currently in use.

The purpose of the guidance, which will be in effect for the 2007 courses, is to assist householders in meeting their obligations under the Fire Safety Acts 1981 and 2003.While my Department is not responsible for fire safety in Irish Colleges or households, it agreed nonetheless to provide assistance to colleges to employ engineers to survey the households in question so as to identify any works to be carried out and I understand that most of the surveying has been completed. My Department has also introduced a special improvement grant up to a maximum of €20,000 (€25,000 on islands) or 75% of the cost, whichever is the lesser, to assist qualified households in carrying out the necessary improvement works.Householders wishing to provide accommodation to students for the 2007 season will require a certificate from an engineer confirming that the fire safety management measures in place in the household are in substantial compliance with the Guidance Document issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and expressing an opinion that the premises are safe to be used to accommodate students. While I appreciate the concerns of householders in regard to the timeframe available to ensure compliance with the Guidance Document, I understand that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is unwilling to agree to an extension. I remain optimistic that, with the generous assistance available from my Department, householders will be in a position to have any necessary improvement works completed in time for the summer courses and to secure the requisite engineer's certificate.

Applications have been made by 47 persons from outside Bord Bia for positions in Enniscorthy, under the Decentralisation programme, of whom 19 are based in Dublin.Issues relating to the transferability of staff between State agencies and between Civil Service, Public Service and State agencies generally are being examined centrally by the Dept. of Finance who deal with general human resource and industrial relations issues arising from decentralisation.  Bord Bia is not one of the organisations given early mover status under the Government Decentralisation Plan and a precise time frame has not been established.

Where a person's quota is added to the Reserve, it is no longer available to that person.  Milk quota may be restored to the former quota holder, or their successor, on application, if they resume production within two years.A person may sell their quota into the Milk Quota Trading Scheme, but their successor will not have an entitlement to buy it back at some future date.  However, if a successor qualified as a new entrant, they could apply to buy quota from the Trading Scheme in the normal way.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	609	My Department implements a wildlife strategy, which includes the targeted removal of badgers, under licence issued by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government where they are implicated in an outbreak of TB.  Capturing is undertaken in areas where serious outbreaks of Tuberculosis have been identified in cattle herds and where an epidemiological investigation carried out by my Department's Veterinary Inspectorate has found that badgers are the likely source of infection.Most of the operational work involved is carried out by staff from the Farm Relief Service Co-op (FRS) who are closely supervised by staff from my Department. For this, a "stopped restraint" of a type approved under Section 34(2) of the 1976 Wildlife Act is used. During the peak months (spring/early summer and autumn), each FRS staff person lays and monitors between 60-100 restraints and at peak times there may be up to 6,000 restraints on farmland on a given night. My Department does not have precise figures in relation to the number of restraints set annually. All restraints are checked daily to ensure trapped animals do not suffer any unavoidable trauma.  Captured badgers are humanely euthanised.The landowner's permission is first obtained and landowners adjacent to where capturing operations are ongoing are similarly notified before restraints are set.  This ensures that farmed livestock are grazed elsewhere and minimises the risk that domestic animals become accidentally trapped.The level of non-badger capture is very low and Department staff report 6-8 captures of dogs per year in each county.  No complaints have been received by staff of my Department in relation to these captures.  Any domestic animals including dogs captured are released unharmed during the morning inspections.  Dog owners have a responsibility to confine their animals at night, as dogs should not be roaming freely due to the threats they pose to sheep.My Department is committed to a research project with UCD on the development of a vaccine for use in badgers that would lead to a reduction in the current high levels of TB infection in that species.  It is hoped that this strategy will in the long term reduce the need to cull TB infected badgers as tuberculosis levels falls in both cattle and badgers.  However, any vaccine will not be available for wider use in the immediate future and the existing strategy will remain in place for some time.My Department is satisfied that its current badger removal policy is justified and has contributed to the decline in the number of TB reactors and the costs associated with bovine TB.

The European Commission have expressed the gravest concern at any further planting within these areas until it is possible to fully assess the impact of forestry on the species.In order to do that, it is necessary to work out what type of management regime needs to be put in place to accommodate both forestry and the hen-harrier in the areas being proposed as Special Protection Areas.  To this end, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has established a working group, on which the forestry and farming interests are represented, as well as my Department, to help with the development of such a management regime.  The work of this group has been ongoing for some time and I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to bring matters to  an early conclusion.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	617	My Department is committed to ensuring the maximum level of integration of farm inspections across all areas including inspections for farmers participating in the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme. On this basis, the overall number of annual inspections associated with the Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is unlikely to exceed 8,000.  This is a very significant reduction from the 18,000 inspections annually under the old coupled regime.My Department is carrying out a full review of the inspection arrangements for the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme before finalising the report forms and checklists for 2007.  The review will also involve consultation with the farm bodies and this process will commence as soon as possible.My Department is in regular contact with the European Commission with a view to simplification of Single Payment Scheme requirements with particular reference to advance notice of inspections and tolerances.  I believe that the initiative by the Commission on simplification of the CAP and the review of cross-compliance, which is under way, provides the opportunity for a fresh look at cross-compliance and other Single Payment Scheme issues.  I am certainly pressing for this both in direct contact with Commissioner Fischer Boel and the President of the Council, Minister Seehofer.  I raised the matter at the Council recently where several member States had similar problems to ours.  It is not surprising then that simplification of the CAP and the cross-compliance regime in particular are core issues for the current German Presidency of the EU.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	620	The EU Petitions Committee wrote to my Department requesting details of the implementation of the recommendations made in the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture.  This report on the Early Retirement Schemes was published in February 2005.  The report dealt with a range of issues and I responded to it in detail in September 2005.  As I explained in my response, certain of the Committee's recommendations were precluded by the EU Regulations under which the Scheme and its predecessor were operated.I saw some merit in other aspects of the Committee's report, specifically those relating to income limits and in line with the Joint Committee's recommendations, I increased the off-farm income limit for transferees in the Scheme from €25,400 to €40,000 and abolished the income limit for transferors with effect from 1 September 2006.The Committee paid particular attention to two further issues.  One was the implication of decoupling for retired farmers who had leased out land and quota to transferees before or during the Single Payment Scheme reference period.  I believe we secured the best deal that we could for people in this situation, in spite of the reluctance of the Commission at the outset.  A specific mandatory category was included in the National Reserve arrangements under the Single Payment Scheme.  This category caters for farmers who inherited or otherwise received a holding free of charge or for a nominal amount from a farmer who retired or died before 16 May 2005 where the land in question was leased out to a third party during the reference period.  Under these arrangements, where a farm reverted to the retired farmer at the end of a lease without any entitlements, the farmer taking it over will have access to the National Reserve.  Retired farmers in the Early Retirement Scheme who farmed during part or all of the reference period and who held Single Payment entitlements could activate entitlements and lease them to their transferees.  If the transferee did not wish to use the entitlements, a transferor has until 2007 to lease the entitlements with land to another farmer.  Once at least 80% of the entitlements have been used by the lessee, the transferor has the option to sell the entitlements with or without land; otherwise he can continue to lease the entitlements with land.The second issue the Joint Committee focused particularly on was the levels of payment under the two Schemes.  In the course of discussions on this issue, the European Commission had pointed out that the rate in the earlier Scheme was set at the maximum amount for co-funding that the Regulation allowed, and that it would not be possible to secure co-funding for an increase in the rate of pension for existing participants in the 2000–2006 Scheme.  The Commission, however, agreed to increases for existing participants in both schemes, funded entirely from the national exchequer as a State aid.  I therefore announced substantial increases in the maximum pension rates payable under both Schemes which took effect from 1 November 2006.  I increased the maximum pension rate payable under the 1994–99 Scheme from €12,075 to €14,075 per annum and the maximum pension rate payable under the 2000–2006 Scheme from €13,515 to €15,000 per annum.  These increases will cost some €33 million extra over the remaining period of the two Schemes, and over 5,000 retired farmers will benefit from them.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	623	This situation relates to the implementation of the EU Wild Birds Directive and as such it is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  He has designated the Owenduff-Nephin Beg area of County Mayo, which includes the area in question, under both the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives.The European Commission secured a Judgement against Ireland in the European Court of Justice in June 2002.  The case, which was focused by the Commission on the Owenduff-Nephin Beg area, was taken under the Wild Birds Directive and was about the extent to which the habitat of the Red Grouse, an "Annexed" species under that Directive, was compromised by the overgrazing of sheep on commonage.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government were the lead Department in responding to the Court proceedings.Following the Court Judgement against Ireland, a reassessment of the commonage took place.  This showed that the actions that had been taken to deal with the overgrazing, which involved partial destocking in 2002 under the Commonage Framework Plans, had not been enough to allow the habitat to regenerate.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was required to take further steps if Ireland was to avoid a large fine.  His officials notified the European Commission and the farmers on the commonage of a requirement to take all sheep off the commonage for five months a year, made up of the months of November and December and the period from mid-February to mid-May.  This arrangement took effect from 1 November 2006.  Generous financial arrangements were put in place by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for those farmers participating in the NPWS scheme and the REP scheme in the Owenduff-Nephin Beg area to compensate them for meeting these increased environmental standards.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	625	Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  There are now 4,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.  Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment).  In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.

The nature and level of support provided is based on the assessed needs of the individual child having regard to the criteria set out in my Department's circulars and the other resources available to these pupils within the school.The NCSE has advised my Department that the SNA post in question was discontinued following the departure from the school of the pupil for whom the SNA allocation was made.  There are currently no other pupils in the class who meet the criteria for SNA support.  My Department has provided grant assistance to the school in question to facilitate the employment of a part-time teacher to assist the pupils that require English language support.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	629	As part of the primary school curriculum Irish is a compulsory subject.Exemption from the study of Irish may, however, be granted to primary pupils under certain circumstances as outlined in Department Circular 12/96.  A condition for the granting of an exemption to a pupil with a specific or general learning difficulty is that evidence of such a disability must be furnished by a qualified psychologist.There is however no provision in the Department's circular for the automatic granting of exemptions to pupils on foot of a recommendation in a psychologist's report.  Under the terms of the Circular delegated authority to grant exemptions from Irish, within the conditions laid down, has been vested in the individual school authority.With regard to the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the position is that the school concerned determined that the pupil in question did not satisfy the requirements of Circular 12/96 and turned down the application for exemption from Irish.  Following consideration of representations received in the matter, the case was reviewed by my Department who took into account the details of the reports submitted, but concluded that the severity of difficulty for the pupil in question is not adequate to merit an exemption from the study of Irish.  In accordance with this decision the school has been informed that the pupil in question is required to participate fully in Irish classes.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	634	As I advised the Deputy on 12th December 2006, I recently announced a series of measures to assist primary school principals with particularly significant levels of non-teaching duties.The new measures include that when a school with a Principal and four or more mainstream class teachers also has a specialist autism unit, established under approval of the National Council for Special Education, the Principal will be appointed on an administrative basis. An autism unit is defined as two differentiated autism classes and provision for younger children with autism i.e. a total capacity for 12-18 children with autism.The new measures also provide for the allocation of additional teachers to allow a Deputy Principal in mainstream schools that, in addition to their ordinary mainstream class teachers, also have five or more special classes for children with the more complex, low incidence, special needs, to operate as Administrative Deputy Principal.The reference to a unit in my announcement relates to autistic provision only.  I am satisfied that this measure will provide much needed support to schools to facilitate the establishment of special classes for children with special educational needs.

Kerry in the current academic year.The Deputy will, of course, be aware that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.I was pleased to announce recently in this connection my intention to expand the number of NEPS psychologists by a further 31 in 2007.  At this time 6 of these psychologists are in the process of being appointed and officials of my Department will shortly engage in discussions with the Public Appointments Commission with a view to recruiting the remaining complement as expeditiously as possible within 2007. Decisions in relation to the actual placement of the extra psychologists will be made in the context of existing and developing priorities for the National Education Psychological Service.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	640	I propose to take Questions Nos. 482 and 488 together.I am conscious of the fact that Lucan is one of the fastest growing areas in the Country. In light of this, the  Department has expanded capacity significantly at both primary and post primary level to cater for existing and newly emerging demands for pupil places. With regard to post primary capacity specifically, a new school for Coláiste Cois Life was recently completed.  This will provide places for 600 pupils, some 400 additional places relative to its then existing capacity.In addition to this, capacity at Coláiste Phádraig was  increased by 300 pupil places with the completion of a major extension project at that school. A further extension project at St. Joseph's College to provide an overall capacity of 725 pupil places has also been completed. This is deemed sufficient to meet demand from pupils in its catchment area. In addition, Lucan Community College is to receive a design team shortly to provide additional accommodation to increase its overall capacity to 1000 pupils.The Deputy will probably be aware that there is considerable vacant capacity at post primary level in areas adjacent to Lucan. Given that it is practice, particularly in Dublin, for post-primary students to travel some distance to attend a post-primary school, it is not unreasonable that the Department should seek to optimise the use of existing surplus capacity at post-primary schools in the general vicinity of Lucan as part of its strategy to address any shortfall for post-primary places that may emerge.The Department will continue to monitor the situation in Lucan to ensure that any future emerging needs are addressed in a timely manner.

The acquisition of a site for this development is being actively pursued.  When this matter has been finalised, progress on the proposed project can be considered under the School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	642	Improving services for children with special needs has been and continues to be a major priority for this Government. Major progress has been made in recent years.  Indeed, there are now 15,000 adults in our schools working solely with children with special needs, compared to just a fraction of this a few years back.As well as providing for huge increases in staff, we have also improved the procedures for accessing extra support. A guaranteed allocation of resource teaching hours has been given to all primary schools, replacing the need for an individual assessment for every single child. And we have put a team of 80 local Special Educational Needs Organisers on the ground to work with parents and teachers and help them to get the appropriate support for their children.Further improvements in services are on the way, with the roll-out of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. Over €820 million is being provided for special education in 2007- €180 million, or nearly 30%, more than what was provided in the 2006 Estimates. A number of families have taken court proceedings against myself, as Minister for Education, and others, in respect of educational provision for children with special needs.  It is, I think, fair to say that the parents involved are, generally, seeking a particular form of provision for their child. The State makes every effort to reach an agreement with the parents while having regard to their genuine concerns and wishes, Government policy, the best interests of the child and the expert advice available to it. In the last six years, only three cases have gone as far as being ruled upon by the Courts, all of which the State successfully defended. Judgment of the High Court is currently awaited in a fourth case.Obviously I would prefer to use all the resources available to me for the provision of educational services. However, once a case has been brought, the State is entitled to defend the case, particularly when it has a different view of how the best interests of the child can be met within its constitutional and statutory obligations.In 2006, my Department paid contributions towards the legal costs of the plaintiffs in special education cases of approximately €621,000. To date in 2007 payments for such legal costs by my Department amount to approximately €3,000.In addition, in 2006, my Department made ex gratia payments in connection with the settlement of these cases of approximately €152,000 and approximately €13,500 to date in 2007.Furthermore, my Department uses private and independent psychological advice in defending such cases and advising on educational provision in relation to the children involved, and engages Counsel to aid with complex Discovery requests. In 2006 these payments amounted to approximately €241,000 and in 2007 to date approximately €21,000.The above payments do not refer exactly to those cases settled in that period, as payments are often made some time after settlement. Neither do the payments include the legal costs of the State itself in defending the proceedings, as these are borne by the Chief State Solicitors Office.The number of these cases taken against the State is showing a downward trend and I believe that the establishment of the National Council for Special Education will further assist in the reduction in litigation by providing through its Special Educational Needs Organisers, a more focused and local response to individual needs. In addition, with the phased implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, parents who believe their child's needs are not being met will have a process of mediation and appeals open to them. These are likely to prove more appropriate, and less costly, fora for the resolution of these issues, in the future.Many of the cases taken against my Department over the years have related to provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders. The Government has attached a major priority to improving services for such children. There are currently 181 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstreams schools — 16 preschool classes — 5 special classes for children with Asperger's syndrome — 14 stand alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis. Two of these facilities have yet to be established.I wish to assure the Deputy that I am determined to improve services for children with special needs even further and that this will continue to be a priority for me.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	643	The person in question has sought to have an institution in which she was resident as a child included in the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 for the purposes of making an application to the Redress Board. Section 4 of the Act provides that the Minister for Education and Science may, by order, insert additional institutions in the Schedule to the Act. For an institution to be considered under Section 4, it must be an industrial school, a reformatory school, an orphanage, a children's home, a special school for children with a physical or intellectual disability or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability or mental illness. It must also be one in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.The institution in this case is the Regina Coeli Hostel which provided shelter for homeless women, mothers with young children and expectant mothers. However, as such hostel facilities do not come within the scope of Section 4 of the Act, it is not open to me to consider the inclusion of this institution in the Schedule. The closing date for receipt of applications by the Redress Board has now passed and the question of including additional institutions has been fully considered by my Department in consultation with relevant Government Departments. It is not proposed to add any further institutions to the Schedule.Officials of my Department have previously met the person and explained the position to her.  The person was also resident in an institution which is included in the Schedule to the Redress Act and it was indicated to her prior to the closing date for applications to the Redress Board that it was open to her to make an application to the Board based on her experience in that institution.Department officials are available for a further meeting with the person and her legal representatives if this would help the situation.

As a rule primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 2.4 kilometres to travel to a pick-up point. The father of the pupil in question has advised that he lives 50 metres from the pick-up point.Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the School Transport Scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.All applications for transport on medical grounds are sent to my Department's medical advisor for approval.  In this case the application was returned by the medical advisor, stating that the application was not approved.Based on the medical evidence received, my Department is not in a position to provide a home pick-up to cater for the pupil referred to by the Deputy.

DEIS will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.As a result of the identification and review process, 873 schools have been included under the DEIS action plan. These comprise 670 primary schools and 203 second-level schools. While the school to which the Deputy refers has not been identified for inclusion in DEIS, it has retained the additional financial resources it had under pre-existing schemes for addressing disadvantage for the current school year.  This includes financial support as an alternative to teacher/coordinator support which is provided for schools that are isolated from other similar schools and hence cannot be clustered.  Accordingly an unclusterable grant was lodged to the school's bank account on 17 November 2006.Schools which have not qualified for inclusion in DEIS, and which are receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes for addressing disadvantage, can be assured that they will continue to get support to enable them to maintain services for their disadvantaged pupils.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	650	I propose to take Questions Nos. 494 to 496, inclusive, together.Information in relation to class size is provided by the annual census of primary schools. The census for the current school-year (2006/07) is currently being worked on and data are not yet available. Data at sub-county area are not generally available due to the inordinate amount of work involved.  Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  There are now 4,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.  Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.  A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.  I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	651	As the Deputy is aware, I indicated at the conference of the Irish Primary Principals Network on 26th January, 2007 that the two teacher rule and the two-year rule will no longer apply.The Deputy will also be aware that recently I announced the schools which are to benefit from the 200 extra language support posts provided for in the 2007 Estimates.  These extra 200 posts will bring the total number of language support teachers in our schools to 1,450. These new resources are intended for schools with large numbers of pupils who do not have English as a first language.  Under the revised arrangements, depending on the number of eligible pupils enrolled, schools may now have up to six language support teachers.The additional 200 teachers are part of the Government's commitment in Towards  2016 to provide an extra 550 language support teachers by 2009 and to reform the limit of two teachers per school. It is intended that a further 350 language support teachers will be provided between 2008 and 2009.Under current arrangements, the additional language support to an individual pupil is generally given for a period of two years. However, it is accepted that children have different levels of language and different levels of aptitude for language learning.In order to ensure that schools can accurately and objectively assess the language requirement of children, my Department will be sending to schools assessment materials which have been developed by Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT). The assessment materials will enable schools to ensure that the specific language requirements of children needing support are met in a targeted way.  The IILT materials will also enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of the child and his or her need for continued language support.

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.An educational placement is available for the person referred to by the Deputy and she therefore does not qualify for home tuition under the terms of the scheme. My officials have conveyed this information to the family.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	653	Appropriate classroom equipment is provided as part of extension/refurbishment projects and new school buildings funded by my Department. Under the furniture and equipment element of my Departments School Building and Modernisation Programme funding is available for the provision of additional equipment at developing schools or the replacement of outdated/damaged equipment. A special PE funding package, of €6.5 million, issued late last year to all 3,200 primary schools. Under the package, every school received €2,000 towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment in their school. This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc. The modern equipment which can be purchased will help facilitate PE and sporting activities in schools, which everyone recognises is a very important aspect of school life.This funding package was made as part of this Government's continued commitment to modernise facilities in schools throughout the country. I expect to announce a PE equipment grant for post-primary schools in the coming months.In addition, since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to all primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.I increased the level of grant payable under the annual devolved grant scheme for minor works to national schools last November. All primary schools with full recognition receive a basic grant of €5,500 plus €18.50 per mainstream pupil and €74 per special needs pupil. This grant is intended to address works required to the physical infrastructure of the schools or on items of furniture and equipment for educational use, including IT related equipment. Around €27m was paid out to primary schools throughout the country to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.Primary schools that establish a class for special needs pupils receive a once-off grant of €6,500 per class to purchase equipment, including physical education equipment, that they feel best meets the needs of the pupils attending the class.I would also point out that schools may use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula including Physical Education. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €163.58 from 1st January 2007.Second-level schools have also benefited from substantial increases in funding for their day-to-day costs. The standard capitation grant of €266 per pupil in 2003 has been increased to €316 per pupil since the 1st January 2007. The support services grant for secondary schools has been increased from €127 per pupil in 2003 to €159 per pupil in 2006 and from 1 January 2007 the grant was increased by a further €30 per student to €189 per pupil. Grants are provided to second level schools to enable the purchase of equipment to facilitate the introduction of new/revised curricula such as Design and Communication Graphics and Leaving Certificate Technology. Grant aid is also being provided to replace old equipment with a view to improving health and safety in wood and technology rooms.

In this context, to address the demand for autism-specific education in the area in question, my Department sanctioned a special early intervention class for younger children on the autistic spectrum in the school in question.My Department is of the view that children with autism, in common with all children should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where children have greatest opportunity to mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration. My Department's ongoing commitment is to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders, receive an education appropriate to their needs. In this regard my Department has established:181 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools.5 special classes for children with Asperger's Syndrome.16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum, which includes the class referred to by the Deputy.14 Stand alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodologies on a pilot basis — 2 of these facilities have yet to be established.A separate application from the group referred to by the Deputy is under consideration for inclusion in the above mentioned pilot scheme.

Provision of accommodation to cater for these additional teachers would cost an estimated €750 million.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	673	Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 4,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc. Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school. Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.  The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	675	A Battlegroup is simply another vehicle under which the Defence Forces may participate in UN mandated peace support operations and humanitarian tasks.  As such, the current standing arrangements for the selection of members of the Defence Forces to participate in overseas peace support missions will continue to apply.While all members of the Permanent Defence Force are liable for overseas service, subject to the provisions of the Defence Acts, the despatch of any personnel on overseas missions, including peace support operations, is undertaken, as far as possible, on a voluntary basis.  However, from time to time it is necessary to detail persons for overseas service, mainly in areas where specific technical skills are in short supply.  The Government's policy of continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces has resulted in recent times in a significant increase in the number of volunteers for overseas service and the requirement to detail personnel is very much the exception.  The Defence (Amendment) Act, 2006 retained the provision of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, that personnel who enlisted prior to the enactment of that Act, cannot be detailed to serve on UN mandated operations other than operations which are of a police character.  However, such personnel may volunteer for service on UN missions, which are not of a police character.The criteria for selection of volunteers for overseas service are broadly as follows:(i) Competence and suitability.(ii) Professional expertise.(iii) Recommendations from reporting officers.(iv) Seniority.(v) Health and age.(vi) Family and social considerations.In relation to the Nordic Battlegroup, the plan is to contribute between 80 to 100 personnel to this Battlegroup.  Ireland's contribution will be an Explosive Ordnance and Improvised Explosive Device Disposal Team together with an Engineer Search Team, a protection detail and some staff officers.  The process of personnel selection for the contingent has recently commenced, with the Western Brigade providing the major element of the contingent.

All enlisted personnel are entitled to medical care at the Department of Defence expense.The Defence Forces supply medical care to all members of the Permanent Defence Force, either directly from Permanent Defence Force Medical Corps resources, or by appropriate referral to civilian facilities.  Accordingly, the Medical Corps maintains full awareness of the medical status of each member.  In the case of members who are on sick leave for a sustained period of time, their medical status is reviewed regularly, and the progress of their treatment, whether supplied directly by the Medical Corps or by way of referral, is monitored.Defence Force Regulations provide for formal "Boarding" by a military Medical Board in cases where the sick leave of an enlisted man exceeds 90 calendar days in any period of twelve months.  Furthermore, enlisted personnel may be referred to a Medical Board in cases where a Medical Officer is of the opinion that a disability or illness is likely to be of a permanent or protracted nature, preventing performance of military duties. It is also provided that cases of frequent or recurrent sick leave will lead to referral to a Medical Board.The Medical Board is charged with determining whether:(a) The soldier is fit for duty, or(b) A further period of sick leave or treatment is likely to render him/her fit for duty, or(c) He/she is unfit for further service in the Permanent Defence Force.The Medical Corps endeavours to provide a first class health care system at home and overseas and to promote and sustain adequate levels of health and fitness of Defence Forces personnel in order to support the Defence Forces in the execution of their assigned roles.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	682	The recent meeting of the EU Environment Council dealt most importantly with climate change issues.  Conclusions were adopted on the EU objectives for the further development of the international climate regime beyond 2012.Council confirmed the EU's willingness to commit to a 30% reduction in emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 provided that other developed countries commit to similar reductions and the more advanced developing countries contribute according to their capabilities. The Council also agreed that the EU should unilaterally commit to a 20% reduction in emissions by 2020 until such an agreement is concluded. These conclusions form part of the Environment Council's contribution to the Spring European Council.There were policy debates at Council on the inclusion of aviation emissions in the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme and on the need to make legislative provision for the reduction of CO2 emissions from cars.  There was a general welcome for the initiatives and more work will now be done on the detail. Council adopted conclusions incorporating the Environment Council's contribution to the Spring European Council.  Thesereiterated the important contribution of eco-innovation to the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs,underlined the importance of mutually supportive EU climate change and energy strategies, setting out an ambitious agenda for actions to combat climate change and including recommendations on energy that reflect the conclusions of the Energy Council held on 15 February 2007, andstressed that the Better Regulation initiative should continue to achieve high quality, regulation with ambitious objectives and standards that promotes a high level of protection and improvement in the quality of the environment.Council adopted conclusions on the Thematic Strategy for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, welcoming the strategy and the fact that the Commission has proposed a comprehensive legal framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides.   There was also an initial policy debate on the Thematic Strategy for soil protection and the related proposal for a framework Directive for soil protection.Council adopted a decision, by qualified majority, to reject a proposal from the Commission for a Council decision to overturn a Hungarian national ban on the use and sale of an approved genetically modified maize labelled MON 810.   It failed to reach a qualified majority decision on a proposal for the placing on the market of the so-called Moonlite Carnation, genetically modified for flower colour.  In line with agreed arrangements in such a situation it will now be for the Commission to take a decision on this matter.

We are committed to updating these standards every five years in accordance with the requirements of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. (2002/91/EC).This Government has improved the energy performance of buildings three times since 1997. The next phase of this programme provides for upgrading of standards under Part L which will come into effect in 2008. I have directed my Department to bring forward proposals that will improve energy efficiency of new Irish homes by 40% relative to current standards. Once adopted, the Regulations will apply nationally.The approach adopted by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in regard to energy efficiency in housing schemes of more than 10 houses, will be useful in the review of the existing standards, details of which I propose to announce as part of Ireland's Climate Change Strategy.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	688	The UK's nuclear power programme, announced in 1955, called for 5,000 megawatts of generating capacity through the construction of a series of Magnox reactors across the country. The fuel used in Magnox nuclear reactors consists of natural uranium encased in magnesium alloy.In May 2000 BNFL announced the planned closure dates for its then remaining Magnox reactors. Following a number of safety-related incidents at both the Calder Hall and Chapelcross reactors, the closure dates for these reactors were brought forward as their continued operation could not be justified economically. The UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges 2010-2020 (DEFRA, 2002) also brought forward the closure dates for the Oldbury and Wylfa reactors.Currently, there remain two operating Magnox reactors in the UK at Oldbury and Wylfa both located on the west coast of the United Kingdom close to the Irish Sea. Closure dates for these reactors are 2008 and 2010 respectively. The UK Authorities advise that all nuclear installations including the Magnox reactors are subject to strict regulatory and safety oversight by the independent nuclear regulatory body, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII). In accordance with the enhanced co-operation arrangements currently in place between the UK and Ireland on nuclear issues, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) visited the Wylfa nuclear plant in September last and a detailed report of the visit is being prepared for publication.Details of the location and the operating status of the Magnox reactors in the UK are set out in the Report of the RPII Visit to BNFL Sellafield published in April 2005 and can be accessed on the website of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland at www.rpii.ie.

In general the Government welcomes the proposal, accepts that it is appropriate to have an EU-wide initiative, but that given the diverse nature and conditions of soils in Member States, policies should be flexible and adaptable.  While the Commission's Impact Assessment of the proposal outlines, among other issues, the possible costs across the EU the analysis of the cost implications for Ireland has not yet been completed.The legal basis for the proposed directive is article 175 of the Treaty and the Council would make a decision on it acting by qualified majority.

Section 34(1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that planning authorities may attach conditions to a grant of planning permission.   The applicant may also make an appeal to An Bord Pleanála against a condition or conditions attached to the decision of a planning authority to make a grant of permission.Under section 30 of the 2000 Act, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, is generally precluded from exercising influence or control in relation to any individual case.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	696	Under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003, primary responsibility for management and enforcement responses to litter problems including defacement by graffiti lies with local authorities. I am satisfied that enforcement powers and penalties under existing legislation are adequate. Sections 19 and 20 of the 1997 Act empower local authorities to take action in relation to incidents of graffiti and, as necessary, to remove or otherwise remedy the defacement.  Penalties under the Litter Acts range from an on-the-spot fine of €125, to a fine on summary conviction not exceeding €3,000 and on indictment, a fine not exceeding €130,000.In addition to the Litter Pollution Acts, the Criminal Damage Act, 1991 provides for the offences of damaging or defacing property.  The Garda authorities take the defacing of and damage to property very seriously.  When Gardaí detect such offences, culprits are processed through the courts, or via the Juvenile Liaison System, as appropriate.In 2006 the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in consultation with my Department and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, initiated a pilot project, the GRO (Graffiti Removal Operation) Initiative, aimed specifically at combating graffiti in Dublin City, Galway City and Bray, Co. Wicklow. This project is separate from, and in addition to, the graffiti abatement programmes carried out on an ongoing basis by local authorities.The GRO Initiative involves an initial major clean up of the worst affected sites in the pilot areas, followed by a rapid response cleaning maintenance programme aimed at maintaining sites free of graffiti. To date all sites in RAPID areas have been addressed and significant cleaning works have already been completed. Sites, which are affected by graffiti outside RAPID areas, are currently being surveyed with a view to extending the GRO Initiative to these areas.The pilot project is overseen by a steering group comprising representatives from the three Departments and an independent evaluation of the programme has been commissioned in order to determine its effectiveness.  Any extension of the programme to other areas would, in the first instance, be a matter for the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform.

In addition, measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are in place for a number of economic sectors and all relevant Government Departments have a role to play in policy development and in the achievement of Ireland's Kyoto Protocol commitments.Against this background, there is no proposal to appoint a special advisor or to seek the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for climate change issues.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	699	Brú na Bóinne is an archaeological landscape of world importance, as recognised by its UNESCO World Heritage Status which it shares, for example, with such famous sites as the Taj Mahal and Machu Pichu. The archaeological landscape of Brú na Boinne  covers some 3,300 hectares and contains many outstanding archaeological features, notably its megalithic art, the large and varied grouping of monuments and evidence of continuous settlement and activity in the area for some 7,000 years. The UNESCO listing obliges the State to protect the area to the highest international standards. The protection afforded includes restrictions on developments which would affect the views to and from the site, given the importance of this site to the Irish people as a whole, and indeed, its world wide significance.The site is visited annually by over 220,000 people. My Department has responsibility for policy issues while the day to day management of the site is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.In recognition of the importance of the site, a Management Plan was drawn up by a multi-disciplinary team of archaeologists, conservation architects, administrators and guide service and was put out to public consultation. The Plan provides information on various aspects of the management policy of Brú na Boinne including its conservation and presentation, visitor management, legislative protections which it enjoys and development considerations necessary to protect the site. The Public were consulted in the drafting of the Plan which was published in late 2002. It will be reviewed in the current year.Following the publication of the Management Plan, a Consultative Committee was established in accordance with Action 29 of the Plan. It represents local interests as well as Meath County Council, local tourism, my Department and the OPW and is chaired by a local interest representative. This committee's main brief is to assist the implementation of the Plan. I understand that officials of either my Department or OPW, or both, attended most of the meetings called and notified to them by the Chairperson/Secretary of the committee.Senior officials of my Department and OPW meet frequently on a range of issues where there is cross Departmental responsibility. In keeping with this practice, a number of meetings were held to monitor and review progress in relation to the various actions outlined in the Brú na Boinne Management Plan with a view to progressing as many of these actions as possible during its lifetime. I understand that considerable progress has been made with regard to implementing the actions outlined. As part of the proposed review referred to above, all actions contained in the Plan will be examined.The Meath County Development Plan was circulated to my Department in the normal way last year. In addition to the usual examination of such plans, the sections referring to the protection to be afforded the Brú na Boinne site were reviewed in my Department against the objectives of the Management Plan. On foot of this review, some additional protections, consistent with those set out in the Management Plan, were recommended. The Department suggested that there was a case for including a policy in the Plan generally restricting new development within the core area of Brú an Boinne to modest works such as small-scale extensions to existing domestic dwellings and for permitting only small scale development in the buffer zone, with appropriate planning.  In the event that the Council wishes to retain Heritage Policy 65 (as set out in the draft Development Plan), the Department considered that it should be strengthened by the inclusion of certain criteria against which to assess development proposals such as that the proposed development should not affect existing views to and from National Monuments and the applicant would be involved locally in full time agriculture and not own land outside the World Heritage Site. My Department's response to the draft Development Plan did not seek to prohibit all development within the core area and buffer zone. The adoption of a Development Plan is a matter for the local elected representatives.The Deputy will be aware that planning permission has been granted for many once off houses in this area, in accordance with the policy that they do not affect the view and amenity which should be enjoyed by all national and international visitors to this very important site.The question of signage is a matter for the local authority. However, in accordance with Action 14 of the Plan, discussions took place involving officials of my Department, the OPW, Meath County Council, local tourist interests and representatives of the Consultative Committee to determine if a revised signage programme could be agreed. My Department wrote to Meath County Council in June 2006 regarding the signage issue and also offered assistance towards the cost of this.Issues relating to the Battle of the Boyne site are a matter for the Office of Public Works, who manage the site on a day to day basis.

Of this €4.8 million was allocated to the southern HSE region, which includes South Tipperary. It is a matter for the HSE to apportion funding within regions.The allocations for 2007 will be determined in the light of the existing level of commitments within HSE regions and the roll out, later this year, of new grant schemes for older people and people with a disability including the Mobility Aids Grants Scheme, the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability and the Scheme of Housing Aid for Older People as announced in the Government statement on housing policy Delivering Homes-Sustaining Communities.The new schemes will be administered by the local authorities and will be more streamlined with greater targeting of those most in need.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	701	Details of the revised housing adaptation grant schemes for older people and people with a disability were announced recently as part of My Department's new housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.  The revised schemes are based on the outcome of the review of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme, which was recently completed within my Department.  The review also incorporated the conditions governing the Essential Repairs Grant scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly scheme.As part of the new conditions, a revised grant scheme to be known as the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability will be introduced.  The scheme will assist in the provision/adaptation of accommodation to meet the needs of people with a disability and is designed to ensure that available funding is targeted at lower income households and those whose accommodation needs are greatest.  The grant will be increased from the current effective maximum of €20,320 to a maximum of €30,000 which may cover up to 95% of the cost of works.  Prioritisation of eligibility will be on the basis of medical and financial need with 95% of the approved cost of work available to those with annual household incomes of less than €30,000, tapering to 30% for those with annual household incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.The revised scheme will become operational during 2007 and the maximum grant levels will be increased in line with the building cost index on an annual basis thereafter.  I intend to issue detailed administrative guidance in relation to the operation of the new scheme to all local authorities later this year.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	702	My Department is preparing a series of inter-related guidance documents on sustainable urban housing, including a review of the 1999 Residential Density Guidelines for Planning Authorities.  The Residential Density Guidelines support the achievement of high quality residential density at appropriate locations, in conjunction with improved public transport systems and supporting services.The review of the Guidelines currently under way will take account of experiences to date with the 1999 Guidelines, rapidly changing demographics and settlement patterns, the need for more compact urban development (particularly within the Greater Dublin Area) and the on-going policy of delivering sustainable communities and enhancing quality of life.  The revised Guidelines will focus particularly on the quality of new developments, ensuring that urban design focuses on integrating education, transport, amenities, landscaping etc. to support development of sustainable communities.  To help address these issues, a new best practice handbook on urban design and housing layouts has also been commissioned to illustrate how the policies set out in the updated planning guidelines might be implemented, with examples drawn from current practice.My Department is currently drafting revised guidelines, in consultation with a broadly representative and expert steering group, with a view to issuing the guidelines for public consultation later in the year.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	706	I propose to take Questions Nos. 566 and 567 together.It is a matter for each local authority to deal with requests for access to information by a parliamentary representative as expeditiously as possible and in accordance with a proper level of customer service. In this regard local authorities are required to put in place arrangements to ensure that systems, procedures and time frames equivalent to those used by them in relation to correspondence from local authority members also apply in respect of parliamentary representatives.My Department has gathered information from local authorities on the practical application of the arrangements for the supply of specified information to Oireachtas members under the Local Government Act 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations 2003.  Based on the information received, I understand that local authorities are, for the most part, complying with these arrangements.  I am continuing to review this matter in the light of concerns raised by members of the Oireachtas regarding the service they receive in relation to these matters from certain local authorities and, if necessary, will issue supplementary guidance to local authorities reminding them of the need to provide a reasonable level of service for Oireachtas members and facilitate them in carrying out their work on behalf of local communities.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	707	The National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste promotes the reuse of textiles.  In particular it advises householders to bring good quality textiles to charity and second-hand shops and encourages local authorities to accept waste textiles at recycling centres.  There is currently competition between organisations for donations of textiles.  Householders should exercise caution in relation to door-to-door collections of second-hand clothes.  Genuine charities may benefit from such collections but bogus operators may undermine traditional charity shops.A local authority has adequate powers to control such activities if it is of the opinion that a person is collecting waste for the purposes of reward, with a view to profit, or otherwise in the course of business.  Section 34(1) of the Waste Management Act 1996 requires that any such person must obtain a waste collection permit from the relevant local authority.  A waste collection permit is needed for each region in which the person intends to collect waste.  It is a matter for individual local authorities to decide if an individual / business is involved in the collection, transport or storage of waste.  In making their decision, local authorities are guided by the definition of waste which is set down in section 4(1) of the Waste Management Act 1996.Any charitable organisation that wishes to source textiles, either by way of a collection service or by providing bring banks, should discuss the matter in the first instance with the relevant local authority.

The overall development is being undertaken by a private developer and the quality of the development as a whole is subject to the same planning and other controls that apply to apartment developments generally.I am advised by Dublin City Council that they are unaware of any difficulties in relation to the standard of completion of the affordable homes being provided in this development.  However, the Council have indicated that they will be happy to pursue any issues in this regard on receipt of the relevant details.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	710	The Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines for Planning Authorities were published in April 2005.  They endeavour to strike a balance between a good planning framework for rural housing and making it easier for those who are part of, or have links to, local rural communities to build a house.  This, of course, is subject to proposals meeting normal standards in relation to matters such as proper disposal of waste water and road safety.In a circular letter issued in May 2005, planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála were asked to put in place the required procedures and practices to implement the policies set out in Guidelines as quickly and effectively as possible.  Significantly, all planning authorities were requested to take immediate steps to review their development plans to incorporate any necessary changes to ensure that development plan policies are consistent with the policies set out in the Guidelines.  This has been done, with some authorities varying their plans and others incorporating the Guidelines into the reviews of development plans.My Department held two seminars for local authority planning officials on the implementation of the Guidelines. The seminars dealt with the overall objectives of the Guidelines and provided practical advice on the implementation of their core provisions.  While respecting the need to consider each planning application individually and on its own merits, planning officials were advised of the need to ensure that the provisions of the Guidelines are applied consistently and uniformly.My Department also held discussions on the Guidelines with the Planning sub-Committee of the County and City Managers Association.  These discussions focussed on the need to give due regard to the Guidelines in the consideration of planning applications and reflecting the Guidelines in their development plan policies and other cross-cutting functions.The Guidelines are a material consideration both in relation to development plans and in the consideration of planning applications.  The detailed application of the guidelines to particular planning cases is, however, a matter for the planning authority concerned or An Bord Pleanála, as appropriate.

I am not aware of such an undertaking having been given in the terms claimed in the Question.Statutory based arrangements for the supply of specified information to Oireachtas members were established under the Local Government Act 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations 2003. As I have stated on previous occasions, I expect local authorities to provide members of the Oireachtas with access to information in accordance with both the spirit and letter of these regulations.The Deputy will be aware my Department has gathered information from local authorities on the practical application of the arrangements established by the above Regulations.  Based on the information received, I understand that local authorities are, for the most part, complying with these arrangements.  I am continuing to review this matter in the light of concerns raised by members of the Oireachtas regarding the service they receive in relation to these matters from certain local authorities and, if necessary, will issue supplementary guidance to local authorities reminding them of the need to provide a reasonable level of service for Oireachtas members and facilitate them in carrying out their work on behalf of local communities.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	712	Management of public drinking water supplies is generally the responsibility of the local authorities, which have a range of instruments and measures available to them to produce and conserve sufficient stocks to meet anticipated needs and to ensure quality standards.  In addition, my Department coordinates and finances a major programme of investment in improved infrastructure, active leakage control, telemetry and rehabilitation of water mains.  Details of such projects are set out in the Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.The schemes included in the Programme are derived mainly from regular assessments of needs undertaken by local authorities, at my Department's request, as an input to the overall strategy for meeting necessary water supply and treatment requirements.  In carrying their assessments in 2006, my Department asked local authorities to take particular account of: relevant national and EU drinking water quality statutory requirements and standards; the provisions of their Development Plans or draft Development Plans and any strategic regional planning guidelines or local area plans; the National Spatial Strategy; relevant reports and studies, such as the National Water Study, and any relevant studies/reports commissioned locally; the Environmental Protection Agency's reports on the quality of drinking water; the need for continued support for social and economic activity and development; and the need to address infrastructural deficits in small rural towns.The 2006 needs assessments will inform project selection under the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme.  Some €4.7 billion will be spent on water services infrastructure under the new National Development Plan 2007 — 2113, €1 billion more than the unprecedented investment already put in place in this sector under the previous Plan.  Substantial increases in water treatment capacity and improvements in distribution systems are being achieved as a result.  Schemes completed in the period 1997 to 2006 have produced additional drinking water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of some 1.2 million.I am satisfied that the forward planning procedures and resources are in place to ensure that the national water supply infrastructure can cater adequately for current and anticipated requirements.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	713	Emergency preparedness and response is based on a "lead Department" principle, whereby responsibility for specific emergency planning and emergency management functions rests with the relevant State Department and its agencies, where appropriate.  Therefore, there is no single national emergency plan but rather a number of such plans to enable a coordinated response to a variety of major emergency risk scenarios.  For example, in my own Department's case, we have prepared a National Plan for Nuclear Accidents and are currently developing a national framework for response to severe weather incidents to ensure that all existing local severe weather plans are appropriately coordinated and linked. When an emergency occurs, the appropriate major emergency plan is activated with the relevant Department taking the lead in its implementation.  Government structures are in place to support emergency planning at a strategic level and to ensure co-ordination across the various existing national plans.As part of an ongoing focus on major emergency preparedness and response, the Government, in September 2006, published A Framework for Major Emergency Management.  The purpose of the new Framework is to put in place arrangements that will enable the three principal response agencies, namely, An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and the local authorities to coordinate their efforts in the event of a major emergency. The Government put in place a Major Emergency Development Programme to implement these new arrangements.  My Department chairs a National Steering Group to oversee and drive this Programme and to maintain the Framework into the future.I am satisfied that sufficient resources are deployed in the relevant areas in my Department to perform its emergency planning and management role.  The level of resources to be deployed locally is a matter for local authorities.  I have, however, in order to progress the Major Emergency Development Programme, recently approved the engagement by local authorities of an additional 46 staff to support the implementation of the new Framework at local and regional level.  My Department has also engaged, on a secondment basis for the duration of the Programme, 4 full time personnel at senior fire officer level.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-27 00:00:00	Prelude	714	I refer to the reply to Question No. 562 of 20 February 2007.Under the Government's decentralisation programme, a total of 682 Dublin based posts in my Department will be transferred to four locations in the South East: Wexford (270 posts); Waterford (225 posts); New Ross (125 posts) and Kilkenny (62 posts).  My Department's Decentralisation Implementation Plans, which are published on the Department's website at www.environ.ie, outline the sections and the overall numbers which are due to decentralise to the respective locations in the South East.  As outlined in the most recent Progress Report (September 2006) from the Decentralisation Implementation Group, the indicative time scales for the completion of the Department's offices in Wexford, Kilkenny, New Ross and Waterford are Quarter 3 2008, End 2008, Quarter 4 2009 and Quarter 3 2010 respectively.The decentralisation programme also provides that the Local Government Computer Services Board (90 posts) and the National Building Agency (50 posts) are to relocate to Drogheda and Wexford respectively.The addresses of my Department's Dublin based offices and those of the Local Government Computer Services Board and National Building Agency are contained in my Department's Annual Report for 2005, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library and on my Department's website.  As indicated in my Department's Decentralisation Implementation Plans, the disposal of, or alternative use for, the Department's various Dublin offices will be a matter for the Office of Public Works.
