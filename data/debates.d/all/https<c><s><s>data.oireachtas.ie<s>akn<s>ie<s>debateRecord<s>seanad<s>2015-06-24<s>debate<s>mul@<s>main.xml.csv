I raise the issue of the ambulance service in north Connemara, in particular in the Leenane, Maam, Kylemore, Renvyle and Clifden areas. An ambulance crisis steering group was set up in the area due to the concerns that exist and a number of meetings have been held with elected representatives. The group has given two examples to underline the seriousness of the situation. One case related to a young mother who was waiting for more than two hours for an ambulance while haemorrhaging badly a few days after giving birth. A second case related to a serious cardiac patient who presented himself to the doctor at 2.30 p.m. with chest pains. The doctor called an ambulance and it arrived at 4.50 p.m., and the man eventually arrived at the hospital at 6.45 p.m. The response from the National Ambulance Service at a meeting was that the resources are not available to put a workable solution in place. That is totally unacceptable. The group believes the National Ambulance Service, NAS, the Department of Health and the Government have a duty of care towards people and patients in rural areas such as north-west Connemara as much as to people living in other rural areas. We all fully understand living in rural areas creates delays, but we take issue with the often two to three-hour delays in waiting for ambulances to arrive to tend to patients. Their major concern is the waiting time between the call for an ambulance to attend and the arrival of the ambulance at the scene. Although the group has made numerous requests under the Freedom of Information Act for ambulance response times in the area, it appears the National Ambulance Service is reluctant to give the information. That is something I might follow up with the Minister. A follow-up meeting was held with the National Ambulance Service at which various issues were raised and options were explored. It was put to the National Ambulance Service that the current service is totally inadequate with it regularly being the case that people are waiting more than two hours for an ambulance to arrive. That is the norm rather than the exception. In addition, people who are very ill then face a 50 mile or 60 mile journey. We appreciate that air ambulances are available but NAS helicopters cannot fly in darkness and while the Coastguard helicopters are available, they have only limited use. Both types of helicopter need areas in which they can land safely and an ambulance to transfer a patient to the helicopter, which gives rise to issues concerning that particular option. I noted the case of a man who was waiting for a very long time. The ambulance crisis steering group has put forward a number of suggestions. There is a Red Cross ambulance in the area and it has been suggested a rapid response unit could be developed with two fully qualified and salaried paramedics being put in place to cover the area, but that would require the support of the Red Cross, the ambulance of which was purchased through fund-raising activities by the local community. Such an approach would have to work in conjunction with the National Ambulance Service. To date, the National Ambulance Service has not been open to such an option on the basis that the Red Cross ambulance is not up to the same standard as an NAS ambulance. People on the ground, however, say they would prefer a Red Cross ambulance than no ambulance or an ambulance that would take two hours to get to them. This is a very serious issue.It is a remote area of north Connemara. We appreciate resources are tight, but the length of time people must wait for the ambulance service to get to them is completely unacceptable. They need a better response. We need to hear the Government response to this and how it intends to tackle the issue.
#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	2	I thank the Senator for raising this issue. On behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, I am pleased to outline to the House current developments in pre-hospital services, nationally and in Connemara. Before doing so, I apologise on behalf of the Minister for his absence. On behalf of the Government, he is attending a funeral linked to the tragic events in California. The National Ambulance Service is working to ensure high quality and timely emergency pre-hospital care, using all available resources as effectively and efficiently as possible. As with any pre-hospital service, development and modernisation is a continuous process as technology and clinical standards change. A significant and ongoing reform programme has been under way in recent years and it is important to acknowledge the progress being made. The single national control system, with control centres in Dublin and Ballyshannon, is now almost fully operational and is improving control and dispatch performance. The National Ambulance Service continues to develop the intermediate care service which transports non-emergency patients between facilities, allowing emergency vehicles to focus on emergency calls. The intermediate care service now carries three quarters of non-emergency work. We are also moving to more efficient on-duty rostering and developing a national rostering system. The model of service delivery is changing. The National Ambulance Service is moving away from the care model where ambulance services are provided only locally from a fixed ambulance base in that area. It is moving to strategic deployment, with resources used across a region, in order that if demand increases in one area, other resources can provide cover as required. Enhancements to the ambulance service in the west include the introduction earlier this year of 24/7 services in Tuam in Galway and Mulranny in Mayo. Accordingly, in addition to the existing 24/7 coverage for Leenane from Clifden ambulance station, under strategic deployment the new capacity in Tuam and Mulranny stations will provide greater coverage across north Galway and west Mayo in general, including Leenane. Also in 2015, an additional €5.4 million has been provided to improve technology and clinical audit and to address service gaps, particularly in the west. Some 50 additional paramedics are being allocated in the west this year under this process. The emergency aeromedical support service, EAS, is further assisting service provision in the west. It allows swift transfer of seriously ill or injured patients from remoter areas to the most appropriate hospital. Over 1,000 EAS missions have been completed since June 2012. Galway, Mayo and Roscommon have the highest demand for the service. However, as HIQA noted recently, no feasible increase in resources will address all of the access issues in remoter areas. For this reason, the National Ambulance Service is working with communities to develop community first responder groups, local initiatives which provide basic life support in life-threatening situations until an emergency response can arrive. I understand CFR groups in Connemara currently cover Spiddal, Ahascragh, Moylough, Lettermore, Maam, Leenane and Turloughmore. There has been ongoing investment in ambulances services and in their capacity and coverage, including in the west, in the face of some of the most stringent budgetary restrictions ever seen. I assure the House, on behalf of the Minister, that the national ambulance service is as focused as possible on addressing and improving services in the west in 2015.

Would it be possible for the Department to make the information on ambulance response times in this area available to me so that I can pass it on to this group in order that we can undertake an analysis of how serious the situation is in the Leenane, Maam, Kylemore, Renvyle and Clifden areas?

#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	5	I wish to raise an issue I have raised previously in regard to identifying a site in Cork for a new hospital. We have three main hospitals in Cork, the South Infirmary, the Mercy University Hospital and Cork University Hospital. It is accepted that both the Mercy hospital and the South Infirmary have little space to expand to provide additional services and there is a need to identify a new site. A group was set up in 2009-10 to work on this and it presented a report to the Minister. In the context of long-term planning, as we have seen in regard to the new children's hospital, which we have been talking about for over 25 years at this stage, we are still in a situation where we are only seeking planning. I understand it will be at least 2020 by the time that hospital project is completed. There is a similar situation in regard to this issue in Cork. We need to work towards a long-term plan for the health service in Cork. The population of Cork is over 526,000 and Cork is part of the regional hospital structure that includes Waterford, Kerry and south Tipperary and further afield. However, all of the specialist services seem to focus on the Dublin region. We need to identify areas where the existing services can be amalgamated and to work towards building a centre of excellence in the Munster region and Cork is the obvious place for it. In terms of identifying a site, it does not matter whether it is in the docklands, the Blarney area or wherever, but we need long-term planning, and that will mean a plan covering a period of ten to 15 years for delivery. It is in that context that I raise this matter, calling on the Department of Health to accept the need for a new facility in Cork in the next ten to 15 years. The first step towards achieving that is to identify a site and we can then work from there. I am not talking about substantial moneys being spent immediately, but a proposed facility should be part of the overall plan for the health service. It should be accepted that this is essential for the development of the health service in Cork. I call on the Department to come on board with the HSE to identify a site and move forward on this issue.
#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	6	I thank the Senator for raising this issue. Again, I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Health for his absence, as he is attending the funeral of a victim of the tragedy in California. The Minister recently met the chairperson of the non-executive advisory board for reconfiguration of acute hospital services in counties Cork and Kerry to receive the board's final report. This report is the culmination of an extensive and pioneering process. The reconfiguration of acute services in counties Cork and Kerry has led the way for the development of hospital groups and the safer provision of services in smaller hospitals. Like most ground-breaking projects, it has not been an easy process but it has been the right one. It both anticipated and reflected developing concerns about smaller hospitals around the State. In 2010 the report, Reconfiguration of Acute Hospital Services, Cork and Kerry: A Roadmap to Develop an Integrated University Hospital Network, was published following wide consultation. Following the 2009 review of acute services in counties Cork and Kerry by Horwath and Teamwork, the roadmap provided a practical guide for developing safe and sustainable clinical services in the region.The plan involved integrating acute services into one hospital across six campuses. Complex care would be centred in larger facilities, with as much acute care as possible being provided locally. Professor John Higgins was appointed director of reconfiguration and the advisory board, chaired by Mr. Michael O'Flynn, was established. The process has driven unprecedented change in acute care provision in the region. This has been achieved during extremely challenging economic times, with reduced budgets and staff numbers and increased activity levels. A major initiative was making the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital the State's first dedicated elective hospital, in combination with the modernisation and reorganisation of emergency facilities across Cork city from five hospitals to two. The process is not yet complete. Since the roadmap, the south-south west hospital group has been established, in line with the hospital groups report. As the Senator said, the group includes acute services in Cork, Kerry, Waterford and south Tipperary. Therefore, there is now a need to fully integrate acute services in Waterford and south Tipperary into the wider group. The road map recommended a single elective hospital in Cork, amalgamating the Mercy University Hospital and the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, to be built in a modular fashion over ten to 15 years. While the Minister acknowledges the board's recommendation, work needs to be done on assessing options and analysing the cost-benefit of any such project. Regarding site selection, a significant amount of work needs to be done before any concrete plan emerges that would support a rational and sustainable choice of location. The question of site selection would be a matter in the first instance for the south-south west hospital group, with input, as necessary, from HSE estates. The Minister and his Department would not have a direct role in that regard. Regarding capital funding and site acquisition costs, the HSE would need to consider the proposal and prioritise the project in the context of other capital requirements around the country. The Minister and his Department would have no objection to any proposal to undertake an options appraisal for the new hospital, as well as a cost-benefit analysis, as the first steps towards assessing the viability of the proposal.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	7	I thank the Minister of State for the reply and dealing with the matter in detail. I am concerned that the Minister and the Department would not have a direct role. The Minister is the person who develops policy. We are discussing reconfiguring the Mercy University Hospital and the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, which is accepted by everybody. However, we also need to examine the development of specialist services, in regard to which we are focusing on Dublin. The Minister can play a part in policy development. Not all specialist services should be located in the Dublin area. As part of the reconfiguration, we need to consider the development of specialist services for the entire Munster region. The Minister has a part to play in this and I ask that the matter be taken up with him, as I intend to do. The Department can become more proactive in the matter with the HSE. While the HSE is stating it cannot do anything because the Department has not given the go-ahead, the Department is stating it is not its problem, given that it is up to the HSE to come back to it. The Department should indicate to the HSE that it needs to progress the matter and that it will give serious consideration to what it states. The reply does not seem to indicate this, rather it seems to pass the matter back to the HSE. There is a need for clarification in the matter.
#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	8	As the Senator said, the Minister is clear that, in the first instance, it is for the HSE to identify sites. I have been involved in the issue, on which I have met the HSE and local doctors. Contrary to the view the Senator has taken from the response, the crucial element is that the Minister and his Department have no objection to any proposal to undertake an options appraisal, which seems to be very reasonable to start the process, as well as a cost-benefit analysis. These are obvious and realistic first steps towards assessing the viability of the proposal. A cost-benefit analysis would almost certainly confirm the Senator's view of needs and requirements in the southern region. Not all specialised services are to be located in the Dublin area, as the Senator suggested. On the contrary, there is a strong commitment to the provision of services, particularly in the second most densely populated area of the State. The Minister, in making the point that, in the first instance, it is not a matter for the Department, leaves an obvious route for local engagement for the HSE and the group in the southern region to pursue with him his support for a cost-benefit analysis and an appraisal of the options for the location of a new hospital.

I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 19 be taken before No. 1. Many colleagues across the House have discussed this issue. No one could agree that it is right or proper that a Government agency, Tusla, has cut funding for Rape Crisis Network Ireland and is seeking to introduce quite stringent changes regarding how rape crisis centres operate. According to what the rape crisis centres and Rape Crisis Network Ireland are stating, the agency is seeking to change the manner in which they do their job. All of us agree that the statistics are shocking. One in five girls and one in six boys in Ireland has been a victim of sexual abuse. In a modern society and republic where we care about our citizens, particularly the most vulnerable and those who have suffered from sexual abuse - the statistics do not lie - it is just wrong for a Government to stand over a decision to cut the funding of Rape Crisis Network Ireland. My motion, which I have signed on behalf of my group, along with colleagues in the Independent benches, whom I thank in this regard, will allow the Seanad to state it does not agree with the cut in funding for Rape Crisis Network Ireland. We should speak with one voice on this. I ask the Leader to amend the Order of Business to take No. 19 taken before No. 1 and to accept the motion. I will be pushing the matter to a vote. I ask the Leader to assert the independence of the Seanad as a democratically elected arm of the Oireachtas.

One would think I would get it right at this stage, having been here for four years, but I am still learning. Every day is a schoolday.It is a very serious issue and we should not stand over cuts to Rape Crisis Network Ireland. Many Senators from across the House have put their names to this motion and I thank them for doing so. The Leader should accept it.  I looked back at my file and saw that I had been raising the issue of the MS drug Fampyra since February 2014. I have been writing back and forth to the Minister for Health and to the previous Minister and have raised the issue on numerous occasions in this House, as have Senators Gerard P. Craughwell and Sean D. Barrett. Other Members of this House, including my colleagues, have raised it. After 18 months or more of raising this issue, Fampyra is not available to 3,000 MS sufferers who benefit from this drug. This is a drug that improves people's mobility and has allowed people to go back to work. It costs approximately €270 per month. The Leader has given responses before, that had been given to him by the Department of Health stating it was assessing the situation and the drugs company was going to send in another submission, which it has already done. That goes back to April and May 2015. We marked world MS day on 27 May. The day is about access to drugs and how we can improve the quality of life of people with MS, yet the country, Government and Department do not allow 3,000 people who benefit from this drug to access it. A man in my constituency who brought this matter to my attention is no longer working. He is back in a wheelchair. I have heard numerous cases. The Minister and the HSE know all about it because people are writing to the Minister telling him that they can no longer work, drive a car or walk. They are telling him that they can no longer do the basic things because the Minister will not allow them access to a drug that is proven to work for about one third of MS sufferers. I again ask the Leader to use his good offices to get back in touch with the Minister, whom I e-mailed again last week and the week before. I have been writing to him and the Department since February 2014, but I have been getting nowhere. It is not right and is bureaucracy gone mad.

It was due to the action of a number of people, particularly Senators Ivana Bacik and Jillian van Turnhout, who made much of Rape Crisis Network Ireland and the great work it does.

The first relates to a report today from the Central Bank which found that seven banks have failed to protect customers in mortgage arrears in a number of areas. It is very distressing to read the findings of the report. This matter needs to be taken further on two levels. I would like to hear the Minister for Finance give us his views on the report and what action the Central Bank intends to take. The Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman has been especially lacking in terms of dealing with the worries of those in mortgage arrears and has taken a very limited view of its own remit. I would like this issue to be brought forward for discussion. I also wish to mention patients left on trolleys in the accident and emergency department in Beaumont Hospital. The country-specific recommendations for Ireland indicated that we are spending more and getting less for our money. There is a real issue here in terms of patients in accident and emergency departments both in terms of their health and safety and the health and safety of nurses, doctors and other members of staff who work in the sector. Such staff must work in situations where dangerous patients are left in situations where they damage themselves and those who work in the sector. Could I ask for a debate with the Minister for Health on this issue? I would very much like to hear his proposals for the health sector, particularly this issue.  I congratulate one of our former colleagues, Eugene Regan, who has been appointed to the European Court of Justice. He is a former Member of this House and a notable barrister and this House should pass on its congratulations.

I did not receive the e-mail. I have double checked and I did not receive it.  I applaud the work of Ireland's top EU civil servant, Catherine Day, who has announced her retirement from the European Commission as of the end of August. She is an unsung hero for us as Irish citizens but also for the European Union, particularly when she championed the enlargement of the Union and its role. I congratulate and welcome Alexander Italianer who will take up the position in August. I suggest we invite Catherine Day to address the House. Perhaps that might be considered-----

May we have a debate at the earliest opportunity on the Government working group report on direct provision? It has been widely reported on in the newspapers. Senators and Deputies may be the last people to receive this 360-page report. My understanding is it is going to the Cabinet next Tuesday. Given the work we have done on a cross-party basis on direct provision - the working group was a culmination of the work we did - may we have a debate at the earliest opportunity on this report?  I wish to raise the issue of the Gender Recognition Bill, which is going through the Dáil. I remain concerned about the exclusion of children from the Bill. We had a good debate in the Seanad in February. We were told that we were on our own on that issue. However, when the Bill went to the Dáil, many Deputies joined in the call regarding the importance of ensuring children were recognised. We were very quick in expressing our views on the marriage equality referendum, which I was glad to applaud, but we cannot forget that the people of Ireland also voted for children's rights. The Supreme Court cleared its way for passage into the Constitution after two and a half years of legal wrangling. This is our first opportunity to show that we understand what is meant by children's rights. This is one area of legislation in which we should ensure twe see children as rights holders. They should not have to wait until they are 18 years to have their rights recognised in this regard. They are rights holders. I considered there was a clear compromise in having a interim gender recognition certificate. It is an issue on which I will continue to fight. The Bill will come back to this House, given the amendments that have been made as it passes through the Dáil. I will continue to fight for the children of Ireland and their families who are looking for this gender recognition certificate.

I do not understand where the Government is coming from.Why does it constantly seem to undermine NGOs that are doing an extraordinary job across the whole field of human endeavour? It is not just about the rape crisis centres, which we are discussing this morning; it will be another agency tomorrow. I am getting requests, as I am sure other Members are, for funding from a variety of groups, the most recent being Women's Aid, which has had its funding cut. What is the Government about? Does it care about the vulnerable people in our society? All we keep hearing about is the spin about the economy recovering. Tell that to the victims of rape, who are going to rape crisis centres for counselling, help and other support only to be told they cannot be seen today and it might be next week because the funding has been cut and they cannot provide the services required. I will not go on and on about this. Shame on the Government.

It is disturbing to hear that banks are continuing with legal action to repossess homes even though they had agreed a revised deal with a struggling homeowner. Other banks are taking away Central Bank protection from mortgage customers because they did not agree to a repayment schedule over the telephone. What was disturbing about the interview I heard this morning with a representative of the Central Bank was that no stern action appears to be planned. The banks were to be contacted and told to correct their misdemeanours, which is very limited action and the Central Bank needs to adopt a much tougher stance on those seven banks. They were not named and I believe they should be named and shamed. I welcome the announcement that the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is preparing a new campaign to get workplaces to become more active by encouraging the public sector, which employs just short of 300,000 people, to develop healthy workplace policies. Public sector companies and agencies, which employ 15% of the total workforce, will be encouraged to make their workplace a healthier place and get staff to be more active under the new plans to involve active travel. It will also try to get employees involved in walking, running and other activities, and exercise groups as well as promoting healthy eating options in staff canteens. This is very welcome. However, I also appeal to the private sector and in particular large employers to follow this line and to start to develop healthy workplaces promoting healthy food options in canteens, as well as promoting exercise, walking and cycling groups within large enterprises. We all know the problems we have with obesity and ill health. The more we can promote healthy opportunities in all workplaces, the better for the Exchequer. It should also help to ease considerably the strain on the health budget.

As we know, that framework was introduced in 2011 to ensure that the banks would play ball with the almost 120,000 residential mortgage holders who are in arrears. Despite the concerns expressed by the Senator, the problem with the Government's approach is that it is all tea and sympathy when it comes to people who are in mortgage arrears but it has done precious little about putting in place policies and supports for people who are in mortgage arrears. It has continued to allow the banks to have an absolute veto on what is happening.

Of course, they have a role and they have expressed clear concerns about the breach of fair process, which was the very essence of the CCMA framework in the first place. Today The Irish Times reported: "Lenders also continued to seek additional ad-hoc payments from borrowers on top of agreed revised repayments without formally assessing their ability to make these additional payments". A number of weeks ago I was outside the courthouse in Waterford when more than 30 families were before the courts over potential repossessions. Again, the banks were not playing ball with those families. These are people who have tried their best. They have gone through MABS and gone through the process. They are paying what they can yet the banks are going for repossession. There is no write down, no proper restructuring and none of the options the Government claims are available, such as split-mortgages and mortgage to rent. Those options are not available to people because the banks are simply not using them. Until the Government faces up to that reality and faces down the banks, into which we invested huge amounts of money, and properly represents those people who are in mortgage arrears, we will continue to have these problems. My message to Government Senators and Ministers is for them to offer less tea and sympathy and show more action. They should put in place the policies for which they are paid to ensure that those in mortgage arrears get at least a fair crack of the whip and are properly represented because the Government has failed them up to now.
#MaryMoran	unknown-#MaryMoran-party	unknown-#MaryMoran-dob	unknown-#MaryMoran-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	53	I have received representations from parents who will be affected by this week's changes to the one-parent family payment. I highlight mothers and fathers who are engaged in employment below the threshold of the 19 hours necessary to avail of family income supplement. I am aware of a specific case where a parent works for 15 hours spread over a five-day week in a local schools as a bus escort. As a result they cannot avail of jobseeker's benefit for the days not in work as their employment is spread over the five days. They cannot avail of family income supplement because they are at 15 hours and there is no prospect of increased hours due to the nature of their work despite the fact that they have offered to work the additional four hours on a voluntary basis. This parent is just below the threshold to qualify for family income supplement which would significantly increase their weekly income by almost €200 while continuing employment. The individual wants to work, but in this situation they may be better off on jobseeker's benefit where they can avail of courses and training to reskill or upskill. I understand this is a particular case, but I know that it is replicated across many counties, particularly with working parents employed on low-hours contracts in schools or other employment. We need to use common sense in such cases where a parent wants to work. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 11 be taken before No. 1 today.

I have no ulterior motive for it. It is a scandal. However, there is a bigger scandal. Yesterday, Senator Darragh O'Brien attempted to propose an amendment to the Order of Business in respect of No. 67, motion No. 17 which deals with the one-parent family payment. Last night I watched Vincent Browne's show, during which he mentioned that out of 120 Government Deputies and Senators, not one was available to come on the programme to defend this scurrilous cut. I call on the Leader to be brave and organise a debate in the House before this change comes in. Let us discuss the exact implications for the lone parents. We hear a lot of old bleeding-heart stuff here about our concern for children and for the poverty-stricken in this country. I would love somebody on the Government side to have the courage to stand up here and explain how this will benefit the poverty-stricken of this country. Tomorrow I will propose the same amendment to the Order of Business as Senator Darragh O'Brien did and I ask the Government to respond with courage this time. If they are not able to face Vincent Browne, they should try facing the Opposition on it.

I reassure the Opposition because of the steps the Government has taken, the Governor of the Central Bank was able to come out and say what he said. However, as the Senator said, I noticed he was weak in his implementation of the powers he has been given by the Government. In 2011 the mortgage arrears resolution process was introduced.In July 2013 it was strengthened by a detailed definition of what constitutes co-operation and non-co-operation. With the powers that the Central Bank has been given by the Government the Governor is now able to wake up, whereas heretofore one could say the Central Bank was asleep when it should have been maintaining oversight. I listened to what he said this morning and was most disappointed to hear that seven institutions are not co-operating as required by the Government. He should name and shame these institutions and take them to task immediately. The regulator now has the powers to do it and he should do it.  An alternative motion was proposed on the cut to the funding of Rape Crisis Network Ireland. Only last week, when the funding was cut, I raised the issue in the Seanad. I asked for a debate and I am still asking for a debate as that is the way to ensure that funding is reinstated. It was not the Minister who made the cut. When I was on the council, we were always looking for devolution of powers and power was devolved to the Tusla board which made the decision. I think it was the wrong decision and many in this House think it was the wrong decision. I asked why the decision was made, but I have not been given an explanation. I want a debate on the issue. Rest assured that we on this side of the House are just as concerned about rape as Members on the other side. When I spoke on this subject, I gave the statistics and pointed to the failings of every organisation in this area.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	56	I ask the Leader for a debate on care of the elderly. I sound like a long-playing record because I have made this request on many occasions down the years. I do so today, however, in the context of the recently issued report by ALONE which clearly demonstrates that up to one third of people who are in nursing homes do not need to be there, should not be there and would be much happier and more fulfilled in their own communities with their own families, friends and neighbours. It is a question of putting in place the resources, which may be significantly less than what is currently invested in fair deal and other such schemes. If we were more generous and caring with the carer's allowance and made a change to the rules and regulations of that particular scheme, and if we looked at schemes such as the home help scheme, the public health scheme and public health nurses, we could ensure that up to one third of people currently in nursing homes are with their families and in their communities. Everybody would win and it would be a win for society. We are becoming fixated in Europe with the concept of long-term residential care but that it is a "shady pines" solution for the elderly. The majority of elderly citizens can be looked after, provided for and supported in their homes and communities by a tweaking of the schemes which we have in place. It would probably save the taxpayer money as well, as the cost of the nursing homes scheme to the State is €1,200 per week, while we simultaneously turn down carer's allowance claims of €200 per week for flimsy reasons. I ask the Leader to arrange this debate, either with the Minister for Social Protection, the Minister of State with responsibility for older people or a combination of the two. We need to look at a much more holistic way of looking after the elderly and we should have an aspiration for our elderly above and beyond simply providing nursing home beds.

It is the network and we must distinguish what it does from what the rape crisis centres do. Rape Crisis Network Ireland does not offer frontline services but is a representative body for 14 rape crisis centres. Tusla stated on 11 June this year that it would maintain the €4 million grant aid for the rape crisis centres and increase by €500,000 the resources being put into them. I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding because I have a sneaking suspicion that the information being given is not being given in error. It is important we clarify the role of Rape Crisis Network Ireland and that of the rape crisis centres.

The most vulnerable people in society are being attacked by the Government and their funding is being cut, as we saw in the case of lone parents and others, but the Labour Party continues to tout the line that social welfare payments have not been cut.

Following on from Senator Paul Bradford's contribution about nursing homes, the annual cost for the fair deal scheme is €993 million or very close to €1 billion. I have highlighted this issue previously in the House. We face major long-term challenges in this regard. Every year more than 20,000 people will reach the age of 65 and the number of over-65s will continue to grow in the future. We should have a debate about long-term planning in this area. I wish to highlight the problems faced by nursing homes in hiring nursing staff. People who want to work in this country are facing delays in being registered with An Bord Altranais, with delays in some cases of up to six months. This is an urgent matter. I wish to raise an issue related to housing. A person known to me has applied for housing assist under the HAP scheme, which is assistance from the local authority. The person has been told that because one person in the household has an income and the other is in receipt of social welfare payments, because of their combined incomes they do not qualify for assistance. However, the same local authority will not grant them assistance to buy a house because social welfare income is not taken into account when applying for a mortgage. They are caught in the middle. They will not be granted assistance because their combined incomes are too high, but, on the other hand, they will not be given assistance because they do not qualify because of their income. We need a solution to this problem. The people concerned are trying to provide for themselves and their family and the system is not providing for them. They either fit into one category or the other, but in this case they are fitting into neither. This is wrong and they are being sidelined by the system. The issue of the irregularity needs to be resolved. I ask the Leader to bring it to the attention of the Minister. I intend following up on the matter, but it would be helpful if the Leader also brought it to the attention of the Minister.

The rape crisis centres are independent of Rape Crisis Network Ireland. They are funded directly. I have it in writing that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, requested that Tusla give particular priority to protecting front-line services. In that context funding for the 16 rape crisis centres nationwide which provide services directly for rape survivors has been protected for 2015. Almost €4 million in funding is dedicated to rape crisis centres in 2015. No rape crisis centres are to be closed. However, I agree that we should have a debate on the network, which is independent. It collates data. Of the 16 rape crisis centres, only eleven use Rape Crisis Network Ireland, while the remainder collate their own data. They can explain this for themselves. We must have a debate to allow the Minister to explain the reasoning behind the policy. However, we should not accept an hour of statements, rather we should have a proper debate into which every one of us can have an input. I reiterate my call of last week for a constructive debate with time for all Members to speak.

I understand Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the representative body of rape crisis centres, as opposed to the service providers, has had its funding ceased. The priority of both the Minister and Tusla was to protect front-line services within the funding available. The funding for Rape Crisis Network Ireland was for the maintenance of a database incorporating data gathered and recorded by rape crisis workers who dealt with the survivors of sexual abuse. Tusla had concerns about the database, in particular, the fact that the data collected by Rape Crisis Network Ireland from rape crisis centres were not readily available to it and not fully representative of all services available in dealing with sexual abuse. As part of its statutory responsibilities in the provision of services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, including information capability, a decision was taken to produce the data in-house in the future. Tusla is developing a national specialist service covering all sexual, domestic and gender-based violence services to enable better outcomes for children and adults who survive such violence. It has appointed a national manager and eight additional staff to ensure a single line of accountability for all resources in this important area. It is very important that people realise the difference between Rape Crisis Network Ireland and what is being done by it, especially in this specific instance, and the rape crisis centres. Some speakers mixed up the two and it is very important that the position be clarified.

The comprehensive reply I have given clarifies the position. However, I will take on board what Senator Marie Moloney asked for last week. I have asked the Minister to come to the House for a debate on it. He was not available this week. I had provisionally arranged for him to come this evening, but he cannot do so. I hope we can arrange a debate at an early date. I will bring the issue of the Fampyra drug to the attention of the Minister for Health. I provided several comprehensive reports on the matter on previous occasions, but we will follow it up. Senators Aideen Hayden, Michael Mullins, Cáit Keane, Paul Coghlan and David Cullinane asked about the Central Bank's report and the banks' treatment of those in mortgage arrears. Their treatment is not acceptable and there is a need for the Central Bank to use the powers available to it to take the banks to task.I remind the other side of the House that the Government has removed the bank veto. The Central Bank needs to take its responsibility very seriously and take action against the banks which are not playing ball on the issue of mortgage arrears. Senators Aideen Hayden and Paul Coghlan congratulated former Senator Eugene Regan on his appointment to the European Court of Justice. He was an excellent Member of this House for a number of years and I congratulate him on his appointment. I am sure he will make an excellent judge. Senator Jillian van Turnhout referred to the retirement of Ms Catherine Day, a senior Irish civil servant in the European Union. I note the points she will bring to the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in seeking to have Ms Day address the House. It would be an excellent opportunity for the House to have her inform us of all the things that go on in the European Union at senior Civil Service level. The report on the direct provision system will be sent to the Cabinet on Tuesday next and I will try to arrange a debate on the issue after that with the relevant Minister. As the Senator mentioned, we have debated the issue in this House on a number of occasions. Senator Michael Mullins referred to the Central Bank's report, to which I have alluded. He also welcomed the new healthy workplace initiative introduced by the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar. Senator Mary Moran referred to the plight of one-parent families. She mentioned a specific case which could be dealt with by means of a Commencement matter. I will accept the amendment she proposed to the Order of Business that No. 11 be taken before No. 1. Senator Cáit Keane also spoke about the Central Bank. I have addressed that issue.  Senator Paul Bradford referred to the care of the elderly and the recent report by Alone. He called for a debate on the matter which I will try to arrange with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. Senator Colm Burke referred to the expenditure of €1 billion on the fair deal scheme. It is a significant sum. He also spoke about the need to address the delay in people getting on the nursing board's register. He referred to funding for housing and anomalies in the system. If he tables a Commencement matter, I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, or the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, will come to the House to address the issue.  I think I have addressed the majority, if not all, of the issues raised by Members.

The purpose of the legislation is to protect consumers whose loans are sold by regulated financial service providers to unregulated firms. It will address concerns surrounding the continued applicability of the Central Bank's codes and access for borrowers to the Financial Services Ombudsman after loan books are sold. It provides that borrowers, whose loans have been sold, retain the protections they had when their loan was with a regulated lender. For example, they will retain the protections provided by the Central Bank's codes such as the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, known as the CCMA, the consumer protection code and the code of conduct for business lending to small and medium enterprises. Consumers need protection when taking out credit, during the course of holding credit and when they are repaying credit. It is not equitable that some of these protections can be avoided owing to the regulatory position of the entity which owns the credit. For this reason, consumers should maintain the protections they had before their loan was sold. This is what the proposed legislation seeks to achieve. As Senators know, unregulated financial institutions are not bound by the Central Bank's codes. In addition, while customers of unregulated financial institutions have access to the courts, they do not have access to the Financial Services Ombudsman. Although, as the House will be aware, many purchasers of loan books have already agreed voluntarily to apply the Central Bank's codes when managing loan books, voluntary compliance is not enforceable. As a result, the Government committed to ensuring these protections would be made available for all consumers whose loans had been sold. Senators might ask why loan books are sold. It is generally accepted that there is a need for financial institutions to be able to deleverage and restructure their loan books so as to return to their main business of supporting the economy through the provision of financial services, including credit for SMEs and consumers. We do not intend that this legislation will inhibit that process, but, more importantly, we do not want borrowers to lose protections because of a change in ownership. This has been complex legislation to prepare. Department of Finance officials have carefully considered how best to protect consumers and, as is often the case when preparing legislation, their thinking has evolved during the course of the preparatory phase. Last July and August the Department of Finance ran a public consultation process to seek views on the proposed legislation. Some 19 submissions were received from a range of respondents, including the financial services industry, consumer groups, public representatives, individuals and other stakeholders. These submissions are available on the Department's website. Department of Finance officials subsequently met some stakeholders to clarify submissions and the technicalities of how the credit servicing industry operated. The officials also discussed the issue with the authorities in the United Kingdom, as they had faced similar policy challenges in recent times. Officials in the Department of Finance have carefully considered the submissions and have been working intensively with the Central Bank and the Office of the Attorney General to progress the legislation.This experience has underlined the value of the public consultations process. It means legislation is prepared in an open and transparent manner and also plays an important role in contributing to understanding the issues and avoiding unintended consequences. When work began on this Bill, the initial thinking was that the ownership of credit should be regulated to ensure borrowers continue to receive the same protections they enjoyed prior to the loan book sale. However, the public consultation process highlighted an issue with this approach, namely, that it was possible to envisage cases where owners would effectively function as passive special purpose vehicles, SPVs, and, where they outsourced servicing of loans to a firm, that would not be regulated. It became clear from the consultation process that if we were to protect consumers effectively, it was better to regulate the process of credit servicing as that is the customer-facing activity. However, if owners do not outsource credit servicing and instead undertake the activity themselves, they will be required to be regulated. Furthermore, if a regulated financial service provider outsources its credit servicing, it will be obliged to ensure the firm credit servicing on its behalf is compliant with Central Bank regulations. In other words, a regulated entity will be responsible for all credit agreements. I will now turn to the details of the Bill, the Title of which was agreed following consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and reflects the approach being adopted to protect consumers. The legislation will amend the Central Bank Act 1942, Central Bank Act 1997, Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 and Consumer Credit Act 1995 and provide for related matters. It is proposed to amend section 28 of the Central Bank Act 1997 by inserting definitions of the terms "credit agreement", "credit servicing", "credit servicing firm", "creditor" and "relevant borrower". The term "credit servicing" is being tightly defined in order that a firm which communicates with relevant borrowers in regard to their credit agreement will require authorisation. As mentioned earlier, the legislation will also require owners who do not outsource credit servicing to another party to be regulated. The Bill ensures there is only a limited number of actions an owner can take without needing to be authorised as a credit servicing firm by the Central Bank. The effect of all this is to regulate the activity of credit servicing, and the credit servicing firms engaged in such activity, in order that borrowers retain the protections they have before the loan book was sold. All consumer and relevant small and medium enterprise, SME, loans that are sold will be covered by these amendments and will retain the protections they currently have. First, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, sets out the framework lenders must use when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears. It requires lenders to engage positively with the objective of helping borrowers to meet their obligations. Under the CCMA, borrowers must be dealt with in accordance with the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, which sets out the steps to be followed on communication, gathering financial information, assessing the circumstances of borrowers and proposing a resolution. Procedures for complaints and appeals are also provided. Second, the consumer protection code provides protections such as limits on communications, personal visits and other contacts, complaint resolution processes, error handling, compliance of outsourced activity with the code, and post-sale information provisions, including warnings on switching from a tracker mortgage to a variable rate mortgage. Third, under the code of conduct for business lending to small and medium enterprises, SME customers of regulated financial institutions enjoy protections in respect of arrears handling, complaint resolution and so on. Breaches of the Central Bank codes can lead to sanctions for the regulated entity. As credit servicing firms will become regulated financial services providers under the new legislative regime, all appropriate supervisory powers of the Central Bank will be applicable to them as regulated financial service providers, including the administrative sanctions procedures regime. Customers of regulated financial institutions also have access to the Financial Services Ombudsman whose role is to investigate, mediate and adjudicate complaints about the conduct of regulated financial service providers. All personal customers, unincorporated bodies, charities, clubs, partnerships, trusts and limited companies with a turnover of €3 million or less can complain to the ombudsman. This is a very important protection for borrowers. With regard to credit union credit, we must ensure that where credit union loan books are sold outside the credit union movement, the borrowers in question are afforded the same protections as other borrowers. This requires an amendment to the Consumer Credit Act 1995. Therefore, the relevant codes will apply to credit which is initially advanced by a credit union but is subsequently sold. We are not aware of circumstances where this has arisen, but it is considered prudent from a consumer protection perspective to provide for it. Section 1 amends section 28 of the Central Bank Act 1997 by inserting definitions of "credit agreement", "credit servicing", "credit servicing firm", "creditor" and "relevant borrower", as I have mentioned. The activities of credit servicing have been defined to ensure the entity managing the relevant borrowers' credit agreements is regulated. Owners who do not outsource credit servicing will be required to be regulated in order that a regulated entity will be responsible for all credit agreements. The effect of the amendments to section 28 of the Central Bank Act 1997 is to regulate the activity of credit servicing and the credit servicing firms engaged in such activity in order that borrowers retain the protections they have before a loan book is sold. The definition of SMEs, which comes within the definition of "relevant borrower", ensures SMEs that borrowed from regulated firms maintain the protections they had, while SMEs that borrowed from legitimately unregulated firms are not captured. Such unregulated firms are an important source of funding for SMEs and we do not wish to restrict the flow of funds to such businesses in any way. The Bill will ensure the status quo is maintained. As a result, where credit has been granted to an SME by a number of providers, both regulated and unregulated, it is only the credit that was originally provided by an authorised or regulated financial services provider that is covered by this Bill. Essentially, SMEs will be restored to the protections they currently have, including under the code of conduct for business lending to small and medium enterprises, when they borrow from regulated lenders, but we are not extending the remit. Section 2 amends the Central Bank Act 1997 in respect of the Central Bank's powers to grant and refuse applications for authorisation. Section 3 amends Section 33A of the Central Bank Act 1997 to enable the Central Bank to impose conditions or requirements on authorised credit servicing firms. Section 4 amends the Central Bank Act 1997 by inserting two new sections, 34E and 34F, with transitional provisions for retail credit firms and credit servicing firms, respectively. Existing retail credit firms or credit servicing firms are taken to be authorised under this Act provided the person applies to the bank for authorisation no later than three months after the legislation is enacted. However, these firms will "stand authorised" on an interim basis during that period and will be obliged to comply with relevant financial services legislation. They will fall under the supervision of the Central Bank which can immediately step in if there is a problem with a firm's actions. The Central Bank does not have to wait three months to have this power. It will have it as soon as the Bill becomes law. In addition, a regulated financial service provider authorised before or after the enactment of the legislation to provide credit in the State is taken to be authorised to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm by virtue of the amendment this Bill makes, in section 1, to section 28 of the Central Bank Act 1997. Section 5 was introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil to strengthen protections for borrowers further. It inserts a new section in the Central Bank Act 1997 that is a statutory obligation on both owners and credit servicing firms. The statutory obligation will ensure a credit servicing firm cannot do something, or fail to do something, that would be a prescribed contravention if performed, or not performed, by a retail credit firm. It also prevents the owner of credit from instructing a regulated credit firm to perform such an action. This obligation is considered necessary to return borrowers to the circumstances they were in prior to the sale of the loan book. It strengthens the protections for borrowers and also effectively closes off possible behaviour by owners instructing firms to carry out inappropriate activities. It also strengthens the position of an upstanding credit servicing firm as it legally obliges it not to carry out such instructions. Furthermore, the obligation makes the issuance of such instructions by an owner an offence. By this obligation, we are specifying an offence for the unregulated owner but also ensuring the breach cannot be implemented by the regulated servicer, over whom the Central Bank has oversight as a regulated entity. This will mean a quicker response to possible breaches. Furthermore, this oversight will allow the Central Bank to investigate in a case where an unregulated owner instructs a credit servicing firm to do something that would be a prescribed contravention if done by a retail credit firm. Such a breach is actionable by the Central Bank against the credit servicing firm. In addition, the owner could also be liable for credit servicing without authorisation. The obligation on the regulated credit servicing firm not to perform the action also means that the borrower has access to the Financial Services Ombudsman. Section 6 amends section 3 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 to amend the definition of "customer". We are adding paragraph (c) to include people whose loans are being serviced by a credit servicing firm. Section 7 amends section 57BA of the Central Bank Act 1942 to ensure relevant borrowers whose credit agreements are being serviced by an authorised credit servicing firm are considered eligible consumers for the purposes of the Financial Services Ombudsman. Customers of regulated financial institutions have access to the Financial Services Ombudsman, whose role is to investigate, mediate in, and adjudicate on complaints about the conduct of regulated financial service providers. Section 8 amends section 3 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, which concerns the application, to ensure that the relevant Central Bank codes will apply to credit union credit that is sold to an unregulated entity. With regard to credit union credit, it is necessary to ensure that where credit union loan books are sold, those borrowers are also afforded the same protections as other borrowers. This issue was raised by the Financial Services Ombudsman in the consultation process. Credit union credit sold outside the credit union movement should be regulated so an amendment to the Consumer Credit Act 1995 is needed. Therefore, the relevant codes will apply to credit that is initially advanced by a credit union but subsequently sold to an unregulated entity. Section 9 contains the Short Title and collective citation. The Bill will commence on its signature by the President. The Bill is important because it addresses the concerns of borrowers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities. It will give consumers a legally enforceable right to complain to the Financial Services Ombudsman and it will ensure consumers whose loans have been sold will have the benefits of the Central Bank codes, and those dealing with those consumers will have to be authorised by the Central Bank. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, looks forward to a constructive debate on the Bill. There is broad agreement in the House on the need to ensure borrowers will have the same protections as they had before their loan was sold. We can all agree that this important legislation needs to be enacted as soon as possible in order that borrowers are protected without delay. While the Minister and his officials have been extremely careful and diligent in the drafting of this legislation to ensure it restores protections for borrowers, they believe that if issues emerge regarding the legislation, they may, if considered necessary, be dealt with at a later stage through amendments to the Act. The priority must be to enact the legislation to ensure that protections for borrowers will be in place as quickly as possible. I commend the Bill to the House and ask Senators to give it their full support and consideration.

I am puzzled as to why he is not in the Department of Finance. He is responsible for European affairs and data protection. I would have believed the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, or his Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, who are responsible for this legislation, would have been here. That they are not is no reflection on Minister of State Deputy Dara Murphy, who does a good job and is more than welcome here. However, I would have believed that if the legislation was as important as stated and if, as stated, the Minister looks forward to a good, constructive and forthright debate on the Bill, he or his deputy, Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, would have come to the House to hear it. This is not great legislation. It is important but it is drastically watered down by comparison to what we expected. I would oppose it on Second Stage only that I have a series of amendments prepared for Committee Stage. The Bill is deficient and watered down. The watering down is akin to the watering down of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears that the Minister of State referred to in this statement, which is obviously prepared by the Department of Finance. The Bill will not achieve what is required. When mortgage books are sold, it is a big issue for those concerned. The mortgage holders will not be afforded the protection required based on the way this legislation is framed because the owner of the loan books, which could be a vulture fund that is not administering the mortgages, will not be covered by it. If vulture fund ABC plc from the USA bought a loan book here but did not administer the mortgages, it would not be covered by the Central Bank or this legislation, as drafted. It is mentioned in the statement prepared by the Department of Finance and read by the Minister of State that the Department of Finance consulted widely, there were concerns within the industry that what I suggest would be too complex, which is why the changes have been made. I believe the changes have been made because the financial institutions and those who purchase loan books did not want the legislation to be as strong as it should be. I could be wrong about this, but it is more than likely the reason.

#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	101	There is a real issue. We have 11 or 12 amendments to the Bill that we will table. I do not doubt the Government's desire to afford protection to mortgage holders but I believe the legislation needs to be strengthened sufficiently. The Minister of State referred to the question of why loan books are sold. We understand why they are sold. Mortgage holders wonder, in connection with the IBRC and Irish Nationwide Building Society book of residential mortgages that was sold, why the affected mortgage holders were not afforded the opportunity to purchase their own mortgages at a discount. The Government saw fit to sell those mortgages as a block at a substantial discount, yet the mortgage holders, even if not in arrears, got no opportunity to make an offer on their mortgages. My proposal might not seem realistic, but I have dealt with people with Irish Nationwide Building Society and IBRC mortgages who were angry because their mortgages were sold by the Government to what is effectively a vulture fund and because they were not offered any discount. Moreover, they were never told the discount at which the mortgages were sold. People refer to a discount in the region of 50%, and this is more than likely the case. This is a problem because the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is not as strong as it used to be. It is welcome that the Government is seeking to remove the bank veto, but its proposals do not do so. The problem concerns areas where house prices have risen.Last year, more than 10,000 repossession orders were issued as a result of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, which the Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Alan Shatter, brought in, which the House passed, and which set aside the Dunne judgment and made it easier for financial institutions to repossess people's homes. At the time, many people warned that we should expect a raft of repossession orders, and this has happened. If a vulture fund in New York has bought my €100,000 mortgage for €50,000 and thinks it can get full redemption of it, particularly if I am in arrears, it will go after me. This is happening. People who are paying their mortgages but who have an amount of residual mortgage arrears are being moved against, not just by vulture funds but also by Irish-owned banks. The code of conduct on mortgage arrears is irrelevant. Today's report by the Central Bank states there has been no financial penalty against any financial institution. I have frequently had occasion to write to Bank of Ireland to ask why it has not offered a split mortgage to a client. The answer is that the bank did not and will not, and that is the end of the matter. The Minister of State should not wonder if I take the legislation and the Government's statement today not just with a pinch of salt but with a bucket. The Government's track record on protecting people who have mortgages and are in mortgage arrears has been abysmal. The legislation will let the people who own the mortgages off scot free. Only the administrators of mortgages, not the owners, will be covered by this. There are major deficiencies in this half-baked piece of legislation. It is 100 million miles away from what the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, said he would produce. The Minister could be elsewhere in the European Union and I understand there are important negotiations ongoing which he must attend. While I do not cast aspersions on the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, is present, and he is more than welcome, I am slightly bemused as to why the Minister State, Deputy Simon Harris, is not here. The Leas-Chathaoirleach might insist that the Leader ensure a Minister who has responsibility within the Department attends Committee Stage here and hears the amendments we plan to table. We plan to table at least 12 amendments and I assume others will also table amendments. Can anyone tell me why those who purchase distressed mortgages will not be covered by the legislation? I do not understand why one would bother bringing the Bill forward without it. There are issues with SME debt and certain anomalies within the Bill will cause difficulties for some major companies in Dublin in particular of which I am aware and I will try to address them by way of amendment. The Department and Minister are aware of unintended consequences which may befall some SMEs as a result of the legislation and I hope this will be tidied up on Committee Stage. I thank the Minister of State for outlining the Bill. I appreciate that he has taken the time to do it. It is vitally important that the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, or the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, be here for Committee Stage. Although I would be inclined to vote the Bill down on Second Stage, we will take the opportunity to strengthen the legislation on Committee Stage rather than oppose it now. I hope the Minister will examine the amendments we will forward this evening. I assume the Bill will be taken on Committee Stage next week. I would give the legislation score of four out of ten, based on what was proposed at the start and what could have been done. That is my humble opinion. Senator John Gilroy will disagree with all of this, which is fine.

#MichaelMullins	unknown-#MichaelMullins-party	unknown-#MichaelMullins-dob	unknown-#MichaelMullins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	104	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, for this discussion on the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015. The Bill aims to ensure borrowers whose loans are sold by a regulated entity to a currently unregulated entity maintain the same regulatory protections as they had before the sale, including under various Central Bank codes and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. I share Senator Darragh O'Brien's concern and outrage at the Central Bank's report yesterday on how seven of the regulated entities are treating people in arrears and breaking the rules set by the regulators. It is disturbing that some of these banks are continuing with legal action to repossess homes, despite the fact that revised deals had been agreed with struggling home owners. Other banks are withdrawing Central Bank protection for mortgage customers because they did not agree to a repayment schedule over the phone, despite the fact that banks are required to communicate a revised payment arrangement in writing, as the Central Bank has indicated. Seven banks are involved, none of which has been named. This morning I heard an interview with a representative of the Central Bank and it is unfortunate the banks were not named and that stronger sanctions are not being imposed on them. The Central Bank's report also showed that some banks were seeking irregular payments from stricken mortgage holders on top of agreed revised payments. There were cases in which lenders continued to call borrowers directly rather than liaising with nominated third parties. Some banks were not adhering to agreed timeframes for dealing with distressed borrowers. These issues should be highlighted, as the Minister of State said. Customers need protection when they take out credit, during the course of holding credit and when they are repaying credit. It is not equitable that some of these protections be avoided due to the regulatory provision of the entity that owns the credit. The legislation rightly seeks to ensure customers retain the protections they had before the loans were sold. Despite what Senator Darragh O'Brien said, the legislation is timely and urgent. Of the 760,000 mortgages on primary dwellings in the State, approximately 102,000 are in arrears. Thankfully, the figure has dropped significantly from 120,000 in February. This is a positive development. Deals are being done and people are returning to work and are, therefore, in a position to make the repayments. The reduction in the unemployment rate from 15% to 9.8% is contributing significantly to the fact that more people are in a position to meet their revised mortgage commitments. Of these 102,000, 5,000 to 10,000 do not enjoy the protection of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. This is a significant number. The proposed legislation would bring peace of mind to many families. Protection became a major issue when the Ulster Bank loan book was sold by IBRC. As public representatives, we have all heard harrowing stories from constituents about how they have been treated by lending agencies after the crash. These agencies have taken no consideration of the parts they played in getting many people into severe financial difficulties. I applaud the wonderful work being done by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and the credit unions and the support they have given many people who have been in great difficulty. The Bill will extend the regulatory remit of the Central Bank and ensure the applicability of various protections for consumers of financial services. I have already referred to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. The consumer protection code and the code of conduct for business lending to SMEs and the Financial Services Ombudsman also apply. In addition to primary dwellings, the legislation will apply to SMEs to facilitate access to credit for sustainable and productive business propositions. The consumer code is essential in this regard. While the primary purpose of the Bill is to provide protection for mortgages, many people have found themselves in great difficulty with loan sharks, properly known as regulated moneylenders, whose interest rates can be as high as 188%. I very much welcome the announcement by the Government during recent days of the micro loans scheme and I applaud the work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys.These loans will provide up to €1,000 to 40,000 low to middle income families at an interest rate of 12% as opposed to the 188% provided by moneylenders. It will be administered through local credit unions and post offices. I welcome the fact that it will be piloted by September. Some people may have concerns that the loans will be given to people who may not be in a position to repay, but repayment is guaranteed because the payments can be taken through social welfare. There will be involvement from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to ensure people do not seek loans they cannot afford. It is welcome that this will be a hassle-free process whereby moneylenders will be taken out of the loop. It should be a great boost to the credit union movement also. I come from a town that has a strong credit union which currently has plenty of money available to loan to business and borrowers. As a Government, we need to strengthen the credit union movement to ensure it continues to play its rightful role in society and in our community, as it has always done. While a few have run into difficulty, the majority of credit unions have run their businesses in an exemplary fashion. It is welcome that the protections in the Bill will cover loan books sold on by the credit union movement. As the Minister of State said, it is important to ensure borrowers will have the same protections they had before their loans were sold on. It is welcome that the legislation is to be enacted without delay. I commend the Minister for Finance for the work he has done in this regard.

I also welcome Senator Darragh O'Brien's thoughtful and measured contribution, articulated in his normal coherent and clear style. However, I am a little disappointed with regard to his comments, which may surprise some. He seemed to suggest the legislation was constructed to satisfy the concerns of the financial industry. Let us consider some of the publications which came before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform during pre-legislative scrutiny. They clearly outline in a transparent way most of the questions laid out by the very actors we are seeking to regulate. The suggestion that there has been a lack of transparency in the process is probably the complete opposite to what I sense in this legislation. It has been outlined publicly in a public document and we can see the contributions and concerns of named companies, including Mars Capital, FLAC, Vivier Mortgages and the Irish Debt Securities Association. These are the agents we seek to regulate. They have all clearly laid out what they are seeking. We can compare clearly what those agents seek and what is in the Bill. If anyone can demonstrate to me that there has been a lack of transparency, they will have done a good job in the public interest. This legislation is a welcome development. It has been the topic of much comment and concern in recent times. We have heard this articulated in the media and through consumer organisations. The sale of loans has a tendency to create uncertainty and concern among borrowers. While it is commonplace in other countries, it is a relatively recent phenomenon in Ireland. Up to now, borrowers in Ireland have had a reasonable expectation that they would continue to deal with the people who lent them money, that is to say, the financial institutions from which they borrowed the money. Our domestic lenders are bound by the Central Bank of Ireland codes but up to now the so-called unregulated financial institutions have not been. While borrowers from unregulated financial institutions have access to the courts, up to now they have not had access to the Financial Services Ombudsman, whose role is central in resolving disputes and complaints between customers and the lending institutions. Many of the unregulated financial institutions have agreed to accept the voluntary code of the Central Bank of Ireland. This voluntary code is a form of compliance, although it is not enforceable. I suggest that relying on the goodwill of international and mobile investors is not the most prudent course of action. We have seen a stark example of this in the past week with the owners of Clerys. They have strictly abided by the letter of company law but have shocked everyone with their ruthless application and disregard of the spirit of that law. This is probably the first time we have seen international asset strippers arriving into the country to make a pure clear profit only to be gone as quickly as they came while using our laws to their advantage. It is not the most prudent course of action to rely on the voluntary goodwill of financial institutions. The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 gives statutory protection to customers and will prevent this type of asset stripping. It will go a long way towards reassuring customers that their loans and the conditions under which the loans were borrowed will retain the protection they have enjoyed up to that point. Before the economic implosion on a global scale we saw how the financial markets in the Americas, and the United States in particular, had securitised or bundled up various financial products, for example, life insurance policies, sub-prime mortgages and other financial instruments and derivatives, before selling them on in the secondary market. In many ways this was the cause of the great crisis that has visited us in the past decade. Does this Bill speak to any of those concerns in respect of financial institutions which might be tempted to securitise other products, including some of our non-performing mortgages in arrears? My second question for the Minister relates to credit union loan books being sold. I was unaware of this practice or if I was, I had not given it much thought. I do not imagine many people in the country are aware of this. Will the Minister of State inform the House how prevalent is this practice in the country? Is it something we are likely to see more of? Senator Darragh O'Brien made a reasonable point. He asked why people in mortgage arrears are not allowed to buy their mortgages, while multinational companies are allowed. Is this anything to do with the fact that people who find their mortgages being sold on are, by definition, in arrears and do not have access to capital to buy them? Where can these people raise the capital if their primary asset is in trouble already? Is that one of the reasons, or is it simply utilitarianism, that is to say, it is simply too difficult to administer? If this were the case, it would be unacceptable. Perhaps the Minister of State might comment on those points. We look forward to discussing the sections of the Bill in detail. I presume the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, will come to the House when the Bill is before us again. I look forward to further engagement. I also look forward to hearing details of the Opposition amendments to strengthen the provisions. Senator Darragh O'Brien, in particular, has referred to this. We look forward to discussing them at length at that Stage.

He was careful about the way he worded it. We have seen the Minister of State in the House on several occasions recently. On this occasion he is wearing a particular hat. I welcome the Bill which aims to give more protection to individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises.There is a loophole whereby certain loans that are bought by third parties may not be covered by current legislation. The Minister of State explained that very clearly. The original Bill was extensive as it was intended that it would apply to all credit agreements, including where an SME entered into a loan with an unregulated lender. However, the amendments of 27 May have the effect that loans originally entered into between SMEs and unregulated lenders are not covered. The provisions will only apply to regulated financial service providers. I understand the purpose of the Bill was to cover loans subsequently acquired by an unregulated entity but perhaps we might find a middle ground in order to offer some protection to SMEs and other customers. I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could comment on that issue. People may face an increased risk of losing their family homes if an unregulated firm holds their mortgage. I am aware that there was discussion about the possibility that mortgages may still be a grey zone. Perhaps the Minister of State might clear up any misunderstanding that may exist in this regard. It would be useful to have clarity on how the so-called vulture funds will be regulated in respect of mortgages. I recently drafted a Bill that would empower the Central Bank to force banks to reduce variable mortgage interest rates. The Minister for Finance is aware of the bad behaviour and profiteering of banks in this respect. While the Minister for Finance has done some work in this area, KBC Bank, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank ruled out the possibility that they would cut their variable mortgage rates. A recent article in The Irish Times reported: "The Minister reminded the banks that Senator Feargal Quinn’s bill to give certain powers to the Central Bank to fix interest rates has been published in the Seanad, where the Government does not have a majority." Where does the Minister of State stand on this issue and how does the Government intend to deal with financial institutions which do not pass on interest rate cuts to customers? The ultimate purpose of the Bill is to give people access to credit and to protect borrowers. One way that SMEs and individuals can get easy access to credit is by releasing some of the cash locked up in their pensions. The Minister for Finance introduced a progressive measure which allowed people to access some of the cash locked up in their additional voluntary contributions for a three year period from 2013. The scheme expires in less than a year, however. The access to cash changed people's lives and it provided crucial cash flow for businesses. By September of last year, more than 12,000 people had availed of the scheme, more than €90 million had been released and €36 million had been paid in taxes. It was a win-win for the Government and borrowers alike. However, I was disappointed to learn that the Minister had no plans to extend the scheme, even though it had been a massive success, with a significant take-up. We have to treat people as adults. The banks are still reluctant to offer loans, while people are unable to access money locked up in their pension account to put their children through education or their businesses back on track. Will the Government consider extending this very worthwhile scheme in the next budget? If people knew they could access part of their pension funds for the rainy day, it would encourage them to invest in their pensions. This has been done successfully in Britain and the ability to access pension funds may have been vital for more than 12,000 people in Ireland. Anecdotal evidence indicates that the scheme has changed lives. I hope the Minister of State will agree to the amendments that can improve the Bill. I am confident that he has listened carefully to our arguments. Senator Darragh O'Brien indicated that he intends to table a number of amendments. I like to believe this House will be able to improve the Bill.

He is looking forward to engaging constructively on Senators' amendments.  The purpose of the Bill is to protect consumers whose loans are sold by regulated financial service providers to unregulated firms. Senators offered broad support for the Bill's overall objectives. While a number of purchasers of loan books have voluntarily agreed to apply Central Bank codes when managing loan books, the Government is introducing the Bill because voluntary compliance is not enforceable. The Bill provides that borrowers retain their protections after their loans are sold, thereby addressing concerns about the continued applicability of the Central Bank's codes and access for borrowers to the Financial Services Ombudsman. I have noted the points raised by Senators during the course of the debate and they will be considered carefully prior to Committee Stage, when they can be further explored. On the issues raised by Senator Darragh O'Brien, it was initially believed the best approach was to regulate the new owners of loan books but the approach evolved on foot of the public consultation last July and August, which sought a broad range of views. Further consideration on Committee Stage may be warranted. The Bill also benefited from input from the Central Bank and the Office of the Attorney General. The public consultation process highlighted an issue with the original approach which would facilitate the use of special purpose vehicles and the outsourcing of loans to unregulated firms.  Senator John Gilroy referred to sales of credit union loan books. This is not known to have happened and, while that is not to say it could not happen, it would be an unwelcome development. We are taking a belt and braces approach in this respect. In order to further strengthen the protections for borrowers, a new section 5 has been added to provide for a statutory prohibition on a credit servicing fund doing something which is a proscribed contravention if performed by a retail credit firm. This provision also prevents the owners of credit from instructing a regulated credit firm to perform such an action.This copperfastens the protections for borrowers and ensures owners' hands are very much tied in terms of what they can do in order to ensure that they do not act in a way that needs authorisation as a credit servicing firm and that they do not commit an offence by instructing a firm servicing their credit to do something or fail to do something which would be a proscribed contravention.  On the question of interest rates, they are not and were never intended to be covered by this legislation. A number of Senators posed questions relating to the SME sector. It is the intention that individuals, as well as small and medium enterprises, will be the greatest beneficiaries of the protections provided in the Bill and the Minister is very eager that it will become law at the earliest possible opportunity in order that this will be the case.  I thank Senators for their constructive engagement on this very important Bill. Most of those in opposition have engaged with it, although Sinn Féin Members were not particularly engaged with our deliberations today which is unfortunate because broad engagement by Members enables us to arrive at the best possible legislation. I hope priority will be given to the Bill and know that the Minister and his Department will engage fully on Committee Stage.

Before I introduce this new Bill to the House, I convey my apologies to Senators for the short notice in bringing it before them today. I know that this was the subject of debate last week and hope Senators got an opportunity to brief themselves on the information at their disposal since. As a former Senator, I am aware of the commitment and effort required by Senators to deliver robust legislation. I thank Senators for their forbearance and co-operation in endeavouring to meet the tight transposition deadline required in this instance. I am pleased to introduce the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Bill 2015 for the consideration of this House. The purpose of the Bill is to transpose directive 2013/30/EU, known as the offshore safety directive, which is focused on safety of offshore oil and gas operations. Transposition of the directive will further strengthen the safety regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and production in Ireland's offshore area. The offshore safety directive which was agreed under the Irish Presidency of the EU in June 2013 is the European Union response to minimise the risk of offshore accidents throughout the Union following its review of offshore oil and gas operations in Europe prompted by the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. The offshore safety directive seeks to ensure a consistent implementation of best regulatory practices in all European jurisdictions with offshore oil and gas activities and to strengthen the Union’s preparedness and response capacity to deal with an emergency that would potentially affect Union citizens or the environment. It is an exciting time for the petroleum exploration sector in Ireland. In the past three to four years we have witnessed strong momentum in exploration interest, with the number of exploration licences in place currently at its highest level ever. This increased level of interest has resulted in a significant increase in the level of acquisition of new seismic data in the Irish offshore. In 2013 and 2014, more new seismic data were acquired in the Irish offshore than in the previous ten years. It is a positive indicator that acquisition of new seismic data is continuing at a high level again this year. We now need to see the this effort translate into increased drilling levels, as it is only through exploration drilling that the true potential of Ireland’s offshore area can be proved. In September this year, the 2015 Atlantic margin licensing round will close. While the drop in oil prices is having a worldwide impact on investment decisions by exploration companies, feedback remains positive about industry interest in the licensing round. A successful round would be important to maintaining the positive momentum that has been established in recent years. It is also positive that the Corrib gas development is expected to come on stream later this year. Corrib will provide over 40% of peak demand for the island of Ireland in its first year of production. The Government’s strategy for the exploitation of the State’s natural hydrocarbon resources is premised on industry rather than the State bearing the risk for exploration investment. In this context, it is important that the State provide the right environment to encourage the industry to take the risk associated with investing in exploration. One of the key components to creating a robust and transparent regulatory regime in Ireland is the implementation of the Government’s decision in June 2014 that Ireland’s oil and gas fiscal terms should be revised along the lines recommended by Wood Mackenzie. The key central conclusions of the Wood Mackenzie report were that there is scope for strengthening the current fiscal system in terms of providing for an increase in the overall State take, ensuring an earlier share of revenue for the State, and addressing what Wood Mackenzie consider to be inconsistencies in the current fiscal system. Other initiatives in this sector include the conclusion of Ireland’s first strategic environmental assessment of the entire Irish offshore exclusive economic zone. This assessment will help to inform applications for both the current and future licensing rounds in Ireland’s Atlantic margin basins. This process will provide exploration companies working offshore Ireland with an environmental operational baseline against which they can conduct their work and ensure the protection of the marine environment. In this context, I would also briefly like to mention the ObSERVE programme. This programme which is being undertaken by my Department in partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service is unique to Ireland in its proactive approach to ensuring that the best possible information is available with respect to protected marine species. This will mean that both regulatory authorities and the petroleum industry are well placed to make decisions in an environmentally robust and sustainable manner. It is particularly satisfying that the two international consortia that successfully tendered for this work were led by Irish research institutions and that Ireland’s national research vessel operated by the Marine Institute will play a key role. The ObSERVE programme will see extensive aerial surveys being undertaken by a team of researchers led by University College Cork. In parallel, a research team being led by Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology will deploy special underwater acoustic devices from the RV Celtic Voyager in Ireland’s offshore canyon systems, to explore their importance for whales and dolphins. I am pleased that this innovative Government initiative has been so positively received by industry. Returning to regulatory robustness with regard to safety, the offshore safety directive specifically provides for the institutional separation of regulatory functions relating to offshore safety and the environment from those functions that are focused on the economic development of offshore resources, such as licensing and revenue management; a goal-setting approach in major accident prevention based on thorough risk assessment and reliable management systems; clarity on environmental liability in the event of a major accident; and emergency preparedness and response arrangements. The deadline for the transposition of the directive is 19 July 2015. The Bill is a relatively short one as the approach to transposition involves integrating the directive requirements with the safety regulatory system for oil and gas exploration, and production activities in Ireland introduced under the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act 2010. The 2010 Act conferred the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, with responsibility for the safety regulation of petroleum exploration and extraction activities in Ireland, including a requirement for the CER to establish and implement a petroleum safety framework. The petroleum safety framework is the system that the CER uses to regulate the safety of petroleum activities carried out by petroleum undertakings licensed to carry out petroleum exploration and extraction activities. The framework was designed In line with best international practice with petroleum undertakings required to reduce all safety risks to the internationally accepted level that is as low as is reasonably practicable, ALARP. In conferring this new responsibility on the CER, the 2010 Act gave effect to a key recommendation of the report produced by Advantica following its safety review of the Corrib gas pipeline. At that time, Advantica had recommended that a new risk assessment-based safety framework with respect to gas pipelines, in line with best international practice, should be developed and implemented in Ireland.This approach is now the commonly accepted methodology for managing safety worldwide. The Commission for Energy Regulation has successfully operated the petroleum safety framework since December 2013. The key requirements of the directive are broadly analogous with the provisions of the 2010 Act. These requirements are the institutional separation of safety regulation from the economic development of oil and gas resources and a goal-setting approach to major accident prevention. A significant element of the transposition of the directive involves the introduction of consistent terminology and language. The main regulatory implications of the directive that are required to be addressed in the Bill are the establishment of a national competent authority, provision for the assessment of potential major environmental hazards offshore within the scope of the safety case regime, clarity on industry liability in the event of a major accident, and specific obligations to be placed on both operators and owners of petroleum infrastructure. Before turning to the detail of the Bill, I refer to hydraulic fracturing, an issue about which Deputies might be concerned in the context of these proposals To clarify, the directive the Bill seeks to transpose relates only to oil and gas activities offshore. As such, it is concerned solely with the safety regime applying to petroleum exploration and production activities in the offshore area and has no implications whatsoever for unconventional gas exploration and exploitation. I shall now outline the detail of this quite technical Bill. For the convenience of the House, a detailed explanatory memorandum has been published, which provides a synopsis of the Bill’s provisions. There are 24 sections in the Bill. Part IIA of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, as amended by the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act 2010, relates exclusively to the regulation of petroleum activities by the commission. Almost all of the sections of this Bill amend Part IIA of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, save for section 23, which amends the Petroleum and Other Mineral Development Act 1960, and section 24, which amends the Continental Shelf Act 1968. I will deal first with all the sections amending Part IIA of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 before dealing with sections 23 and 24. Section 1 is a standard provision concerning definitions. Section 2 replaces section 13A of Part IIA of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 with a new interpretation section that is consistent with the terminology and language of the directive. Key new definitions include those for "operator" and "owner". Currently, under Part IIA, statutory safety responsibilities are placed on petroleum undertakings as licensee only. The directive provides for three related regulated entities, namely, the licensee, operator and owner, each of which has different responsibilities. The definitions of "operator" and "owner" in the Bill enable the obligations under the directive to be placed on the relevant entity and integrated with the existing safety regulatory framework for petroleum safety. These obligations are reflected in various sections throughout the Bill. Section 3 inserts a new section 13GA, which establishes the CER as the independent competent authority under the directive where it prescribes the functions of the competent authority. The principal objective of the CER as competent authority is the effective safety regulatory oversight of operator and owner compliance in reducing the risk and potential consequences of major accidents offshore to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable. Section 4 replaces the existing section 13H with a new section 13H which integrates the competent authority functions under section 5 and the directive requirements within the context of the CER's general petroleum safety functions. The matters to be considered by the CER in carrying out its functions are also set out and include minimising the potential for overlap or duplication of effort. Emergency preparedness and response constitute an important element of the directive. In accordance with the Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act 1999, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is responsible for preparing a national contingency plan which specifies the measures to be taken by the State resulting from discharges of oil from ships, offshore units and oil-handling facilities. Offshore units operating in the State are required to have in place a plan for the prevention and minimisation of damage arising out of an oil pollution incident occurring on an offshore unit or oil-handling unit facility. This plan is called the oil pollution emergency plan. Responsibility for administration of the national contingency plan and assessment of oil pollution emergency plans is a matter for the Irish Coast Guard. Section 5 further strengthens the existing emergency preparedness and response arrangements through inserting a new section 13HA, which provides the CER with the power to direct industry to conduct emergency exercises and tests and take adequate measures to ensure the continuing safety of designated petroleum activities. Section 6 amends section 13I to align with the terminology and language of the directive. Section 13I requires the CER to establish and implement a risk-based petroleum safety framework through which it will exercise its petroleum safety functions. As set out, the CER has successfully operated the petroleum safety framework established under the 2010 legislation since December 2013. Section 7 which deals with obligations on petroleum undertakings, operators and owners inserts three new sections, 13KA, 13KB and 13KC, to reflect the general and specific obligations of each of the three related regulated entities under the directive. These are: the licensee, described in the 2010 Act as the "petroleum undertaking"; the operator, who is appointed by the licensee to carry out oil and gas operations; and the owner, who is the legal entity with operational control of the non-production installation. Key obligations on petroleum undertakings include the appointment of an operator prior to the carrying out of any designated petroleum activity and financial liability for the prevention and remediation of environmental damage caused by offshore petroleum activities carried out pursuant to a petroleum authorisation. Key obligations on operators include ensuring the risk of all major accident hazards in carrying out designated petroleum activities is reduced to a level that is as low as is reasonably practicable. Key obligations on owners include ensuring the risk of all major accident hazards related to the non-production installation carrying out designated petroleum activities is reduced to a level that is as low as is reasonably practicable. Section 8, concerning safety case guidelines, replaces section 13L with a new section that requires the contents of the safety case guidelines published by the CER to be consistent with the specific information requirements of the directive. Sections 9 to 11, inclusive, replace the existing sections 13M, 13N and 13O with new sections 13M, 13N and 13O which impose an obligation to submit a safety case. Section 12, which concerns notifications, sets out the regulatory process for the submission, assessment and acceptance or refusal of design notifications and combined-operation notifications by operators to the CER in accordance with the offshore safety directive. Sections 13 and 14, on safety permits and the refusal or revocation of those permits, amend the existing sections 13P and 13Q to reflect the CER's assessment of safety cases submitted by operators and, where relevant, owners, and the capacity of the operator or owner, as appropriate, to carry out a designated petroleum activity. Sections 15 to 18, inclusive, amend the existing sections 13S, 13T, 13U and 13V and relate to the notification of petroleum incidents to the CER by operators or owners, the further investigation and-or taking of enforcement action by the CER regarding the notified petroleum incident, and the issuance of a report by the CER to the Minister with respect to each petroleum incident that results in the loss of human life, serious personal injury, damage to third party property or a major accident. This section also makes it an offence for an operator or owner not to comply with its obligation to notify the CER of a petroleum incident. Section 19 which deals with improvement plans and notice amends the existing sections 13Y and 13Z to extend the existing power of the CER to issue a direction requiring the submission of an improvement plan or the serving of an improvement notice upon petroleum undertakings to apply to operators and owners. Section 20, concerning access to safety case information, amends the existing section 13AC to put the obligation on the relevant operator to provide a mechanism by which a copy of the accepted safety case can be made available to any member of the public who requests it. Section 21 which sets out miscellaneous amendments makes a number of consequential amendments to the Act of 1999 to, among other things, extend the CER's existing enforcement powers to apply to operators and owners in addition to petroleum undertakings and enable the CER to charge operators and owners a safety case fee. Section 22 amends the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 to require an assessment by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources of the technical and financial capability of applicants for an offshore petroleum authorisation in line with the offshore safety directive. This section also makes provision for ministerial approval of the appointment of an operator proposed by a petroleum undertaking.  Section 23, an amendment to section 6 of the Continental Shelf Act 1968, modifies the definition of a "designated area" under that Act to align with Article 6(7) of the directive, which requires the establishment of a safety zone in the vicinity of an offshore installation. Section 24 makes the usual provision for Short Title and citation. The Bill is an important measure in the continued strengthening of the overarching regulatory framework governing offshore exploration for oil and gas and the production thereof in Ireland. The Bill comprehensively transposes the relevant directive in a manner that will enhance the safety of the Irish offshore oil and gas sector, build on the regulatory model successfully implemented in December 2013 under the 2010 Act and operate at least cost to the industry and the public service.This legislation will contribute to the achievement of the policy objective of a safe offshore petroleum exploration and extraction industry in Ireland. I hope this outline of the provisions of the Bill has been of assistance. I look forward to listening carefully to the views of the Members of this House on this important legislation and to their assistance in progressing this Bill into law prior to the directive transposition deadline of 19 July 2015. Táim ag súil go mór le ceisteanna agus le moltaí na Seanadóirí.
#MarkDaly	unknown-#MarkDaly-party	unknown-#MarkDaly-dob	unknown-#MarkDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	117	I welcome the Minister of State and the delayed Bill to the Seanad. As the Minister of State will be aware, only 2% of the laws made in this country every year actually come before the Dáil and the Seanad. Most of the laws that come into effect in Ireland are EU directives, EU regulations or statutory instruments, signed by Ministers directly into Irish law and they never receive the scrutiny they deserve. This is one of the few occasions when a directive has to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas to be scrutinised before being passed. However, as we see, we have less than four weeks to do it, even though the directive started out in 2013. This and previous Governments have failed to put in place systems in this House, meaning that directives from the European Union, many of which are excellent and much needed, are only dealt with at the last minute and do not receive the scrutiny they require. In 2009 there were 47 Acts of the Oireachtas, yet there were more than 1,200 EU regulations, 547 EU directives and nearly 600 statutory instruments. The legislators only looked after 47 Acts and the rest were done by Ministers and civil servants. The Bill is to be welcomed. In the light of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico where nearly 8,000 barrels a day, which is nearly 100,000 litres, disappeared in the first 24 hours, increasing to 6 million litres per day at the height of the disaster, obviously it is very important to have legislation of this nature. With the estimated 10 billion barrels, 1 trillion litres, in oil and gas reserves off the Irish coast, having a proper safety and regulatory system is important. The Minister of State outlined the Bill excellently. When industry welcomes a Bill introducing safety regulation, we should be concerned. While the Minister of State has said there is no cost to the Exchequer, was any regulatory impact assessment carried out? The programme for Government promised that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would carry out regulatory impact assessments of Bills such as this. Obviously, we do not want to put an undue burden on oil and gas industries or suppliers, but it is important to know what the regulatory impact assessment would be. I have concern over the decommissioning of oil and gas platforms. It is great for the taxpayer that we would get the revenue from it. However, if a company decides to fold its tent and close up its operations in Ireland, there is no entity to chase for the decommissioning of the platform. In fact, all the money we might have got from the taxation and the levies applied on the industry would then be spent on decommissioning oil and gas platforms. I believe the Minister of State will also be concerned that certain sections of the Bill refer to a maximum amount of money to be applied in fines. The term "as low as is reasonably practicable" is very much open to interpretation. I know that they are talking about best practice, but I am sure other jurisdictions would have a definition of what is "as low as is reasonably practicable" regarding the prevention of major accidents offshore. We do not have much time. I know this is a little like Committee Stage. We will ram through Committee Stage and I do not blame the Minister of State for that; it is just the way the Bill has come in. Section 8 deals with safety case guidelines. It refers to "the appropriate technical principles and specifications relating to ... decommissioning of ... infrastructure". Should a bond not be put in place whereby as the Department gives out a licence it also asks the company to put a bond in place in order that if it goes to the wall at least we would be able to get the money from the bondholder to decommission the infrastructure? The concern is that that would be a massive cost on the taxpayer into the future. I am concerned about the lack of sanction over not carrying out requirements by the new authority and also about a limit on the fines. One of the sections refers to "on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €3,000,000”. I do not know why we would limit an oil company to a fine not exceeding €3 million. The cost of the clean-up for the Gulf of Mexico disaster has now reached €14 billion and it has still not finished. Every now and again BP issues an announcement that the clean-up is finished and then the US Coast Guard states it is not done and there is still more clean-up being done. Section 15 deals with a reportable petroleum incident. That is why I highlighted the first 24 hours in the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The Bill refers to the requirement for "information and particulars as may be prescribed by the Commission, without delay, and no later than 24 hours after taking those measures". That relates to the reporting of an incident. One of the issues with the Deepwater Horizon incident was that it was not reported early. The fact that it went on for years was obviously a huge issue. Section 15(2) states that they do have to report anything within 24 hours and make the State aware. Failure to do this incurs a fine of €1 million. One hopes they would do it. These companies deal in trillions and we are imposing an on-the-spot fine that is equivalent to a parking fine for some of them. The Minister of State spoke about the issues of transparency. The Bill provides that "The Commission may, with the consent of the Minister, publish a non-confidential version of the reports". However, there are also confidential versions, which would lead to a lack of transparency. Obviously, I am concerned over the limited amount of time we have - we had two years to do this and we are doing it in four weeks. This has happened before and I have spoken many times in this House about the lack of process when it comes to what is essentially a good directive. I am not giving out about the concept of the directive, but we are missing opportunities, one of the most important of which is consequences for the operators not doing what they should do. We talk about the safety measures required, including fire tenders and other equipment, but do we actually have that in place? How many fire brigades would be required? Obviously, because it is mostly offshore, we will need boats that can deal with incidents at sea. The fire services are provided by the local authorities and do not have these boats hanging around the place. How many do we have? How many are required? If there is an incident and we do not have the equipment, whose fault is it? To bring it in from the Gulf of Mexico or the North Sea would take days. Those are the lessons that should have been learned from the Gulf of Mexico disaster - the equipment was not deployed in time. I wanted to make those points. I know that we are supposed to be discussing the generality of the Bill, but in reality we do not have much time to get this right.Counties Donegal and Kerry could be badly affected by oil rigs just sitting there, which has happened in California and other places because there is an issue around who is going to pay for them to disappear. We should have a bond system in place on which the Government at least would be able to call in the event of a company no longer being in existence, as that would mean there would be money to pay for the decommissioning of such rigs.
#TonyMulcahy	unknown-#TonyMulcahy-party	unknown-#TonyMulcahy-dob	unknown-#TonyMulcahy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	118	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh. First, I wish to point out that the Bill was published after the Government had signed off on it on the morning of 16 June. We were originally due to speak about it last Thursday. I was told the reason for the short notice was the delay in getting guidance from the European Commission on liability issues, yet we have to transpose the Bill into Irish Law by 19 July. Surely the Commission with all of its resources could have given this advice earlier. That is not a reflection on the Minister of State. This is a technical Bill which follows on from the EU offshore safety directive, Directive 2013/30 EU. One could ask what caused the European Union to introduce the directive. The answer simply is safety. Two particular tragic events have brought home to us why we need such legislation. The European Union reacted to the tragic deaths of 11 oil workers when there was an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon exploration rig in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. This oil production platform had a crew of 126 at the time of the explosion and the disaster could have been worse and resulted in a greater loss of life. It was also an environmental disaster. We must transpose the Bill into law to prevent such tragedies from happening in European waters. The Deepwater Horizon oil rig which had cost $560 million to build had only been in operation since 2001. It had been designed to operate in deep waters. Some of the oil and gas prospecting companies off the Irish coast also operate in very deep water. In September 2009 the Deepwater Horizon rig had successfully drilled the deepest oil well in history when it drilled to a vertical depth of 35,000 ft., in water that was more than 4,000 ft. deep. The rig was due to move to a new location when the explosion happened. The fireball was seen more than 40 miles away and resulted in the largest ever oil spill in US coastal waters. A US federal judge ruled in January this year that BP was responsible for the discharge of 3.2 million barrels of oil into the gulf. The clean-up could potentially cost $13.7 billion. In April 2010 the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, was made responsible for safety regulation after the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act was passed. It is ironic that the Act was passed when the Deepwater Horizon tragedy was unfolding. Closer to home, on 6 July 1988 the explosion on the Piper Alpha oil rig in the North Sea cost the lives of 167 oil workers. On the morning of 6 July a pressure safety valve was removed from a condensate pump for routine maintenance. The original paperwork stated pump A was due for routine service. It was one of two pumps on the rig used to pump oil 128 miles by pipeline to Scotland for refining. The on-duty engineer filled in a permit which stated pump A was not to be used under any circumstance. The day shift ended at 6 p.m., but, unfortunately, the engineer failed to inform the new shift of the off-line status of pump A. The paperwork was located in another part of the platform. At 9.45 p.m., a simple fault in the gas compression system resulted in a blockage in pump B and the pump could not be restarted. At 9.52 p.m., the shift manager found the original paperwork which stated pump A was due to be serviced, but he did not have the paperwork which stated it was now out of service and not to be used. He turned pump A back on, unaware of what was about to happen. Three minutes later, at 9.55 p.m., gas that flowed through the unsafe pump A leaked out and there was an explosion which caused several fires and further explosions. The flames from the fires could be seen 100 km away. It took three weeks for the fires to be put out by a team led by the famous firefighter, Red Adair. By 12.45 a.m. on the morning of 7 July the complete platform was destroyed, with the loss of 167 lives out of a total crew of 226. A simple breakdown in communication and bad safety procedures caused massive loss of life. That is why we need to have a vigorous safety enforcement regime in European waters to protect both workers and the environment.  The amendment to the 2010 legislation will further strengthen the current regulations governing offshore oil and gas operators. Safety inspections must be regular and robust. I urge the Minister of State to ensure that whatever resources are needed to ensure inspections take place are provided in order that we do not have more tragedies. I echo the point made on bonds by Senator Mark Daly who has left the Chamber. Having a bond is a good idea to ensure we can deal with the problem of left-over rigs. A fine of up to €3 million is very small money when it comes to the cost of cleaning up following an oil spill. I urge the Minister of State to consider these points when making his concluding remarks.

Tá brón orm go raibh mé beagán mall ag teacht anseo. Tá mé sásta go bhfuil an Rialtas tar éis admháil go raibh sé mí-cheart agus go raibh sé ag teacht isteach lena oiread fuadair agus lena oiread deifre air leis an reachtaíocht seo. Tá an reachtaíocht seo thar a bheith tábhachtach agus tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go bhfaighimid deis ceart é a phlé trasna an Tí. Directive 2013/30 EU which the Bill seeks to transpose into Irish law was published more than two years ago on 12 June 2013. We wondered why the Government had sought to rush the Bill through the House last week. There are certain elements in Irish society which are concerned when they see something about oil and gas, in particular, coming through with such haste. I am pleased that the Government has given us more time to ascertain the impact of the Bill on oil and gas operations in this country. It is not appropriate to carry out business in this House in that manner and I am pleased this has been acknowledged and that the Leader has provided more time for us to reflect on the legislation. This House has a history of rushing legislation through in a haphazard manner. The bailout of the banks and the winding down of IBRC immediately spring to mind. Neither does this House have a good record concerning offshore oil and gas safety operations. An example of where engagement with the community seriously failed is the Corrib gas project and the effect it had on the community of Rossport. The Rossport project is important because it involves a dispute about ownership and the use of natural resources. It illustrates the threats posed to local communities by a powerful coalition of State and capital interests and as a consequence raises serious questions about the link between politics and power. Locals opposed to the development frame their opposition in terms of safety and health. They claim the pressure of unprocessed gas in the pipeline will be too high; that the pipeline will be too close to people’s homes and that the environmental effects of gas transportation and processing will be devastating to the place, people and wildlife. They want the gas to be processed offshore. I note the sad death of Lars Wagner in a workplace incident in the Corrib gas tunnel in 2013. I wonder whether the Bill under discussion would have addressed the situation that led to his death. Has the Government received a full report on the incident and, if so, will it make it available to us? Landowners also took issue with a high pressured pipeline running through their land and protested against what they believed to be an infringement of their rights. As a result, in March 2005, Shell applied to the High Court for an order restraining landowners from interfering with the laying of the pipeline. An injunction was given and five local people were imprisoned for interfering with the work of Shell. These people became known as the Rossport Five. Many maintain that the Government was complicit in the failure to engage with the local community. Local people believe they were ignored by the Government and that private business was allowed a free hand in developing energy infrastructure as it wished. This European directive appears to be well meaning. We will examine it and introduce amendments on Committee Stage. In May 2012 the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communcations, Natural Resources and Agriculture published a fairly comprehensive report and made recommendations on the industry. I have not seen much progress by the Government on the issues raised. The 11 recommendations include the following: 1. Having good basic law in which policy principles are enshrined can greatly assist a country in developing and benefiting from its petroleum resources.There should be a clear and transparent fiscal and licensing regime, which provides certainty for the State and industry alike. The Joint Committee recommends that a simple and transparent system be put in place which is underpinned by clear law. To this end, the Petroleum and Other Minerals Act 1960
should be reviewed.2. Retrospective changes to fiscal and licensing terms can risk long-term reputational damage. Existing agreements should be adhered to irrespective of changing circumstances.In contrast, future agreements can reflect policy changes necessitated by significant changes in the policy context and circumstances, for example a large increase in the number of commercially viable finds or the size of fields.3. Recognising that fields may be subject to corporation tax and profit resource rent tax (PRRT), the State should seek to maximise tax revenues from petroleum exploration and production without deterring petroleum investment.In addition, the report stated: "4. The Joint Committee strongly believes that the State should keep fiscal and licencing terms under constant review." It concluded: The obtaining of geological data from all licensees is of paramount importance ... This would entail mandatory unified operations for a field extending over different contractual zones by different operators and offers advantages including better resource management.Eleven recommendations were made in total. Will the Minister of State, please, outline where we are in terms of their implementation? There is a great rush to get the Bill through the House. An Oireachtas joint committee's report has been sitting on the shelf since 2012 and it does not appear that any action has been taken. There has been a complete lack of action.There is a fear that in that void the oil companies are being laissez-faire. I note the Ballyroe oil find off the coast of Cork is 1.7 billion barrels. Can the Minister of State outline what other oil finds there may be and the potential tax income for the State? If the Government took on board the recommendations of the joint committee would there be a much greater income for the State? There were very specific recommendations around the tax take in particular and we need to ensure the natural resources of the State are used for the benefit of all the people and that the oil companies pay a greater share of the profits they make.

It seems to me that in some quarters one is damned if one does and one is damned if one does not. The legislation is in the House but not before its time and there is a deadline on it. It is important that it is passed in the interest of public safety, the people who work in the industry and, of course, the broader environmental issues that are at stake. In his address he set out in great detail the provisions of the Bill. On the face of it, the legislation that has emerged appears to be thorough and robust. It is vitally important that is transposed into Irish law. Senator Tony Mulcahy has set out two examples of the kinds of incidents that can occur with devastating and disastrous consequences for the workers and the environment. Therefore, any measures that can be put in place to prevent such incidents should be put in place. We have only to get these things wrong once and then it is too late. We are dealing with the area of prevention. Once an incident occurs it is too late to address it. Colleagues across the floor have made valid observations which should be taken into consideration. A bond is a good idea. Who is going to chase down the developers of the sector and the industry once a rig or a well has expired and run its course? It is important that the infrastructure is not left to rust at sea or in close proximity to the shoreline and whatever other infrastructure is in place. The onus is on anybody who has developed rigs and wells to put things back as they found them and to decommission the facilities properly. There have been incidents around the country where that has not always been the case. It has happened in the case of mining developments and in the chronic situation in Cork where the taxpayer continues to pick up the tab for restoring facilities in the former Irish Steel plant in Cork Harbour. Again, the taxpayer has had to clean up a really dangerous hazard and environmental mess left behind by the industry when it closed down. It is important we do not have these kinds of scenario. We have a pitiful record in terms of enforcement of regulations from child safety to financial regulation to charities regulation. I do not have any confidence whatsoever in the Environmental Protection Agency in terms of how it goes about its business. I am glad it is not the assigned authority in this instance. The CER has been selected as the competent authority. In terms of resources, competence, skill sets and staffing how will it police the legislation? How will it ensure compliance? In recent decades basic building regulations were not adhered to or respected. We can have all the rules and regulations we want but if they are not enforced and policed, they are virtually pointless. We found out after the building boom was over that only a small percentage of building developments were inspected by planners to ensure that the conditions that had been applied had been adhered to.  This is important, robust and timely legislation but it will not be worth the paper it is written on unless the competent authority, in this case the CER, has the resources to ensure and insist on compliance and that, as colleagues have pointed out, the penalties for non-compliance are sufficiently imposing to ensure shortcuts will not be taken. As we have noted in the House, the consequences for human life, wildlife, sea birds, fish stocks and the broader environment and ecosystems could be devastating in the extreme for generations to come should an accident occur. It is welcome that this legislation is before the House and it is important that we tease it out here, but my concern is that the regulations as set out should not be dealt with in a light touch, self-regulating or self-policing fashion. The CER should have the teeth, the personnel, the skill sets and the resources to police this legislation and to ensure it is enforced and complied with.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	121	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. The Minister has been a regular here for many years. We get on very well together and he puts a lot of effort into his work and it is good to see him back again. I note that this particular directive is about minimising risks of offshore accidents throughout the European Union, a move in the right direction, but I want to make some comments on the area of safety. I wonder if companies involved in risky operations could put up some sort of insurance in order that a quick clean-up operation could happen if an accident did occur. I understand that such companies would have insurance but perhaps there could be a dedicated environmental fund in case an accident that affected the environment occurred. Given that this is a directive, we have some flexibility on how the legislation is transposed into Irish legislation and perhaps we should include such a provision, particularly when we consider some of the disasters that have occurred in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska. Those large companies were probably well able to cover it but that would not always happen. If we were to approve some test for hydraulic fracturing in Ireland, we could get companies to pay into an environmental fund to give extra assurances, especially to the local population, that the environment around them would not be neglected. I heard what the Minister said earlier about fracturing, and I will come to that shortly. The new legislation calls for all EU member states to prepare external emergency response plans covering all offshore drilling installations within their authority. While I do not doubt that our national authorities can draw up such plans, I wonder if we have the necessary equipment to put them into practice. For instance, I know that if we had a spill we could rely on the Air Corps to do some sort of aerial assessment but could it do such a job even more effectively if it had resources such as more unmanned aerial vehicles on which to rely? I do not know. Someone can fly over it and see where it is but if we cannot do something about it, without getting access using boats or whatever, having the knowledge but not having the equipment would be a disadvantage. Being able to cope with possible offshore accidents may require more investment. The Minister of State might comment on that area. I was disappointed to hear the Minister of State say shale fracturing had no implications onshore in Ireland. I am disappointed that we are not even discussing it. We should discuss it. In terms of wider safety, this month, the Environmental Protection Agency said that its two year study into the safety issues linked with hydraulic fracturing for shale gas in Ireland is due to conclude in July 2016.That means that even if fracking was deemed safe, no exploratory application would likely be received until close to 2018. That seems to be a very lengthy period. I do not wish to sound as though I am encouraging, proposing or believing in it, but I believe we should be discussing the whole question of hydraulic fracturing and I do not think we are. In the United Kingdom the Prime Minister is aiming to cut red tape for companies which want to conduct exploratory hydraulic fracturing. I cannot say that fracking is either right or wrong but we are moving extremely slowly in this area. When one considers the benefits the United States has had since the 1940s and 1950s with practically no disadvantages, it seems to me they have been able to solve the oil and energy crisis on that basis. I believe we should be discussing it at least. Perhaps the Minister of State might be able to tell me whether we are planning to discuss it. Hydraulic fracturing has been around since the 1940s and it seems that Ireland will not go down that route, as things stand. It is really a taboo subject in a lot of ways. In spite of the fact that thousands of jobs could be created and we could drastically reduce our energy costs for both households and businesses, as well as reducing our reliance on energy imports, we have a culture of NIMBY, not in my back yard. Professor Quentin Fisher is an expert in this area who says that drilling a well is noisy and disruptive but after a few weeks only a building the size of a garden shed remains. He says that people may change their minds once they see how safe it is. I ask for the Minister of State's comments on hydraulic fracturing and safety. I am convinced that it is a topic we need to discuss and I am not sure that we are even taking the first steps towards a real discussion of it. In Britain they have decided and it was announced yesterday that they will initiate the process in Lancashire. Some people are not happy about it and there are some protests, but, on the other hand, it is the sort of decision we have to be discussing and I ask for the Minister of State's views.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	122	I thank Senators for their contributions. I agree it would be good to have a broad debate where people offer a critique. While this legislation is very specific, it provides an opportunity to discuss a number of items. Senator Mark Daly made a wider argument around the transposition of EU directives. I share his frustration. I refer to the 1992 habitats directive and the tensions which have arisen in his county and my county as a result of the directive being implemented and enforced. However, there is a deadline on the directive which we are discussing now. As Senator John Whelan pointed out, we have a deadline and our European partners share that deadline. The Senator referred to culpability for what happened in the Gulf of Mexico and issues associated with BP. He asked whether an assessment of the regulatory impact was undertaken. The 2010 Act provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation has responsibility to ensure we follow through with the commitments we gave under that legislation. The decommissioning of oil and gas platforms is an issue. While it is not within the remit of this legislation, it is important to have that discussion. It is an issue in the waters off the south coast of Cork. There have been four successful gas finds in this country. The momentum is good and positive with regard to the current Atlantic margin round which closes in mid-September and it is our success to date. The focus of the legislation is specific and narrow. I refer to the framework regarding culpability, liability and responsibility. Much of the work on the culpability conversation will happen after the Bill. An EU report on culpability and liability is due in the autumn. I would not like to see bigger companies coming together to establish an exclusive insurance bond for themselves only. We must ensure there is a level playing field for small companies. An in-depth conversation is needed in this regard. There is no outer limit on environmental costs. I will ask for further clarification on the figure of €3 million. Responsibility for a contingency plan lies with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The Irish Coast Guard has responsibility for the implementation of the contingency plan. Those of us of the same age were not part of the Internet generation and we were not brought up with broadband. That is certainly the case with regard to County Kerry and County Donegal. This is European legislation and an oil spill off the west coast of Ireland will need a collaborative approach from Europe. We can share resources as members of the European Union. That is outside the remit of this Bill but it is a conversation we could have. Senator Tony Mulcahy mentioned fines and the €3 million which I have dealt with. I appreciate his points about more time but unfortunately we have a strict deadline as this is important legislation. I note his points about the incident in the Gulf of Mexico and how to have a mitigating plan in place to avoid such situations. He referred to the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act 2010 and the recognition of the need for vigilance and a safety regime. He spoke about clean-up costs which are dealt with under section 22(2). The liability for environmental damage is not limited to €3 million as I mentioned in reply to Senator Mark Daly. The State will have to agree the liability for different operations. Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh raised a number of issues. He speaks as fast in English as he does in Irish-----

He covered many issues, including the general interaction with politics and power. Even in the health sector there is a jargon phrase, "clinical networking", meaning consultants, the pharma industry or health departments working together on solutions. From my short time in this Department I have noted the very strong collaborative spirit between industry and officials in efforts to work together to share resources and advice and ensuring environmental sustainability. The officials in my Department are working on behalf of the political representatives on behalf of the people. There is a high level of collaborative work on information about the sea bed. Ireland is the fourth largest country in Europe when one considers the geographical size of our land mass under the sea after France, Portugal and Spain. It is hoped that industry and officialdom can work together in assessing what is available and mitigate environmental damage. Wearing my other hat, this is very important within the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the National Parks and Wildlife Service working hand in glove with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the protection of wildlife or other habitats that could be affected as a result of industry-led development. The Senator referred to the death in Corrib. I will get the Senator information on that matter. Those in the best position to talk about what happened in Corrib are the people who live there. I had an opportunity to go to Bellanaboy and various parts of Bellmullet recently to hear a debate. As with any debate, there is passion on both sides. It was apparent to me that there were many economic benefits to the development. Certainly, there were lessons in terms of regulation and enforcement also. Many lessons have been learned. This has been a dragged-out project. When the operation is commissioned initially it will provide up to 40% of all our gas needs in the short term. There will be constraints on the fiscal potential or possibilities as a result of one thing and another in terms of a delay. It is important to move forward. Much work has gone on behind the scenes, including the Wood Mackenzie report. The work includes looking at readdressing the matter within the finance Bill this year, looking at the fiscal regime moving from 40% to 55% and looking at other ways of trying to get revenue once production starts. That relates to future finds and does not affect existing finds. We need to consider the context as well. A drill can cost upwards of €200 million. Is the State prepared to put that type of investment into a risk that may find an empty field? We need to keep in mind all these considerations. We can learn from it, and we must put community to the heart of any new development. I will digress a little. Let us consider wind farms. There are wind farms in my county. The Donegal local authority gets over €1.2 million in development charges or a rate base per annum. At a local or micro level there are probably better, smarter and more clever ways of trying to ensure that communities get the dividend as well. We can learn from this. I do not agree with the comments on a laissez-faire attitude to companies. Within the narrow confines of this legislation, companies must have a contingency plan and consider risk assessment. They will have to show that they are prepared for a possible failure, if that happens. Senator John Whelan commented on how we need to learn from our history. In our short history we have learned from the building boom. We know that a serious lack of oversight and a laissez-faire attitude led to what happened today. I met a developer in Letterkenny recently. He has welcomed the new regulations on building control. This will cost him more, delay his project and his profits will be reduced, but he has welcomed the new regulations. The point is that we can learn from what has happened within the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in respect of regulation. That is what we are trying to do in this Bill also. Senator John Whelan referred to decommissioning. The matter is outside this legislation. I appreciate his comments on trying to get this legislation through. I note the Senator's observations on the Environmental Protection Agency and his confidence in the Commission for Energy Regulation. I do not agree with the former observation, but I acknowledge the fact that there are areas where we can do better. The CER has been doing this work since 2010. The commission has been acting as an oversight body and it is important to note this. A good point was made about resources and skillsets. Do we have the necessary resources? How do we police the legislation? How do we ensure an appropriate monitoring system? How do we ensure compliance? The CER is a competent authority and has the resources. Our Department has been recruiting experts in the relevant fields. The Department aspires towards looking at different skill-sets in different parts of Europe. Let us consider the example of civil servants in Norway and the United Kingdom. Perhaps we might be clever or smarter in looking at exchange programmes to bring that skill-set into this country. For example, pre-2008 officials from Denver, Colorado engaged with counterparts in Germany and Denmark to try to build up a skill-set around renewable energy. There may be clever ways of doing that. Officials within the Department are looking at those areas and I acknowledge this. I thank Senator Feargal Quinn for welcoming me back to the House. I am pleased to be here again. The critique offered in this House is as good as ever and I acknowledge the Senator's contribution. He referred to the offshore fund and whether the fund was a parent company. Much of that will have to be worked out post this legislation. This is an opportunity to offer suggestions on the matter. Senator Feargal Quinn also referred to unconventional hydraulic extraction. I did not use the word "fracking", but the Senator is right in that is exactly what it is. As he is aware, a report has been commissioned. A particular company or agency is involved but it is a multifaceted approach and involves universities and third level expertise, North and South. I look forward to the outcome of the report. I agree with the Senator that in the meantime the debate should continue. Politicians are not precluded from debating the matter and perhaps there is an opportunity to do this. Whatever the report shows up, it will be the outcome of two main pillars in terms of concern, that is to say, human impact and environmental concerns. The report will also consider the geology and whether it is conducive or otherwise to carrying out this particular procedure. We need to look at all of these factors and feed in to the process at a political level. I agree that the debate should continue. I made a reference to financial liability. A report is due in the autumn in this regard. I will ensure my officials will present the House with the findings from the European Union in the autumn. I thank the Acting Chairman and acknowledge the patience of Members in recent days.

When I stood up to speak, there was only one other Senator in the House and the Acting Chairman, which also puts it in perspective. However, that does not represent the way people feel in this country. Dublin is the capital city of Ireland and as such it affects every single citizen in the country. It is a totally parochial place. I invite Members to look at O'Connell Street which is an utter mess. Forty years ago, Jim Mitchell, a former Lord Mayor of Dublin said Dublin had about as much character as a second-hand knacker's yard. If one looks at O'Connell Street now, what does one find on it? Knicker shops, amusement arcades, fast food joints, tatty souvenir shops and derelict sites. This is the principal street in our capital city and it is an absolute reproach. For that reason, I am calling on the Government to establish a commission to oversee the rejuvenation of Dublin. Nothing less will work. The local authorities have proven themselves absolutely powerless and, not only that, they have intervened to prevent central allocation of responsibilities. In 1986 a Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission was established but under the impetus of Mr. Bertie Ahern, who was on the council at the time, Mr. Charlie Haughey abolished it because it was feared it might detract power from the city council. It is all about politics and power. No one cares about the city of Dublin in and for itself. Virtually every intervention made by Dublin City Council makes it worse, with one exception. I pay tribute to one section of the local authority, namely the cleaning section. The cleaning of O'Connell Street is quite extraordinary because we are a genuinely filthy nation. We are a filthy race of people, but O'Connell Street is kept really clean and wholesome all the time. Forty years ago Mr. Jim Mitchell made the aforementioned comment about Dublin, 30 years ago we had the Dublin crisis conference and six months ago I raised this matter in this House. A couple of months ago one of the houses on North Frederick Street that I spoke about and have been speaking about for years actually collapsed. That is the degree of attention to detail in Dublin City Council. I went for a walk around with The Irish Times and pointed to the extraordinary profusion of black litter bags with no tags on them. There were up to a dozen such bags on some doorsteps. I received a copy of a report from Dublin City Council which found that there was no litter problem. There is no litter problem; none at all. Sure how would there be a litter problem? A dozen black bags on the front steps of a house does not constitute a litter problem. There is no enforcement whatsoever. People own properties, subdivide them and there is no enforcement in terms of maintenance or anything else. Even in terms of planning there are no restrictions on, for example, putting grotesque plastic fly-out windows on eighteenth century buildings instead of the proper up and down sash windows. Quite a number of years ago, after a passionate intervention on my part, the former Deputy Albert Reynolds included three and half pages in his budget outlining grants for the restoration of 18th century buildings in the city of Dublin. However, by the time it hit reality, it had been hedged around with so many qualifications by the Department of Finance that only one person took it up. In recent years I have spoken passionately again on this subject at budget time and have persuaded the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, to do something. He produced the Living City initiative but in its first manifestation, what did it do? It dealt with Limerick and Waterford and deliberately and specifically excluded Dublin. Now we have a new manifestation of it with a limit of 230 sq. m, which deliberately excludes the 18th century core of Georgian buildings in Dublin. Even the smallest Georgian buildings are above that limit. That this was done deliberately was made clear by a spokesperson for the Department of Finance. A document from the Revenue Commissioners states the floor area of property must be between 38 and 210 sq. m. If the property comprises an apartment contained within a larger building, it is only the floor area which is relevant and not the entire building. The document goes on to refer to dividing up buildings. The Government's plan is to force Dublin's inner city core back into tenements. Is anyone actually thinking this through? The overwhelming majority of Georgian houses will be excluded from the initiative. A departmental spokesperson said that the aim of the initiative is not to create a tax relief for mansion-type properties. We were not excluded from the property tax. People who devoted years of their lives and huge sums of money to restoring these buildings were rewarded by not being excluded but by being hit with the property tax. Now we are hit by this further exclusion such that we cannot make use of the scheme. Georgian houses will only be eligible for inclusion in the scheme if they are subdivided and sold off as apartments. There is a commercial angle also because they always get the little commercial angle in. Effectively, any dodgy modern unit can be incentivised for a capital upgrade for retail or service use anywhere in Dublin city or the other cities within the designated areas. It is extraordinary. This is going directly against the objectives which I put down. I know because I was the initiator of this scheme, but it looks as if the will of the Oireachtas is being deliberately frustrated by some ideologically driven civil servant in the lower ranks of the Civil Service. A report entitled, The Changing Face of Dublin's Inner City, commissioned by the Dublin Inner City Partnership argues:...changes in the inner city resulted in ... the closure of facilities such as schools, institutions and community services, and a loss of vitality as the more dynamic members of the population vacated the city centre, either as a result of public policy or natural trends. It also contributed to the decline of the physical fabric of the city, as old industrial sites, institutions and the older housing fabric were left to decay. The deterioration of the physical environment was exacerbated by the blight caused by long-term roads proposals and by inadequate conservation policies or rehabilitation incentives.There are no incentives at all for people in the inner city. I am calling for the establishment of a commission. In the 18th century there was the Wide Streets Commission which gave us the beautiful buildings we are deliberately and scandalously neglecting. We had a pavements commission. When one looks at pavements all over Dublin, they are an absolute threat to people's lives. I walk quite a lot in Dublin and the pavements are uneven, broken, cracked and part of them are tarmacked. They are a thundering disgrace in a capital city. There is also a north-south divide. If one looks at Dublin City Council's publication, it refers to the future of the south Dublin core. It does not give a tuppenny toss about the north inner city where there is the best Georgian architecture. The Dublin city development plan 2016 to 2022 asks how we can release the economic potential of Georgian quarters and so on, as set out in the publication which refers to future of the south Dublin core. The Z6 employment zone includes office districts in the city centre, for example, Harcourt Street. Everything relates to the southside. It goes on to refer to Dublin City Council’s aim of identifying and protecting special quarters of the city’s historic features. It talks about the Parnell Square cultural project, which includes proposals to provide a variety of public cultural facilities, including a new public library. That has gone down the drain, but on the south Georgian side the council has a policy approach to stimulate the revitalisation of this part of the city where residential accommodation can again have a common use. As stated in the Irish Independent, as anybody who takes the time to walk around the area stretching from the River Liffey to the North Circular Road in the capital knows, it is a mess of dereliction. If the same were the case in the expanse from the River Liffey to the South Circular Road, there would be uproar. Look at the way shops are treated. Any old rubbish is good enough for the north inner city, but there are controls for the facades, facias and shop fronts of the south inner city. One then has the absence of owner occupiers. Owner-occupiers are being actively and deliberately deterred by the city authorities. That is what a living city means. I will finish on this point for the time being, but I will speak further when I have an opportunity to reply. In the context of such an ordinary thing as dog dirt, where on the northside will one see pooper scoopers? Where will one see notices about litter? I live in North Great George’s Street. It is quite extraordinary to me to have to wade through mounds of dog crap and not have a single notice or pooper scooper. I have never seen one on the north side of the city; they are all on the south side of the city. It is considered to be targeted enforcement. Dublin City Council has introduced targeted enforcement measures for dog litter offences, including the provision of specific advice and other such blather, but it all relates to the southside. Dog litter signs have been erected, but they are all on the southside. I have plenty more to say, in particular about traffic arrangements. There are two Luas systems that are not joined, about which I protested at the time. There is no spur to the airport and now we have a third Luas project, with the city in chaos. What they should have done was build an underground and we nearly had it when people lost their nerve under the influence of the environmental correspondent of The Irish Times. We have this mad notion of cyclists. Does anybody make sure those who use the blue bikes wear helmets? I thought it was a legal requirement to wear a helmet. They cycle on the pavements, against the red lights and the wrong way on streets. They are a danger. What about those who legitimately drive their cars? I pay €2,000 car tax a year to be confined in my own little prison on North Great George’s Street.  I will have more to say at the end of the debate.

He lives in North Great George’s Street and what a great job he has done by giving it courage, enthusiasm, commitment and a belief in itself. Life has come into it. I wish to talk about breathing life into cities as a whole. Senator David Norris’s focus was very much on Georgian Dublin, but there are many good initiatives from which we can learn and about which we can do something. The Living City initiative is a great project to breathe life into some of our beautiful buildings and wider city life. We are luckier in this country than in some others that had their buildings destroyed during wars or were replaced by huge, ugly communist apartment blocks.

They have gone to rack and ruin. Perhaps in the case of the Duke of Wellington’s house it is too far gone, but a house such as Montgomery’s could be turned into a major tourist attraction. Perhaps we need to think about houses that are in need of restoration and not located just in cities. We need to think about breathing life into our cities in a wider sense and certainly into Dublin. I have called previously for planners to realise Dublin needs to convert some retail or vacant property into housing, a matter on which Senator David Norris touched. That is an important element of what should happen. The Government should remove red tape and ease planning regulations in order that vacant or under-used buildings could be used to address the housing shortage. The council should also consider the reintroduction of the living over the shop scheme to increase the residential use of city centre streets. I was pleased to read that last week the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV, had stated tax relief could and should be used to convert non-viable commercial buildings into livable ones. The incoming president of IPAV, Mr. Eamon O’Flaherty, said thousands of old grocery stores, butchers', bakers' and other small outlets that had become vacant since the crash might never be used as shops again. He also said such a move would have multiple knock-on effects on the local economy and communities. He further said, “The first to see the lift would be local tradesmen and women, next would be retail outlets and then the schools.” In other words, we could bring life back into the cities by getting people to live there. We should look at this issue. In countries such as France apartments are located above and around shops in town and city centres and there is life in town centres throughout the day and night. Here, we allow developers to plonk apartment blocks in out of the way locations, with very few or no amenities close to them. We need more footfall in town centres and to have people living above shops. That would change the position to a considerable extent. The fact is that if more professional people lived in towns, they would spend their money there and keep the local economy alive. That should be a fundamental of planning in order that Dublin and other cities would become even more vibrant in the future. In talking about breathing life into cities we need to think about the role retailers play. The Government should set the conditions in order that Dublin would be home to small, vibrant and original retailers. I was in Dún Laoghaire recently, in the Glasthule area. It is a joy to walk through the area because none of the shops is a chain store. There are all individual shops and there are no vacant shops. They bring life to the place. As Senator David Norris said, one then drives into Dún Laoghaire town centre where the main street, George’s Street, is dead. We can do something about this. We could put life into it, but we must do something. The Government should set the conditions in order that Dublin would be home to small, vibrant and original retailers. When walking around Belfast or Derry, one could be walking around Leeds or Manchester, given that they have been flooded with the same all-conquering UK retailers. Dublin should do everything to avoid becoming a cardboard cut-out of high streets in the United Kingdom. In order to do this, there should be some incentives for very small retailers to set up shops in Dublin. I was in Vienna recently and while walking around the streets there I was amazed to see tiny restaurants seating ten people, speciality record shops and a shop window displaying handmade furniture. It reminded me of Glasthule. The Austrians set the rent at a low fixed rate to allow small and unique businesses to survive. If they paid normal rates, they would not be viable. In Paris every arrondissement or district has its own shopping streets on which one can find an amazing selection of butchers, bakers and fishmongers.If Dublin was able to foster such a diversity of shops it would attract many more people into the city. Customers are very attracted by aspirational shopping and we need speciality retailers to fill this gap in the market. Centuries ago, Dublin had a mixture of shops, craftsmen and merchants and we could get back to that concept. The Government should provide a tax rebate to SMEs in this area if they have profits of less than €20,000 per year. If NAMA has properties which have been vacant for over a year these small businesses could avail of these, rent-free, for a certain period to see if their businesses were viable. I believe incentivising small, speciality shops with schemes like the Living City initiative would be a great way of attracting more life into Dublin and avoid this life being transferred somewhere else. This is not a debate to cause a difference of opinion but is intended to move people and to get people thinking. I think Senator David Norris will achieve a great deal and I rely on the Minister to respond appropriately.

He has always had a passion for the city and we know what he has in North Great George's Street. There is a lot in this motion about Georgian Dublin and the Living City initiative, about Dublin's transport system, housing development and environmental issues. We could take each one on its own and have a full debate about what should be done. The Senator says he feels imprisoned in his house, but I congratulate him on what he has done in the area of preservation. I live on the southside, but I would not mind swapping for North Great George's Street any day. There is a need for the Government to produce a master plan and we must have an overarching vision for the city and region. In Dublin City Council and all councils in the past much of the planning was developer-led, rather than planning-led. That should not have happened but it did. We fought against a lot of it but some of it was not fought against and that is where planning went wrong. There has been a sea change in planning since this Government came to power. The chapter on the Dublin city development plan and on shaping the city is very good. It is only a new plan and the consultation process has just finished. It discusses urban form, density, height as part of the shape of the city, the connected city, urban design and, most important, the type of architecture and the preservation of architecture. We fell down on preservation, big time, in years gone by.

We have seen a doughnut effect in Dublin over the years as people moved out and took the life away from the city and into the suburban areas. It should not have happened, but it did. It should be and is being addressed now in the new city development plan 2016-22, in which there is a new emphasis. One could not possibly read it all but I have read a lot of it, as I have the issues paper that was put together in 2014. Environmental matters and city transport, which are last in Senator David Norris's motion, are very important. I will leave that element to Senator Pat O'Neill.

It is important to consider how we use sustainable energy and new technologies and we are preparing a climate change Bill. We should explore how we can have sustainable energy in buildings and every Government has to take into consideration how Government buildings use sustainable energy and sustainable technologies. Departments and other such buildings should take the lead in this. Smarter travel, sustainable transport and such things are also important. We should revisit the Living City initiative. That was a property tax incentive scheme applying in certain centres of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford as designated by the Minister for Finance. When one wants something done it is good to incentivise people to do it.

One has displacement, incentives, out of town developments and other things which did not work. Intervention sometimes does more harm than good but one has to plan. Housing is an important element. The docklands is a huge area in the city and there was a master plan for the new Dublin docklands, although whether it went far enough or high enough is open to debate. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has said the docklands have the potential to be the Canary Wharf of Dublin. Until very recently planners believed it could take ten years or more to develop residential property but now they think it could happen much more quickly and the Government has incentivised them by providing money. In my own south Dublin council area, €37 million was provided recently to kickstart a housing programme to address the shortage of housing resulting from the recovery. The master plan for the docklands emphasised the importance of providing at least three-bedroomed apartments suitable for families. Senator David Norris said we would be providing tenements, but although demographic studies suggest the biggest demand is for smaller, two-bedroomed units, we have to ensure families are catered for in the city. They were not catered for heretofore, but now we are providing for the housing needs of all.

I compliment Senators Sean D. Barrett and David Norris on tabling the motion. Unless there are some people who are passionate about issues such this and prepared to give leadership in a consistent way, this would fall between two stools. In the main, the planning code in Ireland has a lot to recommend it. Many planning officials throughout the country are exceptionally diligent in their work, but during the Celtic tiger we saw situations about which one could not really have been happy, whether in towns or in cities. In view of rapid development in cities, particularly Dublin, very often the economic requirements and the opportunities took precedence over good planning.Senator David Norris cites an exceptionally good case, the main street of Dublin, O'Connell Street. I do not think any of us is overly happy about it. One wonders what visitors to the country think when they are on it. They know about the country's exceptional heritage and the custodial approach we take to it. I would say they are somewhat surprised that we have allowed things to get out of hand to the extent they have. Why do people take on a pioneering role on an issue such as this? There is no better example than Senator David Norris when it comes to Georgian Dublin. He is not just an advocate, he is also a very proactive campaigner. One of the reasons is that we all like to have an environment that makes us feel good and that we can enjoy to the maximum. It is a sense of pride in ourselves as a people that we want to protect our heritage, architectural, cultural and otherwise. It would be a sad day if we were ever to lose that sense of place and that sense of pride. Senator David Norris refers in the motion to the Living City initiative which was first announced in October 2012. Almost three years on it has not been implemented. One of the main reasons for this was the stalling of European aid. That was the marker put down at the time. The constraints now being put on the initiative are absolutely huge because it is quite clear that Georgian buildings will not benefit from the initiative because it will be about inner city development in areas where there are high rates of unemployment. When constraints are applied to a living city initiative, it certainly does not augur well for the future. It should be borne in mind that we have had living city initiatives in the past, of which there was not a great take-up and they did not succeed as a result. I have grave doubts that this initiative will succeed, through no fault of the Government. Progress has been made in all other cities in Ireland. Negotiations with the Revenue Commissioners are at a very advanced stage on what will qualify for the tax exemption. However, it seems that things will move at a very slow pace, particularly if the bottom line is profit, as will be the case when one is talking about working on buildings and those who will invest in this work. They will look at the bottom line on the balance sheet which will decide what progress will be made. The motion moves outside that box, which is a good idea. It asks not Dublin City Council but also the Government to come up with a master plan.  The first reaction of any government is to state the matter is within the remit of the local authority. One third of the population of Ireland is in Dublin which is not like any of the other cities. It requires exceptional radical attention in the areas being discussed. It behoves the Government, with all of our support in adding in any way we can to the debate in a positive way, to take on board the spirit of the motion. If not, there will still be people campaigning but without resources and legislative back-up. People who campaign are very often seen as marginal. Some of us showed the same passion when discussing the issue of Moore Street not so long ago. We were arguing in the context of its historical significance. We went the extra mile in arguing a development of Moore Street could have huge economic value. I would say the very same about Georgian Dublin, even though that is not the main reason which is motivating us to make a case here today. However, it is an important one because, after all, if it is a tourist attraction, if it is high on people's list of places to visit, we are talking about a financial investment. If we want to argue what it might cost to do what is being requested, we should look at the money that would be generated. I will go one step further - I do not want to be defeatist in any way - and say if we do not do it, we will be the poorer for it as a people. We will also be the poorer for it economically because our heritage will be gradually eroded and downgraded such that, eventually, people will ask how did we let it happen. We know full well that what helped us to succeed in the past in tourism was that we focused on that which made us different. We focused on our exclusive heritage, not something one could get in New York, Paris or anyplace else. What motivates Senators David Norris, Sean D. Barrett and Feargal Quinn is what is unique to us. The worst thing that can happen is that in years to come we will be crying that we did not do it. The issue is now on the agenda and I hope the motion will be passed if the Government enters into a partnership with us in what we are trying to achieve.

It is always a pleasure to have her in the House and I thank her for attending to respond to the debate. I commend Senators David Norris and Feargal Quinn for proposing and seconding the motion which provides a very good opportunity for the House to debate this important issue of the Living City initiative, in the context of Dublin in particular, in a collegiate and constructive manner. Both Senators spoke with immense eloquence about the necessity to preserve Dublin and ensure it remained a living city and the need to strengthen and support the Living City initiative. However, I take issue with Senator David Norris on one point - I know that he will appreciate that I must do so - to defend the cycling community in Dublin.

One of the really important success stories in the regeneration of central Dublin in recent years has been the dublinbikes initiative which was originated by my colleague, Labour Party councillor Andrew Montague. It has gone from strength to strength and the number of bikes is expanding. There has been a great increase in the number of people cycling. I refer to initiatives such as the provision of cycle paths along the canals. To deal more generally with the idea of preserving the city centre, as a resident of Victorian Dublin, I care passionately about ensuring the heritage of Georgian Dublin is preserved. I am raising a family in Dublin 8, between the canals in Portobello, which is a wonderful inner city community. It is a mixed residential community. Senator Feargal Quinn talked eloquently about small retail units in Glasthule. Such units are also to be found in Portobello.

There are some wonderful Georgian streets. The best in Ireland is Henrietta Street which, sadly, is in a terrible state of disrepair. The Kings Inns has managed to preserve the building on Henrietta Street, but it is very sad to see the condition some of the other houses are in. What Dublin City Council and the Government are trying to address in the Living City initiative is the key problem of the lack of residential properties, residences and people living above shops, as Senator Feargal Quinn said, as a result of which many areas such as Mountjoy Square can be dead at night. That is what the initiative seeks to tackle. Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú fairly pointed to the difficulties in seeking EU clearance. The Living City initiative was first proposed in 2012 as part of a scheme of property tax incentives to be applied in certain special regeneration areas and to be piloted in Limerick and Waterford. This, therefore, is not just about Dublin, but the centre of Dublin is a key area.The Irish Georgian Society has pointed out that demand for residential property is high in Dublin and the stock of residential properties is low. The situation is different in Limerick and Waterford, where there are smaller residential communities.

A number of Senators correctly identified difficulties in the implementation of the Living City initiative, particularly in light of the resurgence of the commercial property market in inner-city Dublin. Dublin City Council's original hope that the initiative would bring more life back to the Georgian areas of Dublin 2, especially in the evenings, will be thwarted by the market because Georgian properties on the southside are again attracting interest for commercial use. The Irish Georgian Society made a constructive submission on the Living City initiative in respect of the north inner city which stressed the need to ensure the initiative supports the proposals made by the Mountjoy Square society on the preservation of the north Georgian core, specifically, electoral districts Mountjoy B and Rotunda A. Some of our finest 18th century architectural heritage is located on these streets, but they are facing serious decay and dereliction compared with the parts of the south inner city which also contain fine Georgian buildings. A strong case can be made for specific preservation policies for the north Georgian core. The Seanad recently debated proposals for Moore Street, including the development of a commemorative centre. Moore Street should be part of the redevelopment and preservation of the north Georgian core. The Irish Georgian Society fully supports the Living City initiative because of if its immense potential.

We are all concerned to ensure the initiative enhances the living communities in inner city areas in Dublin and other cities throughout Ireland, as well as helping to preserve our built and architectural heritage. In regard to a master plan for the city of Dublin, a Labour Party councillor, Dermot Lacey, has been outspoken on the need for a mayor for Dublin city. It is time we revived that idea. Until we have that sort of joined-up thinking across Dublin's local authorities, the various initiatives will not work as well as they could. There are, for example, difficulties with traffic planning for the cross-city Luas project. I fully support Senator David Norris's call for joined-up thinking and a Dublin city mayor who would take responsibility for developing a master plan for Dublin.

This is my first time to have the privilege of contributing to a debate with her in this House. In regard to Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú's comments, if I saw a planning officer, I would run and take cover, probably under a duvet in a bedsit he or she had planned. I spend some time in a different guise travelling around the country from Donegal to Cork and Dublin to Mayo. It gets worse as I go through the cities, towns and villages of Ireland. The entrance to Galway is a massive example of what should not be done to a city. One must plough through complete awfulness to get to the heart of Galway. Instead of extending its heart outwards, Galway closed it down to an industrialised entrance. We have completely destroyed our cities, towns and villages. The Senator spoke about what is exceptional to us. What is exceptional to us is the big hammer we took to Georgian Dublin and its architecture. It was people like Senator David Norris, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, Marian Finucane and others from the school of architecture in UCD who kept the city alive. Senator David Norris is believable when he speaks on this subject because his own history is one of keeping Georgian Dublin alive. He was a lone voice in keeping it alive. One need only look at 35 North Great George's Street and the seat of Joyce to see what he managed to preserve in the face of the hammer outside the door. He managed to preserve that building by linking it to Joyce, and the entire street is now an icon. He is the most qualified, passionate and informed commentator on this subject. O'Connell Street, the widest street in Europe, is an example of the issues Senator Norris raised. It spills out into all the other areas. It has no beauty, no planning and no ideas. Master plans are useless without imagination and creativity. It is just tired old takeaways and second-rate burger places. I did a programme on O'Connell Street for RTE which required me to walk up and down the street over a period of two or three days. I repeatedly encountered the threat of violence during this period. It is a highly violent street, which is one of the reasons people walk through it as fast as they can. They do not want to stand and stare at the architecture or look around them. They run up and down the street because of the threat of violence. People speak about sustainable energy. What about sustainable beauty or sustainable artistry? Can we not move that into sustainable energy? The walkways on the River Liffey are disgraceful because no one pays any attention to the once beautiful plants that are now lying dead in their magnificent urns and pots. There also threats of violence because people can do what they like along the boardwalks. One does not look into what Joyce described as the snot green sea but into the grey snot Liffey. Nothing is happening besides the grey snot Liffey. It is completely filthy. The shopfronts are closed, broken and abandoned, and neon signs are everywhere. In one of Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's first contributions in this House, she called for the neon signs to be replaced by proper signage to create architectural unity. Architecture left with James Gandon. We have no architecture. The spike was designed by a British architect. I cannot see or feel our architecture. Are we afraid of it or do we not have it in ourselves? We have gotten rid of our thatched cottages and built the most appalling de Valera porches. We have done nothing to replace the architecture the British left behind. We pulled down the magnificent Metropole frontage and replaced it with a communist bunker for British Home Stores. Life on O'Connell Street keeps walking because of the threat of violence. People are afraid to stop and stare. We have no ideas. The Luas is not even joined up. We need some sort of metropolitan police and a creative architectural police. I concur with Senator Feargal Quinn's comments. I suggested to the then city manager, who now works for Irish Water, that we should have the type of pop up shops and restaurants that one saw in London, as well as farmers' markets. I might as well have been speaking to the chandelier above our heads. We are lucky to be debating in this great ballroom with its fine chandelier, but others do not have the pleasure of working in such an environment. If we could start with O'Connell Street, change might filter to other streets.I do not want to hear about satellite cities and towns around Ireland, because they are anonymous, awful and lack personality.  What we have done is try to impose architecture. The trees used to have a wonderful kind of weeping willow beauty and they masked ugliness but now we have trees cut like squares, pointing to the ugliness and awfulness all over the street. We have not used our imagination or colour at all. It is grey and awful, with a threat of violence and people do not like it. It is an example of what has happened in our towns and villages and at the entrances to our great, beautiful cities. It is a disgrace. In regard to planners, I do not want to see them as I put them in the same category as bankers.

On the basis of the most recent 2011 census, it now has an overall population of 1.273 million when we include the populations of the four Dublin local authority areas, with over 527,000 of these living in the functional area of Dublin City Council. In addition to being our national capital, Dublin, with its ongoing growth and expansion, has become a major European and international centre. A large number of multinationals are now located in Dublin, reflecting its attractiveness as a place in which to live and do business. It has become a vibrant location for industry, commerce, education, cultural activities as well as tourism and is a major focus for economic growth within the country.  Section 9 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, requires every planning authority to make a development plan every six years relating to the development of the whole of the functional area of the authority. Section 10 of the Act provides that such development plans shall set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area of the development plan and shall consist of a written statement and a plan or plans indicating the development objectives of the area in question. These objectives are required to encompass objectives relating to a range of issues including the zoning of land or particular areas of land for particular purposes, residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational or mixed use, in line with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area in question; the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including transport, energy and communications; facilities, including water supplies and waste water services, waste recovery and disposal facilities and other ancillary facilities and services; environmental compliance requirements required by EU directives; the preservation of the character of the landscape of the area; the protection of structures of special architectural, historical and archaeological interest; and the development and renewal of areas in need of regeneration. As the local authority for the city of Dublin area, Dublin City Council is the designated local authority responsible for the development of an integrated plan and strategy for the overall development of the city, in accordance with the requirements of the Planning and Development Act. The Dublin City Council development plan is the primary plan for the development of Dublin city. It specifically includes objectives relating to transport, including integrated transport, housing development and environmental matters, as referred to in the motion tabled by the Senators. Furthermore, the plan is required to be consistent with and have regard to the objectives of the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines, while also taking account of the development plans of the surrounding local authorities, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council. Therefore, it is fair to say the structures are already there for both the development of a strategic plan for Dublin city and for the adoption of a co-ordinated strategic approach by the four Dublin local authorities. With regard to the Dublin City Council development plan, the most recent of which was adopted in 2011 for the period 2011-17, the strategic vision identified for the future growth and development of the city is based on a number of key principles including the creation of a more compact city where residents can live and work in close proximity, thereby reducing urban sprawl and unsustainable travel patterns; the creation and nurturing of sustainable neighbourhoods close to public transport and a range of community infrastructure in good quality and more intensive mixed use environments; the integration of the Transport 21 programme into the overall layout of the city; the development of resilience to climate change and its impacts, including potential water shortages, more extreme weather conditions and an increased likelihood of coastal and river flooding; the structuring of the city to provide a critical mass to support investment, innovation and the smart economy; the development of a well designed network of streets and open spaces; the preservation of Dublin city's heritage and its unique historic built environment; and the pursuit of a distinctive Dublin brand and identity in the context of promoting Dublin as a world-class city.  The next Dublin city development plan will be in respect of the period 2017-22 and work has already commenced on progressing the development of this plan, with the recent publication of a key issues paper by the city council seeking the views of the public on the future priority issues to be addressed in the new plan. Everybody here has been saying the Government must adopt a plan, but it is city dwellers themselves who must have a say.

There have been significant advances in this area in recent decades, with the development of the DART line, Luas, bus lanes, cycle lanes and the introduction of the cycle to work and dublinbikes schemes. These have facilitated significant gains in public transport use and in the numbers of people cycling and walking, in line with what one would expect of a modern sustainable city. All of these measures have also influenced significant environmental benefits in terms of reduced vehicle emissions and pollution. It is, therefore, important that this progress is maintained in the future. The economic growth experienced in recent decades, which unfortunately stalled for a number of years following our economic problems since 2008, but is now beginning to recover, has influenced ongoing steady growth in the population of the city and the surrounding suburbs. This has placed a significant strain on the provision of housing to meet demand. In this regard, it is imperative that the current housing supply shortage situation is addressed and that an appropriate range of housing is provided, taking account of changing household formation patterns. It is imperative that the right mix of housing types is provided to meet the needs of our expanding and changing population. The Dublin City Council development plan places particular emphasis on the preservation of Dublin city's heritage and its unique historic built environment, an issue that I know is of importance to both Senators David Norris and Sean D. Barrett, but has been especially dear to the heart of Senator Norris, whom I acknowledge has been a leading campaigner for the preservation of Georgian Dublin for many decades.In this regard, the motion of Senators David Norris and Sean D. Barrett refers specifically to the Living City initiative which was recently launched by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan. This is an urban regeneration incentive scheme which focuses on the regeneration of the historic centres of six cities, providing property tax reliefs in designated special regeneration areas in the centres of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and my city of Kilkenny, particularly those areas which are most in need of regeneration. It is not a widespread initiative, as it is targeted at those areas that are most in need of attention, but it is aimed at helping to bring life back into the heart of the relevant cities by offering tax relief for qualifying expenditure incurred on the refurbishment or conversion of pre-1915 buildings where certain conditions are met. Planning for the scheme included a thorough ex ante cost-benefit analysis and recommendations from relevant agencies. There are two elements to the scheme, residential and commercial. The residential element provides for an income tax deduction over ten years for qualifying expenditure incurred on the refurbishment or conversion of a building for use as a dwelling. To qualify under the scheme, the building must have been constructed before 1915. The commercial element of the Living City initiative provides for capital allowances over seven years in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred on the refurbishment or conversion of a property located in a special regeneration area for use for the purpose of retailing goods or the provision of services within the State. The amount of tax relief available under the commercial element of the scheme is capped at €200,000 for any individual project but there is no restriction on applying for both the commercial and residential elements of the initiative. I note the Senators' comment in their motion that the Living City initiative needs to be revisited. In this regard, the scheme was only launched last month, in May, following a lengthy process involving assessment of compliance with EU state aid rules. I am assured by the Minister of Finance that, as a newly launched scheme, it will be kept under review. Dublin, as the capital city, continues to grow and expand and now extends well out into the areas of the surrounding local authorities of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council. We already have structured mechanisms in place under the Planning and Development Act for the drawing up of strategic plans setting out the development objectives and vision for the future development of the areas in question. With regard to Dublin city, as specifically referred to by the Senators, the Dublin City Council development plan is the primary plan for the development of the Dublin city area. While all four Dublin local authorities are responsible for the adoption of development plans for their respective areas, they are also required to take account of one another's plans with a view to adopting an overall co-ordinated and integrated approach for the future development of the greater Dublin area. The Government is extremely cognisant of the need for enhanced co-ordinated planning for Dublin, especially in the light of the expected continued growth of Dublin and its population. In this connection, new structures are about to be introduced under the Local Government Reform Act 2014 involving the development of regional, spatial and economic strategies with the input of all local authorities in the relevant region. These strategies will in turn be informed by a new national planning framework, as a successor to the national spatial strategy, which will provide a framework for the co-ordination of relevant sectoral policies in a way that will create the conditions for public and private investment to take place, thereby facilitating growth. These arrangements will also influence strategic investment in transport, housing, water services, communications and other infrastructure at all levels - national, regional and local, including in the Dublin area. Senators David Norris and Sean D. Barrett have raised a very important issue regarding the need for greater emphasis on co-ordinated strategic planning. The focus in their motion is very much on Dublin city. The Government acknowledges the need for a planned strategy for Dublin and has therefore agreed not to oppose the motion. However, the Government is of the view that the new arrangements and structures being put in place for planning at national, regional and local level will deliver on the overall objective of the development of Dublin, as sought by the Senators.

My late father was a Member of this House in the early 1960s and I travelled with him on many occasions, primarily to visit the amusement arcades on O'Connell Street, which were there even then, and also the cinemas. I especially remember the buzz and life about O'Connell Street. It was like something out of fantasy land for someone coming from a small town. There were all the cinemas with their lights, the street lighting and the advertising lighting. As Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell said, there were wonderfully famous iconic buildings such as the Metropole, the Capitol cinema, in which I saw the first ever Elvis Presley film-----

The first time someone decided to do something about the streetscape of O'Connell Street was the Wide Streets Commission, which went back several hundred years. It did a wonderful job at the time, but it has not been followed through since. Certainly since self-government, we seem to have neglected Dublin. Not only that, we have destroyed it in many places. While I can understand to a degree in the immediate post-colonial period where people were venting their revenge on 800 years of British domination, the strange thing is that seems to have been unique to a post-revolution Ireland. It did not happen in France. After the revolution, the French did not destroy the buildings of the aristocracy. Versailles was a particular example. However, many of our country houses were burnt out. As a child I remember all the argument about the ESB and the monstrosity it built in Dublin that still stands as a legacy and not one of which one should be proud. I remember some very concerned people at the time who tried to stop that. I understand the ESB has plans to restore it but not quite restore the Georgian streetscape to the same extent as it was before. I am not sure if Senator Norris referred to it in his contribution, most of which I heard. I hope that whatever the ESB proposes, it will do its very best to restore that wonderful Georgian streetscape. Anybody living and working around this area, as we all are, will notice tourists who stand at the corner of Merrion Square and look up and look down. I am not surprised because it is a tourist attraction in its own right and is unique to this city. In a way it encapsulates the attitude of official Ireland for too long that these things did not matter. I believe that contributed to a mindset that developed over the years about O'Connell Street. It became tacky with its fast food joints. Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell and many others referred to this. Following the initiative started by Senators David Norris and Sean D. Barrett and ably supported by Senator Feargal Quinn, I sincerely hope that what has been said here will be taken into account.I appreciate much of what was said and about the fact that things are happening. There is still a need for some sort of radicalism in terms of what we do to preserve the iconic O'Connell Street. Irrespective of whether people come from small-town Ireland such as Drumshambo or medium-sized Ireland such as Kilkenny city, we empathise with O'Connell Street. We might not necessarily always empathise with Dublin, the Dubs and whatever, in particular the county's dominance of football. At the same time, we empathise with O'Connell Street and people are proud of O'Connell Street. Traditionally, it was a place where country people tended to go, but maybe less so to Henry Street. It was O'Connell Street that people went to and talked about. It was on O'Connell Street and just off it that one shopped for clothes in places such as Guineys, Clerys and Best. Therefore, O'Connell Street looms large in the Irish psyche and for that reason no one would object to a Government, aided by the city council, taking initiatives to restore O'Connell Street to its former glory.

I am a Kilkenny man and noted that one of first comments the Senator made in this debate was to criticise that we have a rural Minister and that there were rural Senators in the House. I say to him that we are all Irish people. I am very proud to be an Irish person. I am very proud of my capital city of Dublin. It is a city that we, as a nation, sell to the rest of the world; therefore, it is important we get the Living City initiative right. There is more to Dublin than Georgian Dublin. I admire Senator David Norris's passion for Georgian Dublin. Senator Paschal Mooney mentioned the ESB building and things that we have got wrong.

However, in the early 1970s the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, as it was known then, decided to knock the Georgian buildings and install a redbrick building to house a telephone exchange. Around Kilkenny castle and its vicinity is often used for film sets. When filming calls for Georgian buildings, the set designers must put a false frontage on the redbrick building. I would love to see the building restored to its former Georgian glory. A nice Georgian hotel was knocked in Kilkenny and the KBC Bank building, which previously housed National Irish Bank, was knocked. I agree we got things wrong and planning must be sorted out. Today's motion is about a living city. What is a living city? Is a living city where people live or is it where people come to work and be entertained?

Dublin City Council must get its plan. Is it high density? Part of the matter is transport. I agree with the views expressed by Senator David Norris on transport in this city. The bus lanes work well. We have a Luas which should have been joined at the start, but the matter is now being sorted. There is also a place for motorists. We cannot deprive private motorists the right to use the streets of Dublin. We cannot deprive cyclists of their right to use the streets either. There has been an amazing 87% increase in cycling in Dublin city over a seven-year period which proves the initiative has been a great success. However, I would not get on a bike in Dublin city because I would lose my life and someone would definitely knock me off it.

There has also been a lot of controversy about cyclists and people cycling on blue bikes. If people want to cycle around this city then they must observe the rules of the road, the same as anyone else. Dublin City Council, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or someone should provide a course to teach cyclists how to behave properly on the roads because motorists, bus drivers and everyone else must observe the rules of the road. If we want to integrate Dublin city centre, we must tackle the land use issue. There is 67 ha available to Dublin City Council to do something with either for residential or other purposes. Submissions are being taken again for the upcoming development plan for Dublin city. We must look at land use like parking. If one brings cars into the city then one must allow them to be parked. Are we going to allow them to park at a cheap rate? Are we going to charge exorbitant rates to park in our city? Are we going to have a system of stacking cars like in Tokyo and other cities? A stacking system means a car goes into a lift and is raised high up in the sky which is another way of conserving space. I wish to raise one of the biggest issues. I remember coming to Dublin on the train as a kid and going to matches in Croke Park. At the time the train used to travel from Heuston Station to Connolly Station via a tunnel. A tunnel system is the future for Dublin city transport. We must ensure the Phoenix Park tunnel is upgraded and can be used. The majority of the people who travel to the city use public transport that starts off in suburbia, from Kildare, Meath and so forth. As well as this, people use a light rail system and rail transport is not just about the Luas. I am very proud of Dublin, city but I want to know how we can improve it. As we are not going back to the Dublin featured by Pete St. John in his song "The Rare Ould Times", we have to build a modern city.

I am sorry, but I was interrupted for at least two minutes. To sum up, I agree with the sentiments contained in the motion. A lot of this matter has to be with co-operation between Dublin City Council and central government to get either a commission or something set up. We need that because there are a lot of issues about people coming back to live in the inner city or the main parts of the city. Public transport is another issue. We have a major problem with public transport in this city, especially in the centre of the city. As I said, we have a city of which we are proud; we have a city that we sell to the world and tourists come to this it. The majority of tourists who come to Ireland stay in Dublin city and do not travel outside it. We would like to see them visit Kilkenny, Cork, Clare, Galway and other places in the country. Another issue is policing. When one travels to a major capital city one will see a greater presence of police and, therefore, feel safer. The Garda must be seen on the streets. Ee have a problem in Dublin city with tourists and ordinary citizens being accosted by beggars. The matter must be addressed if we are to have a proper city and one of which we are proud.
#MaryAnnOBrien	unknown-#MaryAnnOBrien-party	unknown-#MaryAnnOBrien-dob	unknown-#MaryAnnOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	224	I welcome the Minister of State for the debate. I say to Senator David Norris that I am here to support him absolutely and completely. I also welcome the motion which was tabled by Senators David Norris, Sean D. Barrett and Feargal Quinn. Like most people, I embrace contemporary, modern, change, progress and evolution in the country and the capital city. However, I have a huge and massive dislike of sameness, globalisation and, as the French so aptly call it, uniforme. Grafton Street and O'Connell Street, as we know, are full of global names and world-class burger joints, mobile phone shops, headed with plastic signs, and the great unwashed which are the betting shops.I travel a lot and every city and town in the developed world looks the same. Ever since the ESB, to our everlasting shame, destroyed the unique Fitzwilliam Street in the 1960s, the longest Georgian street in the world, followed quickly by the developers' rape of St. Stephen's Green, concerned citizens are on a continuous red alert in terms of what might be lurking around the corner for our once beautiful and unusual city. What other country would have allowed one of Europe's finest city streets, O'Connell Street, to fall into such degradation? Who cares about the potentially outstanding Mountjoy Square, the love of Senator David Norris's life? Do we let Dublin morph into a mish-mash of a uniform, plain could-be-anywhere provincial city or do we fight to preserve what is left of what was an outstanding capital city and then add architecture of today but with stringent demands on design integrity? At the simplest level, are we brave enough to limit or ban plastic and neon signs, to encourage the few remaining sign painters or even train young people in that art and create jobs? If I had my way, all plastic and neon signs would be banned and only wooden signs would be allowed in the country. I dare not mention Kilkenny, but one only has to look to Adare, Inistioge or Kinsale.  The ESB head office is located on Fitzwilliam Street, once the longest row of Georgian houses in Dublin. The street was sliced in two by a decision of the Government in the early 1960s which allowed for the demolition of part of the row and its replacement with the most hideous modern office block imaginable designed by Sam Stephenson. I am hopeful An Bord Pleanála will make certain to effect a restoration of the Georgian facade on this wretched building. They are in the planning process with 11 parties. Following an oral hearing which has just finished, they are sending out letters to all the parties next week to advise them of a new schedule and the next steps. When I inquired today as to why this no-brainer is taking such a long time to complete, I was advised that it was because of the complexities of the task. I wonder what the cost of this exercise has been to date. For goodness sake, we all agree about Georgian Dublin, it is unique in the world. Why do we not just go ahead and restore the Georgian facade?  If our Government really prioritised our Georgian heritage it would put a strong pillar ministry in place as soon as possible to mirror the National Trust in the United Kingdom. We should leave finance to the Minister for Finance and not expect him to run the OPW also. Deputy Ann Phelan is a wonderful Minister of State. We should put her in charge. We have a mish-mash of the Departments of Environment, Community and Local Government, Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the OPW, which is confusing. Why can we not have this vital area under one pillar ministry, invest some serious money in it, get going and get something done? Anyone who wants to know how the Government feels about heritage needs to look no further than the budget that is allocated to this area, which is an embarrassment.  Our heritage is closely intertwined with our sense of identity and also affirms the historic, cultural and natural inheritance which is shared on the island of Ireland for present and future generations. This ties in with the motion tabled by Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell last week in that it is about our future and it has the ability to vividly convey to visitors and those living in Ireland what it means to be Irish. Our heritage, creative and artistic, is a prevailing physical presence which expresses the essence and heartbeat of our history. Dublin's heritage may be described as a public good in so far as our fellow citizens can derive great pleasure and cultural pride from it. I cannot stress enough the tourism benefits from Dublin's heritage. In 2004, the Government commissioned an Indecon report which found that 40% of employment in tourism depends directly on heritage and a high-quality environment. That figure rises to 70% in rural Ireland.  The war to preserve Georgian Dublin has not yet been won. I spoke recently to a property investor who was alive and well during the boom and who is now back again. He is being beaten time and again at the moment by huge global private equity firms, pension funds and venture capitalists which are buying up buildings all over this city. The Government must do more than put in place a plan that some civil servants and councillors will have charge of. We need to be certain that our heritage, and particularly Dublin's Georgian heritage, is preserved and protected forever. We must put laws in place to ensure that no outsiders, foreign investors or monstrous property developers can ever again do what has been done in this city.  I will turn finally to issues of cost and the Dublin transport system. As a junior infant would ask, why did we not put in an underground system in the first place? Why did we not join the dots and have two train lines that join together? Any idiot could have worked that one out.

It is great to see two Ministers of State in the House from the south east. I commend the proposers of the motion we are discussing, which is hugely important. What has come across very strongly in all of the contributions so far is the pride that people have in Dublin city. Despite a lot of the obvious problems in the city, which have been very cleverly and clearly articulated by Members, there is a sense of real pride and passion about Dublin city. There is also an ambition for the city and when one is ambitious about something, one wants it to reach its full potential so one raises the bar and pushes the boat out. That is what Senators are trying to do.  We have serious problems in Dublin city. We have problems in a lot of cities and towns across the State and on the island of Ireland, as the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, said. Dublin is unique because it is our capital city. When one looks at the huge amount of wealth that we had during the so-called Celtic tiger years and the enormous sums spent on various projects, one would wonder whether we got value for money. Given the amount of money that was around, did we really make good use of it? What happened during that time was the price of property was pushed up, some people made enormous amounts of money but the core infrastructure of the city improved very little.  For many people Dublin is not a living city but a surviving city; a barely make the rent city; a scrape together the money for the bus city; a city which costs too much and gives too little back in return. The motion asserts that it does not have to be this way. The potential which is obvious to all just needs to be exploited and realised. What we need is a genuine public engagement and progressive planning. I know that some Senators have difficulties with planners, but obviously we need to plan. If we want to have a vibrant city, we must plan. The issue is the type of planning we engage in and who comes first within it. We need a commitment to important basic infrastructure to make the city a decent place in which to live, work and do business. That is what a living city should be.  A living, vibrant city must also mean a city of equals. We must accept the reality that we have a deeply unequal society in this State and that is very evident in Dublin city. One only has to take a ride on the Luas or go into any part of Dublin city centre and one will see the very clear divide in our society. That has an impact on the vibrancy of the city. The job of the Government is to ensure and guarantee rights to the city for all. This means that everyone has access to decent and affordable housing.A living city requires an efficient and properly funded public transport system and other essential services for all, regardless of their postcode or income.  In the past four years people who make up a large number of the city's inhabitants have had to deal with a dramatic rise in the cost of living. Public transport fares have risen steadily year on year, well above the rate of inflation, due, in particular, to cuts to the PSO levy for Dublin Bus. About 60,000 people depend on bus services in Dublin every day, while thousands more use rail services and others the dublinbikes scheme. These vital transport services must be expanded in line with the principles of equality of access and service. The Government is planning on privatising 100% of bus services in Waterford city, but 10% of Dublin Bus services will be privatised. This could create problems down the road in the provision of public transport services. Privatisation will create a much more obvious and damaging two-tier system which will see poorer and older Dubliners and people with disabilities potentially left without services.  The greatest failure in Dublin is the lack of decent housing. Well over 20,000 people are on the city council's waiting list for social housing. The vast majority are being told that their social housing needs will be met in the private rented sector. This essentially amounts to the privatisation of social housing. In recent years we have seen people being pushed into the private rented sector and rents have soared as a consequence. The Government has put rent caps in place, which means that people are in tears every day of the week because they cannot find properties to rent. This is all because we are not building housing for citizens, although it is quite obvious that we need to do so.  The recent announcement on housing by the Minister of State falls far short of what is required across the State, including Dublin where 100 people are sleeping rough each night. Although I love spending time in Dublin, since I was elected to the Seanad, I have seen a marked increase in the numbers sleeping rough in the capital. The problem is staring us in the face. When a tragedy occurs, we all focus on it and master plans are announced. We are told all sorts of great things will happen, yet as time passes we forget and the memories of the individuals involved fade away. We are then back to normal and the focus is lost. Homelessness is a real issue which needs to be tackled. To our shame there are almost 1,000 children living in emergency accommodation in cramped hotel rooms or bed and breakfast establishments across Dublin city. The Government's response has been to pray for more private developers to arrive and to build 167 council houses before 2018. I wanted to say a lot more, but, unfortunately, when we are confined to five or six minutes, there is only so much one can say. I wanted to talk about Georgian Dublin, but I did not get a chance to do so. The arguments have been made very well by the proposers of the motion, whom I commend. I thank the Minister of State for attending the House.

I commend Senator David Norris and his colleagues for tabling this Private Members' motion. It is quite simple and proposes the production of a master plan for the city of Dublin to include provisions on the Dublin transport system, housing development and environmental matters, as well as revisiting the Living City initiative and the commitment to the preservation of Georgian Dublin. It makes absolute sense and I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, has said the Government will not oppose the motion. It would be an insult to do so, not only to Senator David Norris but also the people of the entire country. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey. Being the capital city, Dublin belongs to us all. I take the opportunity to commend Senator David Norris for his decades-long commitment and dedication to the preservation of Georgian Dublin. Only for him and people of like mind, we would not have it to talk about. I was struck by a number of contributions, including those of Senators Marie-Louise O'Donnell and Paschal Mooney. I have similar recollections to Senator Paschal Mooney's first memories of O'Connell Street, albeit many decades after his.

The one thing that struck me was the buzz of that huge street. I am sad to say, however, that that has changed. I agree totally with Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell that there is no beauty in it anymore. There is no plan and there do not seem to be ideas. In recent weeks we heard about the closure of that famous store, Clerys, where, as Senator Paschal Mooney said, country and city people came to shop. They also did their shopping in other premises off O'Connell Street. Now, however, they are afraid to walk down it. It is a horrible term which I hate, but there are a lot of the "walking dead" on the street. People are terrified to walk down that thoroughfare which has become the fast food capital of Europe. It is time we woke up and did something about it because the city spreads out from O'Connell Street. If we were to get it right, clean it up and revitalise it, everything else would follow. I welcome the Living City initiative that was originally announced in October 2012. I regret that it took until a few months ago to get it up and running. However, it is only paying lip service to what is really needed. I was struck by what Senator David Norris said about the late Albert Reynolds in having a budget speech running to three and a half pages. If I recall correctly, when the mandarins in the Department of Finance were finished with them, one premises benefited.

It is time the idea of a directly elected mayor for the capital city was revisited as a matter of urgency. We could make a major start by having a directly elected mayor with a budget to run the city. Not only would it help to protect Georgian Dublin and clean up O'Connell Street, it would also help in getting the city's transport system right, including the provision of cycling lanes. I agree that cycling in Dublin is dangerous, but that is not the cyclists' fault. I do not blame them; I encourage them, but they should have proper cycle lanes to use. The lack of such lanes makes cycling in the city extremely dangerous. The Luas works are causing chaos. I agree with previous speakers that the two lines should have been joined from the beginning. In addition, they should have been put underground.

It is time to begin the process of co-ordinating because there are so many Departments involved in this, that and the other. A directly elected mayor with the requisite powers and finances could work on getting the city to operate in the way it should, just like any other major capital city in Europe.It is time we resourced An Garda Síochána properly in this city in order that it can protect the citizens of this city and the people who visit it. People are being assaulted on a daily basis and hundreds are in fear during the day, not to mention at night time. I congratulate Senator David Norris on what has been a very interesting debate. I had not intended to speak on it but hopefully we can keep this issue on the boil.

I have travelled around the country and seen some of the work that has been done by the Office of Public Works. I acknowledge the great work it does. However, there is an issue for the office and that is its budget. Where it has a budget and can maintain properties, particularly State-owned properties and properties of historical importance, it does an excellent job. The Department's heritage card which one can buy for some €40 allows one to visit these marvellous buildings around the country and this is something we should push a lot more because there is a lot about Ireland about which we need to be very proud. I refer to a comment by the Minister of State's colleague - the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, or is it Deputy Ann Whelan?

I will, however, turn to Dublin which is what this debate is about. I am honoured to speak on this because Senator David Norris has, for as long as I can remember, been furthering the cause of Georgian Dublin. It is a matter of deep regret to me that our capital city's main street has become the burger king hurdy-gurdy of Ireland with slot machines and burger joints. The only decent store on that street that I can recall is Clerys. We have now closed that down and will no doubt open it up in the future as some sort of a franchise selling high-class burgers. We built a fantastic boardwalk along the Liffey. I walked along it once with my daughter and I was accosted every 20 yards by people begging, or by drug addicts or alcoholics on skid row. As Senator Diarmuid Wilson said, we have to resource the police. We have to have gardaí on their feet, on the beat, as it is the only way to solve the problem. It was a great initiative to bring bicycles into Dublin to rent to cycle across the city. I agree with Senator David Norris that it would be great if people rode them on the road or on cycle tracks. I wait for the day, however, when we hear the first High Court action over injuries received by someone not wearing a helmet on these bikes. The fact that there is no requirement to wear a helmet is a serious issue.  Senator David Norris referred to the north-south divide in Dublin city. Some time ago a friend of mine from the United States visited me. I brought him into this House and he was totally amazed at the architecture and the wonderful buildings, although he did think Leinster House was in a pretty poor state of repair. As one walks across the corridor from the Seanad towards the Dáil the floors are creaking and falling away underneath.

He remarked that once we crossed the Liffey it was like entering a different city. On one occasion he asked me, "Is this Beirut?" That is how poor some of the city is. I am delighted to have the Luas, which stops outside my front door but I join Senator David Norris in asking what lunatic put the proposal together that left a mile and a half of a gap between the two Luas lines.

One can get into town in 20 minutes or, at most, 40 minutes on the Luas and then one has to spend an hour and a half on a bus getting out to the airport. Who thinks these things up is beyond me. A vision for the future of the city, or for any local area, should rest with the locally elected representatives, the local councillors in the area.

I can remember, as a young fellow, greatly admiring Senator David Norris's deep knowledge of Georgian Dublin and his superb way of communicating it. My aunt is also an expert on Georgian Dublin and has studied the churches in Dublin, particularly the Jesuit churches. We have a rich city but it has plenty of problems, though not all were created by government, some were created by citizens. We have a serious pollution problem with litter and we need a national conversation on this.

#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	269	We need to consider how we can educate young people, old people and all citizens to have a civic responsibility and a civic-minded approach, realising that we all have a part to play in the ambassadorial veneer of our city. It is desperate to see the attitude many of our young people and citizens have to dumping rubbish. If one goes down to Temple Bar any night of the week, not just Saturday, one will be shocked to see urinating and rubbish thrown all over the place.  The Government has a significant leadership role to play but society has a role to play as well. It is time we had a national conversation on how we can all play our part in promoting our city. I am sure Senator David Norris would wholeheartedly agree that it is not just the great city of Dublin that needs to be protected and regenerated. Many of our beautiful towns, some of them old garrison towns, some of them towns that supported industry over the years and some of them with wonderful streetscapes and traditional shop-fronts, have the same need. My own town, Ennistymon in County Clare, is regarded as probably the premier town for traditional shop-fronts in the country, in spite of the national debate that rages about two buildings that have no architectural merit and should have been demolished years ago. Looking beyond the traditional shop-fronts, however, one sees many empty units. The Government has a role to play in bringing forward a town renewal scheme, although absolutely not in the manner of the renewal schemes we saw during the tax incentive years.Carefully thought out, properly crafted and innovative schemes that encourage people to live and open small businesses in some of these buildings could be useful. It is time for us to have some sort of recovery. I hope it will be a very good one and development will take cognisance of our town centres. It would break one's heart to go into some towns in this country and see branches of Tesco Express on the outskirts of the towns but nothing in the town centres. We do not see that in some of our European neighbours, particularly France and Spain. We see markets and small shops that are thriving. We are all under the European banner. I do not know why we always have to follow the example of England as opposed to following the example of our fellow European citizens in countries like Italy, Spain and France. I know the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Paudie Coffey, is determined to deal with red tape. He has taken the red tape relating to the scheme for building one-off houses by the scruff of the neck and is dealing with it but there is plenty of red tape that we need to look at across Government, particularly in the area of environmental health. It is amazing to go down the main street in San Sebastian. One can go into practically any small pub that might have one toilet cubicle and have some of the most amazing tapas that hands can create, yet in Ireland one needs four or five different forms of toilet before the kitchen is even built and the kitchen nearly has to be bigger than the restaurant. We are totally knotted up in red tape when it comes to food production. People were not dying from food poisoning 40 years ago. Yes, there was a certain amount of it and there must be care but people washing their hands and being careful will achieve the same result as having the swankiest toilet and kitchen facilities, open air doors and non-smoking areas. What good is all of that if a human being does not wash their hands?  It goes back to the point I made at the start. Citizens have to take responsibility also. Small industry is tied up in red tape. We need to unleash some of that red tape. I agree that we should give citizens rights but they should be rights with responsibilities. We all have a part to play. Government is just one stakeholder, every citizen is also a stakeholder.  The motion is an inspired one. I watched the contributions in my office and felt an absolute need to come down and contribute to an important motion.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-24 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	270	I thank all of the Senators who took part and the two Ministers of State who attended the debate. They were quite inappropriate in respect of the motion, but I hope they will take back some of what was said here to their colleagues in the Cabinet. I am very gratified that as the Government has decided not to oppose the motion, it goes through. This means it is still an active idea. I believe very strongly that a central government plan is necessary. Nobody on the Government side took up the points I was making on the Living City initiative and other issues. It was just blank. Georgian houses in Dublin are between 400 and 500 sq m, yet there is a limit of 230 sq m. Mr. Graham Hickey of the Dublin Civic Trust said that "even modest Georgians built in the 1830s and 1840s on streets like Belvedere Place, Nelson Street, Sherrard Street – the very houses that desperately need designation – are in the order of 230-300 sq m." This is in the aftermath of the abolition of the national conservation grant in 2011. The house in North Frederick Street that I mentioned in this House and that collapsed a few weeks ago would be excluded. One would get no help for that. Look at Aldborough House on the northside, which until recently was in the hands of the Government. The lead was ripped off the roof and it is in a state of complete dereliction. The Irish Music Rights Organisation wanted to take it over, but it found that it did not have the money. According to Mr. Hickey, Georgian houses would only be eligible for inclusion in the scheme if they were subdivided and sold off as apartments, in other words, the tenementalisation of Dublin. We have the commercial aspect. Dublin Civic Trust said that "effectively, any dodgy modern unit, shed or otherwise, can be incentivised for a capital upgrade for retail or service use, anywhere in Dublin city, or the other cities, within the designated areas".  Dublin traffic is a complete mess. They should have put in an underground. Now we have this business where the city manager is determined to drive motor cars out of the city. I live in the city. Have I no rights? I appeal to the Minister of State to take this back to his Government colleagues. As is the case in Jerusalem, they should have different coloured number plates for people who live in the inner city who would be allowed to cross through College Green and the other blocked areas. It is absurd to discriminate against people who live in the north inner city.  There is a huge amount of dereliction, particularly on the northside. Dublin City Council is investigating 630 sites that could warrant inclusion. It only has 46. That is how active it is. It is absurd.  Litter is another big mess. It was privatised and companies fight like the Mafia, burning each other's trucks out. There are different dates and times for collections, waste is collected in plastic bags that split and waste is spread all over the street. One experiences the noise from the vehicles when they drive up and down residential streets at all hours of the day and night. There are rehabilitative schemes for drug addicts in the north inner city. I have great compassion for drug addicts but they are all dumped in the north inner city. Practically every week, a new rehabilitative outlet is dumped along Parnell Street. We were lied to in this House about Fitzgibbon Street Garda station. We were told it was closed for rehabilitation. It was closed to be turned into a home for homeless people. Again, I have great sympathy for homeless people but we need a police station. People from around this House have all said that we need the reinvigoration of the police in the inner city. What are they doing? They are closing it down and making it a place for the homeless.  With regard to the Living City initiative, I was the needle point of this, pushing and pushing until I got an agreement from the Minister for Finance. The will of the Oireachtas is frustrated by an anonymous civil servant who said that this is not for mansion taxes. In other words, anything over 230 sq m - anything larger than a three-bedroomed bungalow - will not qualify for this.  Everybody echoed what I said about O'Connell Street - knicker shops, fast food joints, tatty souvenir shops and derelict sites. The Metropole which was a wonderful building was demolished. What do we have in its place? We have British Home Stores; 1916, my eye, we are still a bloody colony. What will happen to the Clerys building? Vulture capitalists from the United States came in and made a profit of €19 million. Shame on Gordon Brothers and shame on the Irish people who are implicit in this. It is a disgrace. I was talking this morning to a man who gave 43 years of service to Clerys but who is out on his arse without a single penny in terms of a pension. I listened yesterday to Alex Findlater, a decent man who had 26 shops across Dublin and a headquarters in O'Connell Street. It was pulled down and an ignorant, barbaric concrete monstrosity put up in its place. He at least took an interest in the welfare and well-being of his employees.

Dublin City Council will do sweet bugger all about it and all it wants is a little power play. That is why I am saying and I am glad that it is still active that we need a master plan for Dublin. Speakers on all side of the House said "yes". In the 18th century we had the Wide Streets Commission and the Paving Commission and that is what has left us the glories of 18th century architecture. We are the custodians of it, yet we are allowing it to fall down. A master plan which includes traffic, the conservation of buildings, the environment and so on is necessary. That is what the House has joined to support.
