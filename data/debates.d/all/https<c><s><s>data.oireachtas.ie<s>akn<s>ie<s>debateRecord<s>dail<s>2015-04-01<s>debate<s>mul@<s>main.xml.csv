#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	As the Minister is aware, Fianna FÃ¡il has tabled a Private Members' motion this week on the issue of excessive standard variable mortgage interest rates and the ability of the Government or the Central Bank to set interest rates. The motion calls on the Minister to use his influence, to express a view and to engage with the financial institutions directly and for the Central Bank to do the same. Standard variable rate mortgage customers are an exploited group of customers. They are paying way over the odds and something needs to be done about that.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. Lending institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, are independent commercial entities. I have no statutory role in regard to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate changes or to the mortgage interest rates charged. It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned. It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed position or manner in which individual banks choose to put forward mortgage propositions to potential customers or how that relates to existing customers. That said, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review and this has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates. The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. It has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. As I stated in previous parliamentary questions, a previous Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise. The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank previously stated that it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants. In this regard, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there has been some movement on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggests that the market may well be entering a new and more competitive phase. 
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I thank the Minister for his response, which is quite similar in nature to the response given on the Minister's behalf by the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, last night during the Private Members' debate. The problem I have with the response is that the Minister did exert pressure on the banks back in 2011, in a very public way, when there was an ECB rate reduction and the pillar banks did not initially pass that reduction on to customers. The pillar banks were called before the Economic Management Council and the Minister and the then Minister of State, former Deputy Brian Hayes, made strong comments and at least one of the banks subsequently passed on that rate reduction to customers. The Central Bank is not just the prudential supervisor of the banks and the regulator. It is also the consumer watchdog. Take Bank of Ireland as an example. Last November, it told the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that its cost of funds is 1.15%. Its standard variable rate for existing customers is 4.5%. That is extortion by any measure. That level of a margin being applied on a particular group of customers is unfair. There has been some downward movement on variable rates, but a number of the banks excluded their existing customers from benefiting from that reduction. This is unfair and should be addressed. They have given the reduced rate to new customers, but not to existing customers who form part of the 300,000 customers affected.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	The views the Deputy is expressing are shared widely by Members on all sides. As I said in my response, a previous Deputy Governor of the Central Bank indicated that within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, it would continue to engage with specific lenders that appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds. I will speak to the Governor of the Central Bank again and express the views expressed by Deputy McGrath and will indicate that those views are held generally in the House. I will ask him to consider what influence the Central Bank can bring to bear to bring variable mortgage rates closer to the cost of funds. However, the market movement is in that direction at present. We hope further progress can be made. New mortgages are available at much lower interest rates than the rates the Deputy has cited, but I hope existing mortgages also gain from the general downward movement in interest rates across Europe.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	I welcome the fact the Minister is going to take up the issue directly with the Governor of the Central Bank. I have made it clear that I fully accept that neither the Government nor the Central Bank sets interest rates, but they have significant influence. The Minister is in an influential position, as is the Governor of the Central Bank who has a key role in terms of consumer protection. There is no doubt but that the variable rates being charged to existing customers are way out of line with the cost of funds the banks currently face. As the Minister knows well, the cost of funds is at an historic low, with the ECB base rate at 0.05%, the cost of funds on the wholesale interbank markets exceptionally low and the level of interest being paid to savers and depositors is very low. Where banks are accessing funds, they are doing it exceptionally cheaply. I welcome the fact the Minister is going to take up the issue with the Governor and hope he will bring his influence to bear on the banks and that this will result in further downward pressure, particularly for the 300,000 existing customers, many of whom have not benefited at all from the recent announcement of rate reductions.

Obviously, however, I cannot be expected to act illegally.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	This question relates to the legislative or other steps the Government proposes to take in order to tackle the ongoing mortgage crisis faced by the State. We are all aware of the increasing number of families appearing before courts throughout the country in the context of repossessions. Is the Government developing a view on this matter and does it intend to put forward proposals to empower the courts to consider circumstances in which banks are vetoing solutions? Is it considering establishing an independent body? How does the Government propose to deal with this crisis, which is engulfing many families throughout the State and resulting in people losing their homes?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	I thank Deputy Pearse Doherty for tabling this question. Tackling mortgage arrears is a priority for the Government. A whole-of-government approach has been adopted in addressing this issue, with a view to maximising the level of loan restructuring arrangements and minimising the number of home repossessions. Initiatives such as the reform of personal insolvency legislation, the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the introduction of a mortgage arrears information and advice helpline and the availability of mortgage-to-rent schemes ensure that borrowers are assisted in dealing with their arrears. In March 2013 the mortgage arrears resolution targets, MART, framework was introduced. This sets out demanding quantitative targets for mortgage arrears resolution at six Irish mortgage lenders which account for 90% of the mortgages in Ireland. The six lenders - AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank, ACC Bank and KBC Bank - are required to meet targets at quarterly intervals. In addition, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residences. The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lenders and that long-term resolutions are sought by lenders with each of their borrowers. Under the CCMA, a lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession after it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his or her nominated representative, and where specific timeframes have been adhered to, or where the borrower has been classified as not co-operating. It is clear that the Government has put in place a number of initiatives to assist homeowners in difficulty, including reform of personal insolvency legislation, the provision of independent advice to those dealing with debt issues and, as already stated, the introduction of MART targets and the revision of the CCMA. The most recent ISI results show an increasing take-up of its services, albeit from a low base. For quarter 4 of 2014, the ISI reported that it was dealing with debt of â¬1.5 billion and that the number of personal insolvency arrangements approved in quarter 4 had increased by 148% over that for quarter 3. The ISI also reports that 75% of proposals are supported by creditors. The decision in 2014 to waive fees for the insolvency service, coupled with a targeted awareness-raising campaign, is likely to lead to greater engagement with the office.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 My Department and the Central Bank monitor the situation in regard to mortgage arrears on an ongoing basis. Data published by the Central Bank in early March for the end of 2014 showed continued improvement in the number of personal dwelling house, PDH, accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days, which decreased by 7.4% over the quarter, representing the fifth consecutive reduction in the number of accounts in arrears for this category. In addition, the number of borrowers reaching agreements with their banks to restructure their mortgages is increasing, with almost 115,000 mortgages classified as restructured at end December 2014. It is also encouraging to note that approximately 85% of these restructured accounts are deemed to be meeting the terms of their current restructure arrangement. This is, however, an area which remains under continuous review. More and concerted action is required by the banks to assist customers in arrears and, as the Taoiseach has previously announced, my Department is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the take-up of personal insolvency solutions.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I thank the Minister for his reply. Unfortunately, it merely constitutes a list of the initiatives the Government has taken in the past, some of which have led to a weakening of the position of consumers. The point I was trying to get at is that there has been speculation in the media that the penny is finally dropping in Government Buildings to the effect that something must be done to tackle the large number of repossession cases coming before courts throughout the land and that further action must be taken regarding the 100,000 families in mortgage arrears. We are well aware that this crisis was not created by the Minister or the Government and that it first emerged on the watch of the previous Fianna FÃ¡il Administration. However, the crisis has become twice as bad under the stewardship of the Minister and the Government. Is anything else being proposed to deal with this matter and is the Government considering bringing forward further legislation in respect of it? Is it considering other measures which might assist in dealing with the crisis or is it satisfied that initiatives introduced heretofore are sufficient?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	As the Deputy is aware, the essential issue revolves around ensuring that there are sufficient procedures and initiatives available to allow mortgages to be restructured in a way that will see to it that they are affordable. Some 110,000 mortgages have already been restructured and significant progress has also been made across a range of initiatives. In the past month or so, the initiatives that are available to the banks have been reviewed in order to establish whether additional or modified initiatives that would work better might be put in place. Work in this regard is ongoing and an announcement on the matter will be made some time during the course of this month.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I welcome the fact that a review is taking place. I am not familiar with this review and I presume that the views of those on this side of the House are not being solicited in respect of it. We, as Opposition spokespersons on finance, and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, have invested a great deal of time considering the position with regard to the mortgage arrears crisis. When commenting on the review, the Minister referred to the suite of options that will be available in terms of restructuring. Does the review encompass a consideration of the powers that could be extended to the courts to deal with banks that are vetoing personal insolvency arrangements? Will the review be examining the position with regard to the bankruptcy rules and reducing the three-year term of bankruptcy to one year? The House is due to take Report Stage of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill 2014. Is the Government considering using this legislation to bring forward amendments to deal with the length of the term of bankruptcy or to stipulate what the courts may take into account when issuing repossession orders?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	As the Deputy is aware, a menu of options is available to the lending institutions and mortgage holders in the context of restructuring mortgages. Some of these initiatives suit particular mortgages holders while others do not. One of the quite frankly disappointing aspects of this matter is the low level of take-up in respect of the personal insolvency legislation. However, the position in this regard is improving and I understand that the take-up figures are now comparable with those which obtained in the UK when insolvency legislation was introduced there. The insolvency regime and how it applies, and the other issues raised by the Deputy, are all contemplated by the review being conducted primarily by the Department of Finance. The views put forward by Deputies in this House and at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform will, of course, be taken into account. The views of the Deputy and others are not secret and we are quite well aware of them. I must sound a note of caution. It is possible that we could take initiatives which might make matters worse. As a result, we want to ensure that those we do take will be positive in nature and that they will contribute towards an overall solution. It is not the case that the options currently available have failed, but there is no doubt that they can be enhanced. As already stated, 110,000 mortgages have been restructured, and this represents significant progress. However, there is a residue in respect of which an enhanced range of options might provide assistance. As stated, I expect announcements on this matter to be forthcoming during the coming month.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	Question No. 3 is in the name of Deputy Donnelly. As the Deputy is not present, we will move to Question No. 4 in the name of Deputy Michael McGrath.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	I am seeking the views of the Minister and the Department of Finance on the proposed reduction in the discharge period for bankruptcy. As the Minister is aware, this matter has been the subject of much recent discussion in the aftermath of the publication of a Private Members' Bill by Deputy Penrose. While this matter may relate more directly to the Department of Justice and Equality, I tabled the question in order to give the Minister the opportunity to outline his views and those of his Department, because they are absolutely crucial to the debate on it.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	While, as the Deputy states, this issue falls within the functional responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, he will be aware that the duration of bankruptcy was reduced from 12 years to three in December 2013. Insolvency Service of Ireland data indicate that for all of 2013, 58 people were adjudicated bankrupt by the High Court, whereas in 2014 the number adjudicated bankrupt rose to 448. It can be anticipated that this number will continue to increase in 2015. This demonstrates that the reduction in the bankruptcy term is having a positive impact as a mechanism of last resort in dealing with distressed debt situations. However, more time is needed to assess the effectiveness of this measure. Recently, there have been calls in the media to reduce the bankruptcy term down to one year, with the rationalisation that this will allow entrepreneurs to regularise their debt situation quickly with a view to facilitating them in establishing a new business. Alternatively, it is suggested that reducing the bankruptcy term will enable individuals to write down debt without having to leave their family home. Bankruptcy is a big step for borrowers and one that may not deliver the desired result of retaining the family home. It is my understanding that of those who had a family home and were declared bankrupt in 2014, approximately 70% have lost or are expected to lose their home. Banks are the best protected creditors in bankruptcy. Currently there is a lack of analysis of unintended consequences around further reducing the bankruptcy term to one year. I would be concerned that if we act in haste on this issue, without having conducted rigorous analysis of the objectives and impacts of such a change, we may not achieve the best outcomes for entrepreneurs or private individuals. When this analysis has been completed, the Government will then have all the facts on likely consequences, both good and bad, and will be in a better position to make an informed decision on whether the bankruptcy term should be reduced from three years to one year.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The Deputy may rest assured that tackling mortgage arrears is a priority for the Government. A whole-of-Government approach has been adopted in addressing the issue with a view to maximising the level of loan restructuring arrangements and minimising the number of home repossessions. Initiatives such as the reform of personal insolvency legislation and the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the introduction of a mortgage arrears information and advice helpline, and the availability of the mortgage-to-rent scheme, ensure that borrowers are assisted in dealing with their arrears. Significant progress was made in 2014 in restructuring mortgage accounts. Data compiled by the Central Bank on residential mortgage arrears show that the number of PDH mortgage accounts of greater than 90 days is declining. This is, however, an area that remains under continuous review. More and concerted action is required from banks to assist and restructure customers in arrears and, as the Taoiseach has previously announced, my Department is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	I thank the Minister for his reply. We are all aware of the dramatic increase in the number of people going bankrupt in Ireland. Many people have gone to the UK to become bankrupt. The Minister has put a number of important facts on the record, including that 70% of those who went bankrupt in 2014 have lost, or will lose, their home as part of the bankruptcy process. It is a pretty sobering statistic for everyone to remember. I have an open mind on the reduction of the discharge period, but it should not be the solution of choice for tens of thousands of people in mortgage arrears. I do not believe it is, quite frankly, because bankruptcy is a serious measure with significant consequences for those involved. In most arrears cases, there is a joint mortgage involving joint ownership of the property. If both spouses have to go bankrupt, it is not the most efficient way to deal with mortgage arrears. It may well be a worthwhile step for those who have more complex debt arrangements involving corporate and commercial debt, for example, but not for those in mortgage arrears. The Minister referred to the need for more time to assess the impact of the recent reduction from 12 years to three years. He also referred to an analysis that has to be done. Perhaps the Minister can clarify if a particular initiative is under way to analyse the impact of the reduction from 12 to three years. If so, is there a timeline for completing it?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	The issue of reducing the term of bankruptcy from three years to one year is separate from restructuring mortgages, and should be seen as such. By mixing both issues one could end up making a decision which would not be helpful. If somebody has mixed debt, the only institution that has security is the bank because it has the deeds of the home and is underpinning the mortgage. Therefore the banks are in a good position if part of the mixed debt is a mortgage. This is why repossession occurs in so many cases. Most of the repossessions I referred to are voluntary in working out the bankruptcy. As to the Deputy's precise question, officials in my Department keep these matters constantly under review and will advise me on them. We are not working to a particular timeline, but we are collecting the relevant data. I presume that some of the data will be put into circulation in due course, later on. If there are merits in reducing the three-year bankruptcy period to one year, as has been done in other jurisdictions, that is a separate policy consideration from resolving the mortgage crisis. It does not resolve the mortgage crisis and, in fact, the data would suggest that persons who enter bankruptcy lose their homes more than people who do not.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	As I have said on a number of occasions, I do not believe people in mortgage arrears should have to go bankrupt in order to have their indebtedness dealt with and to have a restructuring of their mortgage agreed. We need to separate both issues - mortgage arrears and the decision whether or not to reduce the bankruptcy discharge period further. People whose main debt is a mortgage on the family home should not have to go bankrupt. Let us be honest about it, they should not have to go bankrupt to have that situation dealt with. I welcome the Minister's comments in that regard. The debate on reducing the discharge period has been gaining some momentum, yet the Minister seems to be pouring cold water on it. It would appear from what the Minister has said that no decision is imminent from the Government in favour of a reduction in the discharge period. The fact that 70% of those who went bankrupt in 2014 have lost, or are expected to lose, their family home as part of the discharge of their bankruptcy, is a sobering statistic. People who are advocating a reduction in the discharge period as a measure for dealing with mortgage arrears should bear that statistic in mind.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	The issue of reforming the bankruptcy laws is fairly recent. The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, brought in legislation reducing the period from 12 to three years. At the time, the three-year period was not picked arbitrarily. Other options were considered, including the one-year option which is now the norm in Britain and Northern Ireland. Therefore, there has been recent consideration of what the appropriate term of bankruptcy should be in this jurisdiction. Data is now coming through which show how the changes are working out. The clearest change so far is that it has gone from 58 bankruptcies in the last year of the old legislation, to 448 now. There is quite a clear uptake by those availing of bankruptcy under the new terms of the Act. Not all the implications have been assessed yet, but I welcome the debate. I know that a Private Members' Bill has been published, so we can continue the debate. I do not have a particularly fixed position on it. If another term works better, so be it, but I would like to have it evidence-based rather than change being made for the sake of it and on the basis of a lack of evidence.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	As Deputy Donnelly has arrived, we will now go back to Question No. 3.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	This question concerns the fact that in many restructurings of distressed mortgages, banks are making more money than they would have had the mortgage not been restructured. For example, the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform went through the Bank of Ireland's restructures. The bank's chief executive admitted that in at least 90%, and probably a lot more, of the mortgages the total amount being paid back by the borrowers was more. Therefore, term extensions and capitalisation of arrears led to more. It is particularly depressing right now with the courts becoming filled up with orders for repossession from banks. We are aware that in many cases the banks are making more money out of these mortgages than they would have had they been functioning normally. Does the Minister agree that this should not be happening and, if so, can he legislate accordingly?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	I thank the Deputy for his question. The consumer protection code and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, have in place a number of measures to protect financial consumers. On a general level, regulated lenders are required, in their interaction with their customers, to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers. Utilising the mortgage arrears resolution process, there is a requirement on the lender to assess each case of mortgage difficulty on its own merits and also to proactively work with the borrower in order to address a case of genuine mortgage difficulty. If a borrower is dissatisfied with the decision of the lender in this area, the appeals framework as set out in the CCMA will be available. Also, where appropriate, independent financial advice will be available to the borrower under the protocol for independent advice to borrowers availing of long-term mortgage forbearance.Specific provisions in the CCMA, which are designed to protect borrowers in genuine mortgage difficulty, include that except in the very limited circumstance set out in the CCMA, a lender must not require a borrower, as part of an alternative repayment arrangement, to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type; and lenders are restricted from imposing charges and-or surcharge interest on arrears arising on a relevant mortgage in arrears unless the borrower is not co-operating. While it is unfortunate that there are cases of mortgage difficulty and that this gives rise to certain difficulties and costs for the parties involved, it is nevertheless a very welcome development that many parties are in a position to agree and put in place sustainable alternative arrangements in order to address such a difficulty. The latest data from the Central Bank and my Department indicate that an increasing number of mortgage restructures are being put in place in order to deal with mortgage difficulty with almost 115,000 principal dwelling house, PDH, accounts being classified as restructured at the end of December. It is also encouraging to note that 85% of such accounts are deemed to meet the terms of their current restructure arrangement. I would encourage lenders and borrowers in difficulty to continue to build on this and to reach acceptable and sustainable solutions to mortgage difficulty.

As an example, the chief executive of Bank of Ireland has admitted to the committee on the record that more than 90% of Bank of Ireland restructures result in higher overall payments to the bank. For a great many restructures, including repossessions, the banks are making more money than had the loan been discharged. Let us ignore the CCMA and other such considerations, but, as a principle, does the Minister agree that in those cases the banks should not end up with a higher profit than had the loan been discharged normally? If the Minister agrees with that, would he be open to exploring legislation with the committee to that effect?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	I will outline the remainder of the reply which I did not have time to read. In relation to the proposal suggested by the Deputy, I am not convinced how workable a solution it may be, but it appears to be the case that many of the properties that banks are moving to repossess have been carrying arrears for some significant period and would be sold for a lower valuation than the original mortgage. Mortgage arrears is, however, an area that remains under continual review. More and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears and as the Taoiseach has previously announced, my Department is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	Perhaps I could ask the Minister to stop reading out the prepared stuff from the civil servants because it does not address the question I asked, which is whether he as Minister for Finance believes that, as a principle, the banks should not make additional profits on restructured mortgages. If he agrees with that as a principle, would he be open to working with the committee to draft legislation to that effect? This is something Government Deputies and people within the banks have raised. It is a principle that says the banking sector is partly responsible for what happened and it should not make excess profits on irresponsible lending. They are making profits on the arrears, recapitalisation and term extensions. They are making additional profits over and above the expected net present value of the loans. Should we, as elected representatives, say it is fine for the banks to make the money they would ordinarily have made but they cannot make additional profit on the behaviour that caused the problem in the first place?

It seems to me that if a lending institution has a mortgage in arrears, for the period of the arrears it is losing a lot of money from the original contract position. I am not sure what Deputy Donnelly is saying about profits. The restructuring should help both parties, the borrower and the lender, and it should arrive at a new position which is sustainable. I cannot see where the argument arises that this leads to extra profits for the bank, unless the Deputy is arguing that when the mortgage is in arrears, its saleable value is so low that only that amount should be realised by the bank-----

The Fiscal Advisory Council's report on the rules issued this morning, which will be a helpful addition in terms of the Minister's negotiations with his European partners. Could he outline to the House the status of the talks and the impact on the budget if the expenditure benchmark rule is changed, as this country has requested? What leeway would it give on expenditure?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	From 2016, the public finances in Ireland will be subject to the rules of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact. Assessment of compliance with the rules of the preventive arm is based on two pillars, the annual improvement in the structural balance and the expenditure benchmark. The expenditure benchmark links growth in expenditure to the potential growth rate of the economy. Additional expenditure above the benchmark has to be paid for through the introduction of new discretionary revenue measures. The benchmark also contains a feature that is designed to assist with achieving the minimum annual structural improvement of more than 0.5% of GDP. I have raised on a number of occasions, including at the recent Eurogroup meeting, the use of outdated estimates of growth in the calculation of the expenditure benchmark. At the moment, the reference rate used in the calculation of the expenditure benchmark is based on a ten-year average of potential growth that is updated every three years. The reference rate to apply for 2014 to 2016 was calculated in 2013 when both the outturn and outlook for our economy's growth potential were considerably weaker. The use of such outdated estimates could lead to inappropriate fiscal decisions being made. On foot of my interventions at political level, my officials have been in discussions at a technical level with the European Commission and other member states. The aim of technical discussions has been to ensure that the methodology for calculating potential output and its implementation in the context of EU fiscal rules is applied in a manner that produces credible results that underpin the operation of a sound set of rules. The focus of our discussions has been two pronged; first, to improve how estimates of potential GDP are calculated for Ireland by using more appropriate population projections and, second, to apply the calculations in a more logical fashion so that the fiscal policy consistent with the rules is set based on latest available information regarding both the outturn and prospects for the Irish economy. Discussions are progressing well but final decisions at a technical level must be endorsed at the relevant committees. While I do not want to prejudice the ongoing discussions, I welcome the strong engagement of the Commission on this issue. Finally, I emphasise that I support the revised fiscal rules. What I seek from the Commission and colleagues from other European states is a more sensible application of the rules for all member states as this will enhance the credibility of fiscal policy decision making.

The Minister was one of the architects of the rules and the first time they apply to this country is now, and we are over with the begging bowl asking to get rid of some rules that are simply not sensible. I agree with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's report that there is an anomaly in the rules and they need to be changed. It is not only the rules that must be considered as other issues must be taken into account such as the calculation of structural deficits and structural surpluses that will cause problems in the future. There is suspicion that this is happening as a result of it being an election year, that the Government has implemented all of the austerity rules and policies but given the impending election and the fact that it has committed to reducing the income tax rate for top earners, under the current rules the expenditure benchmark would not allow that to happen, and that the measure is very much geared towards election commitments. The Minister said the matter must be agreed by committees in Europe. Is it expected that we will have a decision before the April statement?If it is not expected, does the Minister expect to base the April statement on what he is seeking from Europe, which is the revised expenditure benchmark rate?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	I want to make it clear that I and the Government believe in the rules that stem from the Stability and Growth Pact. The issue is that when rules are applied to give bizarre or peculiar results, the application of the rules needs to be examined. For example, technical people in the European Commission looking at migration patterns from 2008 for three years or so, when migration was very strong, came to the conclusion that the Irish population would decline by a million by 2030 and built expenditure loans around that. That is nonsense; it is not going to happen and it is quite clear that population trends now negate that. Some kind of theoretical, bizarre interpretation of economic data cannot be the base for applying the rules. The second issue is that as a general expenditure rule, sovereigns should keep their increase in expenditure below their net growth rates. That gave another bizarre result for us because of the averaging over ten years. There is an argument that for 2016 we must keep our expenditure increase below 0.6% on the basis that the growth average is 0.6%. Quite obviously that is not the current growth rate, and I welcome the paper produced by the Fiscal Advisory Council, which casts independent light on this issue. It has moved the expenditure benchmark up to 1.8%, which gives a certain amount of room. On the last question the Deputy asked, I would hope to see further clarification of this in the spring statement.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	I welcome the fact that it will be there before the spring statement. The expenditure benchmark is something I have been raising with the Minister and his Department for a long time now. The Minister's legacy when it comes to how he deals with some of the economic data is that it is about keeping the Opposition in the dark. We have been raising this for the guts of a year and finally, at the foot of an April statement, the Government is starting to deal with the issue. The Minister presented me with figures last year whereby the expenditure benchmark would currently allow him a leeway of about â¬400 million in additional expenditure. Obviously, if he reduces taxes as he has planned, the â¬400 million would be absorbed and there would be no expenditure increases. This morning on "Morning Ireland" the Fiscal Advisory Council suggested that the rules, if granted, would allow him about â¬700 million of leeway, which could be further enhanced with drops in unemployment. Does he concur with that statement? The council has also very strongly cautioned against decreases in income tax as a result of increased pressures on health, education and pensions. Can the Minister give us any indication of whether he is going to adhere to the Fiscal Advisory Council's strong suggestion that discretionary income tax reductions should be avoided and instead focus on those areas where is there growing pressure?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	I always listen to the advice of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, which is independent and gives its advice freely without any influence of the Government being brought to bear on it. We will follow the same approach on this occasion. It is a long way to the budget but we will be laying out the parameters of where I think the economy is going to go in the spring statement. The Deputy has indeed brought up the expenditure benchmark on a number of occasions, but we have given him as much information as we have on all occasions. I would think that in comparison with the situation under other Administrations, the flow of necessary financial data to individual Deputies and to the finance committee is very strong. We have been quite transparent on these issues and can arrange for further briefing if that is necessary.

Even though I have highlighted this discrepancy before, nothing seems to have happened. It raises the question of the priority the Revenue Commissioners are giving to the issue of petrol stretching, in light of the devastating impact it is having on families and individuals who have had their vehicles destroyed.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for tackling fuel fraud, that they are very aware of the risks posed to consumers' vehicles, legitimate businesses and the Exchequer by all forms of fuel fraud. The Revenue Commissioners have, since last summer, received reports from a variety of locations around the country of problems relating to petrol quality, and suggestions that these problems are attributable to petrol stretching. Petrol stretching involves the illegal addition of a low-tax commodity to petrol, and the motive of the criminals who engage in this activity is to profit from the sale of adulterated petrol, thereby defrauding motorists and the State. The Revenue Commissioners have received 141 complaints to date, the majority of which originated in its Border, midlands and west region. Every filling station about which a complaint was made has been visited by Revenue Commissioners enforcement officers and fuel samples taken from them have been sent for analysis to the State Laboratory. In total, 345 samples of petrol from filling stations and other sources have been referred to the State Laboratory. The scientific analysis required is complex and time-consuming, and the State Laboratory has conducted an extensive series of tests and re-tests on the samples. Despite this extensive testing, evidence of the presence of prohibited stretching agents has been found in only two samples, both from one location. The conclusive results received from those tests have resulted in the seizure of the product, and files are being prepared with a view to prosecution. Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results were received which indicate the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations. This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time. There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to mix normal road diesel with petrol. If the problems that have come to light were caused by unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed with petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved. However, the Revenue Commissioners are investigating vigorously the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems. In any instances where the analysis of samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against alleged offenders where possible. They have been working closely with An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na on this matter, and will continue to do so.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	The fundamental problem here is that because there does not seem to be a loss to the Exchequer, it is not really an issue for the Revenue Commissioners. In my constituency and the adjoining counties we have families that have had two cars destroyed. In some cases, the replacement car has also been destroyed by this practice. Something serious went on here. The Minister has said 141 cases have been reported to the Revenue Commissioners. Close to 400 cases have been reported to An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, and we were advised by the Revenue Commissioners that if the information was given to the Garda it would then be passed on to the Revenue Commissioners. How can Revenue get to the source of the problem when up to two thirds of the reports that have been made have not actually been investigated by it? Will it not make it far more difficult to identify the source of the problem? Even though there may not be a loss to the Exchequer, will the Revenue Commissioners act in the interests of the motorists who had their vehicles damaged and try and source where this fuel came from in the first place, whether it is diesel or some other contaminant?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	We must distinguish between what may have occurred as a result of negligence and what may have occurred as a result of fraud. In the test carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in the State Laboratory, 345 samples were tested.Only in two samples is there clear evidence of petrol stretching as defined. There is no economic point or any economic advantage in mixing diesel with petrol, yet in many of the samples the petrol is contaminated by diesel. That is not petrol stretching. Something happened in the supply chain which caused the adulteration or the contamination, but there is no profit margin or motive in that. Revenue are examining to see if there is some kind of connection with tax, but it is not quite clear that there is a connection. There is no doubt that something happened and that damage was caused to many individuals' cars, but there is no evidence that there was widespread petrol stretching as defined. There was widespread contamination of petrol, but with diesel and not with a low-excise product to allow profit.

The fundamental problem, however, is that because the Minister believes there is no fraud involved, it is not an issue for the Revenue Commissioners.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	I never said that.

Vehicles have been damaged. Families have been decimated economically by this action. The culprits need to be identified. If it is negligence, the car owners are covered by insurance and the insurance companies should kick in here. However, if the Revenue Commissioners have only received one third of the reports that have been presented to the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, how can they identify the source of this? I ask the Minister for an assurance that the Revenue Commissioners will do everything possible to identify the source of the contamination, whether caused by negligence or fraud. If the information cannot be used for a criminal prosecution, this information should be made available for a civil prosecution. Why are there two completely different standards for the recording of the deliveries of petrol fuel and diesel fuel? If these recording systems were similar, it would have been much easier to identify the source of the problem and ensure people were adequately compensated.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	I do not have the data to which the Deputy refers. It is news to me that complaints have been made to the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na about petrol stretching which have not been passed on to Revenue.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	The Deputy has raised it, but if he has a file on it, he might provide it and we will give it to the Revenue Commissioners.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	We will let the Revenue Commissioners investigate, if there is a way to do so. One of the central points in my reply to the Deputy's question is that if there is no fraud or if there is no intention of fraud, it is outside the legal powers of the Revenue Commissioners. They pursue fraud and criminal offences. If there is no evidence of a criminal offence and if it looks as if there was contamination of a petrol supply by the addition of diesel, where there is no obvious profit motive, that is a different issue and it is not for Revenue-----

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	The purpose of this question is to ascertain the level of engagement of the Minister for Finance with the banks, in particular with the banks in which the State is a shareholder. We own a number of the banks. We have a minority shareholding in Bank of Ireland. The Minister is a member of the Economic Management Council and it is appropriate that he would engage with the banks regularly on key issues of concern in the economy such as interest rates, mortgage arrears and lending to the SME sector.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I can confirm that I last met the CEOs and senior management of the each of the banks last July when we discussed, among other matters, the issues included in the Deputy's question. I also met the CEO of Permanent TSB in the past month. In addition to my own meetings with the banks, officials in my Department meet senior management of each of the banks each month at least. The agendas for these meetings are wide-ranging and typically include updates on mortgage arrears, lending volumes across all portfolios, product pricing and profitability. My officials keep me briefed on these developments. On the specific question of mortgage arrears, the banks' arrears management teams provide updates on current trends and initiatives being taken by the banks to assist customers in financial difficulty and the distressed credit environment in general. In the case of SMEs, AIB and Bank of Ireland submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office at the beginning of each year. The banks also meet the Department and the Credit Review Office every quarter to discuss progress. The Credit Review Office is also available to review cases where credit facilities up to â¬3 million are refused, withdrawn or offered on unreasonable conditions. There are more than â¬2 billion of State supports available in the SME and farming sector, including large supports from Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund. On the topic of variable interest rates, the Deputy may be aware that this was subject to lengthy discussions with the banks' CEOs at the most recent meetings of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. At those meetings the banks pointed out that in comparing the standard variable rate mortgage margin of Irish banks with other jurisdictions, it is important to understand that the difference reflects many factors and loss experience, in particular, which determines the capital that must be held against these loans. In recent years this has obviously been very different for Irish banks compared with their counterparts in other European countries. Funding models also differ between Ireland and other countries. They pointed out the shortcomings of comparing mortgage rates against short-term ECB funding rates, given the significant liquidity risk which is a feature of mortgages that typically have a 20-year term.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	I respect the fact the Minister does not run the day-to-day business of the banks and that there is a relationship framework in place to provide for that separation. I would expect, however, the Minister and other members of the Government to have regular and ongoing engagement with the banks, in particular the State-supported banks, on the key issues of concern to the people and the economy, such as interest rates, the handling of mortgage arrears and the issue of lending to the SME sector. The Economic Management Council last met the banks in June 2012, almost three years ago at this stage. At that time there was a detailed discussion on mortgage arrears. The Minister has stated he met the CEOs of the banks in July last year. This level of engagement is not sufficient. It is helpful and to be welcomed that the Minister's officials regularly meet the senior management of the banks. When the CEOs of the banks are contacted, however, and a meeting is requested by the Minister or with the Economic Management Council - we have many issues with that council but it exists and it might as well use its powers and influence - there has not been any meeting with the banks since June 2012, and I find that extraordinary. There is a need to step up engagement with the banks on those key issues, while respecting that a relationship framework is in place which separates the Minister from the day-to-day management of those banks.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	There is a relationship framework in place, the details of which the Deputy is fully aware of. My officials meet the banks every month. They are sometimes in daily contact with them on specific issues. Otherwise it is weekly contact. I work with my officials who brief me and I give them my view. I transmit views to the banks through my officials. There is merit in doing it on a hands-off basis because it would not be appropriate for very frequent meetings between the political side and the commercial side. It gives rise to the suspicion that there is political interference in commercial decisions. I favour a hands-off approach but I favour a full flow of information. That is the way it is organised in my Department. The banks do not report to the Economic Management Council. That was one specific occasion when one specific set of issues needed to be discussed at a very high level in Government. The Department of Finance is the interface with the banks because we are the shareholders. I am the shareholder in the banks. There is constant and regular contact with officials who report to me in detail, both verbally and in writing.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	To an extent there is also merit in a hands-on approach. If there is a lack of direct engagement by senior people in the Government, this sends a signal to the banks that the Government endorses their approach and is satisfied with what they are doing in respect of mortgage arrears, interest rates and their role in lending to the economy.The Minister was far from hands-off when it came to meeting people from private equity funds or so-called vulture funds. He met them eight times in 2013 and 2014; personnel from the Department met them 65 times. In contrast, there were five meetings with advocacy groups for those in mortgage arrears and the Minister attended none of them. The Minister can be quite hands-on when he wants to be in dealing with vulture funds but he certainly has not been hands-on in using his very significant influence with the banks on the issues of concern to the Irish people.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	Those are just accusations of a personal nature. When the Deputy cannot make any ground in a logical argument, it is an attempt to introduce some kind of smear.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	It is not. Those are facts.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I meet the appropriate people. There is nobody at any senior level in any of the banks who does not know that what is being done is being monitored very closely by the Department of Finance and me.

Will he update the House on any discussions he has had on the so-called knowledge box tax incentive, which is proposed and which I understand is currently out for consultation for a period?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	In the 2015 budget, I introduced the new document, A Road Map for Ireland's Tax Competitiveness, to update the objectives set out in the 2013 international tax strategy and to set out a clear path for this country's tax competitiveness into the future. The roadmap set out a comprehensive package of measures designed to reposition Ireland to reap the benefits of sustainable foreign direct investment in a changing international tax landscape. The knowledge development box, KDB, which the Deputy has asked about, was one of the measures announced in the roadmap. The knowledge development box is not intended to be a replacement for the so-called "double Irish", which was never part of the Irish tax offering, and it was just one example of the many international tax planning arrangements designed by tax and legal advisers to take advantage of mismatches between the tax rules in two or more countries. However, the reality is that the "double Irish" was damaging Ireland's reputation. For that reason, I introduced a change to Ireland's corporate tax residence rules in budget 2015. I view the knowledge development box as a potentially positive measure for Ireland. It is recognised internationally that investment and growth in OECD economies is increasingly driven by knowledge-based investment, which is related to research and development and intellectual property. Putting in place an attractive tax offering for developing and commercially exploiting intellectual property is therefore important to encourage companies to develop their knowledge-based capital in Ireland and for our continued success in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland. A public consultation to gather views on how the knowledge development box should operate was launched on 14 January and will remain open until 8 April. The consultation paper invites submissions from interested parties on their views of how the knowledge development box should be designed to ensure it meets the key objective of being the most competitive in class, within the agreed international parameters for fair tax competition in this area. As is the case with all public consultations that have been undertaken by my Department on corporation tax, input is welcomed from all sections of society and I encourage all interested parties to have an input to this process. With regard to my recent visit to the US, I met people from a number of major multinational companies, representative bodies and tax advisers with the chief executive of IDA Ireland, Mr. Martin Shanahan, to update them on Ireland's international tax strategy. The feedback from investors on the medium-term corporation tax strategy, which is set out in the roadmap document,
was very positive.

In terms of the development of proposals for the knowledge development box, has the Minister come to a conclusion on the rate or how it will be structured? Does the Minister have a clear vision for that? Has there been much opposition expressed from interested parties through the consultation process? Has the Minister given much consideration to tailoring it for the benefit of indigenous Irish companies as well? We are well aware of the context, which is a changing international tax environment, and specifically continued inward investment, which we all wish to see from foreign direct investment companies. There is a major opportunity for domestic companies to avail of it as well.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	Over a number of years, a number of European countries have had patent boxes, which were designed so that intellectual property would be attracted to the countries that had such patent boxes. Patent boxes became controversial and there were discussions within Europe and driven by the OECD to abolish patent boxes completely. Two years ago, I would have said that I did not foresee these being replaced by anything else. Opinion in the OECD and within Europe has come to a point where the specific encouragement of research and development through something analogous to patent boxes is deemed to be appropriate in the tax portfolios of countries. Quite restrictive definitions are being developed. Talks are ongoing at OECD and European level but we now know that the principle of patent or knowledge boxes has been accepted and the parameters are being negotiated actively. I have not decided on the appropriate rate and any innovation we introduce will apply to indigenous companies as well as foreign direct investment companies.

Will there be specific tailoring of the knowledge development box for the benefit of particular domestic industries and sectors etc.?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	We are open to submissions from interested parties and there is a consultative process. Currently, I do not see a need to distinguish between indigenous and inward-investment companies. If the incentives are available through the tax system for research and development, they should apply equally. I cannot see what added advantage could be designed for indigenous companies.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	I have listened to much debate on the different aspects of mortgage problems this morning. As it stands, matters relating to mortgage arrears and negotiations are governed by the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears. These are weighted overwhelmingly in favour of the lender and removing local branches from the decision-making process further weighs against the borrower and makes it a bit more difficult. It does not do much for the borrower getting a fair deal.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	Borrower engagement with a bank, including the local branch, is very important in dealing with mortgage arrears. I am informed by the Central Bank that under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, lenders must establish a centralised, dedicated and adequately staffed arrears support unit, ASU, to manage cases under the mortgage arrears resolution process. It is the responsibility of the lender's arrears support unit to carry out certain functions under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. For example, the lender must pass the completed standard financial statement to its arrears support unit immediately on receipt and provide a copy of the standard financial statement to the borrower; a completed standard financial statement must be assessed in a timely manner by the lender's arrears support unit; a lender's arrears support unit must formally review the borrower's case, including the standard financial statement, immediately where a borrower ceases to adhere to the terms of an alternative repayment arrangement; and a lender must allow the borrower a reasonable period of time to consider submitting an appeal to the appeals board, which must be at least 20 business days from the date of notification of the decision of the lender's arrears support unit. The code of conduct on mortgage arrears also requires that each branch or office in the case of a lender who does not operate a branch network must have at least one person with specific responsibility for dealing with arrears and pre-arrears cases and for liaising with the lender's dedicated arrears support unit in respect of these cases. Therefore, while the code of conduct on mortgage arrears requires that a lender's arrears support unit, as opposed to the branch, is charged with managing cases under the mortgage arrears resolution process, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears does not preclude a borrower from liaising with the lender's arrears support unit through the branch staff member with specific responsibility for dealing with arrears and pre-arrears cases and for liaising with the lender's dedicated arrears support unit in respect of these cases.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	While I realise the Government has introduced initiatives which should help borrowers in their negotiations with lenders, the reality is a little more difficult for the lender. Sadly, despite the initiatives the Minister has introduced, there is very weak compellability on the lender to treat the borrower in a fashion that is 100% fair. I have found the banks inconsistent in their approach to distressed loans, commercial or private and, unfortunately, this is leading to repossessions. If a borrower wants to have the mortgage-to-rent scheme applied to his or her situation but the lender is against it, the borrower will find it impossible to make it happen, no matter how much he or she argues for it. While the Minister referred to the appeal process, given that the lender is not obliged even to inform the borrower of its decision making process, it is very difficult to appeal a decision.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	The arrears support unit, ASU, in accordance with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, has responsibility to assess a borrower's standard financial statement, SFS, and recommend the most appropriate course of action to eliminate mortgage arrears over time. The CCMA requires each branch to have at least one person with specific responsibility for dealing with arrears and pre-arrears cases and liaising with the lender's ASU. Borrowers may use this channel to seek assistance, for example, completing the SFS or dealing with any queries that may arise. There is a specific role for a designated branch member within the overall rules. Borrowers should insist on going that way if it suits them best.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	While I am aware of that, would the Minister not agree that it worked much better when banking was less centralised, local managers knew the clients with whom they were dealing and it was much easier to build a relationship? It is very difficult for somebody from the country to get a fair deal when dealing with a centralised authority in Dublin. When properties were further underwater, there was more interest on the part of the banks in considering solutions such as mortgage-to-rent, parking part of the mortgage and taking the borrower's capacity on board. Since asset values have recovered, there has been less appetite on the part of the banks to engage in these solutions, the goal posts have been moved and the banks are becoming more aggressive. While the Minister cannot control them completely, he has the potential to put manners on them in this area.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	We are continuing to review the position, and we review it on an ongoing basis. The essential element of restructuring is agreement between the two sides. If there is no agreement, there can be no restructuring. There is a menu of arrangements available, not all of which are working as well as others. The enormity of the problem was such that it could not have been resolved at local level. Because of the scale of the problem, it had to be centralised. General rules had to apply and it had to be centralised to make progress. As I said earlier, 115,000 mortgages have been restructured. The local contact is built into the procedure and a person must be designated in each branch to deal with mortgage arrears. This point of contact is still available at a local level and it should be used by the kinds of people the Deputy has described.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	I copied the Minister on a letter which Deputy Mac Lochlainn and I sent to the enforcement section of the Central Bank. In the letter, we summarised how, in December 2014, after receiving information from whistleblowers via us, the Central Bank fined Provident Personal Credit â¬105,000 "in respect of consumer protection failures relating to money lending loans". The charges against Provident were very serious: it was preying on very vulnerable people. I wrote to the enforcement section of the Central Bank because Provident has terminated the contracts of all five of the whistleblowers who sent the information to me and thence to the Central Bank. What does the Minister intend to do? This sends a very bad signal to whistleblowers in financial services. Does the Minister propose to take any action? Does he propose to engage with the Central Bank or the licensed moneylender?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me, asÂ Minister for Finance, to comment onÂ actions taken by any company in relation to specific employees. While I cannot provide legal advice on possible courses of action available to individuals who consider that they have been unfairly dismissed, I would advise such individuals to seekÂ appropriate legal advice. I am aware that the Central BankÂ fined Provident Personal Credit Limited â¬105,000 and reprimanded it for breaches of legislation relating to certain moneylending practices late last year. In its announcement of the settlement, the Central Bank made it clear that, where licensed moneylenders fail to ensure full compliance with their legal obligations, they should expect vigorous investigation and follow up by the Central Bank, and for the Central Bank to exercise its sanctioning powers where appropriate. I have been informed by the Central Bank that itÂ cannot discuss specific regulated financial service providers and I am not aware of the full details of the issue to which the Deputy refers. I understand that the Central Bank would welcome any information anyone wishes to provide regarding concerns they may have about firms it regulates. All such information received is reviewed and considered as part of the Central Bank's ongoing regulation of financial service providers. Part 5 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 providesÂ protections for individuals who make "protected disclosures" to the Central Bank. These protections are separate from the protections which apply by virtue of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. It is a matter for the Central Bank to ensure it uses its powers to ensure that individuals are protected and that it can continue to receive such disclosures. I am aware that the Deputy has raised the matter directly with the Central Bank and I trust that he will be satisfied that the bank ensures that the provisions of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 are used in a manner which ensures that employees are not penalised for reporting wrongdoing. The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.

Five employees of Provident came to me and Deputy Mac Lochlainn and gave us detailed documentation of irregularities in the company, which we passed on to the Central Bank. The Central Bank carried out an investigation, found Provident guilty of the charges that had been levelled and fined it â¬105,000. However, Provident terminated the contracts of all five employees, and this sends out a terrible signal to whistleblowers in financial services. We need something stronger from the Minister. It is unacceptable that whistleblowers who are in employment, provide documentation to the Central Bank and whose allegations are proven correct have their contracts terminated. I would like to hear more from the Minister about what he intends to so, not just citing the existing legislation and the responsibilities of the Central Bank.Does he intend to raise this with the Central Bank and to ask it to investigate if the termination of the contracts of these five whistleblowers was connected with the fact that they blew the whistle on the company in the first place or does he just intend to stand by and allow the bank to deal with it itself?

It relates to the definition of "medical assessor" and consequential amendments. We had a lengthy debate on this on Committee Stage and I propose the deletion of these lines.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I tabled two of these amendments, which are consequential on the proposed change. I do not have a major problem with the definition of "medical assessor" but my problem is that this change will facilitate the use of employment agencies instead of hiring medical practitioners directly. On Committee Stage, I reflected the practice in Britain when agency staff were introduced and the health service went outside public practice. A standard was set for medical assessors to achieve reductions in payments. A report in The Guardian about this, which I quoted, stated that this led to the death of a number of people because they were assessed as being fit for work when they were not. That put stress and pressure on them and forced them back into work when they were not ready. It needs to be ensured that what was done in Britain will not be replicated here. The Minister of State gave us an assurance that this is not the intention but, in the past, the Minister for Social Protection has sought support, for instance, for the re-employment of social welfare inspectors in the social welfare appeals office. We did not oppose that because the intention was good, which was to address a huge backlog of cases, and it was timebound. However, it involved a contract directly between the Department and the individuals in question for 11 months. That led to a reduction in waiting times. Nobody wants to exacerbate the current situation. There are not enough medical assessors and there is a significant delay in social welfare payments dependent on medical assessment. It is difficult to figure out why hiring someone through an employment agency rather than through a recruitment drive or via direct contracts with the Department would be better. It will result in an increased cost to the Exchequer because normally employment agencies charge a premium of between 15% and 20% on top of the remuneration of the staff they provide. If the salary is â¬100,000 a year, this means it will cost the State â¬120,000 a year. I am concerned that the Department is going down this route, especially since most medical professionals can access the Internet to find work through agencies. In addition, quite a number of doctors who are the basic equivalent of a medical assessor leave the country every year. I may be wrong but this is an attractive job in that people can take up contracts for a short duration while backlogs are addressed. In the long term, we have an ageing population. This will result in increased demand for assessments under the carer's allowance scheme, for instance. People who apply to care for elderly relatives will have to go through this process because an assessment must be made that the relative is in need of full-time care. Given advances in medical technology, people are living longer with complicated disabilities where previously they would only have survived for a few years. This is resulting in more medical intervention at an earlier stage and, therefore, the State is incurring increased social welfare payments on medical grounds, which will continue to increase in the future. There has been a significant jump in recent years as people who cannot afford the care required have become aware of the payments that are available and how to access them. Nobody denies the need for medical assessors and, therefore, my proposal is to delete the reference to employment agencies because my problem is that we will impose an additional cost on the Exchequer. We should support the other amendments to ensure people are not put under undue stress because of delays in processing applications for disability allowance, invalidity pension, domiciliary care allowance and so on. The other issue with bringing in agency staff is they will have to be trained to be medical assessors but they could disappear in the morning, although no more so than somebody employed directly. However, usually somebody who goes to the trouble of being employed directly has a little loyalty.At the moment we have a significant problem with medical assessments, which has not arisen of late but has been there for a while. On appeal over 50% of those assessments are overturned. They are not all due to a bad assessment. Many are due to additional medical documentation. However, it is still a high number, which means that work must be done to ensure staff, whether the current medical assessors or ones employed in future through this contract system, are fully aware of everything required, take their job as seriously as they can and give it as much care as they can. The medical assessors cannot do that if they are under pressure to move things along as quickly as possible. That is the pressure they are under because the in-pile on their desks is getting bigger and bigger. They need help, but the employment agency part is a bad move.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	We discussed this on Committee Stage and I have submitted another amendment, which attempts to take on board some of the defence the Government side gave when it came to the concerns that were raised by us at that stage. The Government said that there is, or can be, difficulty in getting qualified people to be medical assessors on a permanent, full-time basis, and for that reason they needed the option of getting people from employment agencies. Taking the Government in good faith in that regard, I have put forward an amendment that allows the Government that option, but only after the option of directly engaging people on a full-time, permanent basis has been exhausted. That is a fair compromise because it is not ideal that we should have agency people coming in. It can be more costly and is more haphazard because people are going in and out and not developing the necessary expertise. Another issue I will raise in regard to some of the other amendments I have tabled is that we need some discussion about the medical qualifications of these assessors. Are they specialists? Are they people who have specialised, expert knowledge in the particular areas they are supposed to be dealing with? I suspect they are not. As we will discuss later, even worse is the fact that we often have unqualified, non-medical people as deciding officers, second-guessing qualified medical practitioners who give diagnoses on the care and support needs of people with disabilities, which is totally unacceptable. We will come to that in a minute. At the very least, if the Government is saying that it is forced, in a non-ideal situation, to take agency people on for this staff sometimes, then it should only be as a last resort when the possibility of getting full-time, permanent and appropriately qualified people to make these medical assessments has been exhausted. Let us not forget, these applicants are very vulnerable, disabled people with real needs, who should be our absolute priority in this regard, never mind the need to have decently paid, proper jobs, for people performing this important task. My amendment is a fair attempt to deal with the Government's difficulty in getting medical assessors while prioritising the objective of getting full-time, permanent, directly employed people wherever possible.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	I certainly agree with the thinking behind these amendments. We are all dealing, day in, day out, with constituents who are suffering because of inordinate delays in medical assessments. As I understand it, the Minister of State said on Committee Stage that the Department is quite willing to take on extra medical assessors. I presume the money is available to do that, but it cannot get people to apply for the jobs. I do not for one minute doubt the Minister of State's bona fides, but I find that difficult to understand because, as has been said, people who qualify as doctors are leaving the country looking for employment. It is not as if we are confined to Ireland when we are seeking to recruit these people. We have the whole world from which to recruit. As has been said, and for all the reasons stated, it would be preferable to recruit people directly to work full time in these jobs if possible. Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment seems to be a reasonable compromise. My understanding is that the Department wants to recruit permanent people, it cannot get them so it proposes therefore to fill the gap by resorting to people from agencies. If that is the situation, then amendment No. 4 is only putting into legislative form what is happening in practice already. I do not see any difficulty, therefore, for the Government to incorporate that into the legislation.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	I thank Deputies for their contribution. As Deputy Collins said, we debated this extensively on Committee Stage. The Public Appointments Service recently conducted a competition to recruit permanent medical assessors for the Department. Following that competition, ten doctors were placed on the panel. One doctor has since withdrawn from it and four of them will start on 27 April. In addition, PAS will be asked to run a similar competition again. I reassure Deputy Ã Snodaigh that it certainly is not the British model as he outlined. Was it discussed in The Guardian or The Daily Telegraph?

#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	That is not the intention of the Department. There are obvious benefits in being able to use agency medical assessors as required in the case of a backlog. It does not make sense to recruit them on a permanent basis in the long term. Why establish additional services we do not need long term? However, we are committed to keeping the current demand of 25 permanent medical assessors in place. This gives us additional ability to draw on five agency medical assessors as required. I think I explained on Committee Stage that they would be embedded in the Department, they would be given full training and the aim is to carry out the service in a more efficient manner, to deliver a better outcome to applicants and to reduce further the existing backlog. I accept that Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment was intended to be constructive. However, the ability to access agencies gives us additional flexibility in that regard. I accept the good intentions and the merits of what he outlines, but I would like to see us making significant inroads into that backlog. At the moment, we should be looking at a permanent base of about 25 medical assessors, with the possibility of drawing on five additional agency medical assessors as required to deal with that backlog. For that reason, I do not propose to accept the amendments.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	I also tabled an amendment to this section on the basis that the Minister of State would not accept the deletion of the section itself. My amendment was to add that agency staff were:only to be engaged for short term, specific work loads or backlogs and only after all attempts to fill permanent positions to be agreed between workers representatives and the Department.I do not understand why the Minister of State also cannot accept that amendment as it stands, because it states that while it can happen under certain circumstances, in general the idea would always be to recruit directly into these positions.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	I have listened and I welcome the progress that has been made in ensuring we will achieve the maximum number of medical assessors.The population is ageing. Is the Minister of State confident that putting the full complement of 25 in place and addressing the backlog would be sufficient to deal with future needs, or will there be a continuous need for agency staff? This is my concern. I have no problem with using contract staff for a while to deal with a backlog. I am realistic enough about this and I supported it for dealing with the social welfare appeals backlog because it was time-bound. Will the Minister of State assure us that once the backlog is dealt with the need for contract staff will end? Will the medical assessors' contract be on the basis of being paid by results or by case, or of being in situ? There is an issue of accountability. A promise was made in the Haddington Road agreement that work would not be outsourced and the Department would be protected. I want to ensure we are not doing something which flies in the face of this and undermines it or lays the basis for future outsourcing.

I am not entirely sure why the Minister of State will not accept what I think is a reasonable compromise amendment, because it would set it out clearly in the legislation that while the option is retained to use agency people where they are needed, the optimum situation is for us to employ people on a full-time permanent and direct basis rather than on an agency basis. The amendment I have tabled is in line with what the Minister of State said, and deals with his concern that this option should be available. I am not sure why he will not accept it.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	88	To answer Deputy Ã Snodaigh, as is the case for all staff in the Department, the need for medical assessors is kept under constant review. Everybody in the House realises that while we have quite a young population at present, we face very large challenges in the future, and it will have to be reviewed by future Governments as time goes on. As the make-up of the population changes there will be demands not only on social protection but also on health and other services. It will have to be constantly kept under review. The medical assessors will operate as they do at present. The Deputy can correct me if I am wrong, but his concern is that when they were introduced in England they were paid on a results basis according to the number of people they knocked off the system. I reassure the Deputy that this is not my intention, nor that of the TÃ¡naiste. Our intention is to have a more practical operational mechanism in the Department. As I outlined earlier, we will recruit more permanent people. The intention is not to do as the Deputy outlined, which is payment based on results, whereby medical assessors would be paid on the basis of the number of people to whom they disallow benefit. This is certainly not my intention, and I would view it as being quite serious if this operational procedure was introduced in the Department. I would not be at all happy with such a mechanism with regard to dealing with people in a respectful and dignified manner. I give the House this commitment. I know what Deputy Boyd Barrett is trying to do, but we are trying to have flexibility. Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 tabled by Deputy Boyd Barrett and Joan Collins would significantly restrict the circumstances in which medical assessors would be engaged through agency arrangements. This would likely make the system unworkable and would remove the flexibility required in the new arrangement. We are actively engaging; four new doctors have been recruited and will start on 27 April if they take up the positions, and the indications at the moment are that they will. We will hold another similar competition. On Committee Stage, Deputy Collins asked about their salary. Everyone in the House is on a respectable salary; I can certainly live on it, as can anyone else in the House. There are restrictions in the way the Deputies have formatted the proposals. We will hold a competition to recruit more doctors for the panel. On any one day we have between 17 and 19 doctors available for medical assessments, and we want to ensure we have efficiencies. We will deal with the backlog that Deputy O'Dea spoke about in a Private Members' debate. I have a strong commitment to this. There is a willingness and commitment in the Department to reduce as much as possible any backlog that exists.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	I move amendment No. 7:In page 6, to delete lines 31 to 38, and in page 7, to delete lines 1 to 30.This was discussed on Committee Stage, and in an effort to be reasonable and take on board the Government's concerns while addressing the issues we raised, we have tabled a series of amendments which shift the balance of presumption about people's entitlement to carers and supports towards the positive and away from the negative. To clarify what I mean, the Bill states, "For the purposes of the definition of 'relevant person' in this Chapter, a person shall not be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention unless the person has such a disability that he or she requires from another person" continual supervision throughout the day, and other requirements outlined in the Bill. This series of amendments proposes that the Bill should state that a person shall be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention.It is a positive rather than a negative. I think the negative wording in this Bill is symptomatic of what is actually going on in the Department. We will come to this again later when we are dealing with another issue in the context of other amendments, some of which bizarrely have been ruled out of order. The bureaucratic default position of rejecting people's applications is probably influenced by budgetary considerations. Many vulnerable people, including some who are disabled, are being put through unnecessary hoops in order to access their rights and entitlements. These people, who are already suffering in difficulty, need to be supported. The framing of this whole legislation, not just this section or this part of the Bill, is about tightening up and providing the legislative back-up to say "No" as the first response. If it is not the case that it will place a bigger onus on the applicant who is seeking to get resources or supports, and if our anxieties and concerns that this is the inclination of the Department and the Government are misplaced, the Minister of State should have no reason to refuse our amendments. If the intention of the Bill is to provide support to anybody who is entitled to that support, as it should be, there is absolutely no reason for the Minister of State not to accept these amendments. The only reason to refuse to accept them would be a desire to retain a provision that will make it easier to say "No" without good cause. I hope that is not the case, but some of us on this side of the House suspect that it is.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	We are dealing with this section again. We all feel we are expressing the negativity of this section when we say that the inclusion of the word "not" is negative law-making. This has quite clearly been outlined by the Free Legal Advice Centres, which have major concerns about this section. We are questioning why the Department and the Minister of State want to change the current legislation in this way. Given that it has worked effectively up to now with no negative content in it, why do the Department and the Minister of State specifically want to change it now? When we debated this matter on Committee Stage last week, I tabled an amendment which would have provided that a person would not be regarded as requiring full-time care unless "the nature and extent of the personâs incapacity has been certified in the prescribed manner by a medical practitioner including the person's own General Practitioner". I intended that this certification would determine the eligibility of the person's application on medical grounds. The Minister of State suggested that the amendment tabled by Deputy Boyd Barrett and me last week was too broad because it would affect the means testing of the whole application. That is why I have tabled a similar amendment that refers specifically to the "personâs eligibility on the medical grounds eligibility of the application". I think it is a very practical amendment to the Bill. I will conclude by reiterating that I want to know why this section of the Bill is necessary. There is concern on the Opposition benches that it is being introduced to tighten up the process that has to be followed by vulnerable people when they are looking for grants and benefits and to put the onus on such people to prove they have illnesses that are so bad that they require carers to assist them.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	97	These amendments relate to the obstacles that have to be overcome by a person in order to qualify for and receive carer's allowance or carer's benefit. Every Deputy in the House will know from his or her experience in his or her constituency that people do not apply for carer's allowance lightly. I accept that some people do not meet the criteria. People do not apply for it lightly. Deputies will also be aware that in practice, it is extremely difficult to get carer's allowance. That is not to say that many people who apply for it do not ultimately get it. As the Minister of State told us on Committee Stage, the figures with regard to people qualifying may have improved. The number of hoops through which applicants now have to jump to get carer's allowance is not measured. It is probably not possible to measure it. On Committee Stage, I instanced cases in which people who were extremely ill - in some cases, they died before a final decision was made - were refused carer's allowance in the first instance because they were deemed not to be sick enough. In fact, it was brought to my attention this morning that an unfortunate constituent of mine, in respect of whom I have been making representations for carer's allowance, is being removed from a funeral home this evening. I was told initially that he was not sick enough. That was a couple of months ago. The man died yesterday. It is difficult. People who are ultimately determined to have been entitled to carer's allowance all the time, having gone through the appeals system and the review, etc., are experiencing inordinate delays and terrible stress as they wait for the their applications to be finalised. I could also mention the stress on their family members who have to support them in the meantime. The legislation governing carer's allowance that is on the Statute Book at the moment - the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 - is pretty neutral. Obviously, it puts the onus on applicants to apply and produce certain documentation with regard to medical conditions in order to satisfy the Department that the person being cared for fulfils the requisite criteria. It is now proposed that our legislation will, for the first time in history, put the burden of proof very firmly on the unfortunate applicant. I suggest we should stand back from all the technicalities and look at the effect of this proposal. I suggest it can only make it more difficult for somebody to qualify for carer's allowance. To look at it the other way around, it can only make it easier for the Department to say "No". That is the net effect. It cannot have any other possible effect. If one looks at the way this Bill is written, one will see it provides that a person will "not" qualify "unless" he or she meets certain conditions. The onus is firmly on the applicant. The Minister of State said something I found quite extraordinary during the Committee Stage debate. He said "it has always been the case that the onus has been on the claimant", but I believe that if one examines the wording of the 2005 Act, one will see that this has patently not been the case. He suggested that the provisions of this Bill will retrospectively justify what has always been the reality and what has been happening all the time. That is tantamount to saying that the Department has been misapplying the original legislation all the time, and that an amendment must be passed to retrospectively justify that misapplication. It is difficult to get carer's allowance. It is difficult for the unfortunate ill people who are waiting for the money to come through. It causes great stress to such people because they feel they are a burden on their relatives. In my experience, it causes enormous financial stress for the relatives in many cases. The last thing we want is legislation that makes it more difficult to qualify, or easier for the Department to say "No". I earnestly entreat the Minister of State, even if he makes no other amendments to this legislation, to withdraw this section of it or to adopt the wording of the amendments as outlined. As I have said, it is difficult enough already. There is no point in making it any more difficult. Only the vulnerable will suffer.

As the Free Legal Advice Centres have indicated in their submission, this is negative legislation. I would like to remind people of exactly what is provided for in the relevant legislation at present.In respect of carer's allowance, section 179(4) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 states, "For the purposes of subsection (1), a relevant person shall be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where". The new provision states, "For the purposes of the definition of ârelevant personâ in this Chapter, a person shall not be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention". The use of "not" puts a different emphasis on the criteria or the burden of proof that someone who is applying for carerâs allowance needs to achieve. It is difficult, as other Deputies have said, to get carerâs allowance. Some of this is due to complications such as not providing enough documentation. Some of it is due to incomplete medical assessments. Now, an additional hurdle is being put in place. The Minister of State might claim this is not the case as it is just a different way of drafting it. We are supposed to be promoting plain English and ensuring legislation is accessible. Once one starts writing in the negative, it makes it more convoluted and difficult to understand where someone qualifies or does not. As a rule, legislation should not be written in the negative but this is what this provision does. In its submission to the legislation, FLAC, the Free Legal Advice Centres, and the Community Law and Mediation group also made this point. It stated:In practice, the proposed amendments to carerâs payments will allow decision-makers to adopt a presumptive position; that is, it will be presumed that a person is ineligible for a payment, âunlessâ it can be proven otherwise. This is an unacceptable shift in the burden of proof that falls to a prospective claimant; it is negative law-making. Referring to the existing definition, the conditions for receipt of the relevant payments are clear, a person must need full-time care and the applicant must prove this need exists. When determining a personâs eligibility decision-makers must make a reasoned finding from a position of neutrality and objectivity. The amendments if passed will have the effect of placing a greater burden of proof on the applicant, as the decision-maker will be considering the evidence from the perspective that the applicant is ineligible in the first instance. We are in no doubt that this will have the effect of increasing the number of legitimate claims that are rejected, and this will in turn lead to a corresponding increase in the number of appeals that will be submitted to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. Notably, according to the Social Welfare Appeals Office report 2013, an average of 58% of those appealing decisions in respect of carers payments were successful. Lengthy appeal processing time for carerâs allowance, benefit and respite care grant currently stand at 22.6, 20.1 and 19.1 weeks respectively as of January 2015. The proposed amendment could increase the rate of appeal and cause further delays in processing appeals also resulting in undue hardship and distress for claimants who are entitled to these payments. We recommend that section 3 ... is deleted as it does not present as having a purpose other than to make it more difficult for carers to access income supports since it does not alter the actual conditions for eligibility other than introducing a presumption that claimants are ineligible unless they can prove otherwise. If passed, prospective claimants will be presumed to be ineligible for a payment unless they can prove otherwise. This constitutes an unacceptable shift in the burden of proof placed on an applicant.We should not be changing legislation unless there is a purpose to doing so. Is there some other purpose to this legislative change from the positive to the negative emphasis that we, FLAC or the Community Law and Mediation groups have not understood?
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	99	I already gave the figures which show an increase in the numbers being awarded carerâs allowance. The figures do not bear out Deputy OâDeaâs assertion the Department is operating the scheme in a different fashion. There appears to be a misconception that section 4 is in some way shifting the burden of proof from the Department to the claimant and that a negative presumption is being introduced that a person is not entitled to the allowance. I am aware that Deputy OâDea made such a comment on Committee Stage and FLAC has also stated this. There is no such negative presumption being introduced. It is always the case that the onus is on the claimant, whether for carerâs allowance or any other social welfare payment, to provide the necessary information in support of his or her application to prove eligibility. There is no change in this regard. Deputy OâDea has also argued that he not seen the word âunlessâ used in such legislative measures. The use of the unless clause is already found throughout the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 such as in sections 40, 44 and 45 for illness benefit, sections 62 and 67 for jobseekerâs benefit, section 141 for jobseekerâs allowance and section 128 for widowâs pension. Deciding officers make no presumption as to the eligibility or otherwise of any claimant for any scheme. Each claim is made on merit and the information available to the deciding officer and in accordance with the statutory conditions for eligibility set out in the relevant legislation. The current legislative provision for the carerâs scheme states a relevant person shall be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where he or she requires continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or continual supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself. The legal advice I have received indicates that this provision could be read as meaning a relevant person, as defined under section 179(4) of the principal Act, could be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention in other circumstances. In other words, the current definition is not an exhaustive one and, in essence, it is ambiguous. For the avoidance of doubt, section 4 of Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015 provides that a person will only be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention of the purpose of the carerâs scheme where he or she requires continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or continual supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself. In other words, the person will not be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention unless he or she satisfies those conditions. These changes bring the legislation into line with how these schemes are actually operating since their inception. I refute any suggestion that these changes are being made to make it more difficult for persons to qualify for carerâs allowance.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	100	I do not believe the Government on this one. There is no justification to the changes it is making. From an objective analysis of the current legislative wording, any sane and sensible person will see the Government is tightening the criteria around the eligibility to justify current practice which is completely wrong and unfair.It inflicts unnecessary hardship on legitimate applicants who, I repeat, are vulnerable and disabled people who are being refused supports and benefits they should get when they are ill and vulnerable and need support. That is what is going on. It relates to people who are being refused at first instance and who subsequently get it on appeal when they go through hoops or come to Deputies' clinics. These Deputies go to oral hearings or submit letters to get these people through the hoops to get them benefits and supports they should have got in the first place. Bizarrely, our amendments suggesting that the medical eligibility criteria and the diagnoses of GPs and qualified medical practitioners be simply accepted and not second-guessed by unqualified, non-medical deciding officers have been ruled out of order on the basis that they are a charge on the Exchequer. If someone meets the medical criteria for a benefit they are entitled to apply for and a medical practitioner testifies that they are eligible, how can that be a potential charge on the Exchequer? That is rubbish. It is a disingenuous way of trying to cover up what is going on here, which is a tightening up of eligibility rules. There is no doubt about it.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	101	I must concur with Deputy Boyd Barrett. Nothing the Minister of State has said has convinced me and many other people that there is a need for this. FLAC has come out and said that section 3 should be deleted as it does not present as having a purpose other than to make it more difficult for carers to access income supports since it does not alter the actual conditions for eligibility other than introducing a presumption that claimants are ineligible unless they can prove otherwise. If passed, prospective claimants will be presumed to be ineligible for a payment unless they can prove otherwise. This constitutes an unacceptable shift in the burden of proof placed on an applicant. I believe what FLAC is saying. My experience of dealing with cases heretofore leads me to believe that this is what it will do. Over the past three years in our areas, we have seen a pulling back in many instances, from community welfare officers into the city centre, particularly in Bishop's Square. Tightening things up all the time makes it more difficult for people. There is no flexibility on the part of community welfare officers in dealing with individual cases, clothing allowance, etc. We now see a very specific knot in our legislation relating to carer's allowance. Our amendments relate to medical criteria. They do not affect means testing, which must accompany an application. The amendments propose that a GP's recommendation or determination regarding a person's medical needs be accepted. Obviously, a deciding officer can look at the other aspects relating to getting carer's allowance.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	102	The Minister of State said I had indicated that this is completely new in social welfare legislation. I did not say that. I said I am aware it appears in various aspects of social welfare legislation but I also said it was new in respect of applying for carer's allowance. I said it is a reversal of the words of the 2005 Act which cover carer's allowance. We can argue about numbers and the numbers qualifying have increased. The number of people qualifying for carer's allowance may have increased but the obstacles they must undergo to get it have also increased quite appreciably. It is a pretty devastating indictment of the system that more than 50% of people who were initially refused carer's allowance, in the main because they were deemed to be medically ineligible, ultimately qualify when they go through either a review or the appeals process. That takes months and sometimes up to a year and a half. I have known cases that took two years from beginning to end. That means that people who were entitled to this State benefit under the laws of the State were messed around and delayed for up to two years before they got their benefit. This is a travesty in respect of some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in this country. The Minister of State says there is no change in the legislation even though the legislation we are debating today differs from the initial qualifying legislation. The Minister says this makes no difference. The 2005 Act sets out when a person is entitled to carer's allowance. This legislation is saying they are not entitled to carer's allowance unless certain conditions are met. Any lawyer from one end of the country to the other will readily conclude that this is a very definitive shift in the burden of proof. It places the burden of proof firmly on the shoulders of the applicant. FLAC has indicated that and its views have been set out in this House. FLAC did not give that opinion lightly. It has access to the best legal advice possible in this area. I have the greatest respect for officials in the Department but if it comes to a legal dispute and the officials are on one side and FLAC is on the other, I know which side I would be on. If, as the Minister of State says, this makes no change, why write it in? What are we doing? We ask questions every day and we will be asking them shortly about promised legislation that has yet to appear. What are we doing putting clauses in legislation that are not needed and that by the Government's own admission make no difference? This can only tighten up the provisions relating to carer's allowance. We should remember that this is a means-tested payment. Millionaires do not qualify for carer's allowance so the poorest and most vulnerable people in the country are the ones who will be adversely affected.

An applicant always has the burden of proof, which is understandable, but the language in the past was positive rather than negative. I will not delay matters further. I read what FLAC had to say and it captured my view. I am a firm believer that our legislation should be simplified rather than made more complex. Making it negative will result in the latter.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	104	Deputy O'Dea knows that we normally get two social welfare Bills per year. This period is also used as an opportunity to tidy up legislation. The Deputy knows that from being in Government over many decades. I will be very clear. Our legal advice is that there is no shift in presumption. I refute the suggestion that these changes are being made to make it more difficult for a person to qualify for carer's allowance. Deputy O'Dea is aware that the statistics, analysis and facts show that more people have been on carer's allowance during the lifetime of this Government than at any other time.I am not surprised that Deputy Boyd Barrett does not believe the Government. I have never heard him say that he believes the Government or any individual on this side of the House. I hope he will accept the facts as I have set them out. On Deputy Joan Collins' point regarding the transfer of services to the Intreo offices at Bishop's Square, the Intreo offices act as a one-stop-shop. As result of this move service provision is now much more efficient, in particular for the customer. I have gone out of my way to talk to people across the country who have interacted with the new Intreo offices. They have nothing but good to say about them. People welcome that they now need to interact with only one office on a range of social protection issues, including re-entry into the workforce.  I am unable to accept the amendments.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	105	I do believe the Minister of State but I do not believe the Government's intent in terms of this legislation. We have all seen, in practice, what is going on. The Government needs to get its head around what is going on and the actual intention of this legislation. When one looks at this issue in the round one begins to wonder if the thought process behind this Bill is to shave a particular budget to cover the cost of the back-to-work family dividend. Whether or not this is the overall thinking behind this Bill, people who are vulnerable and disabled, who are entitled to care or support, are being refused it because of the default position of "if we can refuse them, we will refuse them." The people in FLAC are very reasonable. Under the principal Act, the term "relevant people" is defined as follows:(4) For the purposes of subsection (1), a relevant person shall be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention whereâ (a) the person has such a disability that he or she requires from another personâ (i) continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions, or (ii) continual supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself, (b) the person has such a disability that he or she is likely to require full-time care and attention for at least 12 consecutive months, and (c) the nature and extent of the personâs disability has been certified in the prescribed manner by a registered medical practitioner.That is positive. To get support a person needs only to meet those criteria and the medical practitioner's certification of eligibility is taken as fact. However, this legislation as drafted seeks to tighten up this provision in line with the practice over the past few years of deciding officers second-guessing doctors. Unqualified, non-medical people are second-guessing the diagnoses of general practitioners and medical professionals in order to deny people supports to which they are entitled.  Interestingly, our amendments, which seek to provide that a general practitioner's diagnosis be accepted, have been ruled out of order. They were also ruled out of order on Committee Stage. When we asked on Committee Stage why they had been ruled out of order we were told it was because they would result in a charge on the Exchequer. What does this mean? It means that budgetary constraints are overriding medical diagnoses. That is clearly apparent. The fear of the Department is that if the word of GPs in regard to whether a person needs care or support is accepted this will impact on its budget. This is not the basis on which care and supports should be provided. It should be the case that where a doctor certifies that a person requires care or support that support is provided. This legislation provides that somebody else, who is not a doctor or a qualified professional, can disagree with the GP and not provide the support. Applications are being delayed in the hope that some of the applicants will go away out of frustration, which many of them do. This is what this legislation seeks to do. There is no doubt about that.  I propose to press this amendment because too many people are suffering unnecessarily as a result of this.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	106	Tomorrow morning thousands of workers from Dunnes Stores will go on strike across the country. They do not want to do this but they are being forced. This reflects a broader casualisation of the workforce, a regressive trend towards lower pay and less security of hours. The strike tomorrow is essentially about low-hour contracts that have become the norm in certain sectors of the economy. It is about a simple abuse of power that a major employer is exercising over thousands of employees. I do not say that lightly. Some 76% of the company's workforce is now working so-called part-time flexible hours. Some 70% of those in that workforce are women. The employees face uncertainty each week. They experience a fundamental lack of security and cannot plan their lives. There is no decency at the heart of the relationship between this employer and the workers. I have met some of the workers. What was most disquieting was their fear that they could be punished by their employer simply for meeting me. That was said. It is like going back to the 19th century. We are to celebrate the centenary of the Rising next year. The Government's programme in this regard was launched yesterday. I asked myself the basic question as to whether employee rights are going backwards in certain sectors. Employees cannot obtain mortgages and cannot even get car loans. Worst of all, the system is used to control workers. They are threatened with a reduction in hours if they are not on-side and do not play ball. Sick pay is orchestrated and is almost non-existent. There is limited holiday pay, and so on. All the workers are seeking are banded-hour contracts, which Marks & Spencer, Tesco, SuperValu and Penneys have all given. It is very regrettable and shameful that an Irish employer does not see fit to give them. Most people in this House, including me, support basic decency. I have a basic question for the Taoiseach: does he support the Dunnes Stores workers who are going on strike tomorrow? I ask him to say he does and to articulate clearly a loud message that should be articulated by everybody in this House: we will not tolerate this abuse of power over employees. Will the Taoiseach introduce a fair working hours Act to stop this abuse of workers? The existing legislative safeguards are no longer adequate to stop what is going on. It must stop, and the message must be sent out that if the current practices continue there will be legislative response to ensure they do not.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	107	On the occasion of the launch by the Government of the Low Pay Commission, which is being handled by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, its Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and specifically the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, I had a brief meeting with the representative from Mandate Trade Union, who explained to me the position of the workers in Dunnes Stores. I support certainty and the right of people to know from their employer what hours they are expected to work each week, in so far as that is possible. Deputy Martin is aware that the Low Pay Commission has already started its process of meetings. It will report in July and the Government will act in response to that. The Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, is dealing with the question of zero-hour contracts. Deputy Martin mentioned a fair working hours Act. I will wait to see the response and proposals of the Minister of State. It is not for me, in the position I occupy, to say whether the strike should take place. This is not the first time these kinds of circumstances have arisen. As the Deputy pointed out, other stores have had to deal with this matter. They dealt with it clearly in the interest of their workers, with a view to their having clarity and confidence in respect of their working futures. I am clear that the workers in Dunnes Stores deserve no less. They need to be told by their employers what the week and month ahead hold and, in so far as possible, what the time ahead holds. I hope the mechanisms that have been in place for quite some time apply here so people will not have to go on strike. I hope the employers in this case can understand the consequences of not providing clarity to the thousands of loyal workers who provide services to those who shop in the stores daily.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	108	The reason I ask the Taoiseach to say he supports the Dunnes Stores workers unequivocally is because I genuinely believe a message must go out to the employer in this instance. As a former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I know all the usual processes and mechanisms. Dunnes Stores has refused to engage with the Labour Relations Commission or Labour Court, or to adopt its recommendations. It has refused flatly to engage with the workforce representatives, as recommended by the Labour Court. There comes a time when everybody should stand up for basic decency in terms of that relationship. The experience of the workers demonstrates excessive abuse of power over the workforce. As legislators, we cannot stand over what is going on. Everybody has been rostered for Thursday, deliberately. Even those who might have hospital appointments have been rostered, deliberately, to put them behind the eight ball, so to speak, or put them under pressure such that if they do not turn up there may be consequences for them. That is what is being said on the ground to the workers. It is intolerable and unacceptable. With the greatest of respect to the Low Pay Commission, I do not believe it will deal with this. I have not read any proposals from the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, that will apply to this issue right now. The most powerful message that could go out would be a message from the Taoiseach stating he supports the Dunnes Stores workers and that the management should do what others have done, that is, apply the very basics. The requests were quite minimal. No one is looking for an earth-shattering change, just very basic rules so workers can at least plan their lives with some degree of dignity and decency. There is an absence of dignity and decency at the heart of how Dunnes Stores is treating its workers.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	109	Let me be clear. It is not the intention that the Low Pay Commission or the work Minister of State Deputy Gerald Nash is doing in respect of zero-hour contracts will deal with this particular problem.I am simply saying that is a measure of Government because of a concern about clarity and the future of everyone who is a low-paid worker. That is an important issue that is being attended to now by Government. In respect of this issue, I support the Dunnes Stores workers in having a right to clarity in so far as their working lives and working weeks are concerned. I would hope that this strike does not have to go ahead. As the secretary of Mandate trade union explained to me, this happened or was about to happen in other stores and a decision or conclusion was reached that was satisfactory for the workers in terms of giving them clarity about their week's work and their working lives. I hope the strike does not go ahead. I support the workers in their right to have clarity about their working lives. Therefore, the message to the employers is that this can be sorted out. These workers are loyal workers. They provide services every day of the week on a 24-hour basis. That should be recognised.

Bills will also be issued to households which have undrinkable water. The Taoiseach should compare his attitude to this issue and his attitude to the banks. What action has the Government taken against the banks which have refused to pass on the benefits of the lower interest rates set by the European Central Bank? The Taoiseach has given them a veto. Does the Taoiseach believe it is fair, just or equitable for the Government to take water charges from the wages, social welfare payments or pensions of a family, while at the same time he allows the banks to withhold the benefits of lower interest rates to these same families?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	118	I reject Deputy Adams's assertion that this Government is not interested in people who work on lower wages. I point out to Deputy Adams that the live register figures for today, 1 April, show that the standardised unemployment rate has now decreased to 10%. Deputy Adams will recall that when he was first elected to the House, he was one of those who spouted constantly about the numbers of unemployed going above 500,000. It is still too high and we have a job to do ahead of us, which we intend to do to manage this competently in the interests of the people. That is why the first thing the Government did with the troika - it arrived in this country not by my invitation, but it was here - was to reverse the decision made by the previous Government in terms of the minimum wage. That is why we have taken 420,000 people out of the requirement to pay the universal social charge. That is why it is the intention of Government to bring that to 500,000 when the Minister for Finance presents his budget in October. That is why, having listened carefully to the people, the level of charge for water is â¬1.15 per week for a single person and â¬3 per week for two or more adults.

It is for the benefit of customers.

The Fianna FÃ¡il Members have nothing but a catastrophic tradition in so far as banks are concerned. They need not open their mouths about it any more. As for those in Sinn FÃ©in, who know a lot about banks as well, we did not fix them for the benefit of the banks but for the benefit of the customers, and we will be meeting the banks shortly. Will also be bringing a number of other options this month in so far as mortgage distress is concerned.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	135	Seeing as this is April fools' day, perhaps the Taoiseach saying he did not fix the banks for the benefit of the banks but for the benefit of their customers was his attempt to get into the spirit of this day. I asked the Taoiseach to contrast his attitude to struggling householders with his attitude to the banks. The Taoiseach did not do that. The banks have refused to pass on to mortgage holders the benefits of lower interest rates set by the European Central Bank. That is happening; I am not making it up. The Economic Management Council has not met the banks in three years. The Government has given the banks a veto. We tried to table an amendment to that but the Government guillotined the legislation when it was coming through the Chamber. Let us consider the fact that the Taoiseach behaves as if he were a commentator or a spectator.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	136	A question, please.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	137	The people own the banks. The Taoiseach has not reformed the banks for the benefit of their customers. The Taoiseach spoofs all the time about the great sacrifices being borne by the citizens. It is the Taoiseach who has imposed these sacrifices on them. Today - I am making the point again - on the one hand the Government sends bills out to take water charges out of people's pockets while at the same time the banks are refusing to pass on benefits to them. Again, I call on the Taoiseach to contrast or compare his attitude to the elites with his attitude to struggling households. Is the Taoiseach's approach fair?

The bank has not gone far enough. I want to see the engagement that the Department of Finance has every week with the Central Bank continue. The Government, as I said in the House yesterday, will meet the banks about an agenda of issues, including the bringing forward of a number of other actions in regard to mortgage distress. The priority for Government is that people do not have to lose their houses. Fully 100,000 have been settled satisfactorily and are paying their way. There are others in particular circumstances that need to be dealt with.

#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	159	Last week, we had a presentation in Leinster House by members of the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland. They were introduced to the Members of the Oireachtas by Deputy CaoimhghÃ­n Ã CaolÃ¡in, who has first-hand knowledge of this ailment due to a family connection. The speakers for this sector included a person who has been afflicted with Alzheimer's disease and is going through the ordeal while trying to live as fully as possible, and a carer who is looking after his mother on a full-time basis. A contribution was also made by a GP with expert knowledge of the medical condition. The Alzheimer's group is promoting the national dementia strategy, which was launched by the Government in December. This is aimed at meeting the needs of the approximately 48,000 people who are currently living with dementia. A rapidly growing number are afflicted by this debilitating disease and this will continue into the future. The national strategy is a first step, but real progress will require strategic financial investment, naturally, and a new social and community approach to dementia. The priority actions in the strategy have the potential, if implemented, to significantly improve the rates of diagnosis of the early stages, to improve people's journey through life and also to improve the health and social care system for these people. Will the Taoiseach prioritise the national dementia strategy, as diagnosis and referral to the appropriate services need to be vastly improved? Will he provide adequate home care packages for the many thousands of people who urgently require these to enable them to live in their communities? Will he support a campaign to remove the stigma associated with the whole issue of dementia?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	160	This is a most distressing condition that people find themselves in. Everybody in the House knows families or people whose loved ones or family members are so afflicted, and I know many myself. We waited ten years for a strategy on dementia to be produced. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, brought that forward after extensive consultation and published it before Christmas, and she also put together both an oversight committee and an implementation group to see that it happens. One of the action groups, Genio, has a number of projects in locations around the country, one of them here in Dublin. Atlantic Philanthropies was so taken by the quality of the strategy produced by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, that it has contributed very substantially to this. Between it and the State, I believe over â¬27 million is being allocated for services and support for people who suffer from dementia in all its forms. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter of concern to families. The vocabulary changes automatically once a diagnosis is made but, in so far as the Government is concerned, we recognise this is an issue and the Minister of State has produced the strategy after the country had waited ten years for it. There is substantial support for those who are affected by the condition, the members of their families and those who provide the various supports. I can give the Deputy further details of the work that is going on at the various locations around the country, if he wishes.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	161	I commend Atlantic Philanthropies, which is co-operating with the Government by providing some â¬15 million alongside the Government commitment for a further â¬15 million. However, this requires substantial further funding additional to that â¬15 million. The national dementia strategy commits to an integrated, multidisciplinary approach and to a response by community services, primary care and secondary care in order to support people with dementia and their carers. It needs huge commitment into the future from the Department of Health and the HSE. The facts are that 63% of the approximately 50,000 people with dementia currently live in the community, the most common form of this condition is Alzheimer's disease, and the vast majority of those with dementia are primarily cared for by a family member. They need supports to be provided at regular stages from the advisory bodies linked to the HSE and from occupational therapists in order to ensure these patients are kept at home and in the community as much as possible.

It is the first point of medical contact for people, particularly given the need for occupational therapists and all of the other supports. Early diagnosis is crucial.

#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	165	We must ensure we have high-quality diagnostic services in our hospitals as well as from GP services. Training courses for families and carers are vital. In the forthcoming budget in October, will the Taoiseach ensure that the required amount of funding is made available to build good foundations for the strategy so that it will be progressed into the future?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	166	As I said, the Minister of State launched the national dementia strategy in December, after we had waited ten years. I pay tribute to the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland for its contribution and for the part it played in the development of that strategy over a period. There are 50,000 people afflicted by dementia. As I said, a very substantial amount, about â¬27 million, is being allocated at the moment. Central features of that strategy are exactly what Deputy Fleming is talking about, and that is what is being implemented. There is an assignment of clear responsibility at management level within the HSE in respect of dementia, there is much clearer information available to people about the services that are available and there is far greater understanding about the causes of dementia and how best people can be facilitated. It is very important that, in so far as is possible, people can be maintained in their own locations and in the community. What the Deputy has outlined has been central to the development of the strategy that is published, on which the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, has taken a very strong lead role. We are now focused on implementing that strategy. Obviously, in respect of the budget for 2016, as the figures come in for the improving economy, this is a matter of social importance and personal importance. Deputy Fleming can rest assured that the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and the committee dealing with this will be centrally involved in those discussions. It is not for me to predict the outcome of those discussions but, clearly, it is a matter of importance, as are many other matters, for the Government in the time ahead.

Is the proposal for dealing with the late sitting agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 11, motion re proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing certain acts in the field of police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, to be taken without debate, agreed to? Agreed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	169	Can the Taoiseach indicate when the Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No.2 ) Bill will be introduced? It is a Bill to provide any legislative changes required to deal with the bargaining rights of trade unions, and it is included in the programme for Government. If it was in place, it would assist the Dunnes Stores workers who will be on strike tomorrow. Can the Taoiseach confirm when the Bill will be progressed through the House? Can the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government is reviewing its position on guidance counsellors and its decision two years ago to take them out of our second level schools? It was a scandalous decision. Will he commit to restoring them? Can he indicate where stands the junior certificate reform proposals?  There is an issue I want the House to address and ask the Taoiseach whether the Government would be prepared to give some time to, namely, comments made by Deputy Adams some weeks ago on the murders of Garda Aidan Donohoe, Paul Quinn and others. In the course of his contribution he identified a small gang in a particular location which he said was responsible for all of those murders. I would regard that as a fairly significant revelation in itself. I looked at the blacks and that is what Deputy Adams said on the record, which contrasted with what was said publicly earlier by him and others who said they did not know the identity-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	170	We cannot get into this on the Order of Business.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	171	These are crucial issues and we need a fuller debate in the House on them, or at least some explanation of the content and substance of those remarks.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	172	The Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill is due this session. On the question of guidance counsellors and the reform of the junior certificate, the Minister for Education and Skills has given her views in respect of the junior certificate. I will raise the question of guidance counsellors with her, but the decision was very clear, namely, to allow them to have greater freedom at school level. In respect of the third matter the Deputy mentioned, it is a matter of concern to me. I hope that we could give consideration to a debate in the House, on the resumption of the DÃ¡il, on these matters in general. A number need to be reflected and commented upon in the House.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	173	I refer to the mental capacity Bill and the commitment made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government last month to introduce legislation to freeze rents. Monday was the eighth anniversary of the State's signing the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In the programme for Government there was a commitment to introduce a mental capacity Bill that would incorporate the convention into domestic law. Some four years later that has not happened. There is a whole range of other legislative matters which have been promised but have not come to the floor of the DÃ¡il. In the meantime, 156 states have ratified the convention. This State is one of only three in the European Union which has failed to do so and we still rely on the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871. There are ongoing difficulties faced by citizens with intellectual disabilities in some care homes. When will the Taoiseach repeal the disgraceful Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 and introduce a mental capacity Bill? As I said, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government last month promised to introduce legislation to freeze rents in the private rental sector for the next two years and to tackle excessive rent increases by landlords by the end of this year. When can we expect this legislation to be published? It is a matter of major concern. The Taoiseach will know that 500,000 households in rented accommodation are now approaching the levels of rent they paid at the height of the property boom. Rental costs in Dublin have risen by almost 10%. The Minister also expressed concerns about the impact of the programme of reform of local government by the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, and said he supported the comprehensive review of the changes Mr. Hogan had forced through. Does the Government intend to hold a comprehensive review of local government? When does it intend to do so?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	174	In respect of the mental capacity Bill, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill was published on 17 July 2013 and provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and to exercise their basic rights in line with the principle of the UN convention. It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity and is awaiting Committee Stage in the House. A number of amendments are being worked on. The Government has given a firm commitment to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Government intends to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible. It is important to clarify the process and issues involved. We have a dualist legal system. Therefore, we cannot become party to treaties unless we are first in a position to ratify the obligations that are imposed upon us, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary. I am advised that a substantial number of items need to be dealt with before we can deal with that. The Minister has set up a team in the Department of Justice and Equality to examine all of these outstanding matters. It has almost completed the first phase of its work, which includes identifying those areas which will need attention prior to ratification being possible. An interdepartmental committee is in place and it met recently to review those issues and the actions and timeframes set out to meet them. I can advise Deputy Adams that the Government is serious, but because of the dualist system we have we have to deal with a number of issues here before we can ratify the convention.  It is awaiting-----
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	175	The Government has had four years to do that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	176	No, the Bill was only published in July 2013. Committee Stage is awaited in the House. Another key task which is under way involves examining how the issue of reasonable accommodation can be achieved in a meaningful way within our constitutional framework, as interpreted by the Supreme Court.The House may be aware that the Supreme Court in an Article 26 referral dating from 1998 found it unconstitutional to impose an obligation to provide reasonable accommodation to people with disabilities where the cost would be more than a nominal cost. The United Nations requires a higher standard that it calls "a disproportionate" cost. Our law with respect to sexual offences imposes a ban on persons with intellectual disabilities having intimate relationships. That needs to be changed while still protecting vulnerable people from exploitation. The Department of Justice and Equality is working on proposals to be included in a revised sexual offences criminal law proposal and to deal with this issue. It has published a discussion paper to allow interested parties to contribute their views on what is a sensitive and very complex matter.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	177	What about the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	178	A review of the Mental Health Act has recently been completed by an expert group. I would have to give the Deputy further advice on that.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	179	As the Taoiseach may know, we have a disproportionately high level of cystic fibrosis in this country and everyone in this House or the wider society would know a family affected by cystic fibrosis. In the first half of 2012, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, promised a health information Bill that would allow and regulate research into this and other diseases. He also promised a human tissue Bill that would govern organ donation, and that is clearly crucial to the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Again, we have not yet seen that Bill. When will those Bills be progressed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	180	I am sorry but I do not have a date for either of those Bills. I can advise the Deputy on the work that has been completed. I am pleased to say that in recent years, with all the difficulties, there has been a deal of progress made with isolation units for people suffering from cystic fibrosis, which is to be welcomed.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	181	Much of that has been provided by charities.

I will give further advice in respect of the two Bills mentioned by the Deputy.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	183	SI 58 of 2015 relates to the new tuberculosis regulations introduced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It facilitates departmental officials in having a stricter interpretation of existing law on the testing of cattle for bovine tuberculosis and it is causing much hardship for farmers. Is the Taoiseach aware that a notice has been issued to farmers in my area and throughout the country instructing them that they should not treat animals with a veterinary medicine until they have carried out their animal herd test? This is contrary to the animal welfare laws of this country and a farmer complying with that directive from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine could be prosecuted and jailed for breaking the animal welfare laws. Will the Taoiseach allow time to be made available in the House to discuss this statutory instrument, which comes into force today, have it reviewed and have a consultation both in the House and with farming organisations? This would ensure it can be implemented in a fair and reasonable manner which does not contravene other law in the country.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	184	We cannot have a debate on the matter.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	185	I would be surprised if the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was contravening animal welfare law. I have not seen the letter to which Deputy Naughten refers. I will have the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine respond to this.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	186	I will send a copy to the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	187	It is not necessary to have the matter discussed formally in the House. There could be either a Topical Issue debate or a response from the Minister, as I will bring it to his attention today, to deal with this. Tuberculosis is a serious illness and bovine tuberculosis has cost the country millions of euro over the years. The conditions dealing with it should not be flouted.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	188	I call Deputy Mattie McGrath to speak to promised legislation.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	192	That is grand but you can talk to him privately about that rather than on the Order of Business.

The Taoiseach has promised on countless occasions to meet them. The legislation in question is the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill. When will the Taoiseach meet the families of the Omagh bomb victims? They had open access to him before he became Taoiseach but in the four years since, he has not met them. It is disgraceful.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	194	That is not for the Order of Business. Table a parliamentary question.

Many young people are coming home and I know the Ministers and the Taoiseach, when abroad on St. Patrick's Day, encouraged them to come home. If young people are gone for more than three years, insurance companies will not honour a no-claims bonus or clean driving record in a foreign country.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	201	That is a matter for a parliamentary question.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	203	This is not appropriate to the Order of Business.

#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	221	With respect to the law governing both the sale and consumption of alcohol, when can we expect the sale of alcohol Bill to be brought before the House?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	222	That will be later this year. There are a few matters we are to attend to in Northern Ireland at the same time, including minimum pricing and so on. I will advise the Deputy later.
#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	223	I have asked before about the technological universities Bill. The provision of a technological university for the south east is crucial to the area because of the unemployment rate there over recent years. The Taoiseach is aware that negotiations broke down prior to Christmas and an independent facilitator, Mr. Michael Kelly, was put in place. When is he expected to report back to the Government on his deliberations involving the Waterford and Carlow institutes? Is the Taoiseach expecting a positive outcome?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	224	The Bill is due this session so I expect the report will go to the Minister for Education and Skills shortly. I understand that despite the initial hiccups, there has been some progress. I hope the matter can be concluded. It was an important priority for the Government, following the demise of a plant in Waterford some years ago, that there would be a technological university in the south east. The standards are very high and the criteria are difficult to meet, but it is a very important issue for the next generation of young people.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	225	Commissioner Phil Hogan has spoken about diesel laundering in the Border areas and the contamination of water supplies, with consequential suffering for businesses, specifically farming businesses. We need a full debate on this serious issue in this House. When is publication expected of the criminal justice (freezing and confiscation) Bill, which is to transpose Directive 2014/42/EU of the European Parliament and Council of 3 April 2014 on the freezing of proceeds of crime in the European Union? I am sure Deputy Adams would love a debate on diesel laundering in the Border areas.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	226	I do not have a date for that. Perhaps Deputy Butler could raise the issue during the course of a discussion on Northern Ireland matters.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	227	Various elements of our heritage come together to give each local area its identity and sense of place. There are many artifacts which belong to rural counties that are stored in basements of various public buildings, particularly here in Dublin.Yesterday, Deputy Adams raised the national monuments Bill. Another Bill that is dear to my heart is the heritage (amendment) Bill and I would like to inquire when it will come before us.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	228	The heritage (amendment) Bill is due later this year.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	229	I have three questions. One is on the awaited tenant purchase scheme. During the past 18 months, no local authority tenant has been eligible to buy his or her council house, despite repeated promises that the legislation will be published within months. Can the Taoiseach give a definitive timeframe in which we will know when the new scheme will be announced?

One might expect that, as part of a recovering economy, there might be greater emphasis on apprenticeships. Much of the very skilled construction workforce we had have left Ireland and, no doubt, the Taoiseach will have had contact with many of them during his St. Patrick's Day travels. What sort of impetus is there regarding apprenticeships?

The Minister with responsibility for this, Deputy English, is shortly to bring proposals about a new apprenticeship council, which is in situ, and new modules for upskilling, training and apprenticeships, to the Government for approval. It was to happen last week, but did not, and I expect it in the next few weeks.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	244	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Water Services Act 2013 to make provision for requiring individual consent to all information provided to the subsidiary.I welcome the opportunity to introduce this Private Members' Bill. The purpose of the legislation is to amend section 26 of the Water Services Act 2013. People will be aware of controversy in recent days when local authorities informed their tenants and the public that they had submitted their tenants' details directly to Irish Water. Their action was provided for in section 26 of the Water Services Act 2013, and my argument is not with the local authorities, who were complying with their legal responsibilities under the Act. I have no quibble with the Data Protection Commissioner, who does not have much of a role in this issue. While the Data Protection Commissioner must be consulted, the commissioner must accept what is in the legislation. However, the legislation is unfair and bad and the only way to deal with it is to amend it. That is why I have brought forward the Bill to amend the Water Services Act 2013. The Bill is couched in technical terms and refers to a "subsidiary", which means Irish Water, which is a subsidiary of Bord GÃ¡is in the legislation. We are asking that, in future, transfers of information about tenants to Irish Water under section 26 happen only with the written consent of the person involved and any information given to date without such consent be destroyed, subject to the verification of the Data Protection Commissioner. We had such a situation last year when Irish Water sought PPS numbers. Fortunately, light prevailed and people felt it was not right to give PPS numbers to what was allegedly an independent, commercial semi-State organisation. Subsequently, a programme was put in place to delete the information Irish Water had received on individuals, subject to oversight by the Data Protection Commissioner. This process has not been completed, but should be, and the same should happen with the information local authorities have already handed over. Given that there is no reason to believe, or evidence to suggest, that the level of registration by local authority tenants is any higher or lower than the rest of the community, it was unfair to single out this group. Irish Water has confirmed that it had most of the information regarding people whose details it received from local authorities. As the Taoiseach keeps saying, 1.2 million people have registered with Irish Water. I registered for the conservation grant. Does this mean I consent to pay my bill? Nobody should confuse the two issues. Given that most of those people had registered for the conservation grant and submitted their details, there was no reason for the local authorities to hand over the details to Irish Water. Section 26 of the Water Services Act 2013 also gives Irish Water authority to seek information from the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Social Protection and any other person the Minister prescribes as a designated person. We all know this will include the voluntary and social housing agencies, and it could include many more. There is power in the legislation to allow Irish Water to obtain information from the Department of Social Protection such as people's payments, the number of children in the house, their dates of birth and PPS numbers. Irish Water will be able to obtain information from the Revenue Commissioners such as whether a person is tax compliant, and maybe a person will have to have a tax clearance certificate before receiving his or her water conservation grant. Although we have not heard it yet, I know how the system operates and the Government will put in this little twist. Revenue will probably have to approve the issue of the conservation grants. Irish Water should not receive preferential treatment as a semi-State company. Bus Ãireann, the ESB and CIE would not be entitled to this information. They are bona fide commercial semi-State bodies and if Irish Water is one of them, it should not receive this information. The fact we have provided for this proves that Irish Water is not a commercial, stand-alone semi-State organisation that can stand on its own without all the legal infrastructure that would not be available to back up a normal semi-State company. It is further proof of the unsustainability and fiasco that is Irish Water. I ask that the Bill be given a reading today in order that it can proceed through the Oireachtas in due course.

#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	251	I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue and I thank the Minister of State for being present. The VEC halls on Clogher Road in Crumlin and in Inchicore are among the education and sports facilities that were introduced when some of us were members of Dublin City Council, DCC. A condition of their introduction was that they had to open their doors in the evening for community use, particularly for football and dancing clubs, martial arts, arts and crafts and active retirement groups. This meant that people in the community who could not avail of the facilities during the daytime found that these centres could be part and parcel of what they did in the evening, and they have become a great asset to community groups. People can stay local and get involved in activities locally without having to journey elsewhere to participate. Over the past few weeks, Pobal has withdrawn funding from these centres, which means they will only be able to open between 9.30 a.m. and 4 p.m. to facilitate the students in the colleges in Inchicore and Crumlin. While that is welcome, a commitment was given when these sports halls were opened that people in the community would have access to them in the evenings, and this change is hugely disappointing. I requested confirmation of the commitment to community access from the Minister of State in writing and I received a letter from him yesterday. I understand that the Department felt the proposal made by the groups running the centres was not adequate and did not contain sufficient detail. All is not lost; there is a window of opportunity. The Minister of State stated in his letter:I want to assure you that the Department is committed to securing the community use of these facilities and will continue to work with the CDETB to enable this outcome. The contract with the CDETB was extended to the end of June [I welcome that], which will enable work to continue with the ETB to address matters concerning the Department, with the aim of allowing longer terms of operation of the contract and to ensure viability for the services to continue in the community.I welcome the final line in the letter, which is important. I stress that if these centres are prevented from opening in the evenings for community use, it will be a huge loss. It will be a reversal of the commitment made when they were built.
#EricJByrne	unknown-#EricJByrne-party	unknown-#EricJByrne-dob	unknown-#EricJByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	252	I thank the Minister of State for attending. I appreciate that as soon as I called him on receipt of the letter from the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, he acted promptly. It is the least I can expect from a Labour Party Minister. I do not know what exactly are the issues between Pobal, DCC and CDETB, but I have a copy of a reassuring letter which was sent to both sports centres. Will the Minister of State give a guarantee, notwithstanding the fact that there are three months for negotiations among the three bodies, that the community services available on Clogher Road and in Inchicore will be retained with the same opening times and availability for the community as heretofore? The first I heard about this was when I attended a drugs task force meeting in St. Andrews Hall last week and somebody said Pobal had pulled the funding for the centres. I replied that Pobal is only an agent for European funding or governmental funding. Where does the funding come from? Is this money from the European Social Fund, which finds its way into the system where Pobal intervenes? What is the difficulty being experienced? Public meetings have been demanded. I have received text messages from roller skaters who are worried that they will be unable to roller skate any more, while other community groups are being called to meetings by councillors from DCC. I would like the Minister of State to verbally back up the commitment I have received in writing that this is not a funding cutback and that the funds are available, but there is a complication between the three bodies. He might put our collective minds at rest in order that we can tell people not to bother going to public meetings to shout and roar, because they will be shouting and roaring about the wrong issue.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	253	I too heard about this issue late last Thursday evening. Many people panicked, as could be expected, and I tabled the Topical Issue matter early yesterday evening. I thank the Minister of State for the letter he sent and for responding quickly. When I asked a subsequent question, he responded to me quickly again. I rang the CDETB earlier when I realised this matter would be taken in the House to clarify its position. Mr. David Treacy said that everything was okay, and he is confident. He said that their application might have been too soft, whereas Pobal was expecting a more comprehensive response regarding where the community resources go. However, he is confident that the money is available and everything will be okay, and I hope the Minister of State will confirm this. This is a complicated way of funding these facilities. It is provided by Pobal but the application has to go to CDETB and then to DCC before being returned to Pobal. My understanding is that there is potential to have the grant paid directly to DCC rather than going through this complicated process. While the buildings belong to the CDETB, the staff are employed by DCC. I hope we will get good news.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	254	If the Deputies will forgive me, I will depart from the script that has been circulated. This matter involves substantial funding. A sum of â¬600,000 will be paid over three years. In many ways, Pobal is a gatekeeper, and we have to make sure this money is spent correctly. The provision of such funding over a three-year contract is a fantastic asset to local communities. This is the first time this contract has come up for renewal, while approximately 140 contracts come up for renewal on a regular basis. Pobal, therefore, acts as the gatekeeper to make sure the criteria attaching to the funding are met. There will be no reduction in funding. The money is available and we want to spend it, but we want to make sure that happens in the best interest of the communities and, therefore, the criteria must be met. For example, there must be transparency in how the money is spent and in respect of community access to the facilities, which are jointly managed by DCC and the ETB. The four of us were members of Dublin City Council and I worked with Deputies Eric Byrne and Catherine Byrne on the provision of both these centres, because I was chairman of the VEC when these developments were proposed. They are fantastic facilities. I am concerned by Deputy Eric Byrne's comment that councillors are calling for public meetings on issues for which they are responsible. While the contract is with the ETB, DCC is also involved.Councillors have representation on the education and training boards. When I was a councillor, I took full responsibility for the electoral mandate I had and dealt with the problems raised regarding this issue. I am quite satisfied that we can resolve it, but there must be engagement, and there must be a contract. All four of us will agree that we must ensure that the money involved, which is over â¬600,000, is spent in the interests of the two communities. I am happy to work with the Deputies if there are further issues of concern, but we must ensure when we are spending taxpayers' money that it is spent in the right areas, with the right intentions for the outcome of those communities. I will work with members of all parties and none to ensure that happens. I thank the Deputies for raising the matter. There are issues that need to be raised with the local public representatives regarding their own governance of it. The Deputies will have dealt with those issues at council level before, but the contract is with the CDETB and with Dublin City Council, which operates it. I want to see those two centres and those two communities thrive, and I will do everything I can to assist.

He might, if he has access to the information, write an outline of his response to the sporting, cultural and adult groups that are using the services to reassure them, despite the scare tactics that have been used on the ground, that there is no need for them to attend public meetings. These are three-year contracts. I was surprised that so many bodies were involved in the funding stream. I used to think the VEC had it in the morning, during class hours, and then Dublin City Council took over afterwards. The funding stream seems to be more complicated now, with three or four agencies involved. My first question is whether the Minister thinks we could streamline that funding. The more fingers in the pie, the more complicated it gets. Second, could we not make it a permanent relationship, so that the building is permanently available to the community?

If all sides sit down, that will be easily sorted. I also want to raise the question of funding. Is there a possibility that the funding could be better streamlined, that is, that the grant could go directly to Dublin City Council? The CDETB owns the buildings of Inchicore sports centre and Clogher Road. About ten years ago, they agreed to a procedure whereby Pobal would pay the CDETB as a middle man and then the money would go to the DCC staff and so on. Would it not be better to sit down and use this opportunity to see how the process can be streamlined so that we know exactly where the money is going and if there is a more direct way of dealing with it?
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	264	I thank the Minister of State for his clear response. I also thank him because I know he understands what this community needs and what these halls mean to the community. I must also stress that the reaction has been felt strongly on the ground locally. In some ways it has also been fuelled by many negative things, which were not related to this. There are concerns and it is important to let us know as soon as these are resolved, because there can be a negative reaction when people hear for the first time that money is being withdrawn. As the Minister of State said, this has nothing to do with money. This has to do with an application, which was declined for some reason, whether it was put together wrong or did not give the proper information. I agree with him that we have to be very careful giving out substantial amounts of money regarding who it goes to, how it is used and, above all, how the community benefits from it.

#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	266	Deputy Catherine Byrne is correct. It is â¬650,000. I am a little cautious about streamlining. It is the flexibility of the community service programme that makes it work well. There is flexibility in the services where numbers of groups come together but there is one overall manager. In this case, the CDETB has taken on the administration of it. The way this is managed varies across the country. Sometimes when one streamlines something, one loses the benefit. There is often one community group that manages it for five or six other groups, like the hub of a wheel. There is a flexibility within the service. The Department and the taxpayer pay for this; Pobal does not give the money. As I explained earlier, Pobal is the gatekeeper. It ensures that the criteria are met, and that the taxpayers' money is safeguarded and spent in the right manner. There must be engagement from the CDETB. The letter that went out, which I saw myself, scared people on the ground. This is very much a process. There has been an extension to June, but the contract must be fulfilled. The contract is quite specific and it is safeguarding that service for local communities. The Department of Social Protection is paying out â¬650,000 on behalf of the citizen and the taxpayer over three years. We want to make sure that money is spent in the best interests of those communities. I will contact the CDETB and urge it to get the application in on time and to move things on. We are not trying to save any money here. We are quite happy that a good service can be supplied to the residents the Deputies represent and I will work with all the Deputies to try to ensure that service is maintained. However, the required level of openness and transparency must be met when these large sums of public money are being spent. I thank the Deputies for raising the issue and look forward to working with them on it.

He knows, given where he comes from, that post offices are the vital lifeblood of rural Ireland. Deputy Healy-Rae tabled his topical debate at the same time as me and he is also very anxious about it. I have two documents in my hand. One is the policy of the Department of Social Protection regarding post offices. It wants the majority of its transactions, bar 3%, done by electronic payment by 2015. The Taoiseach told Deputy Fleming and myself recently that this is not happening at all. He said so many post offices were closed under Fianna FÃ¡il, while only 20 closed on his watch. That is not the real issue. The real issue is that the Department wants to have most of its business done by electronic means by 2015. That is only a few people out in the sticks who do not have broadband or anything else. There is a cat-and-mouse game going on here. I want the Minister of State to be honest and tell us what he is going to do about it. We have nothing without post offices in rural Ireland. They are the last bastion. We have already lost the Garda stations and schools, and the post offices are vital. The post offices could do business through e-transactions if someone funded them. They have submitted proposals to the Department to be funded to do e-transactions. They could replace banks and other services that have been taken away from rural Ireland. It could do a great deal for tourism and the development of the rural economy. The former Minister, Mary Hanafin, in fairness to her, in the last Fianna FÃ¡il Government ring-fenced social welfare payments. If this had not happened, the post offices would have been closed long ago. There would have been mass closures. The Taoiseach can play games all he likes but he is not telling the truth. He is telling the truth when he says that only 20 have closed, but if this policy is accepted, the game is over for post offices in rural Ireland. We want to get the ball on the pitch here. We want to play the ball fairly, openly and, above all, honestly, and deal with the situation because post offices are going to disappear before our eyes. That is not good enough and the Minister of State knows it from rural Ireland as well as I do.

This time last year, before the local elections, the then Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, made an announcement that there was a whole-of-government approach to the future of post offices. In February this year, some nine or ten months later, it was announced there would be a review. What was said previously was only to get the Government over the local and European elections. Whatever the election cycle, a letter has been issued from the Department of Social Protection to pensioners advising them or encouraging those who have been receiving payments for a long number of years to have their money paid by direct debit into the bank rather than through the post office. This is in direct contradiction of what the Taoiseach stated in the DÃ¡il, what the Government has said and what the Minister has said to me on numerous occasions in the House. How come a Department sanctioned this letter, which is in total contradiction of what has been said by Ministers and the Taoiseach in the House? If the Department continues to pursue this policy, it will mean all the post offices in the country will close. The Department should examine how An Post needs to change to ensure the transaction can take place in post offices in the same way as it can in banks. It should be borne in mind that if the Minister for Social Protection continues to send letters to social welfare recipients encouraging them to use banks, it will be the end of the post office network.

It is important to point out a working group has been established under the stewardship of Bobby Kerr. When I received a copy of the letter the first thing I did was go to the working group because it includes representatives from the Irish Postmasters Union and various stakeholders with an interest in pulling together a plan for the long-term sustainability and viability of post offices. Progress has been made and good work has been done by the group. There is good, open and honest conversation. I cannot say what the outcomes will be at this early stage because a report will issue shortly on the actions of the group. The Government has made a decision to work proactively across Departments to examine how all Departments can work together, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Social Protection, to lend their weight to the sustainability and viability of post offices. I sit on the working group and I take this very seriously. It is important to point out that while the script states this was a trial, as far as I am concerned every Department must be on the same wavelength as the interdepartmental decision to ensure the long-term sustainability and viability of post offices. As I stated several weeks ago, and Deputy Moynihan was in the Chamber when I did so, Friday at the post office on Tory Island is the only day when people meet, and the post office in any rural area provides an opportunity for people to meet. The Government is working towards this. The Deputies have raised important issues. I have taken this matter seriously. It has been raised at the working group and is being taken seriously at that level. The message today must feed into the Government decision that each Department is on the same wavelength in terms of the long-term sustainability of post offices. Perhaps banking in post offices is an option. We can be critical of what happened with these letters, but they did not suggest that people change from post offices. It was not mandatory or prescriptive, but it is information in black and white and I accept this. It is important the issue has been raised at this juncture with regard to the working group. It is also important to point out each Department must be on the same wavelength with regard to where we are going. The Government is taking this seriously and it is important we continue in this vein.

If it was not the intention of the letter, why was it sent? Why were people told to reply via freepost? When something is sent via freepost, the postmistress or postmaster gets nothing for it. This is a concerted attack on post offices. I welcome the fact a report is being worked on but the Department of Social Protection must be reined in and restrained. Its policy statement of 2013 stated it wanted all but 3% of transactions to be electronic by 2015. This is the death knell for post offices and the social aspect in rural Ireland about which the Minister of State spoke and about which we all know. There is deception going on here. I do not say the Minister of State is involved, rather departmental officials and whoever. Yesterday the Taoiseach announced in a blaze of glory that he will send all his Ministers and Deputies to visit small businesses in rural Ireland to see what the Government can do and that they will not be discriminated against in the new constitution. We are discriminating against self-employed postmistresses and postmasters who do Trojan work and give employment, pay rates and taxes and look after people. Unless this codology is dealt with, we will have no post offices. If this is implemented in one single swoop, they will be gone. The letter should not have been sent out. Apologies should be sent out. The biggest insult is that replies are to be sent via freepost to ensure the postmistress or postmaster does not get a cent from it. It is undermining and closure by stealth. Brostaigh ort leis an situation sin.

I hope the script given to him by the Department will not go into the record of the House because one line in it is deeply offensive. It states the letters were issued as part of a small trial to determine the best means of communication with people about their payment options. This is not correct. The letter was basically telling people to go to the banks because the Department wants to get rid of the post offices. Have the letters stopped? Will the working group make a decision to stop the letters? Will no further attempt be made by the Department of Social Protection or any other Department to undermine the post offices in the way this letter sought to do?

The Health Act 1970 acknowledges the moral imperative of the health services to make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people suffering from prescribed diseases and disabilities of a long-term nature, in effect establishing the HSE administered long-term illness scheme.There is no doubt that this scheme is of monumental benefit to the thousands of people who depend on it to cover the costs, which would otherwise be onerous, associated with treating their individual medical conditions. However, one aspect of the terminology used in the existing legislation that specifies the qualifying conditions for accession to the long-term illness scheme is contentious, perturbing and for many people stigmatic. The legislation in question is the Health Services (Amendment) Regulations 1971, which prescribe diseases and conditions for the purposes of section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970. The regulations list serious and often life-limiting conditions, including phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus; haemophilia and cerebral palsy. One condition stipulated in the regulations, but which I have yet to mention, stands out for many people. Under the regulations, "mental handicap" is the tag used to encapsulate conditions such as Down's syndrome and global developmental delay. This archaic, offensive and hurtful label has caused untold emotional suffering to those affected by these conditions and their families for many years. It is a tag that has no place in the world in which we now live. I raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, earlier this month. I asked her in a parliamentary question whether her attention had been drawn to the offensive nature of this terminology and whether had she any plans to review and amend the secondary legislation by which this term is shamefully legitimised. Even though I comprehensively illustrated the derogatory and insidious nature of the label, together with the negative connotations with which it has become associated, she unfortunately responded by telling me she had no plans to amend the terminology used to denote the conditions covered by the long-term illness scheme. As I was not satisfied with the response I received, I chose to highlight this issue again by asking a question that was referred to the HSE for direct response. In its reply, the HSE professed that with regards to the long-term illness scheme, it no longer employs the term "mental handicap", which dates back to the 1970s. It said that it opts to use what it described as "the correct term" of "intellectual disability" instead. The HSE also gave me a commitment that it would review the wording of the long-term illness scheme on its website to reflect this development. I think we were all delighted to hear of the HSE's decision to drop a label which can only be described as a sordid and unmissed relic of the past. While the simple and sensible action taken by the HSE might involve no more than the rewording of existing HSE documents, the importance and significance of this move should not be overlooked. It was a momentous victory for disability rights advocates throughout Ireland, for those who rightly refuse to be ill-defined by their disabilities and for those who dedicate their lives to challenging the perceptions and preconceived judgments of others regarding intellectual disability. I call on the Minister to amend the Health Services (Amendment) Regulations 1971 so that this obsolete, draconian and deeply insensitive term can finally be removed from Irish statutes once and for all. This would end the shameful practices of the past, which merely served to stigmatise and marginalise further those who suffer from intellectual disabilities. It would afford them the fairness, dignity and respect they thoroughly deserve. These are our children, friends and loved ones. We should cherish them equally and we should amend the regulation.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	289	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I have continually spoken about the use of inappropriate language and highlighted the need to change our language when the circumstances are correct. I will continue to do so long after my career in politics ends. Therefore, I agree with everything the Deputy has said. The Health Services (Amendment) Regulations 1971 use the term "mental handicap". This old-fashioned term is no longer in general usage. It is not an appropriate term to be used nowadays as it offends many people. The contemporary term used in this country now, including by the Department of Health and the HSE, is "intellectual disability". As the Deputy has rightly said, this term is far more significant than anything that he and I, and maybe others in this House, might find when we look through Acts that were commenced over 30 years ago. Indeed, he will appreciate that these regulations were made over four decades ago - in September 1971 - by the then Minister for Health, Erskine Childers, who later became President of Ireland. While it might seem baffling now, it appears that the use of the term "mental handicap" was considered appropriate at that time. I understand that the representative body, Inclusion Ireland, used to be named the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland. I recall the change of name, which happened relatively recently. I do not believe a person like Erskine Childers would have meant to cause any offence in the making of regulations in 1971, which is a long time ago. Some Deputies in this House were not even born at that stage. With the passage of years, the language used from previous times can appear offensive and inappropriate, even if it was not so in those days. As I have said, "intellectual disability" is the commonly used term in this country now. I agree with the Deputy's view on the term "mental handicap", which is completely old-fashioned and offends many people, especially self-advocates. As the Deputy may be aware, there are other terms used to describe "intellectual disability". However, "intellectual disability" is the most commonly used term internationally and is widely used in medical and teaching circles in Ireland. For example, there is a nursing degree in intellectual disability nursing. There is also a National Institute for Intellectual Disability. The Department of Health used to have separate units for mental handicap and physical disabilities, but they were merged over ten years ago. Now that the Department adopts a non-diagnosis-specific approach to disabilities, its policies apply to people with all disabilities. It uses the definition of "disability" set out in the Disability Act 2005, which is a far more relevant Act than the 1970 Act. The 2005 Act describes disability in terms of its effects on the individual, rather than in terms of particular types of disability. The national disability strategy and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities take the same approach. I agree that the terminology used in the 1971 regulations is old-fashioned and offends many people. I think it would be best for acceptable contemporary terminology to be substituted for old-fashioned language when legislation is being revised. I am about to run out of time. We might be able to deal with this matter further in the supplementary part of this debate. I remind the Deputy that a far more impactful Bill, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013, will come before an Oireachtas committee in May. If I were asked to prioritise legislation, I would say that the Bill in question will have a far more profound effect on our lives as we age. I refer to the lives of those who were born with a disability and those who will acquire a disability during our lifetimes. The Bill in question will change fundamentally how we think and amend all the relevant legislation that has gone before it.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	290	I am well aware of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 and the delays with it. I know families who have been campaigning for it and are frustrated by the delays in bringing it forward. The Minister of State's concluding comments could be interpreted as making a judgment on which rights we will provide for in the first instance. I would say out of respect that I know the Minister of State did not mean that. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 will have major effects. There are family members out there who have told me they were in tears as they filled in the form for long-term illness care because they had to label their child with "mental handicap". Other people told me they decided not to avail of the scheme because they refused to have their child labelled with "mental handicap". This is not the Ireland of 1971; it is the Ireland of today. The Minister of State's remarks suggested that the use of this term was confined to the time of Erskine Childers. If she visits the HSE website today, she will see the list of conditions that have to be fulfilled by people in order to qualify for the long-term illness scheme. Those conditions include "mental handicap". The Minister of State can download the form from the HSE website.I checked it again today and the term "mental handicap" is still on the form. According to the Minister of State, the contemporary term to be used is âintellectual disabilityâ but it is not on this form. I am sure also that she and the rest of us use that term in everyday life. However, it is used in officialdom in this form and on the website. I accept the Health Service Executive has said it will change the form but it still has not happened. One can change the form for the new language but the Act still states mental handicap is a qualifying condition for the long-term illness scheme. Most regulations can be changed at the stroke of a pen and ministerial order. Is it possible these terms can be changed in the Health Services (Amendment) Regulations 1971? This label is deeply offensive and hurtful. We are both on the same page that this should not exist. As the HSE can deal with it, can the Minister of State deal with it in the original legislation?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	291	There has been no delay in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013. I accept there has been a 20 year actual delay in publishing it. The Government, however, has drafted relevant legislation and sent it out for the most widespread consultation there has been. This has involved not just the organisations but individuals and academics internationally. There has been no delay on our part. We are determined to get this legislation right because it will have a greater impact on peopleâs lives. It will not just affect those with intellectual disabilities but people with Alzheimerâs and dementia. It will be about an individualâs will and preference as they go through life. I do not accept the Deputyâs concern about the delay in the legislation. There is no delay in it and Committee Stage will be taken in May. If the change to the regulations could be done at the stroke of a pen, it will be done. The commonly used term is âintellectual disabilityâ. When I speak to parents or children at a passing out from second level education or the move from first to second, I do not use the term at all. We need to start looking at them as people who have a difficulty that we need to support. The type of label such as âintellectual disabilityâ should not necessarily be used and most parents appreciate that too. If the change to the regulations can be done through ministerial order, then it will be done. There is, however, forthcoming legislation such as the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 which will have a greater impact and take more time to bed down. I am determined to get it right as it will have a greater impact than previous legislation in this area. The Disability Act may have to be changed, as the Mental Health Act has already been amended to take account of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013. I accept we are all speaking from the same page. Unless one is standing in the shoes of a person affected by this issue, one cannot empathise to the extent one would wish.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	292	The situation in respect of civil legal aid has now reached an absolute crisis point. People deemed eligible for civil legal aid have a waiting time for a full appointment with a solicitor of between six and 18 months. In my experience of people attending my constituency office, many women experiencing domestic violence are those seeking legal aid. For a person charged under criminal legislation, all he or she has to prove to receive legal aid is that they qualify financially. However, for many women and children suffering physical and emotional abuse, they do not get this Rolls Royce treatment. Both civil and criminal legal aid are provided by the State. This should be with a level of equality and fairness across the board. The High Court determined several years ago that people should not wait longer than three months. Unfortunately, this is now got around by the Legal Aid Board, itself under workload pressure, by offering what is known as a triage appointment. This is a preliminary meeting best described as an introductory meeting. It does not assist the applicant for legal aid in any way. It is merely a lip-service appointment. The delays in terms of getting legal representation will still be the same at between six and 18 months. Some women seeking legal aid are dismissed by being told to just get a barring order. Not everybody is in a position to bring an application for a barring order. The reasons for this differ from social or family pressures, as well as not actually being able to face having their spouse barred and issues around children being aware of what is going on. The only option for people living in the misery of marriage break-up who cannot afford to deal with matters privately is to seek representation from the legal aid board. To put the delays in context, a person may wait for up to 18 months just for a first appointment. If, following on from that, a legal process has to be started, that will take a further year to 18 months. During that time, women are in many cases condemned to live under the one roof while domestic violence is ongoing. It can be very frustrating and even a dangerous time as relationships continue to deteriorate. In many cases, women are seeking legal aid as they are in an abusive and violent relationship. The delays in the District Court in Dolphin House are particularly bad. I welcome, however, the Ministerâs recent announcement about the construction of a new family court. Former Supreme Court Justice, Catherine McGuinness, said:Most District Court judges have a very long list and very little time to listen. Not listening is a symptom of this lack of resources.The delay from application to the hearing of the case is approximately 16 weeks. The courts are listing between 18 and 22 matters per court per day. We cannot continue to have women forced to return to violent or abusive relationships due to the lack of options and supports because of the lack of civil legal aid.

The Legal Aid Board provides legal services for persons of limited means in certain civil matters subject to a financial eligibility and a merits test. I am informed by the board that domestic violence cases are treated as a priority and, as such, processed without delay. A contribution may be payable by the applicant. However, applicants can apply for a waiver if it would cause hardship to pay it. Such applications are invariably granted in domestic violence cases to ensure this would not cause a delay in providing services. Legal services are provided through an extensive network of law centres or via a private practitioner panel.Domestic violence cases are referred to a solicitor on that panel if one is not available within the law centre in order to avoid any delay in providing legal services. I have been assured that the board is not aware of any undue delay in the provision of legal services by the Legal Aid Board for domestic violence cases but if the Deputy has a specific instance in mind, she might let me or the Minister have the details. Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, endeavours to facilitate co-ordination across the justice, health, housing, education, family support and community sectors. The office drives the implementation of the national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Cosc is currently developing a new national strategy which is expected to be published in May or June 2015. Under the strategy, Cosc has run an annual funding programme for awareness raising around the country. Just under â¬300,000 was provided in funding in 2014. It is expected that around â¬280,000 will be provided in 2015. Cosc also funds 13 programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence and â¬484,000 was provided under this in 2014. Work is being undertaken on the preparation of the general scheme of a reformed and consolidated domestic violence Bill. I understand that the Minister for Justice and Equality intends to bring the draft general scheme to Government by the end of April. Finally, the Deputy may also wish to note that work on the general scheme of a criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill is at an advanced stage. The Bill is expected to be published in mid 2015.

I am definitely aware of cases where there is undue delay in the provision of legal services to victims of domestic violence by the Legal Aid Board. I must emphasise the issue of domestic violence. SAFE Ireland published a report on Monday that stated that the legal system in Ireland often regards domestic violence as a nuisance rather than a crime. If a criminal turns up at court, they will immediately have access to a junior or senior counsel if they do not have the ability to pay. I can assure the Minister of State that many women who have presented to me in my constituency office have not received immediate legal aid or junior or senior counsel. In many cases, rape, assault and battery within a relationship are not being treated as criminal offences. Even when the gardaÃ­ call to some homes where domestic violence has taken place, it is dismissed and rubbished and the woman is told to get over it or that it is not that bad. I urge the Minister of State to look at the report and recommendations of SAFE Ireland. I can assure him that I have met mothers who have been beaten and raped. I know one woman who was slashed across her face, and received something like 50 to 60 stitches, in front of her young son. This is not acceptable. It is clear that not only do delays need to be addressed, the system needs to offer real support to women suffering domestic violence. The CEO of SAFE Ireland, Sharon O' Halloran, said that women are being worn down by the system rather than supported by it.

I assure her that domestic abuse and the plight of victims of crime are matters of great importance to the Minister. As the Minister said in her opening remarks in Seanad Ãireann on 3 March 2015, the Government is committed to introducing consolidated and reformed domestic violence legislation to address all aspects of domestic violence, threatened violence and intimidation in a way that provides protection to victims. The draft general scheme of the legislation is being finalised and it is intended that it will be considered by Government shortly after Easter. Following approval of the general scheme by the Government, it will be forwarded to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence for pre-legislative scrutiny. Work is also continuing on the drafting of a general scheme of a criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill. This Bill is expected to be published in mid-2015. Persons seeking the assistance of the Legal Aid Board regarding domestic violence matters can be assured of the board's commitment to providing a prompt service in this area. I will look at the report. At no time and in no way, should any victim of domestic violence or any other kind of violence in our society ever think that they are being treated as a nuisance at any stage of the criminal justice process. I make a commitment to read that report and I look forward to the Deputy's constructive engagement in the process regarding the legislation the Minister intends to bring before this House shortly.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	300	This Bill is not fit for purpose. However, I do not propose to vote against it. This Bill follows on from the Social Welfare Act 2012 Act, which proposed amendments to the one-parent family payment. During debate on that legislation, the Minister gave a commitment that these cuts would not be proceeded with in 2015 if decent, affordable and accessible child care had not been put in place. When this issue was raised by the National Women's Council of Ireland at a conference in 2012, female members of the Labour Party called on the Council not to oppose the cuts on the basis that the Minister would keep her word and they would not be implemented in 2015 if affordable child care provision had not been put in place by then.It is outrageous that the Minister is proceeding with this. We know that 63% of lone parents live in deprivation, we know we have the highest child care costs in Europe, and we are still proceeding with this. The Labour Party in particular should hold its head in shame. The Government has suggested it is to facilitate lone parents getting back into the workplace. Almost 53% of lone parents are in the workplace and these are the people affected by these cuts. I said this already and it should go on the record again. The Minister absolutely agreed with the figures provided by SPARC, the lone parents group, that there would be a 20% loss in earnings with this, even with the one-parent family payment. The Government is taking money out of their pockets while at the same time giving about â¬30 back to them, and that will be gone in about two years' time. The Government should hold its head in shame. This is an absolutely disgraceful continuation of cuts on the most vulnerable people in society.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	301	I thank the Minister of State for his courtesy and how he has dealt with the Bill. Like Deputy Joan Collins, I was tempted to vote against the Bill, but because of the improvements contained therein, I do not propose to vote against it. However, I deeply regret the Government's decision to proceed with the change in the one-parent family payment, despite promises to the contrary by the Minister. The reason for the change advanced by the Government is to incentivise lone parents to go out to work. This must be the first time in the history of the universe when people were supposed to be incentivised by being made worse off. A lone parent who is not working and does not want to, or perhaps cannot, engage with the workplace, for whatever reason, is not affected by this legislation. It is only working parents who will be adversely affected and they will be pretty dramatically affected. The figures produced by SPARC that incorporate the improvements brought about by the family dividend clearly show that those people, who are already in very low-income occupations and who are scraping from one end of the week to the other to survive, will lose a substantial chunk of their income. For example, yesterday's edition of The Irish Times contained a feature about a woman. She allowed her photograph to be taken, and her name and address to be used. She is a lone parent working part time and getting â¬94 per week. Because she has a child who will be over seven on the relevant date in May, with that â¬94 over five days, she will not be entitled to jobseeker's allowance and therefore she will have to give up her job. Obviously she cannot live on â¬94 per week, albeit she is getting â¬50 a week in maintenance from her husband. She will have to give up her job. The net result will be that whereas her full income at present is â¬361 a week, that will drop to â¬267 per week next month because of the changes the Government has introduced. That is a quarter of her income. There are people in this House who might feel it if they lost a quarter of their income, but for someone on â¬361 a week to lose a quarter of her income is pretty devastating. I spoke to two single parents who came to see me over the weekend. I know both their families. They are both working part-time and they will both lose 20% to 25% of their income in May directly as a result the changes. While it is all very well for the Department of Social Protection to suggest they get more hours and qualify for family income supplement, in the real world sometimes these people cannot get more hours. A person cannot demand more hours from an employer. In many cases they would not be able to do more hours because of their child-minding responsibilities. What is happening to lone working parents is a travesty and is a denial of justice. The TÃ¡naiste gave a very firm commitment on the floor of this House that that change would not be triggered until we had a Scandinavian-type system of child care. As we clearly do not have that, the TÃ¡naiste is going back on a promise she made in good faith and which we certainly accepted in good faith here in the DÃ¡il. That is very regrettable. Even at this late stage I appeal to the Minister of State, who is a very sympathetic individual, understands these things and is dealing with these sorts of people as much as I am, to prevail on the TÃ¡naiste to postpone that change. It is not too late.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	302	Like the other Deputies, I believe the Bill is in the main positive, but it represents a missed opportunity to address a problem that is now quantified regarding working single parents. Some years ago when the announcement was made that changes were to come into effect as of July 2015, we did not have exact figures for how many people would be affected and to what degree. Those who opposed it understood at the time the effects on working lone parents and those who were in education. In particular we were not persuaded at the time by the Minister, who is still Minister but is now also TÃ¡naiste, when she promised that changes to the one-parent family payment would not proceed unless we had a Scandinavian model of child care. That was pie in the sky and is still pie in the sky because Ireland is recognised as having one of the highest, if not the highest, child care costs of any country in the world, which makes it difficult for anyone in work. To date, with their one-parent family payment they have been able to subsidise going back to work and now in many instances they will be penalised. Those on this side of the House and certain Government backbenchers have raised with the Minister of State and the TÃ¡naiste the question of the effects on those in receipt of SUSI grants. The answer we have been given to date is that there are ongoing negotiations and discussions between the two Departments. Those discussions only seem to have been triggered since Christmas when the figures started to emerge. However, they should have been triggered two years ago when this legislation was put forward first. We still do not have a positive outcome on that. The only social welfare legislation on the schedule for this year is the next social welfare Bill which will come into being in October or November, which means there is a potential that a number of lone parents who are in education and in receipt of SUSI grants will be substantially affected. It is not contained in this Bill; that is the problem. We have highlighted concerns over the Bill and the Minister of State has answered them. In the main this is a positive Bill and is to be welcomed. It is often very difficult to vote against a social welfare Bill which is not cutting people's payments. All it is doing is tinkering around with a system and in some cases giving money. In this case there is a dividend and that is welcome. It is an approach that is to be welcomed in some ways because it is making work pay, but in other ways it should be addressing funding. I have another problem with social welfare legislation, which is not the fault of the Minister of State or his officials. I can take all the time in the world to prepare amendments, whether they are positive or negative from a Government point of view, but I cannot put them forward and we cannot debate them on Report Stage or even on Committee Stage unless the Chair on Committee Stage allows us leniency and we have managed that. It is difficult for us. When the Minister of State reports back to the TÃ¡naiste, I ask him to reflect that the Convention on the Constitution made a proposal to address that aspect in the Constitution which prevents me and others in the House from putting together amendments that are likely to be a charge on the Exchequer or on the people.Ultimately, I cannot force the Government to accept my amendments. I can table all the amendments I want, be they good, bad or indifferent, but it is up to the Government to argue against them or, if they are off the wall, ridicule them. However, if I table positive amendments, as I have done in the past, they should be taken on board or, at least, amended. What is happening makes the Opposition's job of recommending changes difficult. It probably makes the job of the Minister of State difficult because he does not get to answer the key concerns we raise unless the Chairman allows a loose debate on them on Committee Stage. I will not oppose this legislation but I believe it is a missed opportunity. I ask that the Minister for Social Protection come to the House at the earliest opportunity before July to explain what has been done to address the substantial shortfall for working parents who will be affected by the change to the one-parent family payment that comes into effect this year. I refer in particular to those who are stuck working for five days per week but not working 19 hours, which would qualify them for family income supplement, for instance, and also to those in education who are affected by how the legislation is now framed. It means they will have substantially less money. The amount of money is substantial when one has very little.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	303	I have certainly had to think long and hard about my attitude to the final vote on this Bill, and I had to consult colleagues. This is because a trick is being played with this Bill. The trick is to smuggle in a very regressive measure under the cover of one that is marginally progressive. I find that sort of politics quite dishonest. It is a way of trying to blackmail the Opposition into endorsing legislation that is regressive. Much of the debate on this Bill has focused, for important and entirely legitimate reasons, on the issue of lone parents and the impact of changes already made, but not dealt with in this legislation. I am referring to the phasing out of the one-parent family payment for families when their children reach the age of seven. That was a the regressive move. As has been said, we were promised this would not be implemented until we had Scandinavian-style child care but we have not got that. The Government has broken the promise. Instead of giving what it promised, it has offered the sop of the back-to-work family dividend, essentially under pressure owing to agitation by lone parents, advocate groups such as SPARK and its supporters in this House. In so far as the Government has been forced to introduce the dividend, lone parents who are not working will be able to move on to the transitional payment and, therefore, not lose out. However, as has been pointed out at length, those who are working will lose out, even with the back-to-work family dividend. That loss will become increasingly worse over a number of years. On the other hand, it is better than nothing for those who will benefit from the concession the Government made under pressure. While much of the debate has focused on that, what was smuggled in under the radar was not really spotted by me and most other Deputies until we read the detail of the legislation on Committee Stage. We saw in various sections of the legislation that the Government is giving a little with one hand but taking away with the other. The taking away is in the form of the tightening of the eligibility criteria for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant. These issues are every bit as serious and important as those concerning lone parents. This is a real sleight of hand by the Government. We have debated this extensively through the amendments we tabled on Committee Stage, in addition to those we tabled on Report Stage this morning. The Government has not given any justification for the changes included in this Bill in respect of the criteria, the definition of a "relevant person" who would be entitled to carer's benefit, or the criteria for eligibility in that regard. We just got bluster. The reason for this is to cover up the fact that the Minister of State, his officials and everybody knows that this is a tightening up. The Minister of State said something to the effect that the previous legislation was ambiguous. If I am correct, that was the justification. The Minister of State said this Bill is doing away with ambiguity. I would prefer the ambiguous version because it offers more latitude and support to the applicant for the carer's allowance, or carer support, than the tightened-up version. The existing legislation states a relevant person shall be regarded as requiring full-time care where they meet the criteria. This Bill states a relevant person "shall not" be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention unless certain criteria are met. That is a clear shift in the presumption of entitlement. It absolutely clear that it is a shift. It makes it easier for deciding officers to say "No". That is essentially giving legislative support to deciding officers who were wrongly refusing applicants. When they refuse people, they are inflicting suffering on a very significant cohort who do not need further suffering on top of the disabilities, illnesses and infirmities that lead them to apply for carer supports in the first place. It is just not fair. Needless suffering is being experienced. We should be moving in the opposite direction, as alluded to in the amendments that Deputy Collins and I tabled. These amendments would simply require the acceptance of the word of a general practitioner. I will make a point I did not have time to make earlier. When we discussed this on Committee Stage, I asked why we should not simply accept the word of the general practitioner or professionally qualified medical practitioner when testifying to medical eligibility for a carer's payment. The response we got from a committee member on the Government side was that it would put too much pressure on general practitioners. We also heard the excuse that it would make the general practitioner judge, jury and executioner in the determination of eligibility. I would much rather a general practitioner, who is medically qualified to decide whether somebody needs carer support, to be judge, jury and executioner than somebody who is not medically qualified and for whom a significant pressure is the budgetary constraint. I am not merely speculating that budgetary constraints are an influence on deciding officers; we know this because amendments to address this were ruled out of order on Committee Stage because they would represent a potential charge on the Exchequer. Why would they be a potential charge on the Exchequer? If somebody meets the medical eligibility criteria for a benefit, he is entitled to it. If the Government were honest in this legislation, it would actually say the relevant person shall not be entitled to a benefit unless he or she fits the medical criteria, "subject to budgetary constraints". Of course, it would not say "subject to budgetary constraints" because that would completely undermine the principle of the measure, which is supposed to be a support for people who need it.The Department could not possibly admit that in legislation but it is absolutely clear that this is what was driving the thinking. The idea is that the Government cannot open the floodgates, as the Department would see it, because it would impact on budgets and would bring a charge on the Exchequer. The Government does not admit that this is what is driving the tightening up of the criteria in the legislation. It is dishonest legislation. One of the implications was explicitly stated at the committee. Certainly, from talking to some of the Deputies afterwards - I am not referring to the Minister of State, but other Deputies - there was a belief that general practitioners are willy-nilly signing letters stating that someone needs supports or is permanently disabled or whatever, when that is not the case.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	307	It is what is in the Bill. That is the point I am making. The implication is that doctors are lying and writing false testimonies on a large scale. I do not believe that for a minute. Even if there are a small number of abuses, the idea that the Government would frame the legislation on the presumption that large numbers of GPs are lying is rubbish. It is an absolutely unacceptable way to frame legislation, particularly when the alternative is to depend on deciding officers who are not medically qualified. I believe that, by and large, when GPs say someone needs support, they need it. That should be enough. Having thought it over and in view of what is going on here, I believe we have no choice but to vote against the Bill. I have no wish to vote against the back-to-work family dividend, not because it is sufficient compensation for the axing of the one-parent family payment for children over the age of seven years - it is not - but because it is a marginal improvement on the decision made in 2012. It should not be lumped in with a regressive move which will tighten the eligibility criteria for carers and for a significant cohort of others on an ongoing basis for years to come, including people who are vulnerable, disabled and infirm. These people need support. They should not have extra unnecessary hoops put in front of them to claim their entitlements. These two things should not be lumped together. I want to make it absolutely clear in saying I am voting against the Bill that I am against it on the basis of what the Government is doing around the eligibility criteria for carers. If the Government were cognisant of this, it could easily introduce amendments in the Seanad that would separate out the two issues. That would allow us not to oppose the parts of the Bill that will improve the situation for lone parents without forcing us simultaneously to endorse something that will disimprove the situation for vulnerable, ill, disabled and infirm people. The Government should not ask us to lump those two things together.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	308	I too and the other Deputies of the Anti-Austerity Alliance will not be supporting this Bill because of several measures. As the previous speaker said, this is an attack on the requirement for getting full-time care by taking it out of the hands of a GP and giving it to the opinions of a deciding officer and medical staff. There is a system like this in Britain operated by Atos Healthcare which is routinely used to refuse people full-time care. To me, that is what is going on here and I believe the Bill should be opposed for that reason. I do not believe people should be fooled by a back-to-work family dividend of â¬29 per week as some kind of gesture towards the furore and outrage we have seen over the Government's cuts to lone-parent supports. The back-to-work family dividend facilitates the Government in its philosophy, according to which being a lone parent is a lifestyle choice, such people are lazy and they need to be activated back to work. That is absolutely outrageous given that over 50% of lone parents are in the workforce in any case. What the Government is doing will make it more difficult for them. The back-to-work family dividend in the Bill is one of the Labour Party's key measures in the legislation. It is supposed to make going back to work pay for families. However, in effect, it will not do that. The amount of money being given is â¬29.80 per week per child. Does the Minister of State know of any child who can be minded for â¬29.80 per week? It is absolutely ridiculous. In a report carried out recently, we learned that the average cost of child care nationally was â¬659 per month. We know that in Dublin and other cities it is much higher, depending on the age of the child. The dividend will cover â¬119.20. How is anyone meant to make up the shortfall? It is called the back-to-work dividend but the question is: back to what work? The only jobs available are low-paid or seasonal, as we are finding out and as we will find out with the case of the Dunnes Stores workers tomorrow, many of whom are women workers and many of whom may be lone parents or parents trying to keep their families afloat. The work is contractual, seasonal and is almost moving to zero-hours contracts. These are the types of jobs the Government is promoting. Most of these jobs are low-paid and precarious. Why should the Government subsidise employers who are not paying people enough to enable them to afford child care? This is another subsidy by the taxpayer for these employers. This is a sop that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, is bringing in because she has been under relentless criticism from every agency that deals with children, including Barnardos and the One Parent Exchange and Network. All the various bodies have reacted with outrage. Let us be honest. This is an attack on women yet again because 90% of one-parent families are headed by women. It is a continuation of the attack on the most vulnerable, who are not in a position to organise in the same way as, for example, a trade union or public sector workers. They do not have the same collective organisations. Women especially have been hit by austerity and this is another social welfare attack on them, having already faced major cuts in child benefit. I appeal to Opposition Members to oppose this Bill because it facilitates all the cuts the Government has brought in, especially to lone parents. We should not facilitate the Government in the argument that people need to be incentivised to go back to work. People need proper child care. Most lone parents work. This shows they would like to work and want to be part of the workforce, but it is being made especially difficult for women. We have already heard from speaker after speaker about the lies of the TÃ¡naiste, Deputy Burton, who promised this would not be brought in until we had the Scandinavian model of child care. We have no such thing. I agree it is a sneaky attack on the Department qualification for full-time care. This is something that often happens in this type of legislation. Something that can seem rather nuanced can turn out to be very serious for many people. The Anti-Austerity Alliance will oppose the Bill. Moreover, we urge people to organise and put serious pressure on the Minister of State and the Labour Party in particular, because this represents another betrayal of women, low-paid workers and people on social welfare. We should apply pressure to get those in government to repeal all the attacks they have made.

As far as this being a sop is concerned, it is not a sop or a response to people being under pressure. The back-to-work family dividend is substantial and the people I have spoken to have quite welcomed it. They see it as an opportunity to get back into the workforce, having been distanced from that. This is an opportunity for people to get back into work for a period of time through a subvention that is paid over two years. While there is a tailing off, people know exactly what they are getting into and they quite welcome it. Of all the people I have spoken to, I believe there were only two who responded negatively, including one of the Deputies present, who objected on Committee Stage because people would be at a loss as it tailed off after two years. I accept there is a time element. I refute any suggestion these changes are being made in order to make it more difficult for a person to qualify for the carer's scheme. I do not accept that is the intention, although I know Deputy Boyd Barrett wants to portray it like that. He said in the debate that we shaved carer's allowance to pay for the back-to-work family dividend. That is not the case. He should look at the budget figures, where it is clearly funded. He is using bluster in tying one thing to the other.

When we came into government, unemployment was at 15.1% and it is now at 10%. When the recovery started, many jobs were part-time or short-time but, for the past 18 months, there have been substantial announcements of high paid, solid jobs providing 39 hours a week, and the tax returns show this. The Minister of State, Deputy Nash, in his commission will address many of the issues the Deputy has raised. Right across the House, everybody has been worried about low-hour contracts.

However, I certainly do not believe this is in any shape or form an attack on carers. Deputy Ã Snodaigh debated for a long time on Committee Stage and Report Stage in regard to the medical assessors to whom Deputy Coppinger is referring. I believe I have adequately explained what we are doing to those who were present in the House. By and large, I believe most Deputies accept how we are going to manage that. The medical assessors who will be recruited will operate in the same fashion as the current ones. We are not copying any English or British system.

Normally, the accounts would cover a 12-month financial year, but these amendments allow the final accounts to cover the longer period from January 2014 up to the date Sport Ireland is established in 2015. The approach suggested by the Comptroller and Auditor General is more effective for accounting and auditing purposes.

The definition in the original text of the Bill gave doping in sport the same meaning as it has in the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport. There were concerns that this definition could cause a difficulty for Sport Ireland in bringing certain cases against athletes suspected of doping. The concern is that there can be a significant delay between the time when the new anti-doping rule violations are introduced by the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, and when the definition in the convention is updated to reflect these new rule violations. This delay could stop Sport Ireland from bringing cases against athletes suspected of doping under any new rule violations agreed by WADA but not yet agreed under the convention. I am amending the definition now to guard against any such difficulties arising. This amendment will mean that all anti-doping rule violations under the WADA code will have immediate effect in Ireland under the Irish anti-doping rules.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	335	I move amendment No. 8:In page 25, to delete line 26.The current version of the Bill includes a provision that obliges Sport Ireland to make anti-doping rules related to consent of data subjects. Consent was part of the old anti-doping rules enforced when the Bill was drafted. A new set of Irish anti-doping rules came into force on 1 January 2015 and the consent element has been removed. This is in line with WADA anti-doping developments internationally. I now propose to delete the reference to consent in the Bill in order to be consistent with international developments. I am also deleting some text in section 43 and replacing it with a general provision that requires Sport Ireland to perform its functions and obligations in accordance with the data protection Acts. There was concern that the original text placed a heavier burden on Sport Ireland than is required under the data protection Acts, and that this could be used by athletes at anti-doping hearings to argue that due process has not been met and weaken the Sport Ireland case against athletes who are alleged to have been doping. The amendment I am proposing will guard against that. Sport Ireland will be required to comply with the data protection Acts in the normal way, just as with all other State agencies.

The question of to whom the rules apply will be set out in the rules rather than the Bill. Sport Ireland will have responsibility for making the Irish anti-doping rules and setting out to whom the rules apply.

The new section provides, subject to the consent and sanction of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, for the expenses of the National Transport Authority, NTA, in carrying out the functions conferred on it by the Bill. It is not anticipated that any new funding will be required by my Department in connection with the administration of the Bill once enacted. The expenses of the NTA are expected to be relatively modest and will be found from within my Department's Vote.

(1) It shall be an offence under this Act to apply a clamp to a vehicle for the purposes of seeking payment for a debt or unpaid charge.(2) It shall be an offence under this Act for an Ownersâ Management Company, as defined by the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, to apply a clamp to a car unless it is operating as a clamping operator under the terms of this Act.(3) Clamping operators or clamping controllers may not apply a clamping device to a person that is a patient in a health facility or visiting a patient in a health facility.â.I raise an issue that is very serious in my constituency and many others, particularly where there are new and multi-unit developments. There are three aspect to the amendment. First, clamping should not be used to get a person to pay a debt, second, clamping companies should be regulated, and third, the odious practice of clamping people at hospitals should be banned. Clamping was allegedly introduced for traffic management purposes, to facilitate the free flow of traffic, etc. However, private companies of various shades are using clamping for profiteering in the most despicable manner at the expense of people who are in very vulnerable situations. People who frequently need to visit hospitals are especially in fear. People whose appointments overrun in a crowded waiting room and who cannot walk back to the car park in time are clamped. I was clamped as I dropped a specimen in to Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown as I spoke to a doctor at the door. Even the doctor, who was a member of the board, could not get the clamper to remove the clamp or see any sense. Clamping is being abused. Many of the clamping companies offer piece work and encourage the clampers to clamp as many people as possible for bonuses, which is why they operate as they do. The Minister must agree that clamping has no place in hospitals, where people are in vulnerable and difficult situations and do not need the extra stress. There is a widespread and despicable practice whereby private estate management companies are using clamping as a way of getting management fee arrears from their members. People come out of their houses and find their cars clamped, although they are parked in parking spaces which they are legally entitled to use and which do not block anyone's access or egress. In many cases, they must pay up to â¬150. This has happened in Applewood estate in Swords, the Phoenix Park Racecourse in Dublin 15, my area, Ongar, Archers Wood and many other estates. The Government should send a message to private management companies. There can be many reasons people do not pay estate management fees, and this is not a justifiable way of getting them to pay arrears. I am very familiar with estate management companies, which have been a scourge throughout Dublin West and in many other recently developed areas. Estate management companies were imposed in multi-unit estates. Obviously, an apartment block needs a collective structure for insurance, a sinking fund etc. However, most of the management companies apply to people who have their own houses, with front and back entrances and no need for a management company. Former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, recognised this in the DÃ¡il in 2006 and sent a circular to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicating that the practice should not apply to houses in the future. The problem is that there are many estates that were built in the limbo period during which planning permission was given and which have been left with these private management companies. I live in an estate where we do not have clamping or parking issues. We have a management company as a legacy issue, although, with advice from Fingal County Council, we have taken a democratic decision, in conjunction with the council, that the houses should be released from it. However, tens of thousands of people throughout the country are legitimately withholding fees because they do not agree they should have to pay them. They are being charged fees of â¬200 to â¬300 for the maintenance of a sprig or a bush in front of their houses, which they are well capable of maintaining themselves.In Tyrellstown, people are paying insurance on a car parking space. These are totally unjustifiable management company structures. Clampers are being used by the directors of these companies. I have sympathy with some of these directors who are ordinary residents and who have been put in the odious position of having to take over the management company because they live in an apartment block and the management structure was not working for them given the level of arrears and non-payment of fees. Residents on one estate are going to court because it is totally unjustifiable to live in a house, maintain and insure it and then have to pay a management fee. In Ongar, Clonsilla, Dublin 15 and in other areas, people are waking up and finding that they have been clamped because they have not paid the management fee. This is effective because the payment of the fees seems to increase when this happens, but is it right? This is extortion in a sense with people having to pay an unjust fee. They try to sort the management fee out legitimately by dealing with issues in their management company or they may be in arrears because they have lost their job and they cannot afford to pay the fee anymore, which has been the case during the recession. We should ban clamping for that purpose on behalf of those people. Legislation needs to be introduced to deal with management companies and to ensure houses can be released from their control in a fair and workable way. The legal advice is that this can be done and the Government needs to deal with this problem because it has left many people on newly developed estates in a difficult position having to pay unjust fees to management companies while getting clamped in the process. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. This major issue was raised by a host of Members on Committee Stage. It will also be an election issue.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	345	I support the amendment. I raised the issue of clamping on hospital grounds earlier, particularly Blanchardstown hospital where I have witnessed this many times. People who had to rush into the accident and emergency department come out afterwards to discover their car clamped. Patients and visitors who are detained for different reasons when they go into the hospital are also being clamped. It is despicable that a person can come out of a hospital to find their car clamped having being delayed through no fault of their own. I have always said another mechanism can be used to deal with that. When this issue was raised on Committee Stage, the Minister said he was not in favour of this but there are ways of addressing this issue. Barriers could be used in order that people can at least access their cars and get in and out of the car park. To be clamped and have to pay a fine having visited someone who is sick or having to go in sick as a patient is a big issue. It is common practice for management companies to use clamping to put pressure on people to pay management fees and I am aware of this happening in many areas, including Lanesborough, Hampton Wood and so on. This practice should not be allowed. More rules are needed to regulate management companies. We need to examine how they do this. I would much prefer if we went down the road of having local authorities manage all these estates instead of having myriad management companies with different rules. I welcome the Minister's move to bring fines on public and private roads into line. That is welcome because the cost of unlocking clamped cars varies significantly.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	346	We had a discussion on these issues on Committee Stage. I wish we were discussing parking in its totality and, as a subset, where clamping fits into it but that is not what the Bill is about and I understand that. The amendments are an attempt to moderate the actions taken in extreme cases in the context of clamping. Many traditional housing estates, which do not contain an apartment, are run by management companies. Sometimes, the developer has a proxy vote giving him a majority. The management company then determines that people must pay clamping fees because a majority vote decides on such initiatives to recoup management fees. This does not dovetail well with the Multi-Unit Development Act 2011. Typically, people are stressed in terms of paying a mortgage and they make a decision on whether to pay the management fee or the mortgage to keep the roof over their heads. In most cases, they are not trying to avoid paying the fee but they simply do not have the money to pay it. I have had people in my clinics in tears over this. Their car has been immobilised for days and they have been unable to go to work. In addition, workers making deliveries and visitors to residents have also been clamped. It is a blunt instrument. These cars are not causing an obstruction on the public road and this clamping policy is a means of collecting the management fee. I fully appreciate that in the case of an apartment, a management company arrangement will always be needed given there will be shared spaces that require to be managed. However, in the early part of the first decade of the new millennium, the establishment of management companies was routine, whether the development was full of apartments or traditional housing. There needs to be an understanding of what is going on. Clamping is not appropriate as a sanction. Other measures such as the simple contract debt sanction could be pursued without adopting this approach. No court would impose the sanction the clampers can impose. People can run up debts of between â¬300 and â¬400 in a week because they do not have the money to release the clamp. It is unfair to treat citizens in that way. An amount is charged per night until the clamping fine is paid and it is a blunt instrument. Deputies Ellis, Coppinger and I particularly focused on Blanchardstown hospital in the context of clamping fines because that is the hospital about which we receive most complaints. These complaints are ongoing. Clamping is in place 24-7 and does not stop at 5 p.m. People run in and out of the hospital to put money in the machine only to find they have been clamped. I have dealt with cases of families who were visiting relatives in the final days of their lives. That last thing on their minds was to worry about the car being clamped but they came out of the hospital to find it had been, which is inappropriate. They were parked in a designated parking space and, for example, they were not in a disabled space or obstructing traffic. I have no problem with parking charges given, as the Minister said on Committee Stage, we cannot have a scenario where people use hospital car parks such as the one in St. James's Hospital inappropriately. I get that as part of an overall policy but where somebody is trying to have tests done or is visiting a patient who is seriously ill, the use of clamping as a means of sanction is highly inappropriate.It is not necessary. The only ones gaining from it are the clamping companies. It is not as if the hospital is gaining from it. I hope the Minister will accept these amendments. It is not a question of throwing out an entire policy or legislation, it is about at least taking out some of the worst excesses. It is interesting to see how Government policy on some issues does not dovetail with other areas of policy. There is a plan for the renewal of rural Ireland. One of the initiatives concerns parking in towns. At the same time, there are towns where part of the reason people will not go near them is the risk of being clamped. Being clamped once is enough to put them off ever coming back. It has a dramatic impact and there are a myriad of arrangements in many towns. It is not just the local authorities, it may be two or three different companies, some of which use clamping as the main sanction. One also finds it at railway stations. This happens when people do not expect it. For example, I was at the railway station in Leixlip where people came to park and get the train to Croke Park on a Sunday or bank holiday Monday. Yes, there are signs, but most people would not expect to come back and have to pay â¬140 to undo the clamp. This must be better thought out. It is not about modifying the legislation for the clampers, it is about looking at parking policy in its totality and the impact it has on other things. For example, we want to discourage people coming all the way into town when there is a big match on. We want them, for example, to come as far as train stations on the periphery and get the train in. This legislation does not achieve that because of the way it is imposed. There are many different issues, but the most offensive situations are in housing estates, where management companies are using this as a sanction when there is no need to do so, and most offensive of all, in hospitals, which is unfair on people when they are at their lowest.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	347	I thank the Deputies for their contributions. I will begin where Deputy Murphy finished. She urged that this Bill be focused on parking policy. She correctly said this Bill does not take the approach of dealing with parking policy. It deals with the regulation of clamping, which is something that has not happened before in such a strong and national manner as this Bill proposes. I will use the Deputy's example of clamping on large match days or around sporting events to show why we are not dealing with parking policy itself. If we were to take the approach in this Bill of trying to regulate parking policy, this Bill would have to deal with the specifics of events like that. Do we believe there are any circumstances in which clamping is allowed? I do. I believe there are other circumstances in which clamping should not be allowed and other sanctions or criteria should be used to deal with illegal parking. The reason this Bill does not get into the realm of trying to dictate parking policy is precisely that there are so many different situations and so many needs all over the country regarding parking, which could have the potential for clamping. If I were looking to do that, I would then be dealing with charges from members of the Opposition that I am trying to take power away from the people who best know how that power should be wielded, namely, local authorities or statutory bodies which look after property they own. If I were looking to deal with parking policy, the claim would be made against me that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and myself were removing power from local authorities, for example. Local authorities are the bodies best placed to develop policy for their areas. It is because of the different nuances and local needs to which parking policy must respond that this Bill looks at the regulation of the activity of clamping, while recognising the right of other parties, such as statutory bodies and local authorities, to determine what is the best policy for parking in their areas, and charging the National Transport Authority with playing a role in the regulation of clamping that takes place as a consequence of the failure of motorists or clampers to take cognisance of the parking policy in that area. The amendments proposed by Deputies Coppinger, Murphy and Higgins seek to make it an offence to clamp a vehicle for the purposes of recovering an unpaid debt or charge and within multi-unit developments to make it an offence under the Multi-Units Development Act 2011 for an owners' management company to clamp a car unless it is operating as a clamping operator under the terms of this Bill. They also seek to prohibit the clamping of vehicles in residential developments other than to facilitate the free flow of traffic and the clamping of vehicles in hospital and health facilities that belong to patients or people visiting patients. As I said on different stages of the Bill, and a moment ago, this Bill is not about parking policy itself, for the reasons I have outlined. It is not about where clamping should or should not be carried out, whether on the public road, in hospital car parks, in residential areas, or anywhere else. This decision was made from the outset of the Bill. This Bill seeks to deal with the activity of clamping if used as a means of parking control. For this reason, it is beyond the scope of this Bill to legislate for practices within the property management sector. In the case of hospitals and health facilities, while I would prefer clamping not be used and that alternative means of parking control were used, I must also accept that it is the right of the individuals and organisations running those hospitals to decide how they deal with parking needs on their own property. Deputy Coppinger used the example of James Connolly Hospital, with which I am familiar. It is adjacent to the National Sports Campus and other areas of employment.

Let us tease this out because we have gone through it on Committee Stage already. Am I to say there are no circumstances at all in which clamping should be allowed within a hospital? There could be circumstances in which clamping is allowed in the hospital. The board of management or the people running a hospital might decide that if clamping is not used, it might deprive patients or staff of their ability to use the facilities that are there. The fact that I accept that there are some circumstances in which a hospital might decide that clamping is used or should be used is another reason I have decided from the outset that this Bill should not deal with the regulation of parking policy itself. Instead, it should deal with the circumstances in which clamping takes place and, through the National Transport Authority, set out a framework within which the rights and responsibilities of both people who are clamped and the people who do the clamping are clearly laid out and processes are in place to allow appeal either to the clamper or to the person who is clamped in areas in which a car is clamped for the infringement of parking policy.For those reasons, I cannot accept these amendments.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	350	The Minister is looking at clamping purely from a Dublin City Council perspective because it is the only local authority that operates clamping. All the others are private clampers. Clamping has been outlawed in England, Scotland and Wales and the world has not fallen in on top of them. In fact, they regulate parking in a coherent way, which is clear if one visits any of those three places. The Minister talked about Blanchardstown hospital. For the life of me I cannot figure out how the Minister can stand up here and make that silly argument about parking there and going up to the National Sports Campus. Blanchardstown it is not an area I know extraordinarily well, but I do know it. The Blanchardstown Centre has thousands of free car parking spaces with buses coming in and out of it. Why would one park in the hospital grounds? I cannot see any logic in what the Minister is talking about in that regard. It just does not stack up. There is a need for a parking policy that is coherent. The lack of such a policy is having a negative impact on businesses in town centres and villages by virtue of the fact that it is difficult to figure out exactly what the regime is. In my area of Celbridge there are four different arrangements. There is the local authority and three different companies which charge three different amounts. What is the public supposed to think? Is it supposed to read the bylaws and every sign before parking their car? That is the kind of thing that puts people off. They come back and find they have to pay between â¬80 and â¬120. The Bill will take the worst excesses away, and there are positives in it from that point of view, but it is lacking in ambition in terms of what is needed. We have to ask why this is only thing the Bill set out to do when there is so much more needed that can be done.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	351	It is ridiculous for the Minister to say he cannot legislate for these serious issues in the Bill. Serious abuses of clamping have been pointed out by private companies. Why is it outside the scope of the Bill, given that the Minister is meant to regulate the private clamping companies? We have shown the Minister a really serious case and he is going to ignore it. His predecessor, Deputy Leo Varadkar, should be well aware that this is a major issue not only in his own constituency but in Kildare, parts of Dublin City and many other areas. Connolly hospital has been raised by a number of Deputies as being a particular offender, with no mercy shown to those who are clamped. It was laughable when the Minister said that was because the hospital is adjacent to the National Sports Campus, where my sister works. It has hundreds of acres and there is no pressure on parking there. It is clear there is not a need for this. Other issues can be considered to regulate parking without resorting to clamping. Other hospitals do not use clamping. They have looked at underground car parks, barriers or whatever. It has been pointed out by Dublin City Council that these workers have to clamp or else they are not paid properly. Dublin City Council set a target of â¬60,000 for clampers. Some of the companies are unlimited companies in the Isle of Man and would surely have to be properly regulated, submitting financial accounts and so on. Unfortunately our amendments were ruled out on that issue. In a number of these companies the workers literally have to clamp cars - otherwise, they will not be paid - so there is no rhyme or reason other than profiteering. It is disappointing that the Minister has done nothing about parking at hospitals, but it is also poor form, because the previous Government should have dealt with management companies and regulated to allow houses to be released, which is the main problem. The Government is continuing a decade-long problem whereby people are left in these invidious positions.

Deputy Catherine Murphy and Deputy Ruth Coppinger are the two Deputies, among other Deputies, who continually stand up and argue for the need for proper power to be devolved to local authorities, yet they want me, through the Bill before the House, to determine national parking policy. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot say they want power devolved to local authorities to allow them to determine how parking should be implemented in their areas if, the moment they are not happy with what they do, they come into the DÃ¡il and ask me to remove that power from them. That is what they want. I find it extraordinary that Deputies within the Independent tradition in particular, who I would have thought would be very aware of the powers that local authorities should have, should come to the House and ask that we remove flexibility and power from local authorities and enshrine it in legislation which is not capable of recognising the extraordinary diversity of areas and properties and the various ownership structures of areas within which parking takes place. They cannot have their cake and eat it in respect of this issue. They cannot say that local authorities should be more powerful, yet, in a case in which they are not happy with how they use that power, come in and ask for that power to be removed by amending the legislation.

I am simply making the point that it was a reasonable choice for the Bill to take and that we would be able to achieve more by regulating how clamping takes place, which is what we have done. The reason we have done that is that there are so many bodies involved in the administration of parking policy that it would be exceptionally difficult for the Bill to deliver policy in that area. That is the approach we have taken. On the issue of clamping within hospital grounds, I have said, as I said on Committee Stage, that I believe hospitals should use means of parking control other than clamping, which most hospitals do. We had an example of one hospital on Committee Stage. We must accept it is still the right of people within a hospital unit, who have responsibility for the maintenance of that area, to decide how parking policy should be administered within that area. That is what the Bill allows. Deputy Catherine Murphy offered mild praise here, but it is the first time this sector has been examined properly through primary legislation. The reason we are doing this is to deal with the many difficulties within the sector and to give rights, as enshrined in the Bill for the first time, to people who are clamped, and also to recognise the need for clamping companies and people involved in clamping to be properly regulated.

I do not believe it is reasonable that a disabled person using a disabled parking space and who could be delayed getting back to their car for myriad reasons, some of which have already been mentioned, should be clamped. It is an abuse of people who are already disabled enough by society. Will the Minister agree to the amendment?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	361	The use of the term âstatutory clamping placeâ in section 13(1)(b) is intended to distinguish between places where clamping is operated on what are generally State lands and where it is carried out on private property. As for vehicles displaying a valid disabled personâs parking permit, the current clamping exemption provided for on public roads is now being extended to any statutory clamping place. An important change in this Bill is the designation of the recognition of the role of a disabled parking permit which is recognised on public roads. This is being extended to any area that is designated as a statutory clamping place. This includes lands belonging to or occupied by CIE, the Rail Procurement Agency, a State harbour or a harbour. This Bill will extend the amount of public lands inside which the parking needs for people with a disability are being recognised. Vehicles displaying a valid disabled personâs parking permit will not be exempt from clamping on private land. Private car park operators are responsible for determining the location of any disabled personâs parking place and for policing the use of any such spaces on their own lands or car parks. Any cars that are parked in contravention of parking terms and conditions in these spaces are liable to be clamped. It is for that reason that I am not in a position to accept the Deputyâs amendment. As the Bill is phrased, we are extending the recognition of the needs of disabled drivers by including a wider realm of public lands.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	362	Does the Minister know how ridiculous it sounds to claim there is one parking law for public places and a different law for private places? He is actually giving greater powers to private management companies in all the places I listed earlier. That makes no sense. Hopefully, disabled people will only park in the statutory spaces.

If anyone holds a different view, that view is ridiculous or the issue is despicable. What I am doing here is making a much-needed improvement that is overdue in meeting and recognising the needs of drivers with disabilities by extending the number of public lands in respect of statutory clamping places. As a result of doing this, additional public land will be covered by this, including land owned by CIE, the RPA, State airports or harbours. I am simply recognising the ability of people who own private property to determine the parking policy for that area. The NTA will be able to play a role in respect of appeals and how clamping operates but because there is such a wide range of parking spaces across the country with different needs in those places, not to mention a multiplicity of owners, it is beyond the scope of this Bill to be able to recognise the complexity of all of that. This is why we continue to recognise the role of either the landowner or bodies like local authorities.

The purpose of these amendments is to extend maximum clamp release and relocation charges and fees to public places, so the amendments remove the word "non-statutory". The effect of that would be to widen the NTA's remit in regulating clamping to include public roads, harbours and airports and not just private operators. I hope the Minister will accept the amendments.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	369	Reference to non-statutory clamping places within the Bill refers to places where clamping is carried out on private land. Where clamping is operated under an existing enactment, these places are referred to in the Bill as statutory clamping places and include the public road and lands belonging to or operated by a State airport, harbours and lands belonging to the Railway Procurement Agency or CIE. Therefore, the specific inclusion of the term "non-statutory clamping places" in this section refers to this clear distinction between the two categories of clamping places. While clamp release and vehicle relocation charges are set by statutory bodies in statutory clamping places, such charges are set by private entities in non-statutory clamping places. This is the reason I am not in a position to accept this amendment.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	370	The reason I tabled this amendment is because sharp practice is also practised by public bodies which use clampers. It is not just the private management companies, although I would have liked the Minister to take much stronger action against them earlier on. I think Dublin City Council is the only local authority that uses clamping. An article in The Irish Times stated that Dublin City Council set a target of 60,000 vehicles for clampers so the company doing the clamping is actually setting a target. If 60,000 vehicles are clamped in Dublin that year, the company offered to pay staff a bonus of â¬2,000 each. If the overall target was not met, only individual clampers who managed to clamp 2,800 vehicles per year would be rewarded. The Minister can see the aim is not to manage traffic but to clamp people at all costs. This is a private company operating on behalf of a local authority - a statutory agency. Clampers can apparently leave a ten-hour shift after 8.5 hours if they have clamped 21 vehicles. In a letter to staff, the company's management while working for a public body said that the council was not happy with the number of clampings in 2012 and that the company was expected to deliver approximately 60,000 clampings in 2012 but only delivered 54,000. This shows how public bodies are subcontracting to private companies, some of which do not file accounts and operate offshore. They are also putting huge pressure on staff to clamp. We have all had the experience of being clamped after being one minute or two minutes late. We know that Merrion Square, which is right behind us, is a hotspot. It is purely for this reason and not to regulate traffic flow. That was the reason I asked the Minister to extend it to public bodies who use clampers.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	371	I followed up on the matter to which Deputies referred on previous Stages of the Bill in respect of the nature of the arrangement organisations such as Dublin City Council might have with private clamping organisations. My Department has been informed by Dublin City Council that there are neither penalties nor incentives relating to the number of cars being clamped. That is the information I have received from the council which I accept. In respect of the specific point the Deputy put to me, I accept the merit of some of the concerns she raises. However, some of the issues she raises are dealt with in section 14 which deals with maximum clamp release charges and vehicle relocation charges on private land by the NTA. Section 14 gives the NTA the power to deal with matters like clamp release charges and relocation fees. If such charges are not created by the NTA, the Bill will put in place a default setting relating to fees. The fee in non-statutory clamping places will be â¬100 with a maximum relocation charge of â¬50. We are looking to put in place maximum charges for those kinds of activities if the NTA does not implement a code of practice. It is my expectation that the NTA will use the powers that are open to it and implement a code of practice relating to some of the behaviour just described by the Deputy.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	376	I move amendment No. 17:In page 16, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:"17. (1) The NTA shall make regulations stipulating that, in every instance where a charge imposed in accordance with this section is paid before the stipulated deadline, where applicable, the total charge payable shall be reduced by half.(2) The regulations stipulated in subsection (1) shall apply to charges issued in respect of wrongfully parked vehicles at statutory clamping places and non-statutory clamping places.".We discussed the issue covered by this amendment on Committee Stage. Although it does not really relate to clamping, I will explain it again. In other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland, when a person is issued with a fixed notice penalty and the penalty is paid within 14 days the amount is reduced by 50%. This has proven to be very effective in the North, where it has led to a reduction in administration costs and the speedier payment of fines. I accept that the proposal is not in keeping with this legislation and for this reason I propose to withdraw the amendment and submit it for consideration in the context of legislation dealing with parking.

I would appreciate if the Deputy could let me know if the mechanism whereby early payment leads to a reduction in the penalty amount applies to road traffic offences in respect of which clamping has occurred or if it applies to a wider variety of offences.

A clamp can only be released when payment of the fine has been made. I have had the experience of having to wait in awful weather conditions for two and a half hours from the point of payment to have a clamp removed. That is not acceptable. I believe that clamping companies, having been paid a release fee by credit card, should be fined in cases where the clamp is not removed within, say, one hour. Perhaps that is already provided for in the legislation. The maximum time limit within which following payment a clamp should be removed is one hour.

I would go a stage further. For example, if a vehicle is clamped because it is blocking a public road or the point of exit from an estate, it is in the interests of everyone that the vehicle be moved on from that place. This Bill gives the National Transport Authority the power to put in place a code of practice which it will then enforce. I expect that one of the areas that will be covered by that code of practice is that referred to by the Deputy. One of the reasons a vehicle could be clamped is because it is in breach of parking policy. Where such a breach occurs, the sooner the clamp is removed upon release of the charge, the sooner the vehicle can be moved on from the place in which the offence was committed. It is in everyone's interests that the matter be dealt with.

The local authority with which I have been dealing was not aware that it had the power to partially revise a by-law. Putting in place a full set of by-laws can be very problematic. The Minister undertook on Committee Stage to notify the local authorities of this power. My main motivation in tabling this amendment is to find out from the Minister if he has done so.

I recall that at that time we had a discussion on whether a by-law could be partially revised and that my response was that it could be. On 31 March, I wrote to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government referencing that the Deputy had raised this matter with me and setting out my view and that of my officials as to how this matter could be dealt with. I have forwarded a copy of that correspondence and a cover letter to the Deputy, which obviously she has not yet received.

It is now up to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to respond to me on the matter. I am sure the Deputy will be copied on that response but I will also send a copy of it to her. I would signal the following caution. While I do believe the legislative flexibility exists to deal with the issue to which the Deputy refers, I know, based on my own experience as a local representative, that changes to any particular area of parking law or policy has consequences for adjoining areas. For this reason I am of the view that changes in one area should always be made in the context of the effect of the decision in that regard on surrounding communities. That being said, local authorities would be aware of this. In regard to my commitment to contact the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government about this matter, I have done so. The Deputy will receive a copy of that communication imminently, if she has not done so already.

I paid â¬8,000 in interest last year, which would be standard for many people in post offices and ordinary jobs who are on an average industrial wage. An extra â¬6,000 in their pockets would make a huge difference to the economy. Having all those people with money to spend in the economy would be very progressive at this stage. The motion calls for "legislation to ensure that all residential home loans in the State are subject to the protection of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears". The banks are blatantly refusing to implement the code of conduct, which is why I recently introduced legislation that was supported by the Opposition but not by the Government. The purpose of that legislation was to force the banks to adhere to the code of conduct. The CEO of AIB has the audacity to turn around and say that because of moral hazard the bank cannot write off mortgage debt or write it down. He says that it cannot use a magic wand to do this and can only deal with cases one by one. The Minister for Finance can wave a magic wand and give AIB â¬21 billion of taxpayers' money. The Government waved the magic wand, got rid of the moral hazard and bailed out the banks. These banks should be told to implement a reduction in interest rates.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	390	Once upon a time what we now call banking was known as usury and it was illegal to lend money at interest because back in those days they understood the potential for lenders to engage in profiteering and extortion and held that to be completely immoral. We have moved from that and now not only is it not illegal to engage in extortion and profiteering when lending money to people, but these institutions rule the roost and dictate policy and governments cower before them as they blatantly engage in extortion and profiteering. It is quite extraordinary. I commend Fianna FÃ¡il on raising the issue. I disagree fundamentally with its solution for dealing with it because we do not need more market competition to deal with this. We do not need more banks lending money which always hammer out an informal cartel arrangement anyway to deal with this sort of extortion and profiteering. We need a public banking system where banking is not about profit and extortion but is about allowing for the circulation of money to the benefit of all citizens, the economy and society as a whole. Considering the extortion that is particularly being suffered by variable rate mortgage holders, why on earth are we allowing the banks that we bailed out to do this to people? It was laughable for the Taoiseach to claim that our banking policy was not to the benefit of the bankers, but was to the benefit of the consumers and mortgage holders. Are mortgage holders, who are unable to pay their mortgages because of extortionate interest rates, feeling the same as Mr. Richie Boucher when he collects his monthly pay check, which could probably pay the mortgage interest on about ten mortgages in one month?
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	391	The new mortgage rates in the country are among the highest in Europe. This means first-time buyers are paying up to â¬2,500 a year more for mortgages than their counterparts in France, Italy and Holland. The interest rates here are still higher than most of those imposed for property buyers in the other 18 countries in the eurozone even after recent cuts by Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB. The cuts by those two banks were for new borrowers and those switching to them, but mostly not for existing customers. There has been a string of reductions in the main rate charged by the European Central Bank, which is now at a record low of 0.05%, but no decreases have been passed on to those in this country with tracker mortgages or on the new mortgage rates and the existing variable rates charged by the banks to established customers. The Central Bank issues figures for the interest rates charged for new mortgage business, but these figures are distorted by the inclusion of the old tracker rates for those who have had their mortgages restructured. Publishing such official mortgage rates discourages new lenders coming into the market and the reality is that mortgage interest rates are 2% higher than in the rest of the eurozone. On a â¬200,000 mortgage a new Irish borrower is paying around â¬2,500 more than for a mortgage elsewhere in the eurozone. Repayments on a German â¬200,000 mortgage work out at â¬819 a month, far lower than in this country. On the regulated market lenders must act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers. For the integrity of the market the Government must act immediately, in tandem with the Central Bank, which is not implementing its consumer protection code, in order to stop the fleecing of existing variable rate mortgage holders by the banks' actions. We are well aware that they are only further boosting their profitability.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	392	I was somewhat surprised to hear the Taoiseach say rather proudly this morning that the banks were back in what he called profitability. It is not surprising that the banks are back in profitability because the banks are allowed to do exactly what they like once again. One of the reasons they are back in profit is simply that they are allowed to pick their victims. The victims are identified in this evening's motion - the variable rate mortgage holders. Some time ago I could think of no worse way to run a bank than to put it into public hands. I must say that now when I hear the Taoiseach say it will be re-privatised I begin to shudder. However, the worst possible combination is a bank which is in public hands but is being allowed to behave as though it was some sort of private bank, publicly quoted, with its own autonomy. At the moment the banks - I do not think there is any doubt about it - are once again allowed to do exactly what they like. In defence, the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, yesterday said the Government could not possibly interfere with what was happening in the banks. That is nonsense; it could, but it will not. At the moment there is collusion going on. There is a cartel, as I believe Deputy Boyd Barrett identified, being run by the pillar banks with the collusion, consent and indeed the encouragement of the Government. It suits the Government's agenda to allow these unfortunate 300,000 people to be crucified by the banks and to step away in a Pontius Pilate way and say, "It's nothing to do with us; it's the banks doing it." It is the Government's duty to interfere if that is the word it wants to use. It is its duty to say, "No, we no longer will allow this sort of cartel to develop." Instead of that, it is encouraging what it calls pillar banks. It is its policy to allow a cartel to develop.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	393	Many of the 300,000 variable rate mortgage holders will have received mortgages for the same reason as generations of borrowers before them. Their motivation was not one of greed. They were motivated by the desire to set up a home, live independently and have security of tenure. In this country, one does not really have a choice if one wants security of tenure. This is not the case under housing policies in other European countries, where there is less dependence on home ownership. The lending institutions here could not find enough people to lend to and they were questioning whether they were borrowing enough. The same lending institutions now pick and choose and treat some of the borrowers in a way that puts them into even more difficulty. Many of those in most difficulty will have borrowed in the four or five years prior to the crash, when tens of thousands of houses were built every year. They have to listen to the rubbish that we all went mad, we all partied and we were motivated by greed, although all they wanted was a roof over their heads and to live in the same way as previous generations, namely by setting up home and paying their own way. The Taoiseach said this morning that he was not happy. It is not enough for him not to be happy; he has to do something about it. If the banks do not do something about it, the only people who can are the 300,000 people subject to a higher mortgage rate but the members of the Government. Many of the 300,000 people will lose their homes. They are barely managing and may be in negative equity. Some of them feature in the ongoing court cases brought by banks seeking repossessions. Some of the borrowers' homes will be repossessed and at the same time we will see banks sold off. It is the State and taxpayer who will ultimately pick up the tab. At this point, it ought to be recognised that there is a problem. It is a problem for all of us and there needs to be a solution. It is simply immoral not to pass on the reductions to people with variable interest rates.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	394	DÃºn Laoghaire has some of the highest house prices in the country and, by inference, some of the biggest mortgages. Some 300,000 people are on a standard variable rate mortgage. Standard variable rates in Ireland are close to double the eurozone average. They cost roughly an extra â¬1,500 per year for every â¬100,000 borrowed. In DÃºn Laoghaire, I estimate the cost to be an extra â¬7,500 per year, approximately, given the cost of properties there. A young female constituent contacted me today about tonight's motion. She feels Irish families have benefited least from the current low-interest-rate environment in Europe. She said she has watched in absolute frustration as her mortgage rate has steadily risen while rates across Europe have generally fallen. This has cost her hundreds of euro per month. She feels this is the number one issue affecting her household budget, yet it receives little or no attention from the Government. I am speaking this evening to support so many people who are in this very difficult position. Constituents with mortgage arrears have approached me. They are hard-working families who pay their property tax and universal social charge, and they will pay their water charges. I understand that the banks are independent commercial entities and that the Minister for Finance has no statutory role in this matter, but the fact of the matter is that the people who are coming to me in dire straits with their mortgages are the very people who helped bail out the banks. These families deserve a fair chance. We cannot allow banks to make up for their losses on tracker mortgages by loading costs onto those with standard variable rate mortgages. Last night the Minister of State said we must sustain a competitive economy that can pay its own way, serve society and survive and thrive in a reformed eurozone. I agree. Ongoing competition in the sector is crucial. I am glad that, through the hard work of this Government, the Irish market is entering a new competitive phase. However, we need to do more. We need to continue to encourage and support new lenders in the market. We need lenders to support and work with their mortgage holders, just as we worked with lenders in their times of difficulty. The Taoiseach said today that the Economic Management Council will be meeting the banks to discuss standard variable rate mortgages. I urge the Minister of State to make it clear to the banks that as they stabilise and get lower interest rates from Europe, they must pass them on to financially strapped mortgage holders across the country.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	395	The Government has moved the economy from crisis to recovery. Political stability has contributed greatly to the economic stability that we now see. The last tracker mortgages were issued in Ireland in 2008 and half of all mortgages today are tracker mortgages. A tracker mortgage gives the borrower a really welcome respite. The banks themselves admit, and the figures that Deputy McGrath put on the record last night show, that the cost of funding tracker mortgages is still significantly lower than that of funding in total for the banks. Therefore, half the mortgages of the banks are actually loss leaders for them, but I agree with Deputy McGrath that we must continue to put pressure on the banks to hold them to account on variable rates that really are out of sync with those in the rest of Europe. The Government has introduced some measures to help hard-pressed people with variable rate mortgages. The Government has given relief to all those who took out mortgages between 2004 and 2008, but it is now time for the banks to make a contribution. It is also time for the Governor of the Central Bank to take a stronger role in regard to what we are going to do for individuals who are repaying mortgages with variable rates that are out of sync. As Chairman of the finance committee, I have invited the banks to appear before it after Easter. Twice per year representatives of the banks appear before us. The committee is a public forum where everybody can hear the contributions being made by the banks and the questions asked by members of all parties and none. That is why it surprises me that, through this Private Members' motion, the Opposition wants to give more power to the Economic Management Council. Deputy McGrath regards it more as a solution than anything else. I would have expected that in this era of greater transparency and accountability, we would want the banks to make themselves more accountable to the Parliament of the people. I ask that Deputy McGrath consider the view that we really should be asking the banks to keep appearing before us and making statements in public. With the improvement in the economy, the great strides we have made in getting people back to work and our stabilisation of the crisis of recent years, perhaps we should be having a conversation on whether we still need the Economic Management Council rather than regarding it as the solution to our problems. I agree that not everybody is feeling the benefits of our rapidly growing economy or the dramatic increases in employment. This is why we must do everything we can to help keep people in their homes. There is still a real crisis over mortgage arrears and it is a real concern. The banks can and must do more and we need to put more pressure on them. Owing to the crisis that was inflicted on the Irish people, of which we are all aware and which we have discussed many times in this House, not everybody can avoid losing home ownership. There are solutions whereby one can stay in one's home, but it is not always possible to maintain ownership. We need to be pushing the solutions to remove the awful stress affecting too many people at present. People need somewhere to live. The Government is doing a lot and has plans to do much more. Now that the economy has improved, we can invest more resources in it, which is very important, but the banks also need to show us they can do much more now that they have stabilised. There is one thing I do not agree with. Politicians do not make good bankers. Whatever disasters that have occurred in recent years because of bankers looking after banks, the idea of politicians taking control of banks certainly will not improve the situation. We can make changes to legislation and there are other things we can do. However, we must ensure that we continue the stability that we have put in place in our economy and amplify the confidence that we have given back to people. We have given that confidence to all the people who are working, whether self-employed people who own their own businesses or the people who are employed by those small or medium-sized businesses. We are giving increasing confidence and we are getting people back to work. Now, the point has been reached when those who have benefited from what the Government has done to stabilise the situation, including the banks, should seriously give something back to help these people.

It is not simply a matter of welcoming the debate. This type of debate is necessary and it should be repeated given what has happened to our economy in the past ten years or less. We need to learn the lessons whether in respect of relying on one particular industry - I am referring to the expansion of the building industry and its subsequent collapse - or otherwise. The other aspect is the entire collapse of the banking system. This is the type of debate that, rightly, highlights the wrongs of the past. Like many other people, I believe we can learn from these things. I believe we should take the banks into consideration such that mistakes are not repeated in future. More important, as legislators we should concern ourselves with the consumers or bank customers who are mortgage holders. Given the age we live in, any householder with a mortgage or any citizen of the State has access to information. One of the great assets of living in such a technological age is that people can compare interest rates on a screen as well as every other aspect of banking not only in the domestic market but throughout any part of Europe. Such developments have led to frustration among customers. I listened to Deputy McGrath last night. It is one of these things. Apart from unemployment within the household, the next most obvious problem that causes distress is the issue of a person who has a substantial mortgage specifically, given what this debate is about, one with a standard variable rate. Every Deputy will have experienced this in his or her clinics. There is a belief among those who have standard variable rate mortgages that they are being cheated in some way and that the thing is not right. As legislators, we should do something about it. I am with them in their point of view because this impacts on families very negatively. It causes dreadful distress and we have a responsibility in this area. People believe that there is an unfairness, especially given what has happened in recent times. Banks have been subject to a good deal of kicking by politicians and consumers, and rightly so, given what has happened. There is a great deal of distrust, a belief that there is an unfairness to the whole situation and a belief that banks have the upper hand all the time. I listened to some of the debate last night and some of the views were repeated earlier. Reference was made to the independence of the commercial operators, the banking institutions. As I said at the beginning we must learn about what got us to the point where we are having this debate tonight. We are having this debate because of what happened in recent years. We must not repeat these mistakes. I do not think we should and it would be wrong of us as legislators to do so. We have a duty to consumers and householders to ensure this does not happen. I was listening to the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, last night. I do not disagree with him but he made a particular comment on the Central Bank. I have my own view about the Central Bank, given its role in and around the period of the collapse. The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, made a particular remark last night and I am keen to refer to it because I have reservations about it. He stated: "The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector." If the extent of our control as a parliament over the Central Bank amounts to its ability to go chasing around putting restrictions on credit unions, it does not say much for the Central Bank. Perhaps we should be looking in other directions.

I concur wholeheartedly with Deputy Maloney. As Members, all of us should govern and act on behalf of the people, not on behalf of a chosen few. Again today we witnessed good news in our country and economy. More people are at work. There is an increase in the number of gardaÃ­ to be recruited. More funding is to be provided for public and social housing. These are positive developments that will affect the lives of our citizens in an influential way. We must ensure that we keep people in the family home. That is our task and duty. I encourage the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to meet the Central Bank Governor, Professor Honohan, to impress upon him the urgency of the situation and the need to give our homeowners a break. I welcome the fact that the Economic Management Council is meeting the banks. I hope they will put in place a plan to bring about a resolution in this case. The area of mortgages is one where we have a great deal to work on as a Government and as a country. We must ensure that the 0.25% taken off the variable rate and passed on by some banks is passed on by all the banks. I agree with Deputy Mitchell O'Connor. It is not good enough that in some cases this has not happened. This debate is important. It is a pity that in some cases the members of the Fianna FÃ¡il Party were not as concerned five years ago about our fellow citizens. As Deputy Maloney said, events could have changed and we would not be where we are today. Having said that, we need to have an honest debate on the matter. I agree with the Acting Chairman, Deputy Twomey, who is Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. Representatives of the banks should be before the finance committee of the Houses rather than anywhere else. They should be accountable to the elected Members, who represent the people. Clearly the banking sector has undergone significant change. Everything is not fixed and everything is not perfect. However, each of us have been contacted by people in our constituencies on the issue of mortgage arrears and the other issues being debated tonight. It is important for the banks to remember that it was the people who bailed them out and helped to salvage the banking sector.They now have an obligation and a duty to be responsible and to work with people. I mean that as a constituency politician who engages with banks every week. It is unacceptable for banks to think it is business as it was before, under Fianna FÃ¡il. It is not, and it can never go back to that way. Those in mortgage arrears and those experiencing problems require assistance. It is not acceptable that banks can attempt to profiteer at the expense of the Irish people. What we need, as we all agree, is a fully operational banking system. However, the banks must work with the people to keep families in their homes.

I compliment Deputy Michael McGrath for bringing the matter before the House. This is a very emotive issue, one that affects an awful lot of people throughout the length and breadth of the country. Many people have felt assailed in the past number of years and have been under the cosh when it comes to meeting their financial commitments, particularly their mortgage repayments. We know the argument about tracker versus variable rates and we know the banks have been in a bad place for the past number of years. However, we also know the taxpayer came to the rescue of the banks, rightly or wrongly, and the people made a huge effort to ensure the banks were able to trade again. I am not blaming anybody for what happened previously, but that was a huge sacrifice. Following that, it behoves the lending institutions to bear in mind that maybe not all of the borrowers were happy in the past five years either, that they may have gone through bad times and they may have had illness, lost their jobs or suffered various deprivations too numerous to mention. We have all dealt with constituents in this area. It is now time for the lending institutions to look again a little more sympathetically at their borrowers and to try to offer them something that is within their capacity to pay, for example, they might pay the norm of one third of disposable income without any moral hazard being incurred. At the same time, the banks should look at a packaging of the balance the borrowers may not be able to resolve at this stage until it is possible to do so. In that way, everybody shares the burden: the borrower shares the burden on the basis that he or she takes longer to repay the loan; and the lender shares the burden on the basis that it takes longer to have the entire loan repaid, and it may have to be restructured in another way. One thing is certain. The lending institutions must have due regard for the changed circumstances, which are as follows. Having made the huge sacrifices they have made, the people, the taxpayers of Ireland, need to be given recognition for these efforts. Without that recognition, the situation becomes intolerable. It goes without saying that in the time in which we live, if the banks were not to respond sympathetically to the situation, public confidence in the system would be eroded. I again thank my colleagues across the House for bringing the matter before us. I believe there is general agreement in the way Members on all sides of the House look at this issue. It is important that the lending institutions are in profit. That is their job, as they are supposed to provide lending facilities for the community at large. At the same time, however, they need to have regard to the needs of the borrowers.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	404	I am delighted to speak on the motion. First and foremost, everybody wants to see the banks returning to a healthy state and lending normally. While the Minister has no statutory role in regard to the passing on of interest rate reductions in regulated institutions, we need to be part of this discussion. The issue for many people is not the percentage of the interest rate but the principal of the mortgage itself. Like many others, I remember borrowing at 7.7% for three years on our mortgage. I am not saying anything particular about that except that we were able to borrow a sum that was manageable. We cannot legislate against people with tracker mortgages even if the banks are losing money and they dislike losing that money. It is a situation some people find themselves in and, if they can hold on and pay, that is good for them. The point is that interfering with interest rates that the banks set, while I can see the arguments for it now, might set a dangerous precedent down the road. For example, how do we decide who gets a reduced interest rate? Do we sidetrack issues of security and track record? If we did this, we would enter into a different area. Every week we see cases of people who have held on until now but who are in huge arrears and afraid of losing their homes. They certainly need to be dealt with. I urge the Government to consider using some of the 30 year money we are getting at just over 1% to finance solutions for these people. In fairness, they are in a very precarious position. There is an argument about someone who is not in arrears and is paying their mortgage at the moment paying a little less, but those in arrears have priority, in my view. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, is here to promote increased lending, in particular to SMEs and the agri-sector. While I am delighted it is here, I would be very interested to see how much of that money is taken up and how much finds its way down through the system. I will be watching it and we will see the metrics. The challenge is out there for the SBCI to be effective. At times, part of me wonders whether it should go through the pillar banks at all, although that is just my observation. We will see. Perhaps it will work. Banks need to be profitable. All of us who are banking want to be sure our banks can re-lend to us as we move along. I believe we should be looking at the European rules introduced in the middle of the euro crisis that govern countries' deficits and spending. Ireland is in a position where, due to the situation in the worst years of the recession, we are now being tied back to those previous years of low growth despite our high current growth. To conclude, this is a very worthwhile debate. I believe more of the recommendations of the Keane report should be implemented. People should be very cautious when banks start trying to mop up equity, as is the case at the moment, and are looking for renewed personal guarantees in regard to perfecting title. These are serious issues and we need to discuss them.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	405	To pick up where Deputy Barry left off, with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the Government counter-motion stresses the fact the Government has no statutory role in setting interest rates. I believe this was stressed by the Minister last night, and I am sorry I was not present to hear him speak. Nor does the Minister really have any role with regard to the interest rates set by banks which avail of the SBCI. The SBCI was effectively set up to get money to develop SMEs and the wider economy after a period of considerable decline and stagnation and, of course, the SBCI set up long-term funding agreements with the European Investment Bank, with KfW, the German state promotion bank, and with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. The result of that has been very little. I have had communication from constituents who, through all of that period, were wondering where they could get funding, and I had told them the Government was going to set this up and that I was led to believe it would be great. Today, I was told by one of those people that they were being offered an interest rate of 6.25% by Bank of Ireland. Therefore, for all of the Government's efforts and all of the cheap money the Government is getting and giving to Bank of Ireland, that is being passed on at just 0.25% less than normal. This is not only notwithstanding all of the cheap funding but also notwithstanding all of the security that comes with lending through this scheme. Richie Boucher came to the finance committee while I was there and made it quite clear what he thought about the elected representatives in this place. I do not know what more he could have done to express his disdain. Likewise, AIB is propped up by the State and is a failed banking institution to all intents and purposes. Another constituent runs a small business employing over 100 people in my constituency. In that case, the bank is not seeking to re-establish non-performing loans but to re-establish performing loans so it can get a better interest rate than the rate it agreed. This business, which employs over 100 people, is now being threatened with the putting in of a receiver to protect the bank's assets.There is no threat to the business whatsoever, but if it puts in a receiver there will be an immediate threat because people who do business with the enterprise will think they should not give it money or extend it credit. To a certain extent, the Government has had successes, but they have not revolved around tackling the banking sector.  That said, I have not heard too many solutions. The solutions contained in the Government amendment are pretty much the same as those proposed by Deputy Michael McGrath, although they have been cut, pasted and rejigged because we could not possibly acknowledge that he had a point. I thank him for tabling the motion, because we all know that after every election there is a monopoly of wisdom on this side of the House, which remains there until the next election.

We have others who suggest that we do not need a banking sector at all and that we should go back to the Old Testament times of usury, where we bury our shekels, dig them up and find they are worth exactly the same amount of money a couple of hundred years later. I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for highlighting this issue. I wonder what solutions there are.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	409	I commend Deputy Michael McGrath for tabling this motion and thank him for the great activity he has carried out on variable rate mortgages. What he said yesterday about a customer on a â¬200,000 20-year mortgage paying up to â¬1,000 a year more than the offer available to a new customer is worth repeating. Such a customer would pay â¬6,000 more than a family on a tracker mortgage of the same amount. Those figures show how unfair the situation is. The excessive variable mortgage interest rates charged by banks should be investigated by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, because we know that the data available show that the interest on the average standard variable rate mortgage in Ireland is 4.6%, which is well above the 0.05% rate charged by the European Central Bank. Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, has said we can say with certainty that Irish house buyers are being ripped off by banks, particularly when one considers that the eurozone average variable mortgage rate is 2.45%.  It is a great shame that high interest rates are paid by customers to keep the banks profitable, a matter raised by Deputy Donnelly today on Leaders' Questions. He stated that bank profits on individual restructured mortgages, including those where banks are seeking possession, should be capped at the expected level under normal payment of the mortgages. The issue has been raised on Leaders' Questions time and again and I hope the Central Bank will investigate and publish the true average variable rate in Ireland.  We need a thorough investigation into the argument that the current standard variable rates do no reflect market conditions. We should examine other European countries, particularly the low-interest-rate environment that exists in many eurozone countries. In Ireland, banks are still offering variable rates of over 4%. Excuses have been given in respect of Ireland's home loan rates, which are more expensive than in other European Union countries, with reference to the higher cost of funding and the effects of tracker mortgages. I do not think we can buy that. We need a radical change in the current Irish mortgage system. I hope that will happen. There was a time when banks would pass on the ECB rate cuts to all mortgage customers, including those on variable rates as well as trackers, but that is not now happening. Instead, the banks are putting the squeeze on variable rate customers. Variable rate mortgage holders are now on interest rates that are three times those being paid by tracker mortgage borrowers. AIB and Bank of Ireland charge their customers a 4.5% interest rate compared to the 1% to 1.5% rate paid by tracker borrowers.  We also know that anyone with savings has seen banks slash interest rates on deposits. There is a 2% difference in what most banks receive in interest on all of their loans and what they pay in interest on all deposits. It is now time this was dealt with. Central Bank statistics show that almost 240,000 mortgages were restructured by the end of 2013. The Simon Community has raised this issue in regard to homelessness, given the fact that 37,000 households are in mortgage arrears of two years or more.  I refer to returning emigrants trying to get mortgages. It is always said that they are very welcome to come home, but they have told me that one needs to go through hoops to get a mortgage and save a lot more. One can expect to pay interest on a mortgage at similar rates to Irish buy-to-let investors, something which is true of Permanent TSB and AIB. One such person was featured in The Irish Times. He had worked in the UK for 15 years and returned to Dublin in order to commute to the UK. He was told by one bank that he would need a 40% deposit - that is, â¬50,000 - to buy a home worth â¬350,000. A constituent in East Galway returned after seven years, having made a bit of money. He had a â¬50,000 deposit for a modest house worth â¬140,000. He was told he would need 50% of the price of the house because he was not an Irish resident. These are the kind of obstacles that are in the way of people. There is no flexibility, and I call on the Government to show some. People, particularly those returning home, want to plan for the future, but they will not do so while the banks are inflexible and the Government is not taking action.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	410	I commend Deputy Michael McGrath for raising an issue that is important to mortgage holders and the banking system. If the Minister, Deputy Noonan, who has joined us, told 300,000 people that he would give them back between â¬992 and â¬4,000, the benches would be full of cheering backbenchers rushing to the radio talking about the great Government. Yet the benches are empty. Those on the Government side who have spoken are confused as to the policy because there is a reluctance to act on this issue. Competition keeps coming back as one of the reasons variable rate mortgage holders are paying such rates. The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, referred to the lack of competition, as has the Central Bank. Deputies Barry and McNamara spoke about the potential options open to the Government to address issues regarding competition for variable rate mortgage holders, SMEs or bank customers generally. All of the options and the ability to do something about this issue, which is costing families thousands of euro, have been ignored.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland is in existence. Any new money being invested in the economy is good, but we reward the existing pillar banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, which are the criminals that have been found guilty of the offence we are discussing, for their guilt. We reward them for abandoning variable rate mortgage holders and SMEs. Deputy McNamara referred to facilities being changed and extra costs and interest being charged. That is happening wholesale, but we reward the banks and give them more money from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and move away from the chance to introduce an extra element of competition. For years, credit unions have said they want to enter the mortgage market. They are local institutions and community banking at its very best. It is the opposite of what we are rewarding, yet we will not allow competition into the mortgage market. It is no wonder our variable rate mortgages are as they are when there is a lack of competition. To proffer it as an excuse is one thing, but to ignore the chance of doing anything about it shows an ignorance of the issue.  The Government is pressing the banks to do something, as it stated in its amendment, and is the majority shareholder in AIB and a significant shareholder in Bank of Ireland, but there is a fundamental clash between that and driving that shareholding and profitability of the banks to try to sell them off at some stage. We want to increase profits, and to do that we need more bank income and the share price needs to be higher.At the same time, the Government has an interest and responsibility to mortgage holders who are being fleeced by these same banks. Somebody must act as the independent mediator and stand up for the interests of the people, as opposed to the interests of the Government's bank balance. Somebody must argue that there is potential to introduce competition to the market through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, credit unions or any other number of methods. We are not arguing that we should revert to something like the communist days in Russia, when the Minister responsible for finance dictated how the banks operated. We are asking why the Government has consistently over its term in office laid down in front of the banks. The Taoiseach today stated that he did not fix the banks for the bankers but we can look at the record. We changed the law to facilitate repossession of principal private residences. We facilitated and established an insolvency regime to give people a second chance that has, at its heart, a control mechanism by the main creditor, which equates to the banks. Bank representatives have not met the Economic Management Council to discuss this variable rate issue since 2012, and the credit guarantee scheme, which was introduced to assist small businesses in getting lending facilities, and which was flawed since its launch, has not been reformed despite promises from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, going back 15 months. We are coming to the end of another DÃ¡il session where the credit guarantee (amendment) Bill has not come before it for discussion. Where there is an awareness of the problem at a Government level, in fairness to the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Nash, there is no urgency in doing something about it. On many occasions we have seen reforms put in place that have fixed the banks for the bankers, and people who are using the banks' facilities and products are being left behind to wait without money that should be in their pockets going into those pockets. Nevertheless, backbenchers are standing up to wring their hands in pain and exasperation, as was the case when Deputy Michael McGrath put forward a motion on giving protection to the principal primary residence in an insolvency regime. At 9 p.m., those backbenchers will come here to vote for the Government's amendment to the motion, which amounts to a pat on the back. They will argue that they are worried about the issue but they will want to get out of here for Easter. I bet the Government will tackle this issue, along with the issue of protecting the principal private residence, as part of its election campaign. That is why there is such distrust and frustration about politics, as when somebody formulates a good idea, as Deputy McNamara stated, the Government will indicate that it will close down any of those efforts. When options are presented to the Government, as they have been by Deputy Michael McGrath on so many occasions, the Government will refuse to listen as it wants to act at its own time of choosing and take credit for that. The people overpaying for their mortgage do not have that luxury and cannot afford to keep paying rates way above what they would get if they were to buy the house as a new customer. The irony is if these people are forced to give up or sell their houses because they cannot afford to pay the mortgage, the people buying the house would have access to the lower variable mortgage rates now on offer. The person buying the house would have stamp duty paid by some of these pillar banks in which we are placing our trust and in which the Minister puts his constant support and empowerment. They are funding people who are buying houses from others by way of paying legal charges but meanwhile those who are paying excessive interest rates are left to whistle and suffer for the want of somebody standing up and providing a way out of this. People have put up with much and the majority of those who pay their mortgage do so with much sufferance and sacrifice. They are absolutely put to their collar in doing it. They can see advertisements from the two pillar banks in particular about being open for business and lending; the slogan is "we are backing brave". These banks are offering to pay stamp duty for people who can buy a house. This suggests we are at the beginning of a circle all over again, and that is not somewhere we want to go. I know the Minister does not want to go there and surely there is something to be said for the Central Bank acting now on promotional offers which have people being pushed and pulled in the housing market. Bank money is our money and it is paid by variable rate mortgage holders, and it is paying for the promotions like the payment of stamp duty. That must come to a stop, as we are going down a road again which we do not want to follow. I have lost count of the number of occasions that Deputy Michael McGrath has brought motions to this House in the past four years, starting with his first piece of business, which dealt with family home protection. As we come to the end of this DÃ¡il, we are again highlighting issues that are relevant to the Government Members. With those who spoke this evening, there was an absence of the usual backbencher scripts that were about having a go for the sake of it; there is a realisation among Government Members that there is a problem. They will all do as the Government asks and support this very watery amendment to the motion. We need action and if people are to regain faith and confidence in this House, as well as in those of us serving in this House, we will need action on these kinds of issues. We need people to see that DÃ¡il Ãireann recognises their trouble and the ultimate and inherent unfairness in a position where I or anybody doing his or her best in paying a mortgage would pay more than somebody who is now in a position to buy because of lower interest rates. People who have made sacrifices to pay for those lower interest rates now have to stand back while somebody else gets the benefit in accessing those lower rates. They can also use the benefit of those sacrifices to pay for stamp duty. DÃ¡il Ãireann needs to stand up and prove the Taoiseach right for a change when he said that we did not fix the banks for the sake of bankers. The record of this Government suggests significantly otherwise.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	411	In the Minister's absence, there was a telling number of Fine Gael and Labour backbenchers who came here tonight and last night and agreed with the Fianna FÃ¡il motion as tabled by Deputy Michael McGrath. I wonder would they do the same in the Minister's presence, as the benches are now empty. In any event, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and we will see if they turn up later to support our motion. I do not believe they will but the Minister should take time to read exactly what those Members said. We are in highway robbery territory with what the banks are doing with variable rate mortgage account holders. There is a man fronting the newest political quango who previously presented a television programme called "Rip-Off Republic", and unfortunately we are getting into that space again. The banks are engaged in ripping off this republic. I was astonished this morning when the Taoiseach stated proudly that the banks were profitable again and claimed this as an achievement. That sends out the wrong message. Speaker after speaker has argued that the Taoiseach and the Government cannot engage in managing banks and dictating variable interest rates. Surely he has an opinion about this, and if he does not, he has enough advisers around him who are paid well enough to form an opinion for the Taoiseach and have him articulate it. We need to see leadership on this issue. There is a critical mass of people who are stuck because of this problem. In his comments I would like the Minister to address issues concerning the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the abject rate of take-up in that service, as well as any proposal for the bank veto in negotiations. That is the elephant in the room for people suffering distress because of mortgage payments and who are trying to negotiate with bankers. Will the Minister comment on bankruptcy? The three-year term is not working and there is a farcical position as people have the ability to travel for less than two hours and go to the UK for this purpose. We all know plenty of people who have taken bankruptcy tourism into the nearest jurisdiction. We must seriously take that on board and revise the three-year term downwards. I recently had a private conversation with a fairly senior manager in AIB who is based not in Dublin or Limerick but Cork. I will not name that person but he told me that the game with banks and his bank in particular is to restrict lending of money to house and property developers. They are trying to manage the supply of units and particularly new units on the market. They want to force up supply of existing housing stock units available to the market. In fairness, "Prime Time Investigates" had a programme about this at some stage in the past two weeks and independently examined the issue. We must seriously consider that matter as the owners of AIB. The manager told me that privately.The evidence is out there and it was backed up by RTE's "Prime Time Investigates" programme. Like me, the Minister is from Limerick and he knows there was a repossession court hearing recently at which up to 219 cases were heard. I attended the court, as did Deputy O'Dea, and it was a sad spectacle. I compliment the registrar, Pat Wallace, on the way he dealt sensitively with the hardship of the people who presented before him, which was telling. He is doing a great job. Many issues flowed from it, in particular the number of people who presented at the court that day who had never heard of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI. Mr. Wallace asked every one of them about it. One of the support groups, the Irish Mortgage Holders' Association, had a table in the court on the day and were handing out their information. It was very telling that person after person who presented there with cases of the hardest type to listen to was unaware that the ISI was available. It was obviously because the financial institutions that brought them there had not pointed them in that direction. There are lessons to be learnt. If any message goes out from tonight's debate, it is that the Government must take the issue of variable interest rate reductions seriously. They must be passed on. Allowing the banks to profit on the backs of people at every hand's turn is not good for the country. We must take this on board and the Government must follow the lead of some of its backbenchers, if it will not follow the lead of Deputy Michael McGrath.

It is one of the major issues. There is not a public representative in the House who is not encountering mortgage difficulties in his or her constituency and clinic. The mortgage is one of the biggest outgoings of any family, and families are seeing the rip-off they are experiencing at the hands of the banks, particularly with variable mortgages. Nothing is being done about it. Nobody in the Government has taken the lead or got to grips with it, and it needs to be addressed. Nearly all cases of pressure from the banks and home repossessions that I have encountered have been in respect of variable rate mortgages. The banks have been grossly unfair in how they have been dealing with home owners. I will leave aside debts for business investments and farms, and deal only with home mortgage arrears and interest accrued. A large amount of interest has been piled on. When we go to the banks in real negotiations and go through the figures, fill out the forms, take into account incomes and outgoings, and try to come to some kind of arrangement, whether by extending the loan or something else, some of the banks have been intransigent. I have been negotiating along with one family for nearly three years, and only within the past few weeks, after highlighting the case at every level I can within the bank, have we got traction. There is no serious intent on the part of the banks. The banks give the line that the last thing they want to do is to repossess houses. In my opinion, they are going bald-headed for family houses belonging to people who have only one property. These people, through no fault of their own, perhaps due to the loss of a job or an illness in the family, are finding it extremely difficult to meet their mortgage repayments. Such people must decide which bill to pay first - the mortgage or, perhaps, a medical bill. These are challenging issues that face people and it is grossly unfair of the banks. It is high time the Government hauled the banks in to discuss the variable interest rates on mortgages. Although it is fine to see the banks saying they have returned to profitability, they are doing so on the backs of homeowners. My colleague Deputy Niall Collins mentioned insolvency. For the people I am dealing with and their difficulties, the legislation is not worth a hat full of crabs. We must be very straight with each other at Government level and around this House. The existing legislation is giving no protection to the people who have one property, a family home, which can be managed over a period of years. The Government must ensure the banks step up to the plate because families in this country are going through hoops left, right and centre. They have cut back on every possible expenditure. I have filled in forms with them to make cases to the banks and the same response comes back time and again. We must be very straight with ourselves in acknowledging that the existing machinery is not working and that we must challenge it in a significant way. On the business side, families that have had to restructure loans for a whole variety of reasons, who may have had an excellent interest rate over recent years and been significant banking customers, are being disregarded by the banks. These are people who have performing loans and who have worked very hard to ensure they honour their commitments. Yet the banks disregard their track records and the goodwill that should have been built up with them. Tonight, we are dealing with the variable interest rates and the way the banks are treating home owners, particularly those in difficulty who are being threatened with repossession. The machinery of the State is not working and is failing them, and it is high time the Government and this House took initiatives to enshrine the basic principle of retaining the family home. This should be one of the most important issues for us.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	413	I join my party colleagues in commending the motion proposed by Deputy Michael McGrath to deal with this very important issue, which, unfortunately, the Government has continued to ignore. The Government has refused to engage with the issue in any way that would bring meaningful relief to the 300,000 mortgage holders across the country who are on a standard variable rate and continue to be squeezed by the banks despite the fact that over recent years the ECB has reduced its interest rate to an historic low of 0.05%. As many speakers have pointed out, and as people on the Government side of the House have acknowledged, the Government continues to stand over, and refuses to address or challenge a situation in which the banks are charging a standard variable rate that is 2% higher than the average rate charged by banks in Europe and across the Border in Northern Ireland. Some of these banks are lending for mortgages within this State. Since 2007, while the ECB rate has decreased drastically, Permanent TSB's margin on lending has increased from 1.44% to 4.45%. This is a massive increase by any standards. If it happened in any other part of the economy, the Government would regularly jump up and down condemning it and saying it needed to be changed and that there must be intervention. We do not hear such comments from the Government and, unfortunately, the Government was all too willing to allow the banks to recapitalise themselves by charging existing standard variable rate customers grossly unfair margins. Because house prices have dropped so much, normal market rules do not apply and existing mortgage holders cannot seek to switch lenders. The Government has made no effort, through legislation or through engagement by the Economic Management Council with the banks, to ensure the banks bring forward products that allow people to switch mortgages that are in negative equity.Unfortunately, this has been a hallmark of the way the Government has dealt with the banks. Mortgage books were sold but the CCMA has not been legislated for, meaning mortgages sold on to vulture funds in many instances are not protected. Many people have unsustainable mortgages and are in danger of losing their homes but the Government has refused to remove the veto the banks have in respect of insolvency deals. The Minister has also presided over an insolvency service for the past there years which has clearly not worked with only 191 personal insolvency cases being finalised through that service. This is despite the Minister indicating the process would be kept under review. He refused to take on board the many concerns of people regarding how he established the service. Mortgage holders have suffered while banks have had the whip hand in dealing with them. It is long past time for a change of approach by the Government. The EMC at a minimum should seek to meet representatives of the banks and the banking sector regarding how they are addressing this issue. It is also long past time the Government admitted that the personal insolvency service is not working and introduced a service that serves the public appropriately. Unfortunately, the Minister has been content to oversee a situation where mortgage holders continue to be squeezed with the Government refusing to take action.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	414	I have listened carefully to all that has been said on the motion last night and tonight. I appreciate the fact that this standard variable rate charge by the various financial institutions in Ireland has a huge impact on individual households and has a constraining effect on their consumption of other goods and services. This interest rate issue was discussed here earlier during Questions and I gave a commitment to speak again with the Governor of the Central Bank and request that he considers how best to influence the banks to reduce SVRs charged to borrowers. A meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow. I also hope that the debates have shed light on the complex factors at play in the setting of interest rates by independent financial institutions. It should be clear that it would be simplistic to say that a ceiling should be set for mortgage rates and expect that there would be no consequences other than reduced rates. This seems to be accepted on all sides of the House. It is universally accepted that additional competition will have the effect of reducing prices to consumers, which in the mortgage sector means reducing the SVR. Lower rates are available for many standard variable mortgage customers if they switch lender. The banks must be convinced that they are at risk of losing customers if they persist with SVRs that are higher than the rate their customers could get elsewhere. People who are in a position to move mortgages should look into their options to do so. The CCPC website at consumerhelp.ie has useful information on the process. The website also contains comparisons of mortgage products and gives information on incentives that institutions will give to encourage switching. People can be put off by the up front and legal costs involved in switching but some institutions pay some or all of the fees involved and in some case the interest savings can be significant. I fully accept this is not an option for everyone but I would encourage people to take the time to explore it. The Government is playing its part by putting the structures in place to increase competition and ensuring there are no obstacles to new entrants to the market. The Government continues to work to create an environment conducive to the entry of new entrants primarily through the implementation of policies to promote economic recovery and employment creation but also through various initiatives to ensure that there is an adequate pool of credit to underpin the recovery. The Government's actions in this area include the establishment of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the credit guarantee scheme and the amendment to section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act to encourage new entrants into the financial sector. The Government will welcome any innovative products put forward by the banks as a way to address the situation in which we find ourselves but only insofar as they are sustainable. However, if the banks begin to offer mortgage rates at unsustainable, low levels as they did in the past, we could again be dragged back into a situation where their business model does not work, with all the trauma that brings for the economy and society. In budget 2012, mortgage interest relief was increased to 30% for all first time buyers who bought between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008. This is a significant saving and highlights this Government's commitment to support mortgage holders to pay their mortgage. It will continue to be available at this rate until the end of 2017 for those buyers. The Government is committed to applying downward pressure on mortgage rates by increasing and supporting competition in the market. This commitment was made in the statement of Government priorities 2014 to 2016. I will meet the Governor of the Central Bank tomorrow and I will request that he considers how best to influence the banks to reduce SVRs charged to all borrowers. As I indicated, this is a topic on which the House agrees and I will convey this to the Governor. Comparisons have been made, which were incorrect. For example, AIB offers a mortgage rate of 4.15% whereas its subsidiary in Northern Ireland offers a rate of 4.75%, 60 basis points higher, while Bank of Ireland offers a mortgage rate of 4.49% in Northern Ireland and 4.5% in the Republic, a difference of 0.01%. Many of the statistics produced by Opposition Members are just not correct.

I have also listened to the debate over the past two nights and there is a strong consensus, to which the Minister referred, that the views of the House should be conveyed to the Governor of the Central Bank. I welcome the fact that the Minister will have a meeting with him to convey that view. In the contributions by a number of Members, there was criticism of the tabling of the motion. This was done because of where we are as a society and the difficulties families face servicing mortgage debt and we would fail in our fundamental duty as an Opposition party not to highlight the fact that 300,000 people are currently enslaved to the banks. I do not know whether the Minister has recently put his house deeds under his arms and headed off down the high street of one of our cities looking to switch his mortgage but it is not as easy as he outlined. There are many hidden costs to switching and people must also overcome the fear factor of approaching another lending institution to go through the entire process of assessment and approval prior to final sanction. They must carry hidden costs relating to legal and engineering fees and all that flows from them. It is not as easy as putting a copy of the deeds under one's arm and heading into a financial institution. There is little competition between the major lenders on our high streets and negligible savings can be generated by moving lender. The Minister has to convey our strong views to the Governor of the Central Bank. It is reasonable for him to expect a good response because the Governor previously stated, "It is reasonable to ask whether having underpriced lending so badly in the early years of the millennium, we could end up overpricing it". He has also stated that the mortgage pricing structure for variable rates is unacceptable.We have to realise we cannot have a situation where we are asking one borrower, who has a variable rate mortgage, to subsidise another borrower, who has a tracker mortgage. That is what is happening in effect. The banks are the ones responsible for the tracker mortgages. They went out to the markets thinking there would be free funds forever and decided to peg themselves to the ECB rate and lend accordingly. We now have an ECB rate of 0.05%, so tracker mortgages are loss leaders, as referred to by other Deputies. Asking another family to subsidise that tracker mortgage is simply unfair. It is unfair that there could be a difference of â¬6,000 between two mortgages in excess of â¬200,000 depending on whether the family is on a variable or a tracker rate mortgage. The Minister must be strong and forceful in this. The banks cannot consistently say they are doing everything in their power to address this issue. If they were, there would be more competition and they would be more sympathetic to the variable mortgage holders, who are under huge pressure. The Minister referred to it himself. It is negating the capacity of people with variable mortgages to consume other goods and services, which would be of benefit to the Minister and to society more broadly in terms of getting spending power back into the retail sector and the wider economy. There are many good reasons we should do this. We should not always be in awe of the banks and feel that we owe them something. This Parliament and this country owe the banks nothing. It is the other way around. The idea that we can wax lyrical and boast that our banks are back in profitability is fine, but there are 300,000 families, many of whom are well below the waterline in terms of financial comfort. They need a break. It is now the turn of the banks to make a repayment for what was done to assist them in the crisis they went through.

The Minister should not underestimate his authority.

It is the fairest thing to do. The idea that we will consistently ask one family at the top of the road to subsidise the family at the bottom of the road because of bad lending policy by the banks, which thought they could access funding forever and a day from the ECB and peg it to that, is shocking. That is where we are. The cost of funds has been referred to. This is not only in the context of mortgages. Every day of the week, small businesses are in with banks, negotiating loan extensions and looking for term loans and funds.

We know, even from the evidence presented by the banks to the committee, that it is no longer 2%, but they consistently tell people who are trying to secure funding for small businesses that the cost of funds is 2%.

We then find officially that the blended cost of funds at Permanent TSB is 1.74%. At Bank of Ireland the cost of funds was 1.15% in June 2014. At AIB it was 1.64%. We know that it has come down substantially since 30 June 2014. The banks are high on the hog again and they are fattening themselves up nicely. We have to be strong in determining that at this stage they have an obligation to assist the many variable rate mortgage holders who are under great pressure. We should not ask families to subsidise other families because they entered into tracker mortgage contracts with banks. For all these reasons, I urge the Minister to act quickly. There is no doubt that the Insolvency Service of Ireland is not functioning as intended, as has been referred to by Deputy Collins. This is happening day in, day out in courts throughout the country, where banks are seeking repossessions. It is not working. If it were, we would not have this level of repossessions presenting to the courts in the first place and there would be greater knowledge of the many people whose homes are being taken off them. One would have assumed they would at least have been aware of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, but we find time and again that families who are under great stress and are losing their homes are not aware of the mechanism that was set up by the Government to address this issue. This is an indication of failure of policy. The insolvency service had better pick up its game a bit and make itself more visible to hard-pressed families. On numerous occasions, we, and Deputy McGrath, have raised the issue of the bank veto. This Government is beholden to the banks, giving the bank all the cards.

We must accept that the idea that the banks have the veto on determining what is a sustainable solution flies in the face of everything we have learned over recent years about the banks. Their only abiding interest is their balance sheet, their profitability and moving their salaries back to where they were.

It is morally wrong that those who were thrown a lifeline are taking the lifeline from those who are now drowning under unsustainable debts. Any answer from the banks other than acceding to what I hope will be a strong request by both the Minister and the Governor of the Central Bank to the lending institutions would be shameful.

Listening to all the Deputies, including from the Government side, I am not sure anyone spoke against the motion. Perhaps it will be passed unanimously in a few moments. Nonetheless, the important thing is that the issue be dealt with comprehensively. The bottom line is that tabling the motion and the debate on it have resulted in some progress, in that the Minister has organised a meeting for tomorrow with the Governor, Mr. Honohan. I welcome that.

Everyone in this House stands behind him in delivering that message. If he does not want to deliver it in a forthright and strong manner in public, which I understand, I expect him to do it in private. He should not be afraid to bang the table and deliver the message on behalf of the people and their representatives that standard variable rate mortgage customers are the forgotten group and it will not be tolerated any longer. The rates they are paying are exorbitant and unacceptable. The second piece of progress we have is the statement by the Taoiseach today in the DÃ¡il that the banks would be brought before the Economic Management Council for the first time in almost three years. I hope the opportunity will be taken to address this issue as well as a number of other issues. Over recent nights, dozens of individual stories have been conveyed to me, my colleagues and, I am sure, every Deputy in the House. The impact of very high standard variable mortgage rates on families is there to be told. I have been struck by the stories I have been told in the past 24 hours or so. Much has been made of the health of the banks. The banks are on the road to recovery and are largely healthy again. AIB and Bank of Ireland, combined, made â¬2 billion in pre-tax profits in 2014.Any suggestion that the poor banks have no capacity to help people on standard variable mortgage rates simply does not stand up to scrutiny. The Government's approach to the banks seems to be to fatten the calf as much as possible, take it to the mart and flog it to the highest bidder and to hell with the consequences. There are consequences which are represented by many people who are paying outrageous, rip-off, standard variable mortgage rates at this time.  When I looked at the Government motion, I have to say I despaired. The mood has improved since as a result of some of the commitments given by the Minister and his own language. We had the scenario yesterday where the Government put forward a counter motion calling on itself to continue to apply downward pressure on standard variable rates. In my relatively short time in the House, I have never heard the likes of it. The Government felt the need to call upon itself to take action on an issue. Presumably the Government agrees wholeheartedly with the Fianna FÃ¡il motion but, of course, it will not merely accept the motion in the manner in which it has been put forward. I thought it was the best one for a while that the Government should call on itself to take action on an issue.  The issue was well ventilated last night and tonight in terms of the cost of funds which are at an historic low. The bottom line is that people understand a variable rate moves in line with the market. It moves in line with market conditions and market conditions have never been better. The ECB rate is virtually at zero, 0.05%, and the wholesale interbank environment is extremely positive for the banks. We all know that people who are saving in the banks are getting virtually nothing in interest. The banks have never had access to as much cheap money as now and there is no justification for the manner in which they are gouging standard variable rate customers. We are witnessing discrimination against existing customers vis-Ã -vis new customers because a number of banks have reduced their rate for new customers but not for existing customers and that is simply unacceptable. I hope the Minister will make it clear to the Governor of the Central Bank tomorrow that the bank has a very strong role in terms of consumer protection and we want to see that role vindicated and applied.  The Minister referred to north of the Border and highlighted the standard variable rates there. I agree that the variable rates advertised are in line with the rates in the Republic but what he omitted to say is that they offer very strong discount deals for a number of years. When those deals expire, people switch their mortgage to another bank because they have a genuine switcher market open to them. AIB, which the Minister quoted, is advertising variable rates as low as 2.75% and fixed rates as low as 2.79% in Northern Ireland.  I wish the Minister well at his meeting tomorrow. The real measure of the outcome of this motion and the debate we have had is for the banks to announce a round of variable rate cuts which will benefit not just new customers, but existing customers, and that the scandalous practice of targeting this singular group of customers, involving 300,000 people who are paying firmly over the odds for their mortgages, to be brought to an end. Hopefully, our motion will have contributed to that result.
