Members are aware of the calls on both sides of the House for debates on human rights in Colombia and other places. However, there should be debate on human rights on this island given the continual abductions of people by paramilitary organisations that are taking place on the streets of Belfast and Derry.

The Sinn Féin Party likes to lecture us about human rights violations in Colombia. However, it does not want to deal with its own human rights violations on this island. We should debate this matter. It is time for both Governments to come down hard on political parties that are inextricably linked to paramilitary organisations. Those parties must decide, once and for all, whether they are on or off the peace train. The Leader must respond to this suggestion.The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation should be reconvened so that Nationalist Ireland, on both sides of the Border, can make a clear and unequivocal statement about the ending of violence in this country. I am sick to the teeth of some political parties lecturing this State about corruption and human rights violations when their own political buddies are involved in these activities day in, day out. This must be brought to an end. We all had to sit back and bite our tongues for the past ten years or so while one political party decided when to move on the issue of violence. It is time for us to speak with one voice and demand a complete end to acts of terrorism and paramilitarism as soon as possible. That statement should come from this House.

Could the Leader please extend the speaking time on No. 4 from 12 to 15 minutes? I would like to hear people from all sides of the House participate in that debate on a non-party basis. It is an issue we need to consider.We have had several discussions recently about the need for a proper, structured approach to immigration. We need also to respond to the Taoiseach's comments last night. This is a time when wise heads should prevail and Members should know precisely what the Taoiseach said last night. He did not talk about preventing people from entering the country or working or travelling here. He spoke about an adjustment to welfare. Those of us who want a clean and open procedure regard it as appropriate to consider this, particularly given the free travel area between the United Kingdom and Ireland. This should be done sensitively but in any discussion we should make it quite clear that nobody has suggested anything other than free travel — excuse me, I mean freedom to travel, not free travel——

This is not an anti-immigrant policy. These matters must be properly structured. I have frequently criticised the Government's immigration policy but this would not be a basis for further criticism.With respect to our colleague from France in the Visitors Gallery, every time I go to France I find Irish meat cheaper there than in Ireland. Two weeks ago Irish beef was selling there at €5.80 per kilo and two months previously I found Irish lamb selling there for 50% less than in Ireland. The IFA has been canvassing on this issue recently, but what is the solution to this problem and how can we support the Irish farmer?
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I extend my sympathies to those affected by the tragic accident at the weekend involving Dublin Bus, some of whom were from my area, and I welcome the investigation which CIE will hold. Without pre-empting that, however, we need to debate the issue of traffic and transport needs and what action is needed, particularly by the Minister for Transport. This involves several stakeholders, apart from Dublin Bus, including the Minister, Dublin City Council and other parties, all of which should come together to co-ordinate action on public safety measures contingent on the continuing work on Luas. Further safety issues will arise when Luas is running. I would like an opportunity for us to debate this in the House and for the Minister to let us know what is happening in that regard.I would also like to join in the welcome to our visitor.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I seek an update on the proposed debates on one-off rural housing and job creation in the BMW region. I seek clarification on the progress since our successful debate on the Irish language. We had a very magnanimous debate on having Irish included as a working language in the EU. Has the Minister been contacted and is he working on behalf of this House? We must send the clear message that this House serves a democratic function. This House gave cross-party support to the call for the use of Irish as a working language in the EU. As this has not happened to date, we must show a sense of purpose on this matter.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I draw the Leader's attention to an advertisement in newspapers in recent weeks advising people not to mail items to Tuam or Drogheda because of the postal dispute in those towns. It is appalling that such an advertisement should be placed in newspapers. In the case of Tuam, there is a question of inadequate accommodation and now there is a huge backlog of mail. Thousands of items have to be dealt with, which is affecting not just business and commerce, but people have missed hospital appointments because of the dispute. The Minister should investigate this matter and if necessary a third party should become involved to resolve the dispute, which is causing considerable hardship to those in the area. The Leader, as a former Minister with responsibility for this area, might have some ideas as to how to help. The bottom line is that people should not take the advice of An Post and stop sending letters. It is discrimination if people cannot use the service in Tuam and Drogheda. People should continue to use the service and I hope we can get resolution of the dispute as quickly as possible.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I support Senator Brian Hayes in welcoming a human rights debate involving the situation in Colombia. As people refer to those known as the Colombia three who admitted to having been found using false passports in an area controlled by the FARC guerrillas, I am sure we will remember the Colombia 2,000 — the 2,000 people kidnapped, tortured and held for ransom by the FARC guerrillas.I support what Senator Tuffy said and express my sympathy to the people killed and injured in the terrible bus accident. I join her in calling for a debate on road safety. I warned against the building of chicanes and the erection of railings in the city before people were killed. These are dangerous and we need to reconsider them. The debate should include discussing speed limits, an issue that was ventilated very intelligently on all sides of this House. Perhaps the Leader could confirm that the Government is proposing to introduce legislation to permit British commercial companies to be involved in operating speed cameras. That is something we should think about. The British experience has been negative in this regard. Since commercial companies have begun controlling these cameras, there has been a negative impact on road safety.Perhaps the Leader will pass on my next point to the Minister. We have previously discussed the question of inconsistencies in speed limits, mentioning in particular the Stillorgan dual carriageway. There is now a new speed limit of 30 mph, reduced from 40 mph, on the dual carriageway. It was found that this had not even been done properly within the council's own by-laws and all the fines resulting from this new speed limit have now been reversed by the courts. If we are to have respect for the law, we must see consistency in speed limits.We have been monitoring events in the Middle East. I ask for another debate on this matter, particularly as the International Court of Justice in The Hague is considering the issue of the wall being built by the Israelis. The British have said the wall is illegal but added an extraordinary second clause to the effect that it is wrong to go to the court. How morally bankrupt must one be to maintain these two incompatible ideas? During the last terrible suicide bombing near Liberty Bell Park, people got under the wall through a sewer. It does not even work. I would be grateful if we could continue to monitor the situation in the Middle East, particularly in the matter of the wall.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Sixteen Senators wish to speak in less than a quarter of an hour, so they will have to be brief if I am to include everyone.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I support Senator Brian Hayes's request for a debate on law and order in Northern Ireland, which is now clearly the central problem for the peace process. There is no point in attempting to park it somewhere else. The parties must get together and deal with the matter. I do not want to minimise any of the current problems, but any transition from violence to democratic politics will be bumpy. Most historical precedents have resulted in civil war. However, we need to discuss this matter. At its core is the acceptance of decent arrangements for policing, which should take the vigilantes out of the equation.Senator Tuffy referred to the appalling accident in Dublin city centre. I do not want to add to the sorrow of the relatives, but one thing did strike me which the Leader might pass on to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Perhaps he could explain the report that the drivers could not be interviewed by the Garda until they had been given permission by counsellors employed by the bus company. I can imagine that people may be too traumatised to be interviewed, but the decision on whether the police have access to witnesses should not be made by people employed by an organisation which may be in line for criticism.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	42	Some time ago I called on the Leader to invite the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to the House for a debate on the BMW mid-term review. According to that document, there was an underspend of €680 million in the BMW region because of bureaucracy and red tape. The debate should include discussion on rural development and rural infrastructure. It is important to promote economic growth in rural areas. This is an urgent matter because time is running out if we are to spend this money. Perhaps the Leader will consider inviting the Minister to the House.A typical example——
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I mentioned that time is short. The Senator has called for a debate.

#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to come to the House for a debate on Saturday's horrific accident. There should be a co-ordinated plan for traffic management incorporating South Dublin County Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council and including input from the Minister. This is a serious matter which has not been dealt with in the past despite calls to do so. It is a matter of road safety. Everybody knows that many of the out of service buses speed along the road when they do not have to stop at bus stops. This aspect must also be examined, in addition to the problem of speeding and the ramp system. It is time we had traffic calming measures and traffic management. I ask the Leader to have a debate on this matter.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Given that a historic two day international conference on the AIDS epidemic is taking place in Dublin Castle, it would be timely for this House to debate the issue. According to the United Nations, 1.5 million people infected with HIV will be brought to the doorstep of the European Union by virtue of the forthcoming accession. In the first half of 2002, the National Disease Surveillance Centre diagnosed 207 cases in this country. Just because this issue is not being discussed, there appears to be a general attitude that it does not exist. However, it is a global epidemic, as Kofi Annan pointed out, and I would appreciate it if the Leader could organise a debate on it.

I support the call for a debate. Apropos of Senator O'Toole and the price of beef in France, in Wolfe Tone's memoirs there is a discussion about what to feed the soldiers when they landed in France. Carnot replied: "They have very good beef in Ireland. Let them eat beef."

#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I concur with the previous speakers about traffic safety. Obviously, we must await the results of the inquiries into the tragic accident last Saturday but I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport to come to the House to discuss road safety, particularly the problem of overcrowding on buses. People get buses from Heuston Station after their train journey and the buses are generally overcrowded. I am aware of one lady who recently asked the conductor if it was safe to travel in the bus. His reply was that if she was not happy, she could leave the bus. Luas will soon be operating in our streets in addition to the buses and cars so it would be timely to have a debate on road safety. Senator Leyden spoke about our successful website, ripoff.ie. He should also have mentioned the rip offs in the new passport charges, which have increased by €32.

It might be helpful to invite the Minister to the House to update Members on the current position. We should also invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach to the House to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland. In recent days, the Taoiseach made a fundamental pronouncement on the two precepts that are required to advance the Good Friday Agreement. One is decommissioning and the other is the veto mentality of some sections of the Unionist community in implementing the agreement. This is a good time to have such a debate. Finally, in my contribution in support of a call for a debate on human rights last week, I said the island of Ireland should be part of that debate.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Congratulations were extended to everybody in the Department of Foreign Affairs on the important conference on HIV-AIDS which was organised as a major part of Ireland's EU Presidency. I support Senator McCarthy's call for a debate on the issue. The opinion at the conference, which I had the privilege of attending yesterday and this morning, was that it was five years too late to start debating this issue in eastern and central Europe. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who put a great deal of work into this conference, could lead a useful debate on the terrible catastrophe occurring in countries which will be members of the European Union in a few months.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I join Senators Tuffy, Norris, Hayes and others in the expression of sympathy to the families of those affected by the horrific bus crash at the weekend. Two investigations into the accident have been set up and two reports will be produced. As a member of the transport committee, I have asked the chairman that the committee considers those reports when they are issued. I ask the Leader to consider waiting until such time as the reports are available before we debate the issue. Obviously, that is a decision for the Leader but it would be wrong to jump to conclusions. Dublin Bus has had an exceptional record on road and bus safety. Some of us had the opportunity to listen to a son of one of the victims on radio this morning. Although he showed great emotion at the death of his mother, he was careful and knowledgeable about the accident and did not want to jump to any conclusions. He clearly showed his support for the drivers and the company involved. We should wait for the outcome of the investigation before we debate the issue.

This is important in the interest of confidence in the system. If it has set its face against a full audit trail, it should, at the minimum, provide for it in a representative number of constituencies. Otherwise, we will not instil confidence in the system among the public. We welcome the amendments the Government made and the provision for the secrecy of the ballot with regard to anybody wishing to spoil his or her vote.

I have just returned from London where I noticed that crash barriers are installed at any point along routes where a large number of people congregate. Saturday's accident need not necessarily have been caused by a bus. A truck or car could have careered or swerved into the group. We should learn from the experience of others and take their solutions on board when looking at overall road and transport policy.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to the House for a debate on education with regard to three aspects in particular. First, the Higher Education Authority advised the Government in the past month to introduce legislation to enable some universities to leave the State system and be privatised. The Government will have to consider this matter and a debate on the issue should take place in the House before the Government's views are cemented in some form or other.Second, one of the innovations of recent years was the leaving certificate applied. However, there are reports that it is now under threat because the support the Government should be providing to ensure it works is not forthcoming. The Minister spoke about the matter in the other House the other day but it is something we should debate here soon.Third, the Catholic Schools Parents' Association has reported that it is concerned that a number of schools charge fees for assessment, which is against Department rules, and that they continue to hold assessments for places even when those places do not exist. Parents are right to be upset about this as it is in breach of Department rules.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I was taken aback by the recent survey which showed that many hospitals have a severe shortage of radiographers, especially in light of the plans outlined for MRI scans and BreastCheck. I am concerned at the statement by the director of the only radiographer training college in the country that it took a long time to get funding for extra places. It appears that the Department of Education and Science funds the college, but the director feels the Department of Health and Children should contribute to the training of radiographers. The director has written to the Department of Health and Children seven times over the past two years but has not got a reply. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to explain why this position still pertains and what he intends to do about it.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I noted my colleague, Senator Leyden's remarks about the price of newspapers. He did not mention the Roscommon Herald or the Roscommon Champion.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	61	They are good value.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Does Senator Phelan have a question for the Leader?

I urge the Leader to arrange a debate on this matter as soon as possible with the Minister for Agriculture and Food. Two different parts of the farm advisory board, Teagasc, are recommending conflicting levels for the application of the nitrates directive. We should discuss this matter as soon as possible with the Minister before a decision is finally made.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I support my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes, in his call for a debate on human rights and law and order, especially in Northern Ireland.Will the Leader invite the relevant Minister in to discuss the proposed exorbitant price increase in the cost of passports? Passport costs for children aged three to 16 are being increased by 110%, which is a great deal more than the 11% being spoken about. We need to deal with the matter of stealth taxes which the Government continually introduces.

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I support the call for a debate on funding for the BMW region. The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, said in the House last week that funding would not be available for the BMW and western regions until the bigger projects in Dublin are completed, such as the Luas and the port tunnel. In view of this fact, I support the call for a debate on this matter.I also support Senator McHugh in regard to a debate on one-off housing. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government made a big song and dance about new legislation for one-off housing, which is anxiously awaited. Will the Leader inform us when it is proposed to bring the legislation before the House?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, raised the issue of Northern Ireland, in particular the lack of human rights there and that Sinn Féin be called to account as to whether it is on or off the peace train. He also called for a renewal of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. His points were well made. I hope it is possible to renew the forum.Senator O'Toole asked if we would extend speaking time from 12 to 15 minutes for the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. I will extend the speaking time for the main speakers from 12 to 15 minutes and Members may share time.I expect the Taoiseach's views on social welfare will be elaborated on shortly. We all accept this must be done sensitively, but neither do we intend to leave ourselves wide open with every other country taking steps in this regard.Senator O'Toole also referred to Irish food being cheaper in France. I loved Senator Mansergh's intervention which we will come to. If all those years ago in Wolfe Tone's time they were talking about it being better and cheaper, plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose. Things remain the same.Senator Tuffy expressed her sympathy on behalf of her party and the House on the recent Dublin Bus tragedy. She called for a debate on traffic co-ordination involving the Minister, the Department, Dublin City Council and other stakeholders in the debate.Senator Leyden is in high dudgeon over the price of certain newspapers and asked why some have increased while others have not. Yes, well——
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Allow the Leader to reply without interruption.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Senator McHugh raised the issues of one-off rural housing and job creation in the BMW region, and he asked for a debate on the status of the Irish language. The Senator's party took the first step in debating the issue of recognition of Irish as an official language of the EU and other parties joined with it. Many Members signed the petition that appeared in The Irish Times on Saturday. We will invite the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, to the House to debate the issue.Senator Kitt raised the unofficial postal dispute. This would make a good Adjournment debate matter. Unofficial disputes are difficult to manage. Senator Norris spoke about the FARC guerrillas in Colombia. He also sought a debate on traffic management, including issues such as calming measures and the inconsistency in speed limits. The Senator also asked that debate on the Middle East be renewed.Senator Maurice Hayes raised the issue of Northern Ireland. While he was not being critical, he also wondered why the bus drivers involved in Saturday's accident could not be interviewed by gardaí without permission from counsellors. We do not know enough about this incident and it is difficult for us to take a stand. We utterly regret the carnage and injuries caused, and the heartbreak for the families of those involved. We may have a full debate on this when the reports are published.Senator Bannon raised the issue of rural development in the BMW region. While I have discussed this with the Minister, we have not been able to schedule a debate on it. Senator Ormonde sought a debate on transport, with particular reference to road safety and co-ordination. Senator McCarthy raised the issue of AIDS. As Senator Henry said, while it may be late, debate on the issue is certainly worthwhile. Having seen the number of countries that have sent delegates to Dublin for the conference, it is evident that people are really wakening up to the issue. The Department of Foreign Affairs should be congratulated for holding this conference. It will be one of the highlights of our Presidency.Senator Mansergh raised the issue of human rights and sought a debate on it, incorporating Northern Ireland. Senator Ó Murchú raised the issue of the Irish language and seeks a debate with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. As transport spokesperson, Senator Dooley expressed sympathy on behalf of Fianna Fáil Members to all those involved in the accident on Saturday. Joe Duffy is running a show on RTE Radio One about the incident. I suppose it is an interesting thing to do. However, we cannot jump to conclusions until we find the result of the reports.Senator Coghlan raised the issue of electronic voting. We await developments on this. Senator Hanafin called for a debate on road traffic. Senator Quinn raised the applied leaving certificate syllabus. I would be sorry if this syllabus faltered as it is a terrific course that has given great leverage to students. I did not know that charges for assessment were applied.Senator Feighan has pointed out the severe shortage of radiographers and is seeking a debate with the Minister for Health and Children. This would be a useful Adjournment debate matter. Senator John Paul Phelan raised the nitrates directive. However, this issue falls between two stools. While it relates to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Agriculture and Food has a huge input into it. We are seeking to have someone take up this issue and debate it in the House.Senator Cummins raised the 110% increase in the price of passports. We had a little subterranean comment among ourselves. It is not exactly a human rights issue, since if one is fit to go abroad, one is fit to pay for one's passport.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Senator Burke wants a debate on the BMW region, something for which he has asked several times. Before he says that I would not take up his point, I am doing so and endeavouring to have the Minister attend. However, we are entering into a very onerous legislative round over the next three weeks. Time for debates will, therefore, be limited during that period.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I move:That the proposal that Seanad Éireann resolve that section 17A (inserted by section 2(1) of the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act 2001 (No. 3 of 2001)) of the Diseases of Animals Act 1966, (No. 6 of 1966) shall continue in force for the period ending on 8 March 2005, be referred to the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food, in accordance with paragraph (2) of the Orders of Reference of that Committee, which, not later than 4 March 2004, shall send a message to the Seanad in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 67, and Standing Order 69(2) shall accordingly apply.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Before we commence, I remind Senators that they may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment, who may reply to the discussion thereon. Each amendment must also be seconded on Report Stage.Amendment No. 1 in the name of Senator McCarthy is related to amendment No. 13, and amendment No. 14 is an alternative to the latter. Amendments Nos. 1, 13 and 14 will be taken together, by agreement. Is that agreed? Agreed.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 7, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:"(3) As soon as may be after the passing of this Act, the Minister shall prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas, a statement as to the implications of introducing a system of registration of guardianship orders and agreements.".We debated this amendment at some length on Committee Stage. It is about putting a system in place for a register of guardianship orders and agreements. Many organisations representing birth fathers have called for such a provision.The Minister made a case for not accepting the amendment but I wonder if she has had an attack of conscience and changed her stance since returning to her constituency. I look forward to her response, particularly if she accepts the amendment.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I second the amendment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	85	As previously indicated, an tArd Chláraitheoir has no function in the registration of guardianship orders granted by the courts, or in the registration of statutory declarations of guardianship, nor would it be appropriate that she or he could have such a function. The Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides for a declaration by the mother and father on the guardianship of the child. This is a private contract between the parents with regard to guardianship, custody or access arrangements relating to their child. Such a declaration may be made before a peace commissioner, a commissioner for oaths or a notary public. The 1964 Act made no provision for the registration of such declarations and the schedule to the statutory declaration contains a warning that the declaration is an important document and should be kept in a safe place. As indicated on Committee Stage, I expect that parents would lodge such important documents with their solicitors.A father may also be appointed as guardian of a child by order of the court. These orders form part of the court records. Other statutory declarations or important private contracts relating to families, such as separation agreements, are not registered by an tArd Chláraitheoir, nor would it be appropriate for him or her to maintain such a register.Following the debate on Committee Stage, I made further inquiries as to the arrangements that apply in other administrations. I confirm that in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the recording of similar agreements is not a matter for the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages. The registration of these agreements fall to be maintained by the courts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland such agreements may be registered in the Book of Council in Session maintained by the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland, which has responsibility for judicial registers.I have brought the issues raised during the debates in both Houses to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand that the provision of a register of guardianship will be considered in the context of the forthcoming family law Bill. I am not, therefore, in a position to accept amendments Nos. 1 and 14. Amendment No. 13 deletes the text inserted by amendment No. 28 on Committee Stage.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I wish to move amendmentNo. 14.

He should have spoken on the amendments before the Minister replied.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	88	That was not clear. I wish to make one contribution on this group of amendments.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Only the proposer of an amendment may speak after a Minister has replied. I will allow the Senator to make one contribution, although it is not provided for in procedure.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. This is a bad day's work. The Government's decision to override the democratic view of the House, as expressed last week on Committee Stage in amendment No. 28, is bad for democracy and this House. The purpose of the amendment tabled by my colleague, Senator Cummins, and I last week was simple, namely, to include in the civil registration code for the first time a framework for registering voluntary guardianship agreements. If the Government had accepted the amendment, it would have gone a long way towards accepting what unmarried mothers and fathers are seeking. This issue does not favour one side of the equation over the other, but is in the interests of all unmarried parents who seek this change.I regret that the Minister has introduced amendment No. 13 in an attempt to negate a section the House inserted in the Bill. If the Seanad is to have any role as a reviewing Chamber, it should be to ensure that issues such as these are debated, as this one has been, and to stand by the decisions at which it arrives. The Government's attitude in refusing to accept the democratic will of the House on this matter is a retrograde step.My amendment, which I tabled knowing that the Minister intended to do this, gives the Minister the power to introduce this section at a time of her choosing, following consultation with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, instead of deleting what we inserted last week after extensive debate. The Minister stated that other countries have dealt with this in a different way. I accept that, but I suggest that we do it in this way because a guardianship agreement between an unmarried father and an unmarried mother is a very important life event for those people. It is very important for a child to know that this very important document is in a safe place, is registered by the State and is open to recourse by the courts or anyone else in terms of where that document has been registered.Let me put the view, received by my office at 1 p.m. today, from Treoir, the group that represents unmarried parents in Ireland. Regarding a register of joint guardianship agreements, Treoir believes strongly that the appropriate place for such a register is the Registrar General's Office with the records of significant life events because, in effect, the guardianship of married parents is registered in the Registrar General's Office through marriage registration and it is appropriate that guardianship agreements be registered there and not in the courts.The debate in the House last week and previously was an excellent one but, before we vote on this matter, my solution is to leave the section that was inserted in the Bill last week and to give the Minister absolute discretion to introduce the section when she wishes, in consultation with her colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, rather than railroading in a Government amendment negating the section in question. I ask her to rethink this and not to use the Government's majority in the way it is normally used because I believe there is considerable public support for making sure that guardianship arrangements are part and parcel of the civil registration code. I make that plea to the Minister even at this late stage.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Before I call Senator McCarthy to respond to amendment No. 1, does the Minister wish to reply?
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Do I understand that other Senators who wish to speak on the amendment cannot do so?
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	93	No. Latitude was allowed because the Senator sought clarification. The Minister may reply if she wishes.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	94	There are a number of issues. First, the issue of guardianship is not defined as a life event. That may be disputed. It is an important event, but it is not a life event. I have indicated that I will encourage my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to introduce a register in the courts because that is where the court orders are available and there is no point having two different registers.The Senator spoke about guardianship in the context of unmarried parents. Guardianship is also an issue for people who are separated, divorced, previously married and so on. It is also a matter for the courts to determine in very difficult and often tragic circumstances. Equated to that is the aspect, on which I differ from the Senator, of marriage and guardianship. Marriage entails joint custody. Therefore, guardianship is an issue that does not arise——
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I never referred to that. I am talking about unmarried mothers.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	96	——except in circumstances where people are separated, divorced or whatever. This is the best way, administratively and every other way, to deal with the issue of guardianship. I am not against the public pronouncement of guardianship. I feel this is best suited to the courts. On the negating of amendment No. 28, as the Senator is aware in his mischievous little way of proceeding with that wry smile——
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	97	It is nothing mischievous.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The amendment reflected something that did not exist in the first place. The previous amendment would have to have indicated that there would be a register of guardianship. The Senator's amendment would have reflected what he would like to see within that guardianship register. As the register does not exist, then it would in itself be negated. It is on that basis that we are pursuing this amendment once again.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I concur with Senator Brian Hayes. The Minister's response is inappropriate to say the least. It is a sad day not alone for this House but for democracy in general if the Minister persists with this course of action as she quite evidently plans to. There were many valid calls for a system of guardianship registration to be introduced and this is a retrograde step. The Minister has been congratulated quite rightly for introducing this legislation. I am of the view that there are situations and there have been opportunities which could have been taken up by the Minister to improve this legislation and to create better law and a better system of registration overall.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I will clarify the procedure on Report Stage of a Bill. A Senator may only speak once on Report Stage before the Minister is called upon to reply. Only the proposer of the amendment can contribute after the Minister has replied. I hope that is clear. We did bend the rules a little.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	101	On a point of order, if a number of amendments are grouped, we may speak to that group.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Yes, before the Minister replies. A Senator may speak once before the Minister replies.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 15, line 38, after "State" to insert "or to which section 26 or 27 applies".The register of births covers all children born in the State and there are two additional cases of children born outside the State, those children born to Irish citizens permanently living abroad where there is no system of registration or where if there is, a birth certificate may not be available; children born on Irish vessels coming to or from the State or born to members of the Garda Síochána or Defence Forces serving abroad.The provisions for registration of foreign births are created by sections 26 and 27 of the Bill but in the Bill as published, neither of these provisions applies to stillbirths. Following an amendment by the Labour Party in the Lower House, the Minister introduced an amendment to permit the registration of foreign stillbirths in a similar manner to the registration of foreign births. In attempting to explain this earlier, I succeeded in confusing all and sundry. The position here is quite simple. Section 13(1)(a) refers to “a register of all births occurring in the State or to which section 26 or 27 applies (which shall be known and is referred to in this Act, as the register of births),”. There is provision in sections 26 and 27 for the registration of stillbirths, however if this amendment is not agreed to, it makes a nonsense of the amendment taken in the Lower House because the words “in the State” have not been amended in section 13(1)(b). I feel very strongly that this is an amendment that will increase and improve the ability of the Bill to create good law.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I second the amendment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	105	There is still a confusion on the part of the Senator on what was decided in the Lower House. The section provides for the establishment of registers of births, stillbirths, adoptions and foreign adoptions, deaths, marriages, decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity of marriage. Sections 26 and 27 provide for the registration of certain births and stillbirths to Irish citizens domiciled outside the State where there is no system of registration of births or where copies of certificates cannot be obtained. These sections provide for the recording and registration of certain other births occurring outside the State.I understand the purpose of the Senator's amendment is to mean that stillbirths should be treated in a similar manner to births. My view is that sections 26(2) and 27(6) meet the requirements of the amendment proposed by the Senator. In my view, what the Senator wants to establish has been established in sections 26(2) and 27(6). I do not disagree with the Senator but in my view, what the Senator wishes has been adequately covered by the amendment I accepted in the Lower House. It would serve no purpose to accept a further amendment.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I agree with the Minister that provision is made in sections 26 and 27. However, to give effect to that, section 13(1)(b) must be amended to include the same wording as section 13(1)(a), namely after “State” to insert “or to which section 26 or 27 applies”. If this amendment is not accepted, the anomaly is quite obvious. The Bill in itself becomes contradictory which, to say the least, is bad law. The implication in the two sections would be that stillbirths could only be registered in the State as opposed to the system of foreign registration or registration of foreign stillbirths. More significant confusion could arise as to which register of foreign stillbirths registrations should be entered on. There are separate births and stillbirths registers and under section 13 the stillbirths register is confined to the State. It might be argued that a foreign stillbirth should be registered on the births register.If the wording in this amendment is not accepted, it will make a nonsense of section 13(1)(a). The sole intention of this amendment is to improve the Bill from that viewpoint. As the Minister has quite correctly said, the provision exists in sections 26 and 27 but if the wording is not included in section 13(1)(b), it contradicts the wording of section 13(1)(a), thus leading to bad law. The contrast is there for all to see.Section 13 refers to sections 26 and 27 but the wording is not there with respect to this issue. It is inherently contradictory and I believe it will lead to a degree of confusion as to the correct register to be used. The Minister needs to accept this amendment. Initially the Bill did not provide for this but as the amendment was accepted in the Lower House, such provision exists. In order to give full effect to it, technically speaking, section 13(1)(b) will require to be amended accordingly.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	107	In order to be clear, the Attorney General has advised me that the Bill contains provisions to do exactly what is desired. Subsections (1) and (5) apply to the stillbirth of a child as they apply to the birth of a child. Accordingly, references in those subsections to birth or births shall be construed as including references to stillbirth or stillbirths, respectively. This clarifies what the Senator wishes to be clarified under section 13(1)(b), namely that the register will include all births occurring in the State, births and stillbirths. This subsection clarifies that when this legislation refers to births, it equally refers to stillbirths. I hope that clarifies the situation, given that I am not a lawyer.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	111	It is. Section 27(6) deals with that issue; it states "occurring outside the State." Section 13 just deals with the issue of registers.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	112	That is correct. As the interpretation of section 13(1)(b) now stands, it refers to a register in the State. However, if the wording, including the references to section 26 or 27, is applied, it does exactly what the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has just said and will inextricably link the wording of section 13(1)(b) with sections 26 and 27. The literal meaning of section 13(1)(b) is “in the State” and does not extend to outside it. Unless the reference is there, it does not necessarily link it to sections 26 and 27.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	113	The entire section, including the amendment, refers to recording registrations of certain other births occurring outside the State. Section 13 covers births in the State while section 27 covers births outside the State. As that is construed as including reference to stillbirths and births respectively, it covers the issue the Senator is raising. Section 26(2) of the Bill states:Subsection (1) applies to the stillbirth of a child as it applies to the birth of a child and, accordingly, references in that subsection to birth and births shall be construed as including references to stillbirth and stillbirths, respectively.Sections 26(2) and 27(6) indicate clearly that when speaking of a birth of a child it shall be construed as including the stillbirth of a child and that there is no differential in both the registration of births and stillbirths.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I do not wish to be pedantic on this issue, but as a result of accepting an amendment in the Lower House on section 13(1)(a), section 13(1)(b) is rendered incorrect. It strictly confines, as the literal meaning interprets, a register of stillbirths occurring in the State. If the same logic that applies in section 13(1)(a) is applied to section 13(1)(b), then it is exactly as the Minister has said that by including the words of this amendment “or to which section 26 and 27 apply”. It concerns the literal interpretation of that section. The Minister accepted a Labour Party amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil. The change this amendment proposes renders section 13(1)(b) incorrect. There are two similar events. One finishes “in the State” and the other “of to which sections 26 and 27 applies”. It is a literal interpretation. The Bill will return to the Lower House and the Minister should look at accepting this technical amendment. Otherwise, it will lead to bad law because section 13(1)(b) is inherently contradictory as it currently stands.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I do not agree with that determination because section 13(1)(b) states:a register of all stillbirths occurring in the State (which shall be known and referred to in this Act as the register of stillbirths).Section 13(1)(a) of the Bill states:a register of all births occurring in the State or to which section 26 or 27 applies (which shall be known, and is referred to in this Act, as the register of births).The Senator is attempting to establish a register of foreign stillbirths, whereas section 27 deals with the recording and registration of births outside the State. Births on this occasion, because the definition has been clarified in two subsections, shall be construed as referring to stillbirth as well. It is more than adequately covered on the basis of the recording of that information.

The Minister accepted a similar amendment in the Lower House and it basically renders the Government amendment redundant and nonsensical and will lead to bad law. It is the literal interpretation of section 13(1)(b) that is at issue. It is not so much the mechanics of the implications of section 13(1)(b), but the literal interpretation that will lead to bad law as it stands.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 20, line 22, after "registrar" to insert "if required to do so".The purpose of this amendment is to make the Bill more user-friendly by providing for people who cannot attend the registrar or when both people cannot attend. It reflects technological advances because today some of this information can be processed electronically or by other methods which do not require people to be present to register a birth. This is more realistic and more compatible with Department policy, if the advertising campaign is to be believed. I appeal to the Minister to look favourably on this amendment.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I second the amendment. We do not want people blocking places if there is no need for them to be there.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I did not quite grasp that comment. We already discussed this matter extensively. When the time comes for Senator McCarthy he certainly will be most vociferous in ensuring he participates in the registration of a future voter and will rise to his obligations as a parent, as many of us have done already. Given that the registration of a child's birth is such an important life event, it is the duty of the parents to do it. It is not too onerous for the parents to do this on the basis that the large maternity hospitals will now facilitate it, moments after the birth if necessary. A child will now be able to be registered in any of the registrars' offices. I appreciate that children may not be born in the place where the parents may reside.If we allow this to be optional, it would undermine the importance of the registration of a child and would take away from what is a very important event. The restrictions that existed heretofore were an inconvenience to many people. We have now extended the time in which it is possible to register the birth of a child, which should facilitate the registration. The legislation provides that a qualified informant can facilitate a person who cannot register a child due to ill health. We have done our best to facilitate any difficulties that might arise.On this basis, we should not water down the requirement for the parents to be present to register the child. I doubt whether there have been many requests for the parents not to be there except in the exceptional circumstances addressed in the legislation.

In page 20, after line 45, to insert the following:"(4) Where a child is born in a vehicle or vessel in transit from one place to another and the precise place of birth cannot be identified, the place of birth to be recorded shall be that of the townland or civil parish concerned, or other identifiable geographical area concerned, or if that cannot be ascertained, either the place of departure of the vehicle or vessel or the place of arrival, as may be specified by the informant,".While the Minister gave a satisfactory response to this issue on Committee Stage, some Senators still have some concerns.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I second the amendment. I have concerns about the provision and I seek clarification from the Minister. A child born on a vessel might end up being registered in the place from which the vessel departed, for example, Cherbourg. Is there any occasion on which a child born in Irish waters on a foreign vessel cannot be registered as born in Ireland, for example, if the child is born coming into Dublin Port on a foreign vessel? I am not clear about section 27. Is a child born in Irish waters on a foreign registered boat always registered in Ireland? Is a child born on an Irish vessel outside Irish waters always registered as being born in Ireland?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I want to make sure I clarify this matter.

Where the birth of a child born on a foreign registered vessel in Irish waters is registered depends on the domicile of the parents. One reason we are anxious to have this legislation passed is that a child born on an Irish vessel will be registered as Irish.

On Committee Stage, I pointed out a case where a child was born in an ambulance and the registrar used a distance between two towns as the place of birth. The Minister pointed out that the birth certificate can be amended afterwards which is satisfactory and the amendment was withdrawn on that basis.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 22, line 16, to delete "The father of a child" and substitute "A man".I thank the Minister for helping me to understand the rights of alleged and unmarried fathers in the context of this section. On Committee Stage she clarified the matter very eloquently as follows. A father in Irish law is presumed to be a father if he is married to a mother and they have a child. However, he is not presumed to be a father outside wedlock unless he can prove he is the father or if the unmarried mother accepts it. Does the Minister agree?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	138	Yes. In the case of a married person, the man who is married to the mother must declare otherwise.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I am addressing cases where parents are not married. I thought I was being helpful to the Minister and I will try again. Section 22(1) as currently drafted states:The father of a child who was not married to the mother of the child at the date of his or her birth or at any time during the period of 10 months before such birth shall not be required to give information under this Act about the birth.My amendment proposes to delete "The father of a child" and substitute "A man" so the section would state:A man who was not married to the mother of the child at the date of his or her birth or at any time during the period of 10 months before such birth shall not be required to give information under this Act about the birth.While I believe this clarifies the section, there could be some difficulties as has been pointed out by the noises off-stage. We need clarity on this matter. Regardless of whether this amendment is agreed, the big issue, as pointed out on Committee Stage, is the opt out clause. Following the enactment of this Bill, we need to send a positive signal to unmarried parents that fathers should have their names registered on birth certificates. While the vast majority of fathers do so, it is nowhere near 100%, which should be achievable.Articles 8.1 and 8.2 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child indicate we have entered clear international commitments to do what we can to ensure that children born outside wedlock know their parents and particularly their fathers. I would hate to see some men use this section as an opt out clause. While I know the Minister is of the same mind, I ask her to reply to my helpful amendment, which I thought would clear up the matter before the experts loaded in their advice. We must listen to them also.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I second the amendment.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	141	It has been brought to my attention that this wording is not the same as the wording in section 49 of the Status of Children Act 1987, which states "no person shall as father of the child be required to give information concerning the birth". Would it not be a good idea to keep the wording the same? The Bill is a very good one, but in these sections there are differences in wording compared to previous Acts which contain similar provisions.
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I accept the Senator's point, but if the change resulted in the wording, "A man who was not married to the mother of the child at the date of his or her birth," this would give rights or exemptions to any man. There is no presumption of relationship if the term is changed from "the father" to "a man". While I accept what the Senator is trying to achieve, this amendment does not achieve it.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	143	Interestingly, under current law there is no such presumption.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	144	One is "a person" unless one is married. There is a presumption in law that one is the father if one is married to the mother, except when that presumption is taken away. I have thought long and hard about this and I have been convinced by quite a number of arguments. We have discussed this many times. I would like to see the Senator's objectives being met but how should we go about it? We are talking, first, about the right of a child to know who his father is, and second, about encouraging the two parents to register. The more I thought about this and the more questions I asked, the more complicated it became. I see where the Senator is coming from, but Senator Cox is right — introducing the word "man" would not have the intended effect because of the current presumption in law.I considered the issue of the compulsory naming of a father and the registration of a father's particulars. Sometimes, unless we have all the facts we cannot make valuable judgments. In the birth registrations of January 2004, for example, in Erinville Hospital in Cork there was 91% registration of fathers; in Limerick Regional Maternity Hospital there was 93% registration; in Tralee General Hospital there was 95% registration; and in Sligo General Hospital there was 94%. This indicates high participation of fathers in the registration of their children.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Let us go beyond this and imagine it is compulsory for the father to register. What difficulties would result from this? It would put an onus on the State to determine paternity. One can imagine the mess that would create. Also, prima facie evidence of paternity would be required to register a birth where the parents are not married. Hospitals, GPs and midwives could not act as qualified informants as they would not be in a position to name the father. If they did name the father without the necessary evidence it would leave them and the State open to litigation. As Members know, we facilitated registration through the qualified informant.Surrogacy and donor insemination would present particular difficulties. In cases of under age pregnancies, incest and rape, if the father was named the State would be obliged to take criminal proceedings. I have come to the conclusion that all we can do as Members of either House is to actively encourage fathers to put their names down on the birth register. If there is anything we can do, in terms of providing information, to encourage fathers to register we will consider that. We have done this on the basis of facilitating people as much as possible in registration.The reason we do not have the figures requested by Senator Henry is that we only have statistics for hospitals in which there is electronic registration, which has not yet been set up in Dublin. Once that is available, I will forward the figures to any Member who is interested.Although I agree that Senator Brian Hayes's aim is laudable, this amendment may not be the right way of dealing with the matter. This is an example of how a number of issues raised on the floor of the House, although very sensible, could lead us into some strange and difficult legal tangles. On the basis of the information I have I feel that compelling fathers to register may not be the best way forward. Rather, encouragement, not only within the registration process but also within any other process such as parenting, is the way forward.

There is an interesting argument about married couples. There is a presumption that the husband is automatically the father of his wife's child, but this may not always be the case. Some people have even suggested that husbands should also be required to declare their paternity.I understand the dilemma faced by the Government, but I do not want section 22, which runs counter to the spirit of the universal declaration on the rights of the child, cited by a small minority of unmarried men who want to opt out of playing a full role in the lives of their children. Every child in the State, whether born in or out of wedlock, has a right to know who his or her parents are. However, it must be remembered that those parents, male and female, have the responsibility of raising the child. We have a responsibility to say that publicly, despite our reservations about this section.

In page 49, line 40, after "divorce" to insert "or makes an order recognising a foreign decree of divorce as being valid in the State".This amendment provides for a comprehensive list of divorce decrees to cover circumstances where the court may accept a foreign order as being valid in this country.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	159	We have had the opportunity to discuss this topic. Section 59 provides for the registration of decrees of divorce and nullity of marriages granted in the State. The civil registration service, except in specific instances regarding births, stillbirths and deaths, records actual vital events occurring to persons within the State. Events occurring in foreign jurisdictions fall to be recorded in the country in which they occur. The provision to record all decrees of divorce and nullity granted by the courts will provide a complete record of all such events from a future date. The Courts Service will act as registrar in respect of all future decrees of divorce and civil nullity. These are considered a vital event as they have serious legal and social implications for the status of individuals. The provision will facilitate persons granted a divorce in the State who wish to remarry. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to accept these amendments.

In page 50, line 23, after "person" to insert "concerned, as the case may be,".The purpose of this amendment is to insert after the word "person" the words "concerned, as the case may be". This is intended to improve the drafting of the Bill. It is in line with my previous comments on making the legislation reader friendly.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	162	The section provides for the introduction of a new appeals system to provide a formal means of redress regarding the registration of life events. The addition of the extra wording as suggested is considered unnecessary. It might in fact confuse, rather than clarify the matter. I am satisfied that the drafting of the provisions in the section complies with best practice. As a consequence, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I move amendment No. 19:
In page 51, line 40, to delete "may" and substitute "shall be entitled".I propose this amendment because of the large number of people here who may refuse to allow people to look through registers which might be important to them. I know the Minister and Senator Mansergh said that the word "may" will be taken in law as meaning "must". We can compare this with section 35 which uses the phrase "shall be entitled to search". Those who have charge of the registers have a great deal of power. I fear that if we do not include the words "shall be entitled to", we will end up with people being officious and denying others the right to make searches. It is not a big issue to ask for the words "shall be entitled to" to be included.

The provision of this section will not pretend to prohibit the searching of the indices to the registers. The purpose of the provision is to allow for the effective organisation, management and future development of the service. On that basis I am not in a position to accept the amendment.

In page 65, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:"Forename(s) and birth surname of father of deceased.Forename(s) and birth surname of mother of deceased.".I am delighted the Minister has agreed to accept this proposal. I thank the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations for its work and observations on the Bill. The certificate will be more comprehensive as a result. I commend the Minister on accepting our amendment.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I second the amendment. Genealogists of the present and future generations will be thankful to the Minister.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	170	Contrary to what was said about me, I listen to everything said. Part 5 of the First Schedule sets out the required particulars to be registered in respect of a death. Having considered the views put forward by Senators on Committee Stage, I decided to bring forward my own amendment.A key concern of the modernisation programme is to ensure that all deaths are registered. To address this, a new death registration form which combines the medical certificate of cause of death and a death registration form has been introduced. I am also conscious that the State should not place any additional burdens on a family or next of kin at the time of bereavement. That said, I recognise the importance of information to genealogists and family researchers at home and abroad. Having been convinced of the merits of including the forename or names and birth surnames of the parents of the deceased in the death register, I brought forward the amendment.
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I thank the Minister and her officials for the work and effort in communication in which they engaged with all those involved with the legislation. As we said on Second Stage, this is important legislation reforming some laws that date back hundreds of years. Unfortunately, because of a misunderstanding at the time, certain things were alluded to in regard to the amendment which the Government changed again today, which was lost in a vote on Committee Stage. It is unclear as to how one vote can be won and another can be lost. If the Opposition won——

#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I accept the advice of the Chair. It has been an interesting debate, particularly on Second and Committee Stages, which dealt with societal issues of parental responsibility, especially that of fathers, whether they are men, Adams or whoever. I hope this discussion will continue and we will see a change in the culture surrounding parenthood, to which I look forward.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I join Senator Cox in thanking the Minister for presenting this excellent Bill to the House. I hope the amendments that were accepted will improve the Bill further. It is regrettable that the democratic wishes of last week were not accepted, but I am pleased the Minister accepted some Opposition amendments. The Bill is important and the debate has been a healthy one to which speakers made a significant contribution. They spoke most eloquently in regard to a number of amendments. I look forward to the Bill serving us for as long as the legislation it replaces, going back over 100 years. I compliment the Minister.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I join in the glowing tributes paid to the Minister and her officials. It was a complex and sensitive Bill and the Minister deserves to be congratulated on its introduction. I still hold strong views on section 13(1)(b). I shall go to my grave maintaining I was correct in that regard.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The legislation is a step in the right direction.Discussion on the Bill gave rise to a more serious issue — how the House does its business. Three weeks ago a technical flaw was discovered on Committee Stage of the An Bord Bia Bill. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, agreed to accept the amendment but informed me that he could not accept it in the House and it would be dealt with in the Lower House. This gives rise to a broad range of questions in regard to that Bill. However, I thank the Minister and her officials for the many happy hours of debate we had on this Bill.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	180	When one looks at the list of Acts which have been repealed one sees how important the legislation is and the Minister and her officials deserve great praise in regard to it. Naturally, like Senator McCarthy, there are also things I would like changed. I was sorry that ethical bodies such as the Association of Irish Humanists were left out along the way as solemnisers of marriage. I never worked out why they were put to one side because they seemed to think they would get in there.The Minister clarified an enormous amount in the debate. I am still not sure, because the Minister said she did not know at the end of Committee Stage, why the particulars of marriage are not entered in the Bill in the First Schedule. I suppose those are things that we will understand in time. I congratulate the Minister and her officials on this enormous body of work in straightening out and clarifying for us many difficult areas.As the Minister said, we gave her questions to bring to other colleagues as they did not fall within her area of responsibility. I look forward to hearing from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the near future.

It enhances the credibility of the democratic process and of the Seanad when, as a result of debate, some amendments for which good arguments have been made are accepted. In a spirit of cross-party co-operation, and because he asked me to, I thank the Minister on my behalf and that of Senator Brian Hayes and Senator Henry for accepting the amendment at the end. It will enhance the genealogical aspect of register. I congratulate the Minister on overcoming hesitations on that issue.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	182	It is a pity none of the speakers live in my constituency. I thank the Acting Chairman and the staff of the House for facilitating us with the debate. I particularly thank the Members who participated in the consideration of the Bill. I wholeheartedly agree that the process by which we examine our legislation is forthcoming. It gives an opportunity to enjoy good debate and banter and to put across a number of important points of view.I am happy to take on board the considerations and concerns of both Houses. I hope we have been able to produce better legislation. I thank my officials who have spent a number of years on the preparation of the legislation. It has taken much consideration, consultation and amendment prior to its publication.I am sure that whichever Minister amends this legislation, he or she will do so on the basis of change in society. Parts of the legislation we are amending date from 1844; I hope it does not take as long again. We are better to have had the discussions and deliberations that have taken place in the House.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 5, lines 23 and 24, to delete "IN PART".This is a technical amendment. When I raised the matter last time, the Minister explained the situation, but the Labour Party's legal adviser still thinks there is a problem with the wording. Perhaps the Minister has re-examined it.

As I explained on Committee Stage, the European Communities (Burden of Proof in Gender Discrimination Cases) Regulations 2001 give effect to Council Directive 97/80/EC on the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on sex. The regulation applies to gender discrimination cases taken under both the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Maternity Protection Act 1994. The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 revokes part of the regulations regarding maternity discrimination cases and will re-enact the relevant provisions. The Equality Bill 2004 revokes and re-enacts the relevant provisions of the regulations regarding the Employment Equality Act 1998. The inclusion of the phrase "IN PART" is therefore currently required while both Bills are still before the Oireachtas.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Perhaps I could seek clarification. I could not find the relevant place, but apparently another part of the Bill refers to policing the regulations in full. If that is stated somewhere else in the Bill, there is a contradiction. Perhaps the Minister might examine the question when the Bill comes before the Dáil. That is what I have been told, although I could not find the reference.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I will have a look at it.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 9, to delete lines 3 to 8 and substitute the following:"(c) it shall not be lawful for an employer to require an employee compulsorily to retire from his or her employment on reaching a particular age if on reaching that age the employee is able and willing to continue in employment.”We had a very long discussion about this on Committee Stage and I will not go into all the arguments again. However, I feel that it is very important. If I had to pick out one amendment, this is the one I would have tabled. I feel very strongly that this is the next area of discrimination that must be tackled, both in the workplace and in other venues. We should not discriminate against people on the basis of age.I was discussing the issue afterwards with someone, who asked what would happen if one had a 90 year old pilot. That response shows the level of discrimination, since one could have a 30 year old pilot with problems. There is an idea that, just because one is older, one is past it, and the reality is very different. As I said, we are losing out on people's contributions to the workplace and society in general. People are living long and healthy lives, and we must address that sooner rather than later. I would like the Minister to take on board the point made in the amendment as soon as possible.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I second the amendment.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I have a great deal of sympathy with Senator Tuffy's point of view, as I indicated on Committee Stage. For the record, section 34(4) of the Employment Equality Act 1998, which represents the current law, provides that:Without prejudice to subsection (3), it shall not constitute discrimination on the age ground to fix different ages for the retirement (whether voluntarily or compulsorily) of employees or any class or description of employees.The framework employment directive does not require the removal of this provision and a consensus emerged during consultations that the issue goes beyond employment equality policy and has broad socio-economic and industrial relations implications, which is the difficulty we face in terms of taking action on the matter today.Compulsory retirement ages are a feature of many types of employment set over time. In many cases, they have been arrived at after negotiation and collective bargaining. In the case of private sector employment, the removal of existing agreements or arrangements with respect to compulsory retirement age is a matter in the first instance for agreement among the social partners. With respect to public service employees, however, in line with his recent Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance recently published the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004, which includes provision to remove the compulsory retirement age for new entrants to the public service and will, I understand, be debated in the Seanad tonight.The purpose of the new subsection 3(c), which this amendment would remove, is to allow an employee who wishes to continue in employment after normal retirement age to do so, in the event that the employer agrees, by allowing the employer to offer a fixed-term contract without fear of a case of discrimination on the age ground being taken by other employees. By replacing section 6(3) of the 1998 Act, the upper age limit of 65 years is removed in order that employees over the age of 65 years will have all the other protections from discrimination offered by this legislation.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 9, between lines 15 and 16. to insert the following:5.—The Act of 1998 is amended by inserting the following section after section 7:‘7A.—The Minister is committed to ensuring the adherence to, the application and enforcement of the principle of equal pay for equal work in all circumstances.',".I welcome the Minister of State. While I was not present to contribute during the debates on Second and Committee Stages, I recall that a similar amendment was proposed by my colleague, Senator Terry, on Committee Stage. Having read the discussion of the amendment between the Senator and the Minister of State, it is clear that our concerns have still not been addressed.A well established, straightforward principle of equal pay for equal work applies across the EU without provisos. Some of the provisions in the Bill give reason to query whether the Minister is fully committed to this principle. The statutory based discrimination provided for in section 24, to which I will refer later, is one such provision.The purpose of the amendment is to state in black and white that the Minister is committed to the well established principle. During the debate on Committee Stage last week, the Minister of State stated that Senator Terry's view on the matter was aspirational. A clear statement of our view on equal pay for equal work should not be aspirational — nor would it fit under an aspirational heading — and should be applied in practice. The Minister of State's reply on Committee Stage left much to be desired. I look forward to his reply in this debate.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	195	Senator Phelan wants my support for the principle of equal pay to be stitched into the legislation. On this occasion, he will have to be satisfied with it being placed on the record because I am advised that it is not appropriate to write the principle into primary legislation, nor has it been, to the best of my knowledge, anywhere else.As I stated on Committee Stage, the proposal is aspirational in character and, therefore, not appropriate to primary legislation. However, the provisions of the gender equality legislation introduced in the 1970s were enhanced and extended by the 1998 Act to include eight additional discriminatory grounds. Specific provision was made to enshrine the entitlement to equal remuneration across all nine grounds. Moreover, strong equality promotion and enforcement structures were established in the form of the Equality Authority and the Equality Tribunal. Both of these statutory bodies are now fully functioning and are having a real impact in terms of implementing the principles laid down in the legislation.The Senator referred to section 24. I do not accept that this section represents any sort of statutory underpinning of any form of discrimination. It is, as I will argue when we reach it, merely an enabling provision to encourage employers to employ people with disabilities.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The new section replaces the provision under section 16(3) of the Act of 1998 as regards the duty of employers and persons engaged in vocational training to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities to enable them to access and participate in employment or training, as applicable. At present, the requirement on employers is limited to the provision of special treatment or facilities where this gives rise to no more than a nominal cost.Arising from article 5 of the framework employment directive, it is proposed to extend this requirement on employers to the taking of a range of appropriate measures, except where they would impose a "disproportionate burden". The criteria against which "disproportionate burden" is to be determined are set out in the new section 16(3)AC. For the purposes of this provision, appropriate measures are defined in paragraph (b). As I stated, we agreed to take the matter on board on Committee Stage and I am doing so now in the appropriate format.

In page 13, between line 10 and 11, to insert the following:10.—Section 16 of the Act of 1998 is amended by inserting the following subsection:‘(7) Nothing in this section shall operate to discharge an employer from his or her obligations to provide full and equal access of employment to persons with disability.'.".This amendment inserts a new subsection in section 16 of the Employment Equality Act 1998, section 9 of which goes some distance towards relieving employers from their duty to adapt their premises for disabled people. The section goes too far in this regard and the amendment proposes to ensure that section 16 of the 1998 Act cannot be used to justify inaction by employers. It is essential that employers' premises and other public buildings and premises be adapted to facilitate people who have disabilities.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	199	While I have a certain sympathy for the sentiments expressed by the Senator, the position is that, under the Constitution and in accordance with a decision of the Supreme Court, one cannot oblige an employer to take any measures to accommodate people with disabilities if they would impose more than a nominal cost. In this legislation, we have been able to move away from the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution with regard to employment legislation because of the EU framework employment directive, which allows us to shift from "nominal cost" to "disproportionate burden", but no further.Unfortunately, the amendment goes further and, as such, is impossible to accept. In the first instance, I do not believe the Attorney General would agree to it and it would also be unconstitutional. As I stated, the EU framework employment directive enables us to go further than the interpretation of the Supreme Court in this context. Legally, however, we cannot go further than provided for in the legislation.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 15, to delete lines 19 to 32.The Labour Party has resubmitted this amendment because the original legislation allowed section 25 to apply only in certain limited circumstances, which are listed, whereas this legislation encompasses circumstances other than those prescribed. The Minister of State argued on Committee Stage that the section, as amended in accordance with his proposals, would narrow the circumstances in which section 25 will apply. I fail to see how this could be the case, given that it does not remove the circumstances under which it is permitted to discriminate for reasons of gender. Surely, therefore, the legislation will broaden the section by shifting from the particular to the general. Logically it must broaden it. I see the reason for this section, but it leaves openings. People looking at that will see that there are many other possibilities that could be covered by it. Previously it was quite clearcut in that only certain categories were listed and if one was outside those one would not have a case to make. I would like to hear the Minister's response.

The original legislation was section 25 of the Employment Equality Act 1998. This was an excluding section. It excluded certain activity from the scope of the legislation. What we are doing here is replacing section 25 in its entirety with a section which excludes certain activity, in effect, the same activity, from the operation of the legislation. It is our intention, and I hope we have carried it into reality in the wording, to exclude it in a much narrower way. Section 16 of the Bill replaces in its entirety section 25 of the Employment Equality Act, permitting discrimination on the gender ground where a person's gender is an occupational qualification. Article 2.6 of the gender equal treatment in employment directive provides:Member States may provide, as regards access to employment including the training leading thereto, that a difference of treatment which is based on a characteristic related to sex shall not constitute discrimination where, by reason of the nature of the particular occupational activities concerned or of the context in which they are carried out, such a characteristic constitutes a genuine and determining occupational requirement, provided that the objective is legitimate and the requirement is proportionate.Member states, then, may provide that in relation to access to employment or to training leading to employment, a difference in treatment based on a characteristic related to sex shall not constitute discrimination where, by reason of the nature of the particular occupational activities concerned or of the context in which they are carried out, such a characteristic constitutes a genuine and determining occupational requirement, provided that the objective is legitimate and provided also that the requirement is proportionate. The gender provisions of the Employment Equality Act do not contain an exclusion of this nature restricted to legitimate occupational activities necessitating the employment of a person of a particular sex. In other words, to overcome the hurdle of getting within the exclusion there are new tests to be met.Section 16 of the Bill remedies this by replicating Article 2.6 of the directive. The directive does not permit national legislation providing for the exclusion of posts of a certain nature in the manner provided for in section 25 of the 1998 Act. Instead, the directive permits only an exclusion restricted to selection for employment by reference to gender in certain circumstances, i.e. the nature of the particular post or the context in which it is carried out, and in certain conditions, i.e. that the requirement for a person of a particular gender is genuine and that the objective is legitimate and the requirement is proportionate.The Bill will provide a higher level of protection from discrimination on the gender ground than heretofore by imposing strict tests on employers in each case where it is proposed to restrict recruitment to one or other gender.

The Senator's proposal sought the inclusion in the section of a provision prohibiting "a different rate of remuneration paid pursuant to subsection (1) below the level of the National Minimum Wage in force at that time". Having considered the matter, I am satisfied that there is a need to ensure clarity of intention and, accordingly, it is appropriate to insert a provision which sets out the principles sought by the Senator. I sincerely thank Senator Terry for bringing this matter to my attention.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	210	This amendment arises from a clerical error in the text of the Bill as passed on Committee Stage. This provision was agreed on Committee Stage and enables the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to remunerate the board of the Equality Authority. In recent years social type boards, such as the authority, have been brought within the sphere of such payments. That is what we are moving on now.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I move amendment No. 11:
In page 19, before line 1, to insert the following:26.—Section 69 of the Act of 1998 is amended by the addition of the following subsection after subsection (6)—‘(6A) Where an employer fails to have an equality action plan (irrespective of whether he or she had been required pursuant to this section to have such a plan) it shall be presumed until the contrary is shown in any proceedings under this Act that the employer has failed to take such steps as are reasonable to protect the employees of such an employer from discrimination." '.This amendment is a repeat of an amendment tabled on Committee Stage. Its purpose is to try to get employers to take proactive measures to ensure there is no discrimination in the workplace on the basis of race or on other grounds. I mentioned that the Equality Authority said something about the need for some kind of measure to compel employers to do something to prevent racism in the workplace or discrimination against non-Irish nationals working there. Has the Minister considered introducing measures along the lines proposed here, or different measures with a similar intent? Has the Equality Authority raised it with the Minister?

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	215	In response to Senator Tuffy's amendment, this is dealt with essentially in section 69 of the 1998 legislation. To the best of my knowledge — I am open to correction — we have received no representations on it from any quarter. I will make further inquiries about it.The purpose of Part 6 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 is to provide guidance to employers, particularly large enterprises, in taking a proactive approach to implementing equality in the workplace. Section 69 gives the Equality Authority particular powers, at its discretion, to invite a particular business, business group or sector to carry out an equality review or to prepare and implement an equality action plan. The Equality Authority may if it deems it appropriate, carry out an equality review and prepare an equality action plan in respect of large employers, those with more than 50 employees, or in respect of a particular business or a particular sector. The authority has specific enforcement powers with respect to such equality reviews and action plans which are set out in section 69 of the 1998 Act. The EU directives do not require the imposition of a duty on employers to prepare equality action plans. There is no intention in section 69 to coerce all employers to prepare equality action plans. This amendment would have such an effect and would also remove any legitimate defence an employer might have in answering employment discrimination claims before the equality tribunal and those are the reasons why I cannot accept the amendment.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I move amendment No. 12:
In page 21, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:"(a) by the deletion of subsection (2),”.This is a resubmission of an amendment tabled on Committee Stage. The amendment seeks to delete the provision that a discriminatory dismissal should go to the Labour Court rather than the equality tribunal.There is a large body of opinion that the equality tribunal should have jurisdiction and I ask if the Minister of State has discussed this option with the stakeholders and the outcome of any discussion.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I second the amendment.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	218	With respect to amendment No. 12, there has been discussion on this issue during the preparation of the legislation. The effect of the amendment would be to remove jurisdiction for discriminatory dismissals from the Labour Court. In view of the discussions which took place, the conclusion was that the redress structure provided for in section 77 of the Employment Equality Act, places such jurisdiction with the Labour Court for a very good reason, which is that the Labour Court has extensive statutory powers and long experience of unfair dismissal cases. In terms of equality legislation, this jurisdiction dates back to the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act 1974 and the Employment Equality Act 1977. It is accepted by both sides in social partnership that the Labour Court remains the proper forum for resolution of cases of alleged unfair dismissals. It would also be irrational to make ad hoc adjustments to the respective jurisdictions of the equality tribunal and the Labour Court in the absence of a comprehensive review of the employment rights redress system as a whole. The Senator will be interested to learn that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is chairing a review group on this issue and is expected to report to Government later this year.

In page 21, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:"(b) by the insertion in subsection (3) after ‘Equal Treatment Directive’ of ’or any other Directive referred to in the Title to the Equality Act 2004, ’.This amendment was tabled on Committee Stage.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	221	When I addressed this amendment on Committee Stage, I explained there was no requirement on the non-gender grounds in either the framework employment directive or the race directive for access to unlimited awards. The amendments would allow access to the Circuit Court for all employment discrimination cases. In the event that the EU Council of Ministers had intended to make available equal levels of redress between the gender and non-gender grounds, it was open to the Council to make such provision in the directives, however, the Council did not provide for this.Section 77(3) of the Employment Equality Act 1998 provides that the option for a claimant in a general discrimination case to refer the case to the Circuit Court is available in order to allow access to an unlimited award of compensation. This is a requirement of the gender equal treatment directive following the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the Marshall case of 1993. It is our understanding that the Marshall case only compelled this procedure in gender-related cases and not in other cases. The directives provide that sanctions must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. We are satisfied that the existing level of awards open to the equality tribunal and the Labour Court meet the requirements of the directives. The sanctions available in gender and non-gender cases are sufficiently high to deter unscrupulous employers and to fully compensate employees who suffer the effects of discrimination in the workplace.

In page 29, lines 26 and 27, to delete "(other than a separate and self-contained part)".This amendment was tabled on Committee Stage. I argue that the Minister of State should agree to delete the phrase because it does not do what he intends it to do. It is an illogical part of the paragraph and does not need to be included. There are other ways of addressing the issue he is trying to address.Amendment No. 15 is slightly different to when it was tabled on Committee Stage. We concede that perhaps it needed to be clarified. It is an alternative amendment to amendment No. 14. It would allow for the situation of a separate part of the home and the case of a person providing personal services to the householder. I raised the situation of an au pair in a household who lives in the granny flat. In that situation, the person should be exempted because it obviously relates to the employers who are employing the person in their private home. I await the Minister of State's response to amendment No. 15 in particular.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I second the amendment.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	225	Senator Tuffy made a compelling case on Committee Stage and I agreed to examine this amendment. Having done so, my view has not changed. I was delighted at the terms of the directive because I knew it would compel national governments, including this Government, to extend the ambit of these protections to people in what is loosely termed "domestic service". We have agreed to exclude that protection in certain cases but it is of paramount importance that the exclusion is as narrow as possible. For too long those people have remained unprotected. I understand Senator Tuffy's point of view but we must agree to differ. As indicated on Committee Stage the removal in amendment No. 14 of the section in brackets in lines 26 and 27, "(other than a separate and self-contained part)", which is the basis of the amendment, would make the proposed exemption too broad and exclude from the provisions of the Equal Status Act the letting of separate or self-contained accommodation in the owner's home, such as bed and breakfast accommodation or a self-contained apartment in a house. The race directive does not provide for any exemptions in the accommodation area. In particular, it does not as such exempt the letting of accommodation in the provider's home. The race directive provides in recital four that it is important in the context of the access to and provision of goods and services, to respect the protection of private and family life and transactions carried out in that context.The protection of private and family life is a fundamental right covered by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It is important that the rights to non-discrimination be applied with due respect to the protection of private and family life. The Government proposal is therefore to provide a very narrow exemption excluding the provision of accommodation by a person in a part other than a separate and self-contained part of the person's home where the provision of the accommodation affects the person's private life or that of any other person residing in the home. As already indicated, the aim is to protect the privacy of persons in accommodation-sharing arrangements. It is not the intention to exclude from the Equal Status Act the letting of, for example, a self-contained apartment in the owner's home or bed and breakfast accommodation. To do so would be contrary to the race directive. If amendments Nos. 14 and 15 are taken together, the relevant subsection would state:. . .the provision of accommodation by a person in a part (other than a separate and self-contained part) of the person's home, where the provision of the accommodation affects the person's private or family life or that of any other person residing in the home, or in a part of the person's home to a person providing personal services (within the meaning of the Employment Equality Act 1998) to the first-mentioned person.The effect of the addition of the phrase "or in a part of the person's home to a person providing personal services (within the meaning of the Employment Equality Act 1998) to the first-mentioned person" would mean that persons would not be protected by the Equal Status Act who were employed in a private home with provided living accommodation. I know this was not the intention of Senator Tuffy's amendment. However, I am advised that would be its effect.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I move amendment No. 16:
In page 29, lines 41 to 44, to delete all words from and including "she" in line 41 down to and including "or" in line 44 and in page 30, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following:"she requires persons who are not EU nationals or refugees to fulfil reasonable requirements in respect of length of residency in the State.'.".The Minister of State said Senator Tuffy made a compelling case for amendment No. 14. I hope I did the same when I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage. I pointed out that there are people who are neither EU nationals nor refugees, but who could be living here with taxpayers and who should be considered for grants on the length of their residency in the State. I do not think a large number of them would apply. However, I gave a few instances where people from abroad had found themselves no longer with the finances to continue their education here and where money had been found for them. I asked that this amendment be accepted to ensure that these issues would not be considered on a case by case basis. I hope the Minister of State did not tell me he would look at it simply to get rid of me and that he has a favourable response. I am always nervous when there is no asterisk before the amendment.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	228	My practice, either in this or the Lower House, is that when I say I will look at an amendment, I do so. It is not for the sake of getting rid of Members. Senator Henry made an excellent case for this amendment on Committee Stage.I have discussed this in the interim with the Minister for Education and Science. We looked again at the issue of higher education grants and the proposed section 45 amendment in the name of Senator Henry. There is nothing in section 45 that prohibits the Minister for Education and Science from giving grants to non-nationals. Section 45 simply gives the Minister for Education and Science discretion as to whether the conditions should be restricted to EU nationals or varied between EU nationals and non-EU nationals.The Minister for Education and Science informed me that the nationality clause in the higher education maintenance grants schemes has recently been widened. It now covers, in addition to EU nationals, refugees, those with humanitarian leave to remain in the State, the spouse of an Irish national residing in the State, the child of such a person not having EU nationality, spouses of EU nationals working here who are not EU nationals and nationals of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The Minister for Education and Science has shown flexibility on the question of nationality and the Senator's proposal would unfortunately remove such a discretion from the Minister, which he has exercised flexibly in the past. It would oblige the Minister to pay grants to non-EU nationals on the same basis as EU nationals subject only to a residency qualification.If the amendment was accepted, the Minister would no longer be able to give priority to non-EU spouses of Irish and EU nationals over other non-EU nationals. The payment of higher education grants may not necessarily be a matter of the highest priority in current expenditure in the education sector. After detailed discussions with the Minister for Education and Science, eloquent though the case for the amendment was, I cannot accept it.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I thank Senators from all sides of the political divide who contributed so constructively to the debate on this Bill. The debate helped to improve the Bill. I realise, in reply to Senator Henry in particular, that there were a number of matters that I undertook to examine between Committee and Report Stages. These were examined and I apologise to Senators who worked hard on their amendments that some of them could not be taken on board. I understand where Senators were coming from and they made good cases for them. Unfortunately, there is a slightly better case on the other side. This legislation must next go through the Lower House. It will be better legislation after being passed by the Seanad. There may be occasion to improve it again during the course of the debate in the Lower House.It is important and necessary legislation that brings Ireland up to date and almost to the top of the European Union league of equality legislation, on both the employment and equal status front. That is where we want to be. During the course of the EU Presidency, at meetings I have attended in Brussels, I have found people to be impressed by the strength of Irish equality legislation, more so because some EU directives require enormous changes in the basic legislation of many of our EU partners. The changes made to Irish law have been minor and technical adjustments because the basic legislation has been in place since 1998 and 2000. I thank Senators for their valuable contributions which are much appreciated.

However, he is a little too harsh on us because he accepted some amendments. I thank him and his officials for the time and effort put in during the passage of the Bill.I do not quite understand how the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform encompasses the area of equality. However, I know it is not specific to this Bill and not the time to raise this matter. It was obvious that the Minister of State looked at the amendments that were proposed and took some of them on board, which I welcome.

It is disappointing if one's amendments are not accepted on Report Stage, but not if they have been considered. We were not elected to loll around on the back row. All Members have a duty to the constituents of our panels and the public to make an effort to ensure that legislation is dealt with properly in this House. The Minister of State always succeeds in achieving this in a respectful manner.

I welcome this legislation and the Minister of State's explanations regarding why he would not accept the amendments tabled by the Labour Party Senators. I ask him to consider some of them again in the Dáil. I thank the Minister of State for accepting my party's technical amendment. The Labour Party feels very strongly about this important area and tabled several amendments on Committee Stage and again today. While the Government has played a role in this, we pioneered much of the work and would like to help the Government as much as possible in bringing it to completion. I will try to clarify the problem raised in our first amendment and communicate that to the Minister of State.

It is a very progressive Bill which provoked hours of excellent debate, albeit difficult at times. All sides made fine contributions. Senator Tuffy should know that the Labour Party is not alone in feeling strongly about these issues; all sides share that feeling. I hope the Bill will have as safe a passage in the Lower House as it had here and proceed to become the enabling legislation it is intended to be.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	238	My colleague, the Minister for Finance, introduced this Bill to safeguard the long-term budgetary sustainability of public service pensions, while at the same time ensuring that future public service pensioners obtain fair and reasonable occupational pensions. In furtherance of these objectives, the Bill introduces two key changes, which will affect most new entrants to the public service from 1 April 2004. First, it raises the standard minimum pension age in the public service from 60 to 65 years, and second, it abolishes maximum retirement ages in most areas of the public service.These changes will affect new entrants to the Civil Service, local government, teaching, the health sector, non-commercial State bodies, the Dáil and Seanad, and ministerial office. The special nature of the duties of members of the Defence Forces, gardaí, prison officers and fire fighters means that maximum retirement ages will continue to apply in these areas. However, the Bill raises minimum pension ages for new entrants to the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service, as well as providing for new pension arrangements to be put in place for new entrants to the Defence Forces. I emphasise that the measures in the Bill apply to new entrants only; neither serving staff nor existing pensioners are affected in any way.The changes set out in the Bill have been decided by Government following consideration of the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. On foot of that report, there was full dialogue between the Government on the one hand and trade unions and staff representative organisations in the public service on the other. As I will explain later, full agreement was not reached in the course of that dialogue. While the changes proposed in the Bill are urgently needed, they spring from a background of lengthy consideration and extensive consultation.The Minister considers the Bill constitutes a vital reform initiative in light of developing demographic trends. Demographic change, and in particular the trend toward greater longevity, is central to the need for reform of our public service pension arrangements. Since the foundation of the State, life expectancy has risen sharply. In the case of men, it has increased by about 15 years and in the case of women, it has increased by more than 20 years. While future life expectancy forecasts are open to debate, it is generally agreed there will be continued improvement in the years ahead. On that basis it is reasonable to conclude that future new recruits to the public service can expect, on average, to live beyond the age of 85. Most public servants currently have the option to retire on pension at the age of 60. If this option remained in place for new entrants, taxpayers would be faced with the prospect of financing pensions for many future public servants for periods of more than 25 years.The rise in life expectancy, combined with a declining birth rate, will produce a pronounced ageing trend in the general population over the next 25 years. A recent study published by the Department of Social and Family Affairs projected that the number of people of pension age in Ireland will rise from 430,000 at present to 673,000 in 2021, and then to 1.2 million in 2056. This means that our current ratio of five people of working age to every pensioner can be expected to fall sharply to a ratio of less than 2:1 by 2056. This prospective decline in the support ratio further underlines the necessity for action now to forestall excessive impositions on the Exchequer in the future.Public service and social welfare pensions now cost the Exchequer approximately 5% of gross national product. Maintaining the current level of provision is expected to cost approximately 12.5% of gross national product in 2056. Over the same period the public service pension component of this spending is set to rise from 1.4% to 2.5% of gross national product. The challenge posed by such stark projections has already led to a pro-active response by this Government through actions such as the establishment of the national pensions reserve fund. At the same time, the broader goal of fostering responsible pension planning by individuals in the workforce generally has been tackled in recent years by taxation adjustments and the introduction of PRSAs.With costs over the medium to longer term clearly posing a major challenge, the Bill is directed at reducing the Exchequer burden in years to come through implementation of moderate and well-researched changes, which in the long run are estimated to achieve annual savings of some €300 million for taxpayers. This is set out in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill.The need for reform of public service pensions has long been acknowledged and was clearly recognised by the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which was set up by Government in 1996 and which issued its report in 2001. The commission's membership included the social partners, academic experts, pensions industry professionals and departmental representatives. I believe it also included a Member of the House.Its terms of reference included changes in the working environment, claims for improvements in existing terms, emerging costs and the operational requirements of the public service. It recommended its package of measures as representing an integrated strategy aimed at securing the long-term viability and stability of public service pensions. In this context, it cited as key aspects the growth in long-term pensions expenditures, changes in the nature of public service employment, the issue of retirement age and claims for early retirement. The Government accepted the bulk of the commission's proposals, including those on pension age.The provisions of the Bill on increasing minimum pension age for new entrants are a direct implementation of specific commission recommendations. In endorsing such an approach, the commission took a thorough approach by examining all relevant factors, including the demands placed on the different occupational groups, and cited increased life expectancy as a key factor in its decisions. The Government agreed with the commission's conclusions.The commission made no recommendation as such concerning maximum retirement ages, which the Bill will abolish for most new entrant public servants. In the Minister's view, this is an appropriate accompanying measure to the change in minimum retirement age for new entrants and will facilitate future public servants in terms of their capacity to make a productive contribution in the workplace at older ages. From a pensions perspective, the Minister believes that the forecast decline in the dependency or support ratio as the first half of this century unfolds makes it a particularly opportune moment to dispense with mandatory age-based retirement for most new entrant public servants. At the same time as the worker to pensioner ratio falls over the decades ahead, people will be living longer. In the context of the major impact these changes will have on the labour force, it makes sense to allow people to continue to work and contribute for so long as they are competent and willing to do so. The return to the Exchequer should be a reduction in pension costs.In September 2001, the Government agreed the recommendations of the commission in principle and set up a working group with the public service unions to advise on the implementation of those recommendations. The group's deliberations spanned almost two years, concluding with a report to Government in October 2003. Parallel groups with similar remits were set up in respect of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána. The Government also had the benefit of reports from these groups in informing its decision-making.Although the trade union and management participants on the main working group were able to make progress on several important aspects of the commission reform package, agreement was not reached on some other critical items in the package, notably the raising of minimum pension age for new entrants. Every opportunity was given to arrive at an agreement in the course of these talks, but unfortunately this did not prove possible.Against this overall background, the Minister considered that action was urgently required following a prolonged phase of study and consultation. In his view, to delay further created the risk of missing the opportunity for reform created by the commission's work. The Government agreed that real change had become a pressing priority and as a result the Minister was able to announce in his budget statement last December that the Government had decided to implement the bulk of the recommendations of the commission. Specifically, he announced his intention to introduce legislation, now embodied in this Bill, to increase minimum pension age and remove compulsory age-based retirement for most new entrants to the public service.In line with the Government's concern about securing a balanced reform package, the Minister also announced in his budget statement that the Government would not be proceeding with the commission's recommendations for the introduction of an additional 1% pension contribution by all public servants or the use of a new index for determining public service pension increases. In addition, the Minister announced his intention to draw up a further set of pension changes arising from the commission's recommendations in respect of existing public servants. These changes, which are not part of this Bill, may include amendment of the formula used for integrating public service and social welfare pensions to make better provision for current and future staff on lower pay levels, along with a new single additional voluntary contribution-type scheme for the public service, as well as the possibility of optional early retirement on the basis of actuarially reduced benefits. These further changes are the subject of ongoing discussion with the public service unions.I hope this outline of its historical context has impressed on Members that this Bill has its roots in a lengthy and thorough deliberative process. Its provisions are in no way precipitate or improvised, but have been crafted in the context of expert independent analysis and appropriate consultation.I now turn to the structure of the Bill. The first two sections deal with definitions, including the definition of new entrant. These are followed by sections which remove or raise compulsory retirement ages for new entrants to the public service. The Bill then deals with the design of new superannuation arrangements that will be introduced in the Defence Forces, after which the concluding sections are essentially technical in nature, covering matters such as removal of doubts and collective citation.The Bill contains two Schedules. The first is a list of State bodies, mainly commercial, which do not come within the definition of a public service body in this Bill but whose employees in certain circumstances will not be deemed new entrants on assuming posts in the public service. The Second Schedule lists those areas of primary legislation which the Bill is intended to amend.Members will note that the Bill's provisions on minimum pension age extend to new Members of the Oireachtas and office holders including Ministers and Ministers of State. This is in line with the Budget Statement for 2004, in which the Minister said that the minimum pension age for these groups would be increased to 65. Although the pension commission's remit did not include new Members of the Oireachtas and office holders, meaning the commission did not make any recommendations regarding their pension terms, the Government considered that they should be encompassed by the current changes.The reason for including Oireachtas Members, Ministers and other office holders within the scope of this change in minimum pension age is that we are public servants. We serve the public in a fundamental way. However, unlike most public servants we do not have security of tenure. That is the nature of the job. We are subject to the will of the electorate from time to time, so there can be a considerable change in Oireachtas membership from one Dáil or Seanad to the next. It goes without saying that in many cases these changes are involuntary, but this does not change the basic position that we are public servants. The requirement to be re-elected from time to time means that Oireachtas Members are different from the general body of public servants.The Minister considers it appropriate that this special factor should be taken into account in the Bill for serving or former Oireachtas Members and Ministers. Accordingly, the definition of "new entrant" in the case of Members of the Oireachtas and office holders does not include any Member of the Oireachtas or office holder who was first elected or appointed before 1 April 2004. This is an exception, but it is reasonable on the basis that even the most effective Deputy, Senator or Minister may not be re-elected and does not have the same security of tenure as other public servants. As I have said, this is not a voluntary matter. Accordingly, having once been elected or appointed as an office holder before 1 April 2004 should be sufficient to take a person out of the new entrant category when he or she is elected or appointed an office holder in the future. Persons elected for the first time after 1 April 2004 will be subject to the new entrant age limits. The Minister considers this reasonable as individuals going forward for Dáil or Seanad election for the first time will be aware of the new age limits and will be in a position to take this on board to fit their own circumstances.Members may also notice that taoisigh who are first elected to the Oireachtas after 1 April 2004 will be exempt from new entrant status. This exemption applies only to the pension in respect of holding the office of Taoiseach; it will not extend to the person's entitlement under the Oireachtas Members' pension scheme. Perhaps this is an invitation for Senator Bannon's party to elect yet another new leader, who is not a serving Member of the Oireachtas. The existing provisions for office holder pensions recognise the status of the post of Taoiseach as leader of the Government. The Minister considers it appropriate that the respect accorded to the post and to former holders of the post should be preserved. However, this provision for new entrants has no implications for the pension entitlements of current or former taoisigh.In the commission's view, the operational requirements of the Garda Síochána, prison officers, military personnel and firefighters continued to warrant special treatment in terms of minimum pension age and retirement age provision for these groups. Notwithstanding this, the commission did recommend certain changes for these groups and these changes are being proposed for implementation by the Minister in this Bill.In the case of gardaí and prison officers, the Bill sets a minimum pension age of 55 for new entrants and a maximum retirement age of 60. For gardaí, service between the ages of 55 and 60 will require that members meet certain health, fitness and competence criteria. For new entrants to the Defence Forces, the commission recommends that payment of pension be dependent on age and service rather than service alone and that the earliest age at which a pension should be paid is 50 years. The Bill will implement this recommendation on minimum pension age as well as providing for the making of an appropriate pension scheme on this basis for new entrants to the Defence Forces.The commission considered that firefighters should continue to have a minimum pension age of 55 and also a maximum retirement age of 55. The Bill proposes no change in this regard. However, the commission recommended that new entrant officers in the fire service should have standard public service terms. Accordingly, the Bill provides for them to have a minimum pension age of 65. The Bill also abolishes maximum retirement ages for new entrant officers in the fire service.I now turn to the definition of a new entrant. The guiding principle adopted in the Bill is that a new entrant is a person appointed as a public servant, as defined in the Bill, on or after 1 April 2004. However, this does not include staff on leave or on secondment from public service bodies on 31 March 2004 or staff who are serving in the public sector on that date and who subsequently move within the public sector. Provision has also been made in the definition that any current public servant who leaves employment but returns within a period of 26 weeks to a public service job will not be regarded as a new entrant. The stipulated period of 26 weeks reflects similar provisions in employment law generally. The definition also takes account of seasonal and temporary workers. The definition of a new entrant also excludes a person who has received a written offer of employment prior to 1 April 2004 and persons training in the Garda College who were admitted to training prior to 1 April 2004.The Minister, through Government officials' contacts with the unions, has been as sensitive as possible to concerns about the definition of a new entrant. He is confident that the definition contained in this Bill is fair, sensible and workable. A balanced approach is adopted, allowing a reasonable interim period within the overall context of a clear and practical definition. The removal of compulsory retirement ages will heighten the necessity for strong management and performance control in the public service. Guidelines are already in preparation for the civil service in the broader context of public service reform. In overall terms, this Bill is modernising, fair and balanced in its approach. It will shield the Exchequer from unsustainable future liabilities while ensuring the State can continue to provide reasonable levels of occupational pension income to its retired workers. Viewed in this light, I hope Senators will conclude that the case for change is incontrovertible and that this Bill is the right means of delivering that change. I commend the Bill to the House.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I welcome the Minister to the House. As stated, the purpose of this Bill is to remove the compulsory retirement age for certain categories of those who enter the public service on or after 1 April 2004, to increase the pensionable age for certain categories of new entrants into the public service, including Members of either House of the Oireachtas and certain office holders, and to make consequential provisions to provide for certain other categories of new entrants. The Bill indicates that the Government has decided to implement the bulk of the recommendations of the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. The recommendations have in turn been the subject of a report by a joint management-union working group, set up to advise on the implementation of the commission's recommendations, as well as having been considered by parallel working groups established in respect of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.This Bill, if passed, will force new civil and public servants, recruited from 1 April this year at the age of 18 years, to work for 47 years before they can claim a pension. That is manifestly unfair. After 40 years of work everyone should have the automatic right to retire and claim their pension. Nurses, teachers and local government employees will be affected by the change but gardaí, soldiers, prison officers and firemen will have the right to retire at 55. New entrant civil servants will no longer be able to retire early at 60 years and must remain in employment until 65. The minimum retirement age for gardaí will increase from 50 to 55 years, with compulsory retirement age extending to 60. Deputies and Senators elected for the first time after 1 April will not get a pension until 65, while Ministers who are appointed after this time will have to wait until they are the same age, rather than claiming a pension at 55 if they had three years service at this level, as previously applied.The Minister should, as a matter of urgency, consider the establishment of pension rights for local authority members. As general secretary of the Local Authority Members Association, I have been involved over many years in a campaign for this right. Being a councillor is a full-time position and after 40 years' service many council members have left with nothing. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has recognised the role of the local representatives. Full recognition of their pension rights is the next logical step.The extension of the Garda retirement age to 60 years is a step in the right direction. There is a high retirement rate in the Garda Síochána. The increased age limit is a positive move to help reverse this trend. However, there is still no sign of the 2,000 extra gardaí promised by the Government in its pre-election whitewash exercise. Teachers have lost the provision whereby they could retire after 40 years' service on full pension or after 35 years on a reduced pension. This is a significant worsening of teachers' conditions of employment, following the imposition of full PRSI in 1995. Nurses are set to lose the right to retire at 60 or 55 if they have 35 years' service. It is neither feasible nor desirable to expect most nurses to work until 65 years of age. The Government seems to have reneged on its agreement with the Civil and Public Service Union that new entrants would have a spread of retirement age options from 62 to 65 years.Although the Irish population is not ageing as quickly as some of its European neighbours, Irish workers will be quick to realise that this Bill is the precursor of pension related problems for the future. As a result of medical advances, people are living longer. Increased life expectancy is a ticking time bomb for public funding. We are already being warned that we must save more or work longer to avoid dependence on a State pension which pays the equivalent of one third of average earnings. That is less generous than the pensions in most other European states.A total of 50% of workers in the Republic have private pensions and the introduction of personal retirement savings accounts last year is aimed at increasing that figure. Most people believe that if they are in a pension scheme, their future is assured. However, the cost of annuities is rising due to increased longevity and low interest rates. People outside the safety net of defined benefit or final salary schemes must save more for their retirement than heretofore.Furthermore, the picture emerging with the elimination of the compulsory retirement age is one of people working until they drop. Who, in the not too distant future, will be able to afford to retire at 65? What has the Government done for those whose hard work created the Celtic tiger? It has squandered the benefits which those people secured for this country and it now expects them to plough back those wasted billions into the Exchequer, by means of stealth taxes and cutbacks. What has the same Government dreamed up for them in the future? It is not a happy and secure retirement but will, instead, impose the necessity to work until our ageing workers have one foot in the grave.In an effort to cope with future pension bills, the Minister for Finance has graciously eliminated a compulsory retirement age and, one could say, eliminated ageism in the workplace, but at what cost? How far will the parameters be extended? In 40 years from now, will the compulsory retirement age be 70 years and how far upwards can this limit be extended? How far will the caveat of "subject to suitability and health", outlined in the Bill, be extended?The Minister acknowledges that we have a pensions problem and that we must cope with higher future pensions bills. However, what is his answer to the problem? Last year, massive strikes occurred in France and Austria in response to proposed retirement benefit cuts while similar issues are high on the political agenda in Germany, Italy and Britain. How long will it be before the same reaction is seen here?

It is patently obvious that this Bill follows a trend in Government activity. The less well off and the most vulnerable are not its concern. This Bill is finance driven and is yet another money grabbing, income slashing move by the Minister for Finance. When the budget for 2004 was announced, I referred to this Minister as one who would go down in the records as "Charlie the Slasher".

No more needs to be said. This Government's actions speak for themselves. Once again, it is turning to a sector of our society which is not deserving of or capable of handling the burden that is being put on it to ease the problems of the Government.The Bill is a double edged sword for older people in the workforce. Older people should have the choice of whether to retire. Age is not a good indicator of how capable or otherwise a person is. In this respect, the Bill offers the older worker the chance to remain in the workforce, despite age. This extension of the working years is desirable when voluntary but my concern with the Bill is that the Minister is paving the way for compulsory extension.By the time many people achieve a half decent pension, they may no longer be able to enjoy it. The biggest question thrown up by this Bill concerns the private sector. Will the Bill have a knock-on effect or will the private sector lag behind, for better or worse, in the implementation of the proposals?The Minister referred to the exclusion of Taoisigh. Will he elaborate further on that? I do not see why we should go backwards. The general opinion on the issue is that we are developing a monarchy type situation. The Queen's pension or salary is not questioned in Britain and it looks as if we are heading in the same direction. Perhaps the Minister can explain that.

The precise purpose of the Bill is to avoid the sort of problems which have brought people on to the streets in France, Germany and Austria.I am particularly proud of the pension provisions that have been made by this Government, its immediate predecessor, and the party in Government to which I belong. In the early 1980s and the late 1990s the Government gave priority to the pension issue. There was no particular priority given to pensions during the rainbow coalition period. The Government also prioritised the free schemes such as the medical card at the age of 75. We are building and improving provisions.

I was in Germany as a diplomat in the mid-1970s when it was already concerned about the effect pensions would have on the economy and public finances. That was at the stage of Model-Deutschland and the model German economy. Since the late 1990s pensions have had a crippling effect there.One of the biggest achievements of our Minister for Finance is that he is tackling the problem in a number of different ways well ahead of time. He is putting 1% of GNP into the pension reserve fund. Although I know not everyone in the House agrees with that, I strongly agree with it. The Minister has also established many incentives for better private pension provision, including the PRSAs, and now he is introducing this Bill which provides for flexible retirement. Obviously it does not affect any older person and we must be clear when discussing it that it only affects those in their early 20s or younger.I am a little surprised that the savings as a result of this measure are only estimated at €300 million annually. That seems small and I thought the effect would be more radical. The figure is not particularly significant and I find it difficult to believe.

It has been clear to me from watching economic developments over the past 20 to 25 years that the real joker in the pack is migration.

It would not surprise me if we had a much higher population then than we think we will have. It is always in the back of my mind that 150 or 160 years ago we had a population of 8 million. When we debate issues such as one-off housing and the beauty of barren peninsulas now, we forget they were not barren then. However, that is beside the point.This Bill is a useful reforming measure. The precedent for this type of reform was in the mid-1990s when it was decided to extend full PRSI to public servants. Such reforms can only be introduced for new entrants, which means they take a long time to filter through and have an impact. Anything which would reduce people's current entitlements is difficult to introduce. It could be argued that the reform is a blow against ageism. It may well be the case that between now and 40 years time we will become more flexible about retirement ages, which could be good.We should all approve retirement being on the basis of health rather than age. People should not be under pressure to retire on the basis of age although they should be entitled to retire if they want to. Equally, those who want to and who are able to work beyond the age of 65 should be able to do so. That would be better for them than doing nothing.We will have to develop, particularly in the public service, a new kind of career pattern. It already exists in embryonic form in places such as the Department of Foreign Affairs. People there reach the peak of their career, in terms of the importance of the posts they occupy, sometime in their 50s. Their last posting is often not as onerous as previous ones. We can think of other situations where the pattern is changing. In some cases senior civil servants work on a consultancy basis and they are brought in to do specific tasks or to help with a particular negotiation. The public service will have to develop to provide for this.The provisions of this Bill will not affect any current Oireachtas Members. Nonetheless, by a process of empathy, many Members would have mixed feelings about the situation. Given that I have been a public servant for over 25 years, I am delighted to see for the first time in legislation that Oireachtas Members are defined as public servants. This gives one a great feeling of continuity. On the other hand, as pointed out by the Minister, there is a sharp contrast in the security attaching to the career of most public servants and the lack of security applying where one cannot see from one Oireachtas to the next.If one had an eye for satire, one could allow oneself a smile regarding the bodies to which the definition of public service bodies does not apply. If one had a sort of Evening Herald cartoon attitude to CIE, the ESB or An Post one might smile. However, I admire all the people who work in those bodies.There is something objectionable about able-bodied parliamentarians who have moved on to better paid roles than they had in either House collecting a pension unconditionally. Equally, there are people, who through failing to get elected, are in danger of falling on hard times because they have nothing else to which they can immediately turn their hands. I am aware that a severance payment applies once Members have been here for three years. Perhaps there should be a type of safety net arrangement a little like the cnuas in the sphere of the arts to which the 150 members of Aosdána are entitled if they are not earning sufficient income from their artistic endeavours.

We all know teachers who are deeply upset to have to retire at 65. Equally, there are other cases where it would be of benefit both to the individuals concerned and their schools if they could call it a day at a certain point. The Minister of State referred to the possibility of optional early retirement. Teachers are well represented among the social partners and if problems arise as a result of the legislation, I have absolute faith in the ability of people like Senator O'Toole, his colleagues and successors to negotiate within the broad framework of standard retirement arrangements something that is particularly adapted to certain cases for whom the standard scheme might create difficulties. We must remember that the problems are long-term ones which do not apply to existing teachers.We are all aware that members of the Army and Garda avail of other employment opportunities. A period of service in the Army is, generally speaking, a good qualification for many other careers. The reason for the pension in these cases is that one has to attract people to these areas in the first place. The prospect of a pension on retirement at a certain age is part of the appeal.I offer qualified support for Senator Bannon's idea about pensions for councillors. The role of councillors has changed a good deal. I do not think it was always a full-time position, but given the pressures of modern life it is becoming full-time. In recent years Ministers have considerably improved conditions in terms of pay and allowances. I agree in principle with Senator Bannon that it is the next logical step, but that is not to say that it will be feasible for it to happen next month or even next year.I accept that I raised my eyebrows about the exemption for future Taoisigh. Taoisigh being new entrants is a contradiction in terms. I do not know about the aptness of comparisons with civil lists.This is important legislation in terms of social reform. It is also important in terms of underpinning our economy's confidence in its soundness for the future. People are well able to make calculations as to where the economy will stand and what liabilities it will face in ten or 20 years' time. It is wonderful that these problems are being tackled early and that we are learning from the bad experience, in some respects, of European partners who have good pension arrangements that they, unfortunately, are unable to sustain.

It is important that this is done.I begin by declaring both an interest and a disinterest. The disinterest arises from the fact that although I am a teacher and a politician, none of us already in the system will be affected in any way, as Senator Mansergh rightly pointed out. Accordingly, in a personal sense, I have a total disinterest in what I say about teachers and politicians.I declare an interest in the sense that I am the only person in the House who was a member of the dastardly Commission on Public Service Pensions. I assure Senator Mansergh that the odds were better at the pass of Thermopylae, as I was surrounded by the enemy all day long. I failed to convince them. They did not even discuss the idea of politicians. I assure the House that from the few times they made reference to it, their distaste and contempt for politicians was only marginally worse than their contempt and distaste for teachers.I firmly support Senator Mansergh on two points. As I said to the Minister last week, if it is only €300 million we are talking about I can offer four solutions. There is no question about it. My colleagues in the INTO made it clear when the question of the 1% was being discussed that it was partly a solution, but the Government decided not to move in that direction. The 1% of the €2 billion that is roughly teachers' salaries at present would be €20 million a year straight away and one can work that out over 40 years and invest it and so on. It is very easy to get up to those figures. Senator Mansergh put his finger on the real issue. I am glad to have one such colleague in the House, because I have been saying this for 17 years, but I have never yet seen an acceptable demographic prognosis in the House. I argued this case in 1989 with the Leader of the House when she was Minister for Education.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I pleaded with her not to take the word of her demographers who told her what would happen in education in the following ten years. Everything I said on that is on the record and has proven to be correct. Senator Mansergh is absolutely right. The idea that in 2056 the dependency ratio will be 2:1 is absolutely inconceivable. Are we to run the country by computer? It is impossible to consider that taking place. We now have a population which is touching 4 million, approximately 3.96 million the last time official figures were altered, and it has gone up significantly since then. I think we have probably reached 4 million at this stage, the highest population for well over 150 years. It is important to remember that point.I disagree with Senator Mansergh about pensions in Europe. I have looked closely at this issue and it is right that the exposure and liability to future pensions in certain European countries is far in excess of ours, but it tends to be far in excess for reasons other than what we discuss. In the main it is outside the public service and vocational areas and is mainly due to people in the private sector who generally have no pension cover of their own in their jobs. I do not say this in an absolutist fashion, but that is a major part of the problem in those countries.What is wrong with the legislation is that two groups have been hit hardest by it, the professions of politics and teaching, and that is unfair. I wish to put a few points on the record that were not mentioned by the commission on pensions, the Department or the Minister either now or in the Budget Statement. Some significant changes have been adverted to in the Minister's speech which are welcome, such as the one about taoisigh. It is not that long ago since a Taoiseach retired and invested his future in a high profile manner that went up in a bottle of smoke two years later. We all remember that he had to scramble. I do not like the idea of Taoisigh having to be at the grace and favour of big industry or somebody else to give them positions as directors of boards if they do not have income of their own. The issue of their own income is what has wrecked politics in the past. We need people who can see it as a career.In the past ten years we have looked at pensions for both teachers and politicians. The Bill refers to the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act 1992. This Bill put in place a minimum retirement age for politicians and brought it up to 50. This happened after much discussion and consideration. No Member has mentioned this aspect. Politicians are the most disorganised group of workers and would not have the courage to take this on publicly because they are afraid of the reaction of the media. The pension age of teachers was looked at under the PCW in 1996. Meetings were held at the Department of the Taoiseach late into the night. I am sure Senator Mansergh was aware of them. Conclusions were reached at that stage about retirement at 55 when teachers could then draw down a reduced pension.Under this Bill, having five years added to the accrual period has disadvantaged everyone. However two groups are excluded from this, namely, politicians and teachers. The earliest age at which politicians can draw their pension has been increased by 15 years, from 50 to 65, and by ten years for teachers, from 55 to 65. The ages we are building on have came from years and years of consideration and experience.The Leader was the Minister for Education in the late 1980s. A lump sum was offered to teachers during her time as Minister and she made a case for people whom she felt needed to get out of the profession. While I disapproved of the offer that was made, she said the issue should be looked at in such a way that teachers might be able to leave the profession. We were not able to achieve it.This Bill contains good elements. Under it, people will not have to retire at a certain age. Many healthy people want to continue working and we should support them. Under this Bill, every 64 year old teacher should be able to take a class of 35 lively four year olds in junior infants, or challenge 17 year olds in a leaving certificate class. A physical education teacher of 64 years of age would have to do all that is required at a time when most people of this age worry about prostate problems and arthritis. This will not work and is wrong for teachers.It is also completely wrong for politicians. While I do not like naming names, I have spoken about this to the people concerned and I am sure they will not mind me saying what I am about to say. Let us consider the current Progressive Democrats leader who has given her whole life to politics. While I might disagree with her politics, this is not the issue. She is the senior Minister in the Minister of State's Department. Were she to fail to be elected in the next election, she would have no source of income for the next 12 or 13 years. Surely this could not be right. The former deputy leader of the Fine Gael Party was not re-elected in the last election. As these individuals are in this system, this measure does not affect them. However, this could happen to new entrants in similar circumstances.I have spoken to many people from most parties and know there is no support for these measures. The public sector unions and my colleagues in the INTO have often said that the issue of pensions needs to be examined. It may be the case that we need to pay more for pensions. In the interests of equity, everyone should have had their minimum age increased by five years, and not ten years for teachers and 15 years for politicians. I am not going back to my trade union background of simply holding differentials. These ages were established for good reasons. These measures are fundamentally wrong. We will return politics to people who have incomes of their own and will not make a career of it. I appeal to the Minister of State to bring forward changes on Report Stage.Senator Mansergh spoke about €300 million. If teachers are required to work an additional five years, I estimate the additional contribution from them would be €25 million per year. This does not take into account savings on pension. The figures have not been worked out at all.I submitted 20 proposals to the commission on pensions. I pleaded with it and said that it was madness to have people in full-time employment until a certain day and in full-time retirement from the following day. I travelled to Boston College at my own expense and met with experts in this area. My union, the INTO, invited an expert from Boston College to speak to people here. We looked at the different approaches to pensions. It has been repeatedly proven that persuasion is the best way to deal with the pension issue. The carrot should be used rather than the stick.A federal law has been enacted in the United States. While this has not been applied in each state, it has been applied in most of them. It provides for something that would be seen as heresy in the area of Irish pensions and to the Department of Finance. In the United States, a person can decide, in consultation with his or her employers, to work half-time after the age of 65. During the course of the year, this person will draw half a pension entitlement and half a salary entitlement. The person will continue to contribute to the pension fund from the salary entitlement. There is no reason that the law could not be changed so that this could be done here. I believe the Minister is amenable to this move.Coming up to the last election, Members continually raised issues on the Adjournment looking for remedial or support structures for teachers. Retail distribution of the education service at primary level is almost impossible as there are schools everywhere. It is hard to give less than a full teacher type of service. However, teachers who wanted to go on partial retirement and work half-time could do it. I might as well have been talking to the wall as to those uncreative people in the pensions commission; I got no hearing on these issues.A huge amount can be done. I assume that section 2(6)(a), which refers to people returning on the same contract, will cover those who leave service on career breaks. I also assume that someone has thought of the equality implications for people who take off for a year or two, not on a career break but for domestic or family reasons, and return in a disadvantaged position. One can certainly line up the cases on that one.We should also consider a point made by Senator Mansergh which comes very close to what I said about adding five years to everyone's retirement age. When I started teaching, I was 19 years old. That does not happen any more, since the post-primary course is a year longer, as is the teacher education course. Nowadays, people typically begin primary teaching at between 21 and 23 years of age. If one adds 40 years to that to get the full pension, one reaches the age of 61, 62 or 63. That is the appropriate figure. The case has been made by the Government to increase the age on the basis of life expectancy and a variety of other matters. It should be no more than the five years. One should certainly increase the point at which one may take pension benefits from 55 to 60. Full retirement would be somewhere further on from there.That is a very simple method, and I intend tabling an amendment to include teachers. As no one else will have the courage to do so, I also intend to table one for politicians. That is the fairest thing one can do and reflects reality. I will defend those amendments anywhere. No one wants a situation where teachers are forced to stay in the job beyond the point at which they are comfortably able to do it with their natural energy. We have a job to do. It is interesting that teachers always feel put down. The Senator makes a point about their representatives, but it is strange that the Bill will say that people in Garda college who wish to become guards are not considered new entrants. I will certainly table an amendment in order that those in teacher education colleges are treated the same way. There is only one field in which they can be employed when they graduate, namely, as teachers. Surely the same thing should apply there. Teachers are not popular in the Department of Finance, and such things never come easily in that kind of situation. It is unjust, unfair and iniquitous, and I believe very strongly that we should examine it.I have gone over my time, and I have much more to say. Two professions, teaching and politics, have been unfairly hit — harder than any other group — and we should at least try to inject some fairness and balance into matters at this stage. The issue of the additional contributions must also be examined. Someone must say something about it. There are people in these Houses who say to me every year that they have reached their full pension age and wonder why they must still make contributions. When I was INTO general secretary, I heard the same. They have changed it here, but will they change it on this one? I see no sign of that. Will people continue to pay pension contributions after they have reached the end of their approval period? I ask the Department and the Minister to re-examine this and be open to the reasonable amendments which I will helpfully table on Thursday afternoon. I hope that people in parliamentary parties will at least take a strong stand on those issues to inject some kind of balance into this legislation or allow a space for that balance to be created in future.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I welcome the Minister. I will be making many of the same points raised by Senator O'Toole. Of course, I must congratulate the Government on bringing this Bill forward. It is planning for the future regarding pension reforms for the public service; one could not deny that. There can be no smirking or otherwise in that regard. However, the first of the two points we must address is raising the standard pension age to 65. The second is abolishing the compulsory retirement age. The rise in the standard pension age will cover civil and public servants, gardaí, nurses and health employees. In most cases, it is easy enough to agree with that. However, regarding politicians and teachers, I have significant reservations.I am delighted by the welcome removal of the compulsory retirement age. We all know the reasons for that. Life expectancy has now risen sharply, as have the capabilities and performance of people at 65. Why should they not be allowed to continue if they so wish? That is certainly to be welcomed, and no one would say anything against that. However, while many of the recommendations of the commission are certainly all right in my view, the key area of retention for the teachers goes down very hard with me. Perhaps I might remove my politician's hat and put on that of a secondary and careers guidance teacher with which I lived for 30 years. I feel very strongly on this and am compelled to express my feelings.There were special terms for teachers, including secondary teachers. Those were that they retired at 60. If necessary, they could retire at the age of 55 without losing increments. That agreement was justified, particularly when we look at society's changes regarding stresses and strains among teachers. No one should expect teachers in their 60s to try to control, let alone teach, an honours leaving certificate class in mathematics, physics or chemistry. They would be trying to control a bunch of students who do not want to learn. Considering remedial teachers, home-school links and all the societal problems, it is simply unreasonable to expect teachers to have to stay on until they reach 65 before they can benefit from a full pension. I would like the Minister to re-examine that. Those special terms laid down in the conditions of service for teachers should remain. The age of 60 should be retained as the standard retirement age, and voluntary early retirement without losing pension benefits at 55.I appreciate that the working group sat down and talked at length. Senator O'Toole has referred to that. There were many discussions on trying to find a formula on this but, unfortunately, they were not able to reach agreement on it. However, I would like them to take note of some kind of requirement regarding teachers. Those in school management — principals who have spoken to me — all feel strongly that it would work and that some formula or mechanism should be introduced. Perhaps the Minister might add in some subsection that a special case should be made for those who have reached the age where they have peaked in their careers and are not capable of delivering a full programme. Perhaps they should have a lower level of responsibility at a certain point in their career, coming out with that retirement without losing their pension benefits. I would like the Minister to revisit that area to see it he could find some formula or mechanism for those. I might add that not many avail of it at present, but it should be there as a kind of cushioning for those who feel they could leave the profession if they wish and, if they do not wish to do so, have a lower level of responsibility and hang in there until 60. There should be some sort of formula to give them some leeway, and I ask the Minister to revisit that. I have great difficulty accepting this provision regarding Teachtaí Dála and Senators. I say that because, as we know, being a politician today is more volatile than ever. When I grew up in politics, if one became a Teachta Dála or a Senator and worked at all at one's profession, the public would vote one back in. That is no longer the case. We have all felt that we have not received our just reward when we were not successful in politics. This shows the volatility of the political profession.I come from a political family from which another generation of politicians will come forward. It will not, however, be for some time because they will not be allowed to enter politics until they are well-established in their careers. The likelihood that young people who enter this profession at the age of 23 or 24 will be voted out by the age of 35 and will be unable to draw a pension until the age of 65 discourages young people from entering politics. This is wrong. Only the wealthy or those involved in business who can later take up where they left off will get involved in politics. For those in the professions, the prospect of leaving politics at the age of 35, having failed to develop a career, is too dangerous. I ask the Minister to revisit the section to ensure that Members leaving the Houses receive a lump sum or superannuation to allow them to start in another profession.I also ask the Minister to revisit the Bill to allow those who currently enjoy special terms enabling them to leave their profession aged 55 years to continue to do so on a voluntary basis without losing benefits. This is extremely important to teachers because once they reach 55 years, they find it too difficult to contain a class and teach a subject at second level. Many of my former colleagues have spoken to me at length on this issue. If it is not possible to allow teachers to retire aged 55, I ask that the Minister try to devise a formula to allow them at least to complete the final few years of their careers with less responsibility. This would mean giving them some scope to opt out of responsibilities, for which management would be grateful.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I have always admired the capacity of Members, particularly those from the Fianna Fáil Party, to welcome a Bill and then spend the rest of their speech condemning everything in it, as Senator Ormonde has done for the past ten minutes. Her argument may have more effect, coming from that quarter, than it would were it to come from this side of the House.I agree with almost everything said by those who essentially oppose the central tenets of the Bill, although I am inclined to be slightly less exercised by it. This is odd legislation which will not come into effect for 20 to 30 years. In that sense, despite the desire of the Minister to make his mark by passing it, the Bill will not affect anybody for a long time and his successors will have the option of changing it at any time. Other than provisions which specifically relate to politicians, it is not clear if the legislation is required as most of the issues could have been addressed through normal industrial relations mechanisms.In a sense, the Minister is trying to stop the tide of social change. Important changes have taken place in recent years in terms of how people have approached their later years. From the age of 65 onwards, people now look at a range of options. As Senator O'Toole correctly pointed out, they do not necessarily work full-time until they reach 65 years and then stop work completely. Frequently people work part-time or stop working altogether from the age of 55 onwards in an effort to create choices which suit the lifestyle they have chosen. The Minister is seeking to call a halt to this by telling people they cannot have such a choice or develop such flexibility and, if they choose to do so, they must meet the costs. The Government is indicating that people must work until the age of 65 years and after that their choices are entirely their own business. This cannot be achieved through a relatively short Bill such as this one, which we will have to revisit long before its provisions come into play.I agree with Senator O'Toole that the presumptions underpinning the Bill are based on conjecture — I will not say they are wrong. The Bill relies on two or three central presumptions, including demographics, which are not amenable to accurate calculations. While it is true that the birth rate is now lower than it was 20 or 30 years ago, it has undergone several different changes in the intervening period. In the 1970s, for example, it was among the highest in Europe. It then collapsed to become one of the lowest in Europe in the 1980s before recovering in the 1990s. While we may be able to make a reasonable guess as to what the birth rate will be in 20 years, we cannot be in any way certain about it.Even more uncertain — Senator Mansergh correctly pointed this out — are developments in the labour force, which will be crucially important in terms of our ability to pay for pensions. In 1990, fewer than one million people were at work. This figure now stands at approximately 1.7 million, which has major implications for our capacity to pay for pensions. Given that this dramatic change took place over a period of slightly more than ten years, it is nonsense to claim it is possible to state with some certainty what the position will be in 2056.The figures underpinning the consideration of this issue just three or four years ago by the commission, of which Senator O'Toole was a member, were from 1997 and 1998, although attempts were later made to update them. Even now, it is clear the figures used are wrong. They did not calculate, for example, that we would have net migration of some 30,000 to 35,000 in each of the intervening years and, as such, did not take into account the consequent change in the dependency ratio. We cannot state with any degree of certainty the number of likely immigrants during the next 20 or 30 years, or for that matter during the next two years.It is remarkable that we are having this debate on a day when we must acknowledge that we cannot predict the number of people from the accession countries who may seek to come here in 15 or 18 weeks. Producing a five year old report to try to guess the dependency ration in 2056 can only be described as guess work. I was about to describe the process as informed guesswork but that would do it too much of a service.Based on the experience of the past five to ten years, the dependency ratio is significantly better than anybody would have guessed ten years ago. It is, therefore, premature at best to introduce a measure as insignificant as this legislation to address the issue. Even if we were to accept all the figures, as the commission pointed out, the cost of public service pensions as a proportion of GNP will increase from approximately 1.6% now to approximately 2.4% in 2027, not a crippling or, to use the commission's phrase, "unaffordable" burden. One must, therefore, wonder why the Minister is taking this course of action.It is also true that while the number of pensioners is not a matter the Government can control, it has a measure of control over the number of public service pensioners because it controls to some degree the number of public servants. I understand that the number of public service pensioners will peak in the third decade — from around 2020 onwards — because of the significant intake of public servants during the late 1970s and 1980s when we recruited a large number of additional public servants. The legacy of the Charlie Haughey years is even now——

I also recall meeting Senator O'Toole in a hotel in north Dublin about four or five years ago when we discussed it at length over a few pints. It is remarkable that the Minister has reduced to two decisions such an interesting, lengthy report containing many recommendations. He has indicated that he will make more decisions, but he has not yet done so. The only two decisions we have are that there is a presumption that one retires at 65 and that if one wishes one can continue to work for longer than that. I have no problem with the second of those, nor does anybody else. If people want to work beyond the age of 65, and there are plenty of people who do, they should be entitled to do so and should not be told there is no further use for them and they should go away.My worst moment during the election campaign of 2002, bar the count, was when I chaired a Labour Party press conference one morning dealing with issues relating to older people. This provision was one of them.

I am thankful that it was dealt with in the spirit of levity intended by the journalist. In any event, it is a decent proposal. We all accept that if a person can do the job, and that is an essential proviso, he or she should be entitled to continue doing it. However, why should people be required to work until they are 65? The truth of the matter is that people will not do that. Significant numbers of people will choose to leave early and there is no doubt that the €300 million saving will come as a result of people leaving early with either no source of income or an actuarially reduced income in the intervening period. That is not a satisfactory state of affairs.Let me refer in passing to PRSAs, which have not yet been mentioned in any detail. Most of us welcomed, at least in principle, the introduction of PRSAs a few years ago. However, the experience so far has not been encouraging. It is early days and one would not wish to make a final judgment on the issue. However, it is clear that the number of workers, particularly lower paid workers, availing of PRSAs at the moment is not at an acceptable level. It is possible that there are voluntary measures that could be taken to increase the participation rate. It might be possible to provide incentives either to workers or employers to ensure that people are made aware of the schemes and encouraged to join them. It is not my party's official policy, but it strikes me that we will soon have to consider introducing a measure of compulsion. The essential role of the State is to ensure that people have an adequate level of pension provision, but the State should also go beyond that and acknowledge that many people want more than that and provide every possible encouragement for the provision of occupational pensions. This is an issue with which the trade union movement is also grappling and we will have to consider whether there should not be some sort of compulsory private provision on top of the PRSI provision that already exists.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	269	A not insignificant issue struck me when reading the Bill. Senator O'Toole referred to it at the end of his contribution, namely, the issue of breaks in service. It is not at all clear that Members of this or the other House who are defeated at the next election will still qualify for payment of their pensions under the existing scheme. It is fairly clear from the Bill that teachers who take a career break of three or four years, say, to look after their children will not benefit under the old system when they return but will be treated under the new scheme. This is very serious and will come into play much earlier than the basic provisions of the Bill.There is a specific provision relating to Dáil Deputies. The Schedule where we insert an amendment into the 1990 Act seems to make clear and to conform with what the Minister said during the course of his contribution that it does not apply to those who were first elected before 2004. However, it sits uncomfortably with the other provision in the body of the Act which does not exclude civil servants. Section 2(6), to which Senator O'Toole referred, refers to public servants and does not specifically exclude Members of the Oireachtas and contains what appear to be different provisions regarding breaks in service. There is a problem for Dáil Deputies, and there is clearly a problem for virtually all other public service employment, including that of teachers, where people want to take a few years out.I have said on a number of occasions in this House and in the other House that the public service generally will have to be a good deal more flexible in the future in terms of allowing people a few years out. Many Ministers, including this Minister, are on record on more than one occasion as saying they believe it would be a good approach to have some cross-stream mobility between the private sector and the public service whereby people who have worked for, say, ten years in the Department of Transport could work somewhere else for five years and return to the Department or to the public service generally if they so wish. The public service can only benefit from giving people an opportunity to take time out in the private sector. This measure clearly runs in the face of all that rhetoric because it constitutes a serious disincentive to anybody to do that, because if they go away without a specific agreed time for coming back, they cannot come back under the same pension arrangements. They will come back effectively as new entrants and lose out on the benefits of the old system.Others have referred to specific provision regarding the Taoiseach. I find that rather strange. I accept what the Minister says, that Taoisigh need to be treated with a certain respect and that there is a particularity attaching to that office. However, one could make the same case for others. The same case could very obviously be made for Ministers and for Deputies. Ministers are obliged to give up participation in private industry. I am familiar with the position of legal practitioners — there is at least one in the current Cabinet — who are required to desist from any private involvement, and it is not that easy to go back to it if they cease to be a Minister. I really do not see why we take a particular view of the Taoiseach and do not take the same view of other Ministers.

This is not a good Bill. I do not see the point of it. This Minister has done a number of good things and a number of others with which I would quibble on the issue of pensions. This is by no means the most important thing he has done. There will be time to revisit this and time to amend it before it becomes law. However, I do not understand why he is bothering to introduce it in the first place.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	272	Over the coming decades most industrialised countries will face the problem of an ageing population, despite the doubts and reservations about the projections being made and the available statistics. By 2050, for example, on the basis of the information we have, the overall population in Europe will decline by more than 3% and the number of people aged 65 and over in proportion to the working population will increase from 25% to 50% over 20 years. The two big factors contributing to this are low fertility rates compared with earlier years and an increase in life expectancy. Ireland will experience similar trends, to a greater or lesser extent, although currently, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, over this decade we will be in a far more favourable position. As time goes on the trend will take on much the same pattern as the rest of Europe. Projections based on the only statistics we can rely on at this point show that by 2016 there will be about four persons of working age to support each pensioner and by the 2050s there will be only two. The ageing or greying of the population will cause serious problems for us. It presents challenges for the way this and future Governments fund public service and social welfare pensions. Decisions must be made. In 2000 about 4.7% of our GNP went to fund these pensions. By 2026 I understand that will have increased to about 8.1%, and by 2056 it will have increased to 12.4% just to maintain the existing level of pension service. If the Government decides to take no action, if it takes the view that this is conjecture, that things are changing and that it will therefore do nothing now, the likelihood is that the pension prospects of the present and future generations will be at serious risk. The Government is right to take action. I fully supported the establishment of the national pensions reserve fund which was one of the most radical moves in terms of budgetary and financial strategy. For the first time, instead of operating entirely in the system of "pay as you go", the fund introduced a new strategic long-term element into budgetary financing and planning.This Bill is a significant extension although some speakers on the opposite side of the House have disputed its significance. The national pensions reserve fund is a partial pre-funding. The extent of the savings emanating from the implementation of the Bill's provisions has been questioned on both sides of the House. Other countries did not take action and are now faced with major problems. Due to our predominantly young population and high employment rates we are fortunate in having the time and the capacity to take action.The recommendations of the commission established in 1996 have been referred to in detail in the House. The report was adopted in principle by Government in 2001. Following the establishment of the pensions fund, many initiatives have been introduced to build on the planning for future pensions. Budget 2004 is being given legislative effect tonight and builds on those reforms especially with regard to age-related pensions reforms.Discussions on those recommendations have taken place between the social partners at various fora over the past number of years and some progress has been made. It is quite evident that there is no unanimity with regard to this Bill in the House.The Minister's guiding principles in formulating this Bill are laudable in general but I have some reservations. The principle that there should be no compulsion in the pensions system and that people are allowed to retire at a particular age if they are fit and well enough and willing to work is very positive and I can foresee a big take-up on that provision. I know of people who wanted to work beyond their retirement age who wished to use their experience and expertise. Those who opted out of the workplace for parenting reasons and, having reared their families, now wish to re-enter the workforce will be anxious to avail of the benefits of that provision.Some of the reservations have been articulated very forcefully in the House. I wish to speak about teachers from the experience of having taught in inner city Dublin in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. What I witnessed there gives conviction to what I say. I witnessed teachers in their 60s trying to teach in classes where, despite having tremendous records of achievement such as bringing children to scholarship level in previous years, they had come to a point where they were experiencing total burn-out and where their level of productivity was not just zilch but was very much in the negative zone and where they should not have been allowed to continue teaching. My concerns have been reinforced through the years in my political career.The proposal is to introduce the standard retirement age of 65 years for new entrants into the public service. While there is merit in the introduction of some changes to the pension terms of new entrants, it is my view that the introduction of a single retirement age of 65 for teachers needs careful examination. To put the matter in context, the teaching profession currently has what are known as "special measures" to allow a teacher retire on pension and lump sum from age 55 onwards, having completed 35 years of service. The current proposal in the Bill would seek to abolish these special measures and replace them with a single retirement age of 65. To adopt an inflexible stand on that aspect would be wrong and I predict that it will be changed in the future. Common sense and wisdom will prevail. If the Minister does not see fit to amend this Bill to take account of those serious concerns, future Ministers will have to do so. There is no way that an inflexible element of this Bill will work for every teacher. Most teachers can and will be very anxious to work up to the age of 65 but there will be a significant minority element who will simply be inappropriate in a classroom at either primary or secondary level beyond 60 years of age. I ask the Minister to consider amending the Bill in that respect.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I do not agree with the Minister and the other Members with regard to this Bill which in my view is a disaster. The idea of removing the cap on the retirement age is good for those who wish to remain in public service but forcing people to work until they are 65 is outrageous and a completely retrograde step. This is particularly the case for the teaching profession where people will be expected to work for 44 years before they can draw a full pension. People hit the wall sooner than they should in some cases. If a teacher has had enough of teaching at age 45 or 50, that teacher will be forced to stay in a job and I do not see any benefit either for the teacher or the students and their parents.Instead of complaining about bad teachers we should be examining ways of giving escape clauses to teachers so that they can opt out of teaching if they want to move on to something different or take a career break. I am aware that in Canada, teachers are given a year off to attend refresher courses. I believe that in the Canadian system, one tenth of a teacher's salary is withheld every year and this is repaid in the tenth year so that they can take time out to refresh themselves. A recent report recommended that people change careers every seven years. This does not mean a complete change of career but they should be given the opportunity to move sideways or upwards.The days of teachers going into classrooms and staying at the same level for the rest of their lives is over; people expect more flexibility in their work. It is a terrible indictment of the Government that it is introducing the compulsory threshold of 65 years before people can retire. This will have a devastating effect on public services. If the Government is genuine in its desire, it could by all means remove the cap on retirement age and give people who at 65 years of age are still full of the same enthusiasm as when they were 21 the option to continue working in the public service if they wish. However, to compel a person to work until 65 years of age is the wrong step and is too sudden a jump.Senator Bannon referred to members of local authorities. Those who work in local government should be rewarded with a pension and in particular those people who never benefited from a salary and those who sat on local authorities over the years and sacrificed much of their family and personal lives to serve the public, often with very little thanks at the polls. I ask the Minister to consider awarding pensions to those persons or to their families if the person is deceased, particularly in the case of councillors who served prior to 1999 before the current salary system was put in place.The purpose of this Bill is baffling especially when the Government issues contradictory statements about public services. In a previous budget the Minister for Finance announced his plans to cap the numbers in the public service but there now seems to be grave confusion about the numbers. According to FÁS a different figure has been issued lately and people are not too sure——

#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	275	This week there was great confusion among the public on this matter. I do not understand why the Government is compelling people to stay. The public service must be made attractive to people and they should be allowed to leave it if they so wish. Making someone stay in a job for 44 years is not the way to do it. Public service employees should have the option of getting out early.There has been a dramatic exodus from nursing, making our health system dependent on Filipino nurses to make up the shortfall. I am also concerned by recent reports of a future pensions bombshell in light of the benchmarking deal. The Minister of State might refer to this in his closing remarks. Due to the new benchmarking awards and the increases in the number of public service employees, the State will face a massive pensions bill in future years. The deficit will mean that workers in years to come will have to support numerous pensioners. A recent report also stated that in Europe alone, with its ageing population, up to 70 million emigrant workers will be needed.This Bill is a missed opportunity by the Government. By all means, abolish the maximum age for retiring but people should not be compelled to stay in the public service. I am surprised by the stance of the Leader of the House, a former teacher who has many teaching colleagues who are not impressed by this Bill. I accept that our population is ageing, people are living longer and there will be huge costs in years to come. I have raised with the Leader the need for a debate on the effects of the ageing population, as most will now die from degenerative diseases as opposed to sudden deaths, such as heart attacks.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I welcome the Minister of State. The report was compiled in recognition of the difficulty of the impending liability associated with public service pensions. It has been well discussed and has informed this Bill. It is important that the issue is dealt with now, well in advance of when it will impact on the economy. From discussions in the House on the economy, Members are well aware of the importance of facing up to such a situation now. This is notwithstanding the fact that some concerns have been raised by different interest groups. This issue is on the agenda and it is important that it is addressed now rather than in a fire brigade action at a later stage.Up to 280,000 people work in the public sector. I support Senator Fitzgerald's comments on the gross expenditure on public service pensions. Based on actuarial figures, the pensions bill is due to double between 1997 and 2012 and then quadruple between 2012 and 2027. Senator O'Toole has echoed the concerns of the unions on this issue and also that the Bill does not deal with the issue of early retirement. Notwithstanding that, a prudent approach must be taken to the financial management of the economy, which was not done in the past. The year 1987 is seen as a watershed in terms of how the economy was addressed and how certain measures were put in place to ensure the same problem never re-occurred. I would, therefore, be more concerned if the Government's effort was to retrospectively address this issue.This Bill is for new entrants to the public sector. It will be like any contract available to a new employee. They will see from the start what they are getting into and they can make their own decision as to whether they choose the public service or their chances are better in the private sector. I admit that the safety mechanism for those in the public sector is much better than for those who chose to work in the private sector.In establishing 65 years as a minimum retirement age, it recognises that we must address our changing demographics. The future is considered with good financial planning in mind and such issues will not be dealt with out of context at a later stage. The most important element of the Bill and the report is the capacity to address ageism. Ageism is one of the most outrageous perceptions evolving in this country. The manner in which we treat politics helps to inform the entire debate on ageism in our society. One only has to look around Europe and the US to see political figures such as Mr. Jacques Chirac who is 69 years of age and Mr. Berlusconi who is aged 67 years. Mr. George Bush senior was aged 64 years when he was first elected. However, there is a perception in Ireland that after 50 years of age, one is over the hill and any chances of high office are diminished. This perception informs all other elements in society. If this can be focused on, which this Bill does, there will be a much more mature approach to the concept of people's active involvement in life after 65 years of age.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I thank Senator Dooley for sharing his time with me. I welcome the Minister of State.All Members will agree that the reforms allowing public servants the option to remain at work after 65 years of age are welcome. This is reflected in the teaching profession where many retired teachers continue on as substitute teachers. It also highlights the lack of qualified teachers, but that is for another debate.There was a diplomatic sentence in the Minister of State's speech on time being given to new Oireachtas Members to become aware of the new age limits and where they are "in a position to take this on board to fit their own circumstances". Senator Ormonde said this may make it difficult for young people to become involved in politics. At an election convention in Ballinasloe, I noted a 21 year old candidate was selected to contest the town council elections. If a person of that age contested a Dáil election, given the changes we have had, it would be difficult for them to start at such a young age. I hope this issue will be examined again.There is concern about new teachers entering the profession now. The anticipated changes to employment, announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget, will increase the difficulties for them. I must declare an interest as a member of the INTO. I support the INTO in seeking modest changes to allow for the right to retire on full pension and with a lump sum after 40 years service. While many professions may wish to work up until 65 years and beyond, there has been an approach in the teaching profession to maintain the option of taking retirement due to burn-out and other such matters. I hope the Minister for Finance will look at those proposals, as well as defending the pension age and the retention of the dedicated early retirement scheme for all public servants. Of course that is welcome but there is another proposal on the care of the elderly and, for example, the 1% levy for the nursing home subvention which we should also consider. The Minister of State has been good about not borrowing and says we will not pay a 1% levy for pensions but the nursing home subvention remains. The Departments of Health and Children and of Social and Family Affairs have issued a joint paper outlining ways to provide for long-term care, whether in nursing homes, communities or health board hospitals. That links with the issue of people living longer and needing care which I hope will also be addressed.

I do not have to declare an interest in this because the Bill does not affect current Members of the Oireachtas or office holders but will affect those who intend to participate in public life in the future. It is understandable that Senators on all sides have a view on the impact the Bill might have on citizens' participation in the institutions of State and in the public institutions of State. The teaching profession has also shown a great interest in this Bill. There was a very public division of opinion between the commission report and the stated position of the teaching profession whose concern stems from anxiety about sustaining the traditional high standard of our teaching profession. It does not affect the current generation of teachers but will affect those who enter the profession from next year.Various ideological pejoratives are attached to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in public debate. In the context of this legislation however, he is a very far-seeing Minister and his concerns do not relate to this generation or the epoch that will culminate at the next general election.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	282	He envisages in this legislation a measure that will come into operation when many of us, as a matter of actuarial probability, have passed away. In discussing this Bill we must consider that it is providing in legislation for a framework that will begin to impact in 2044. That gives a somewhat arid speculative tone to this debate but I understand the concerns expressed by those in public life and the teaching profession about the possible implications of this measure.Senator Bannon inquired why the Taoiseach was excluded from the definition of a new entrant. He appeared to be concerned that some material benefit accrued to ex-taoisigh in this provision when in fact it will do no more than maintain their existing positions, as is true for the rest of us. There will be no distinction in the future between the Taoiseach and other Members as far as his or her Member's pension is concerned. A Taoiseach elected after the next election will be in the same position as the other new entrants but, uniquely, this legislation will not affect the Taoiseach's position in so far as the pension stems from the office. That marks the importance of the office. Senator Bannon and others raised the question of the introduction of pensions for local authority council members. Since May 2000 severance payments of up to three times the annual representation payments are payable to council members depending on the period of service, hence salary is payable from the forthcoming local elections. I will draw the Minister's attention to the Senators' concerns in that regard.Senators Mansergh and McDowell suggested that our dependency could be more favourable than that which I outlined in my introductory speech on Second Stage. That is possible and I hope it is the case but we cannot be certain of that, and as some Senators commented, developments in other European states have moved in the opposite direction. Senator Browne referred to the ageing and greying of Europe and in some countries the dependency ratios are approaching crisis levels. The political response to this in Germany, France and Scandinavia has disimproved the terms of existing pensions in those countries. That is why I suggested at the outset that the Minister is very far-seeing in this area, not alone in this legislation and in acting on the recommendations of the Pensions Board but also in the establishment of the pensions reserve fund. It is clear that many of these countries left it too late to introduce the necessary measures. We have time to plan and I can assure Senator McDowell that the figures will be updated. Even if the dependency ratio is better than the projected rate we will have a major problem in the future. The Minister is anxious to ensure that only new entrants will be affected, if they continue to enjoy very good pensions by private sector standards.While I understand Senator Browne's concerns, we live in a time of great demographic change. The average life span has lengthened and we must legislate to take account of that. We cannot ignore it. The attitude of a person entering a job today is fundamentally different from that of a person entering a job several decades ago. The modest increase in the actual retirement age for most public servants is between 60 and 65. Many stay until they reach 65 and there will be no saving in respect of such persons.Senator Mansergh thinks the envisaged saving of €300 million seems rather low but that is calculated in current price terms. Public service pensions cost approximately €1,500 million, so €300 million, or 20% of that figure in current terms, is a substantial sum especially when this item of public expenditure is a recurrent annual item in the budget. The €1,500 million outlay on public service pensions makes it a saving of approximately 20% which is significant. Senator Bannon referred to "bad faith" on the official side in not proposing a retirement band between the ages of 62 and 67 which the working group discussed with the union and the staff. That option was discussed in the context of efforts to reach an agreed package but the Minister found it impossible to reach agreement and indicated in his 2004 budget speech that he is willing to make various improvements in pension terms, such as for those on a low income, and he has dropped the 1% contribution recommendation.Senators O'Toole, Bannon, Ormonde, Fitzgerald and Kitt referred to teachers and politicians. The recommendations on teachers stem from the commission's recommendations and will arise only 30 or 40 years hence. Senator O'Toole suggested that every teacher must continue to the age of 65. This does not take account of a package of flexibilities which the commission recommended, such as actuarially determined early retirement, or neutral early retirement combined with the purchase of additional pensionable service. There is also the option of moving to less demanding work as a person approaches retirement.

I appreciate the Senator's concern but we must look at the pension report in which he participated and which makes it clear we are facing very stark demographic facts for which we must plan and adjust. We must revise our work practices accordingly. Several Senators raised the issue of the difficulty of dealing with work challenges as teachers age. The pension commission received and considered a wide range of submissions from groups seeking early retirement terms given the stress employees in the relevant areas experience. This applied to numerous areas in the public service. Stress is recognised as a factor in modern working and needs to be addressed. However, the Commission on Public Service Pensions was looking at pension provision and considered the most appropriate response was to introduce a range of additional flexibilities in the public service that would enable public sector employees to plan to retire earlier if they wished, for example through a combination of purchasing additional pension and actuarially reduced early retirements or by reverting to a lower level in the years before retirement without suffering a pensions penalty.

The Minister for Education and Science will have ample opportunity to address the operational difficulties involved in that time span.Senator O'Toole asked about career breaks. A person on a career break with a right to return will not come within the scope of the Bill. Such people will not be new entrants and this is quite clear. I am advised of this and I am happy to put it on the record of the House. Only new entrants are affected by this measure.The Senator also spoke of the burn-out of teachers. A limited pilot scheme of early retirement for teachers was agreed as part of the PCW restructuring agreement between the Department and the teachers' unions early in 1997. The scheme provided for early retirements for teachers experiencing different kinds of professional difficulty as well as teachers whose posts became surplus to requirements. Under the agreement the pilot scheme was to be reviewed in the light of the pensions commission report. The commission recommended continuation of the scheme for a further five years after which it should be subject to another review.The Minister has not departed from the commission's recommendations. He envisages that the pilot scheme will be reviewed in a couple of years' time. Accordingly, he has not addressed this issue in the Bill. No decision has been reached on this matter. There are numerous issues and it is a matter for operational decision between the Minister for Education and Science and the relevant staff interests in future years. I appreciate the often passionate concern expressed by Senator O'Toole and others about the future of the profession, just as many Senators have expressed concern at our own future in public life and whether the implications for pensions will have an effect on those who chose to participate in public life.The Commission on Public Service Pensions made recommendations. I confess to being somewhat surprised at them. The Minister decided to add to them. I believe he has decided in principle that accepting the pension report is important for safeguarding the economy into the future. The Government has decided that the new arrangements should apply to us and we should provide respectable ballast to the proposal.I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate and I look forward to addressing the detailed issues on Committee Stage.

I know the Minister of State has connections with Longford. I believe his grandfather stood for election in the constituency of Longford-Westmeath at one time. I am sure he will put his shoulder to the wheel to get additional industry for my county of Longford.I emphasise in the strongest terms possible the urgent need for the Tánaiste to make a comprehensive statement on Cardinal Health's decision not to proceed to build a pharmaceutical facility in Longford, which was announced in 2000, and to outline what intervention, if any was made by her to avert this action and save the 1,300 jobs promised to Longford. The withdrawal by Cardinal Health is a massive letdown and disappointment for all Longford people. It calls into question the bona fides of the Tánaiste and the Government in making the original announcement regarding Cardinal Health in the run-up to the last general election.The Tánaiste promised 1,300 jobs for Longford, which were to come on stream this year. Her party colleague, Deputy Mae Sexton, stated in the strongest possible terms during her election campaign that the project would be delivered. As we now see the only thing that was delivered was a seat for the Progressive Democrats in Longford. We are very disappointed in Longford. Deputy Sexton's response is flawed. Yesterday she failed to turn up at a county council meeting.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	306	While 1,300 jobs may represent nothing but numbers to the Tánaiste to achieve her purpose, these jobs were more than empty words to County Longford. Their loss is a major blow to the economy of the county and the entire midlands. Cardinal Health was expected to become the largest employer in the area. Longford County Council was put in considerable debt since the announcement in 2000. It had to foot a huge interest bill on an overdraft to buy the land for Cardinal Health. It cost the council up to €200,000 in services etc. to keep the site on stream for the past four years. There is no need to ask the Minister of State what Cardinal Health lost over this deal, as it lost absolutely nothing. Longford County Council and the people of the county have lost out greatly by Cardinal Health's decision. Ultimately, Longford County Council and the Longford area must not be left to carry the can. The Government must pick up the tab for not honouring its commitment to County Longford.Hope springs eternal and this hope or perhaps desperation leads us to turn a blind eye to the obvious. We smelt a rat when Cardinal Health did not apply for planning permission in 2001 or 2002. There was no way that the original timeframe would be met. Following the subsequent deferral, we should have been told the truth. When the task force was set up we were informed at a county council meeting that its target was to create 4,000 jobs by 2005.With less than a year to go, the number of jobs created is not a quarter of that figure. In light of this abandonment of 1,300 jobs for Longford, there is clearly something wrong with the Minister's job creation policy. Despite the recent setting up of the Abbott plant, the county has had the worst unemployment figures in the country over the years. Unemployment in Longford currently stands at twice the national average. The jobs crisis is set to spiral out of control.I plead with the Tánaiste to meet with Longford County Council and others with an interest in the development of our county and try to deliver a substantial number of jobs, because Longford and the surrounding area has suffered a blow with the loss of Cardinal Health. Much development throughout the region was dependent on Cardinal Health and much hope was invested in it. I would appreciate if the Minister of State would convey to the Tánaiste that we are not happy with her performance or that of her Deputy in County Longford.

Cardinal Health Incorporated has decided not to proceed with its proposed investment in a new pharmaceuticals facility in Longford due to a significant change in its business priorities following a series of corporate acquisitions over recent times. The company had taken an option on land for the project in Longford from Longford County Council.At the time of the announcement in December 2000 of Cardinal Health's intention to build a pharmaceutical facility in Longford, this project was seen as an important part of the company's strategy for Europe. Cardinal Health decided in October 2002 to postpone its proposed investment in Longford for up to two years due to changing business priorities. Since 2000, Cardinal Health has grown by acquisition and has acquired additional manufacturing capacity in the USA and Puerto Rico. In December 2003, Cardinal Health acquired the UK Intercare Group plc, a contract manufacturing and distribution business with six manufacturing facilities in the UK, Belgium and France. This acquisition satisfied Cardinal Health's manufacturing capacity needs in Europe.Since the approval of the Longford project in 2000, the IDA has maintained continuing contact with Cardinal Health and stressed that a greenfield project in Longford would augment the company's existing strategy. This included regular meetings in Ireland and the US with senior corporate management on advancing the project. However, the recent Intercare acquisition changed the position. The decision not to proceed in Longford was communicated by Cardinal Health to IDA Ireland and Longford County Council at a recent meeting in London.IDA Ireland remains committed to the development of the Longford area. There is a degree of confidence arising from the on-site progress in Longford of Abbott, which plans to provide up to 600 jobs there, with related sub-supply opportunities for indigenous companies. Enterprise Ireland continues to work with its strong base of client companies in County Longford. Examples of recent positive developments by EI-supported companies in Longford include expansions by Green Isle Limited, Century Homes and Fenelon Engineering Limited. Green Isle Longford grew strongly in 2003, more than doubling its full-time employment to 160 people. Century Homes, the innovative manufacturer of timber-frame housing, is expanding and doubling its workforce from 40 to 80 people. Fenelon Engineering, employing 129 people, has completed the consolidation of its operations from three locations to the 90,000 sq. ft. former Barbour Threads premises.Under Enterprise Ireland's 2002 community enterprise scheme, the Longford County Enterprise Board, as a lead partner, was approved €330,500 in capital and management grants for the provision of a community enterprise centre in Longford. The board is seeking full planning permission for this development, which will support new start-up enterprises. Under the Government's major decentralisation programme announced in the budget, 130 jobs are to be relocated to Longford. This move demonstrates the Government's commitment to balanced regional development and will provide a further boost to enterprise development in the county. The Tánaiste is satisfied that the combined efforts of the State development agencies under the aegis of her Department, in co-operation with local interests, should provide an adequate framework to ensure continued job creation and investment in the Longford area.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I welcome the Minister to the House. We repeatedly read in the newspapers of cases before the courts in which no places of safety or treatment can be found for some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Children, adolescents and adults with serious conditions must be treated outside the country. Adults with mental illness, intellectual disorders or autism spectrum disorders or acquired brain injuries can be kept in prison or other places of detention because there are no proper facilities for them here. This is especially true if there are behavioural problems involved. I am sure there are many people who do not come before the courts who also have to leave the country to have their problems treated.Children and adolescents are constantly before the courts with mental illness, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder and acquired brain disease. The reason they are there in the first place is that, as judges in the children's court have complained for years, there are no places of safety to which these children can be sent. I am sure the Minister is aware of a case which has repeatedly come before the courts in the last few weeks and was reported by Carl O'Brien in The Irish Times. A boy of 17, who was brain damaged in a car crash and has a mental age of seven to eight, had to be kept in Cloverhill Prison for about six weeks. While it was recognised that the prison officers did everything they could to facilitate the boy, allowing him to telephone his aunts and so on, it was not a suitable place to have a child with a condition such as this.It is extraordinary that there is such a terrible lack of facilities in Ireland even though we have been aware of this problem for several years. People in the Republic of Ireland — adults and children — must be referred to Northern Ireland or our neighbouring island, or further abroad, for places in which they can be kept in safety and receive treatment if possible. People from the few institutions in which adolescents can be kept have asked me whether I can do more to obtain teaching for these children. Some of them need to keep up with schoolwork as best they can for when they recover from their mental illnesses. This must be costing the taxpayer an enormous amount of money. Would it not be better to build suitable facilities here and staff them? The problem has not started with the current Administration; it has been there for a long time. It is socially unacceptable to place people in institutions so far away from their families; if they are to be rehabilitated it is essential that they are as near to their families as possible.I have not been able to obtain up-to-date figures of the cost per day of the UK National Health Service medium-secure units, but in 1998 the cost per day was £300 sterling, which adds up to more than £2,000 per week — about €3,000 — and I am sure it costs a great deal more now. At the time, a low-security unit cost about two thirds of this. I cannot understand why we cannot build our own units and recruit staff who will look after these patients, because they would be far better off near their families.Recently the board of the National Disability Authority said its members would visit the worst hospital in the State. This is how the Inspector of Mental Hospitals described the Central Mental Hospital in his last report. The cost per day there is a few hundred euro. It would be much cheaper to rehabilitate that hospital — to rebuild it, if possible — and create other institutions especially for children so they will not need to be sent to institutions abroad, which is not helping the Irish taxpayer and is certainly not helping the recovery and rehabilitation of these people.

The Minister wishes to thank the Senator for raising this matter. The general policy of the Department on the development of services for persons with disabilities and those with mental illness has seen considerable change in recent years. The Department seeks to put in place a broad range of appropriate support services in consultation with the health boards, the other relevant service providers and persons with disabilities or mental illness and their carers. Best practice must be incorporated as a norm and the Department must take account of internationally recognised advances in treatment or approaches to meeting individual needs. It is only in particular circumstances that individuals would be placed in services outside this country and decisions on those placements are a matter for the relevant health board.The Minister does not have the statistics available this evening but he has asked the health board to furnish them to him. He will then forward them to the Senator. Investment has been made in service development. Additional revenue in capital funding, amounting to €643 million, has been invested in health funded support services for persons with disabilities since 1997. This includes an additional €25 million in current expenditure which was made available by the Minister for Finance in the 2004 budget for services for persons with disabilities. Capital funding will also be allocated for these services from within the 2004 allocation.Since 1997, an additional €80 million has been allocated to the mental health services and the total amount spent on mental health services on the current side is now over €600 million. This has allowed for developments in child and adolescent psychiatry, psychiatry of later life, liaison psychiatry, rehabilitation psychiatry, suicide prevention programmes and support for the voluntary sector. An expert group on mental health policy is preparing a national policy framework for the further development of the mental health services, updating the 1984 policy document, Planning for the Future. The expert group was established in 2003 and will examine a number of issues, including models of care, the respective roles of medication and complementary therapies, measures to reduce stigma and psychiatric services for specialised groups such as the homeless, prisoners and children or adolescents. Submissions were requested from interested organisations in October 2003 and more than 140 submissions were received. They are now being considered by the group.The strategic review of disability services is taking place in accordance with a commitment in Sustaining Progress, the social partnership agreement which runs from 2003 to 2005. It has a similar timeframe to the expert group on mental health services. The outcome of both reviews will assist in ensuring that services are being delivered in an appropriate, effective and cost efficient manner and will identify targeted areas to be addressed in planning for the future.The detailed information requested by the Senator about the numbers and costs associated with persons with disabilities or mental illness who have been placed in services outside this country over the past five years is not readily available in the Department. The Department has requested this information from the chief executive officers of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. It will be forwarded to the Senator as soon as it becomes available and I look forward to discussing it with her on receipt of same. However, the number of cases in which persons with disabilities or mental illness are placed in services abroad will be small in the overall context of the numbers availing of these services.The Senator referred to a recent matter which came before the courts. Indeed, I dealt with this matter in the course of an Adjournment debate in the Lower House. I share the concern of the Senator. It was unacceptable that a child of 17 and a half years was incarcerated in a prison when other treatment was clearly required. It should be borne in mind, however, that under our criminal law, a person over 17 years of age is of full age where penal treatment is concerned. That will change when the Children Act 2001 is fully implemented. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is required under the legislation to establish separate facilities for the penal detention of 16 and 17 year olds. Nevertheless, even those provisions permit the Department to establish those facilities within the confines of an existing prison or institution.As a result of the concern I had about this matter, I sought a report from the South Western Area Health Board and a placement was arranged in Ballydowd, near Lucan. The assessment of the individual in question is extremely complex. In fairness to the health board, its legal representatives described the case as practically unique in their experience. The essential problem of diagnosis, as I understand it, was whether the cause of the condition and the signs the individual displayed was challenging behaviour and a predisposition to engage in challenging behaviour or if the brain injury, which was much referred to in public comment on the case, had an impact on the pattern of behaviour. Conflicting views on this issue were expressed by various parties and it was not possible for the health board to arrive at a definitive conclusion at any stage in the proceedings. That is the reason the option of having the child examined abroad has been raised in the course of the hearings.However, it is an operational matter for the health board and I am glad it was able to meet its responsibilities. As has been made clear at all stages, it was not a question of resources or of the health board, as was wrongly suggested, seeking to wash its hands of responsibility in the matter when the individual reached the age of majority. The matter arose in criminal proceedings to which the health board was not a party and, as far as both criminal proceedings were concerned, the individual was subject to adult treatment. The case was heard in the Children's Court because that part of the Children Act has been commenced. All individuals under the age of 18 years of age are brought before the Children's Court.I agree it is important to evaluate constantly the services we have provided in this area. In recent years, there has been substantial investment in new buildings for holding young children. I propose to commence this spring the provisions of the Children Act dealing with special care orders. That will give a proper legislative basis to the detention of persons under 18 years in these institutions. However, there has been well documented publicity about the difficulty of recruiting and retaining staff in them. Clearly, questions also arise about the restraint and other therapies that are available to help the children in these institutions.These are pertinent issues but the State has made a substantial investment in this area. The current cost of staffing these institutions is also substantial. There is an onus on all involved, both on the professional and on the political side, to devise solutions that will improve the outcomes for these children.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I thank the Minister for his extended reply. I am well aware of the difficulty in getting staff for these institutions. However, the Minister must grit his teeth and try to do something for these troubled young children. He will have the support of all Members of the House. I look forward to receiving the detailed information from the Department.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I am anxious that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs outline why a family member who remains at home to care for an elderly parent or relative is disqualified from receiving carer's allowance if he or she works for a few hours on the small family farm. The carer's allowance has been most successful but farmers, particularly small farmers, are finding it increasingly difficult to comply with the hour rule that applies.Family carers provide high levels of care at home for children, older people, those who are terminally ill and people with long-term serious illnesses. The carer's life centres around the needs of these people and he or she must be constantly available. Over the past year I have attended a number of oral hearings on behalf of small farmers who have not qualified for the carer's allowance. The Carers Association reckons that carers save the State €380 per week on alternative residential care and, depending on the level of nursing care, the saving can be more than €1,200 per week.Sons and daughters of elderly parents who must work on the farm cannot comply with the regulations. A small farm cannot be run successfully on less than ten hours per week. This is the reason I appeal to the Department to increase the number of hours a person is allowed to work outside the home from ten hours to 20 hours. This is a reasonable request from a section of the population which finds it difficult to comply with the current criteria. I ask the Minister to look at this provision more carefully for the sake of rural Ireland and small farmers. The Minister will have my support if he changes this anomaly.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who provide certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.One of the principal conditions for receipt of the allowance is that full-time care and attention is required and is provided by the carer. As I understand the issue, the interpretation of this condition is at the nub of the problem the Senator outlined to the House. Under the legislative provisions full-time care and attention means that the care recipient must be so disabled as to require continuous supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with his or her normal personal needs. In addition, the care recipient must be so disabled as to be likely to require this care for at least 12 months.The Department takes the view that full-time care and attention does not necessarily mean 24 hours in each day. Full-time care and attention can be considered to apply where there is an ongoing and daily commitment by the carer, equivalent to that of a full day's work and which also generally results in the carer not being able to support himself or herself through normal full-time employment.Accordingly, carer's allowance applications are assessed on an individual basis and the current arrangements are applied in a flexible manner, having due regard to the needs of the carer, the person requiring care and within the legislative provisions that apply. Special measures were introduced in 1999 to allow carers to engage in employment or self-employment for up to ten hours per week while still meeting the conditions. This being said, the carer's allowance scheme is designed for full-time carers and part-time carers do not fall within the scheme objectives.In instances where a carer is engaged in farm activity, such cases are, in normal circumstances, investigated by investigating officers of the Department to establish whether the full-time care and attention condition is being fulfilled. The matters which are the subject of this debate appear to be related to the social welfare entitlements of a particular unspecified individual. As the Senator is aware, under social welfare legislation decisions on claims or entitlements must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. As is the case with all statutory social welfare entitlements, where a person is dissatisfied with a decision of a deciding officer regarding a claim for carer's allowance, he or she has a right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.The development of a range of supports for carers has been a priority of the Government for a number of years. During that time it has increased expenditure on carers' payments by 310% — from €46.36 million in 1997 to an estimated €190 million at the end of 2003. The number of carers on the carer's allowance is up by almost 140% since the Government came into office in 1997 and is now almost 22,000. Also, the rate of carer's allowance has been increased by 76% or €68.28 for those over 66 and by 56% or €50.08 for those under 66. The qualification conditions for carer's allowance have also been significantly improved.Government policy continues to be strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. To this end, my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, recently established a working group to review the operation and administration of the nursing home subvention scheme. One of the objectives of this review will be to examine the issue of home care and to make recommendations for the funding of home care as an alternative to long-term residential care.In 2003, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs launched a consultancy study on the future financing of long-term care. Significant issues are discussed in the study, including those regarding benefit design and cost and financing of long-term care. In order to make progress on these areas, officials are currently preparing a consultation document to accompany the study. This document will focus all interested parties on the specific issues we need to address. On completion of the consultation process, a working group, which will include all relevant parties, will examine the policy, cost and service delivery issues associated with the care of older people.The State cannot and would not wish to replace the personal support and care provided within the family and the community. Therefore, its primary role is to provide adequate support to carers and to those for whom they care, to enable them to remain in their own communities for as long as possible. Building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to carers.
