            <p eId="para_1">53. <b>Deputy Thomas Byrne</b> asked the <b>Minister for Education and Skills</b> if there has been engagement with teaching principals on easing their workload; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [29603/18]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_1">
            <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_2">In light of the increased workload for teaching principals, has the Minister for Education and Skills had any engagement with the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, or the new organisation set up in response to this crisis, the forum for teaching principals in primary schools? What they are saying is not fake news, despite what the Government might want to believe.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Education and Skills<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">I have discussed with teaching principals a range of their concerns and have had more formal engagement with the relevant stakeholders, including the IPPN and the INTO. I have also been in correspondence with the forum for teaching principals in primary schools on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> The education system has certain characteristics, particularly the relatively large number of small schools, which have influenced the evolution of the principal’s role. In the case of principals in smaller schools, while management and administrative duties may be smaller in scale than those of larger schools, they must be undertaken in addition to their full-time teaching duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> I am committed to increasing investment in leadership across the school system. The creation of the centre for school leadership, the new approach to middle management and the fostering of innovation across school clusters will all help support teaching principals in their work.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> This year I am funding almost 4,600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018-19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days, depending on the size of the school, an increase of two to four days, respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> I also commenced the restoration of middle management posts as part of an agreed distributed leadership model to reduce the workload of principals, including teaching principals, which will see a new assistant principal post in most smaller schools. I announced up to 50 principal release cluster posts which will be put in place from the start of the next academic year. This measure will assist teaching principals to plan their release days more effectively for the benefit of the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process, alongside the many other demands from the education sector.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_9">I acknowledge a little bit of progress has been made on this issue. However, many teaching principals in small schools feel they are at breaking point. The Government is very much focused on Dublin with its recent announcement on schools necessary in the growing commuting areas. It is key, however, that it remembers the thousands of small schools around the country which have teaching principals. They are the lifeblood of their communities, providing the same education the larger schools, prioritised by the Government, do.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> I have met with teaching principals - I am sure the Minister has even met some from time to time - who feel they cannot continue to absorb the stress and overload associated with the work and the administration they must do. I met one principal yesterday who is in a four-teacher school, yet manages a staff of 23, including part-time staff. The school has a large autism spectrum disorder, ASD unit, special education teachers and a large number of special needs assistants, SNAs, who all have to be managed. It is not possible to manage such a number with the particular teaching workload the principal in question has. Some regard needs to be given to the realities on the ground. It is not just the number of teachers in the school but the whole school community that the teacher principal has to manage.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills">
            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_11">I acknowledge this. I had a useful discussion in County Meath recently with teaching principals about exactly these points. It was at a similar meeting in Donegal where the idea of expanding the clusters, a small initiative in the past, to 50 this year was developed. I am glad we have been able to develop and implement it. It means teaching principals have a single person who acts as a substitute teacher to a range of principals so they can plan their work more effectively. We are expanding the release days to ensure principals with teaching duties can plan more effectively. We are increasing the resource in areas, such as special education, to ensure children are supported appropriately.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> Besides the points referred to in my reply, we are investing in helping school principals to develop their leadership roles. This year up to 1,000 school principals will get mentoring, coaching or an opportunity to participate in a third level course in order that they can better manage this area. I acknowledge this is an area where we need to do better. It will have a significant impact on the quality of learning in schools. Leadership is key and I recognise that for teaching principals this is a particular challenge.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">The exclusion of special education teachers when calculating teaching principals' salaries is unfair as well. The way it is set up acts as a disincentive to principals who wish to set up ASD units in their schools. It leads to a significant amount of extra management, as well as dealing with extra crises which sometimes occur with challenging behaviour from pupils in such units.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> A strong case has been made by many of the teaching principals that one release day a week is a point which should be examined. Is the Minister considering it? I accept it has to be considered within the country’s financial constraints. However, we have to look at the constraints the principals have too. They are doing fantastic work but are not getting recognition for it. It is important we give them that recognition and allow them to fulfil their management and teaching roles. There has to be a better balance between the two.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> The Minister should introduce a pathway for principals to be appointed on a temporary contract basis. For example, a school could offer a principal a contract for six or ten years. After that time, the principal could then step back into the workforce in the school. That should be examined for dealing with this issue, as well as a way of dealing with teaching supply.</p>

            <p eId="para_16">I take the Deputy's point. A principal in a school with one or two mainstream teachers will get 17 release days. By contrast, a principal with five or six mainstream teachers will get 29 release days. The proposal would be to go to 36 for everyone without that grading across the different sizes of school. Whether that is a justifiable approach will need to be assessed. It will cost approximately €12 million across all schools. As there are 1,750 teaching principals, it would not be an insignificant cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> All of these concerns will be factored into our work as we approach the budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_20">I thank the Deputy for the question. The framework for the junior cycle presents a dual approach to assessment and it supports student learning over the three years of the cycle. It measures achievement at the end of those three years. This dual approach reduces the focus on one externally assessed examination as a means of assessing students and increases the prominence given to classroom-based assessment and formative assessment, providing a more rounded assessment of the education of each young person. This change of emphasis arises from an acknowledgement that students learn best when teachers provide feedback that helps students to understand how their learning can be improved. As part of the phasing in of the new framework for the junior cycle, the new junior cycle music specification will be introduced to schools from September 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> The junior cycle profile of achievement is a school-based award issued by schools that draws upon and reports on achievement across a wide range of assessments, including classroom-based assessments by teachers, as well as State examinations marked by the State Examinations Commission. The assessment of a number of practical subjects, including music, for the purpose of the junior cycle profile of achievement will comprise two classroom-based assessments undertaken in recognised schools, a practical examination and a written examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> Where students take extra subjects outside of their school setting, these subjects cannot satisfy the requirements for classroom-based assessments by recognised schools and cannot, therefore, be included as part of the profile of achievement. Students who wish to study additional subjects, such as music, outside their school have a number of other certification avenues open to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_23">I welcome the changes that allow for more classroom-based assessment and more continuous assessment. I am a great advocate of these. They should be introduced at leaving certificate level also. I often talk about this. We should not have so much emphasis on one or two examinations, bearing in mind the pressure they bring.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Music is a particular and unique subject. Many smaller schools, particularly in rural areas, do not offer it because they do not have the resources or teachers, yet the Department's primary school curriculum document acknowledges music offers lifelong opportunities for the development of imagination, sensitivity, inventiveness, risk-taking, enjoyment, creativity and self-esteem. So many people have such talent in this area that it would be a shame not to look outside the box a little where a school cannot offer music to determine whether the subject could be offered by external tutors. The reality is that most students taking music in a school that offers it will be getting additional help from an outside tutor in any case. Perhaps this is something we could consider.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_25">Music is offered in just short of 600 post-primary schools out of a total of 711. Therefore, the vast majority offer it. When the National Council for Curriculum Assessment developed the curriculum, the question of students studying the subject on an external basis was discussed but it was agreed, through the development process and subsequent consultation, that the specification and its assessment, particularly as the latter featured the new school-based classroom assessment, should be designed for study within the school in the first instance. It was felt there is an intricate connection. It was felt it was appropriate to have the teacher carry out the classroom-based assessment and the teaching in a school setting that is also an examination centre for the written examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> In all cases to date, students who sit the music examination do so in their own school, not in an external location. What the Deputy proposes was ruled out but it is not categorically ruled out for all time. To be a recognised school, a school has to deliver an entire curriculum. Fragmenting the curriculum, with a bit run in a specialist Gaelscoil, a bit in a specialist Irish language centre and another bit in a specialist Irish music centre, for example, would result in the breaking up of the system. It is then harder to deliver a coherent curriculum and have a unified State examination system. That seems to have been the consideration. As this evolves and beds in, it can be reviewed.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">I thank the Minister. I am glad he is not completely closed to considering this again. As he said, just a handful of schools are affected. The reason we raise this, however, is that one or two people have come to us about this. What I propose would obviously not be workable for the majority of subjects but music is regarded in a particular way and is unique in that sense. In special education, some people have home tutors who are accredited by the Teaching Council. Something similar could be done with music tutors for students in a school that does not offer music where those students wish to sit the junior certificate music examination. Many people have a talent in this area and want to continue with music. If one has not done music at junior certificate level, it is very difficult to do so at leaving certificate level. There is usually a barrier in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> Where schools do not offer music, I ask the Minister to consider having a system involving external tutors. I agree there could not be external tutors for every single subject but I propose them for music because of its unique nature. There are similar models. The tutors in the home tutor programme in the education system are external tutors but they are accredited by the Teaching Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">The Deputy probably answered her question. The philosophy is that education is integral and that a school should not have music or another subject as a specialism that is outsourced. The thinking is to have a whole-school approach whereby a child, particularly in the junior cycle, can have a range of experiences delivered in an integrated way and develop his or her own personality. Disintegrating them is not the philosophy behind the junior cycle. As the Deputy said, home tuition would not be regarded as optimal in many situations. Mainstream and integrated education are preferred because education is ultimately a social activity. That is the reason the presumption has been against the model suggested by the Deputy. When the system beds in, all these matters will be re-examined. It is only starting in September so it needs the three-year run. We will see how that evolves.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">I believed the Minister of State was to answer this question.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> The position on student accommodation is that we have developed a programme for the construction of purpose-built units. There is a pipeline of 7,000 student places in construction. Since the programme was started, 2,500 additional places have come on stream. The expectation is that we will match that figure in the coming year, with almost 3,000 in addition coming on stream. The question of the cost of these places has been assessed by the Minister of State along with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. They are determining the extent to which the rent pressure zones can be considered as a model for dealing with the pressure on student accommodation.</p>

          <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_15">
            <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_34">I am sure the Minister of State responsible for higher education has been unavoidably detained but, looking at the delegation order for her powers, I believe the Minister has retained most of the powers for himself. Therefore, I am quite satisfied he knows what is going on with third level accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> The issue of rent pressure zones is one important aspect of the problem. My party and other Opposition parties published legislation in this regard. The solution is as simple as the Minister going to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and asking him to adopt our legislation. That addresses one part of the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> The rents are already very high. Rent pressure zones do not cover new accommodation, which is now being offered at very high prices. It will in the main be offered to very wealthy students coming from abroad. We welcome students coming from abroad — we need them and academics from abroad — but we have to make sure our students have somewhere to stay. Surely part of the university experience is moving away from home, engaging on campus, broadening one's mind and learning and studying while engaging in civic society on campus. Students do that in a variety of ways through organisations, whether related to sport, debating or another activity. They cannot do so if there is no accommodation. There are so many things the Minister could do. We could remove the bar on borrowing for institutes of technology. We could offer some incentives in respect of reducing the rents.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">We could also have a capital plan for student accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">The current provision of purpose-built student accommodation exceeds the target set in the plan published shortly after the housing plan. We are meeting and exceeding the targets. The application of the rent control regime to the student accommodation sector is a little more difficult than the Deputy suggests in that rent arrangements in student accommodation are by way of a licence, not a traditional tenancy. There is not the same tenancy security provided in student accommodation, which is part year and often involves fairly short tenancies and fresh lettings. The issue that needs to be examined is whether this alternative model, which is built around licences and short-term lettings, can be adapted with the same sort of evidence base to apply the rent pressure zones as has been the case in ordinary housing tenancies. This work is under way between the two Departments. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy English, will report progress in that regard soon.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">The issue of licence distinction is one of the first things one learns when studying law in college and it is a red herring in regard to this particular issue. There is no reason that the rent pressure zone regime cannot be applied to this sector. It is simply a matter of drafting the provision in the appropriate way. We can restrict price increases for licences. We have done so in respect of leases even though we were told there were legal difficulties with doing so. We were told that could not be done and it would be unconstitutional but it was done. There was a messy compromise involved but it was done. It has not been perfect and it needed to be stronger. There was massive resistance to it from Government. We were told at the time that if we did not accept what was on offer we would be throwing tenants to the wolves and so on. Some progress has been made, but much more is needed. Let us not get bogged down in the issue of legal distinctions. Let us instead put a proper plan together because the targets set are not sufficient and students on the ground cannot access accommodation. We need a much wider take-up of the ability to provide student accommodation, particularly by institutes of technology and the technological universities that are soon to be established.</p>

            <p eId="para_40">I accept the Deputy's point that we need to look at introducing a scheme of a similar nature, but the nature of the student market is different. We have all learned about the law of unintended consequences. It is important that we allow the work being done between the two Departments to continue rather than try to cobble together something that would not work. There is a degree of focus on this matter which matches the level of concern expressed by the Deputy.</p>

This school, which is due to close at the end of this summer - and may already have closed - is quite famous and has been used in many movies, including "Rocky Road to Dublin". It is a massive complex. Will the Minister consider acquiring this complex with a view to it being used to provide Educate Together and Gaelscoil facilities for the Dublin 10 area?</p>

            <p eId="para_43">On the school property to which the Deputy refers, the school patron has informed my Department that the school currently operating at this property will close on 30 June 2019, when the last group of pupils will have completed sixth class. The school patron has been working with the four Catholic schools under its patronage in Ballyfermot in regard to reorganising these schools. I understand the outcome of this interaction undertaken by the patron is that three of the four schools, other than the school referred to by the Deputy which is a senior boys' primary school, have changed to co-educational status following consultation with the parents, staff and boards of management.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> On the Deputy’s query as to whether a school under a different patron body will be established at the school property, there are no plans in that regard.  The property is not in my ownership, nor, according to Department records, does my Department hold any other legal interest, such as a charging lease, over the property. In that context, the plans for the property are a matter for the school trustees, as owner, and it is my understanding that it is their intention to sell the property.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">I understood the school was to close this September but I note from the Minister's reply that it will close in June when the last group of pupils has completed sixth class. The remaining children have been relocated to the St. Michael's Dominican campus, where there are three other schools. All of these schools are full, as is St. Ultan's school in Cherry Orchard. This area is one of the few areas in Dublin where social housing is being built and, as such, demand for school places will increase. </p>
            <p eId="para_46"> This property should not be sold. It belongs to a religious order that is indebted to the State under the redress deal agreed under former Minister, Michael Woods, and to the people of Ballyfermot, Cherry Orchard and Dublin 10 generally. It should be sold to the Department at a reduced rate or taken over by the Department to provide Educate Together and-or Gaelscoil facilities for the area, neither of which exist in this heavily populated area.</p>

            <p eId="para_47">The Deputy asked if the Department envisages a need for an additional school in the area. I am told that while there is some house-building taking place in the area and an increase in enrolments is expected, there is significant capacity in a number of the existing primary schools in the area. The outcome of the demographic exercises indicate a surplus of available accommodation over the next four years across the school planning area. This was not an area wherein the Department identified a need for an additional school. </p>
            <p eId="para_48"> On the issue of diversification, we have two initiatives in place, namely, the divestment procedure established by former Minister, Ruairí Quinn, and the live transfer, which I have just initiated. In neither instance do we have a prospect of an offer being made of property to an incoming new patron.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> On the issue of paying redress, I agree with the Deputy that we need to see additional payment from the religious orders. The indemnity arrangement which she mentioned limited the amount they contributed but it has always been the Government view that 50% of the cost should be contributed by the religious orders. We would welcome contributions from the sale of sites or otherwise towards the substantial cost that has been incurred in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">It is clear that although the Minister believes in divestment and agrees that the costs in this area should be shared on a 50:50 basis, the Government is prepared to do very little to insist this happens. We have moved on. The Taoiseach said recently that he is in favour of the separation of church and State. I am not asking for that. Rather, I am asking that the Department investigate the possibility of negotiating with the De La Salle Trust the acquisition of this very important site for use by the community of Dublin 10 and its environs for Educate Together and-or Gaelscoil provision, neither of which are available in this highly populated area. The Minister mentioned that he has been told there is significant capacity in the other three schools. That is not true. I know from talking to principals, teachers and parents that the other schools are at capacity and additional places will be required when the new housing in the area is completed. We need a definitive approach from the Minister to all of these lands and facilities that are in the possession of the church, which is indebted to this State. It is not sufficient for the Minister to say he does not believe that will happen. He needs to be much more proactive and ensure it does happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">The Department has never acquired new buildings where it already has existing capacity. The Department's demographic process, which is based on the very best information available from local authorities, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the census and so on, is applied evenly and equitably to all areas. Where it is identified that a new school is required, these are the schools we seek to establish, 42 of which were recently announced. There is a separate process for transfer of patronage.</p>
            <p eId="para_52">There is a survey going on in all 16 education and training boards, ETBs, to establish locations where we could seek a transfer of patronage. I refer to a live transfer, as it is described, not requiring closure and a transfer of property. That, unfortunately, has made the Ruairí Quinn approach difficult. The truth is that in the vast majority of cases where we have been able to open a school under that previous process, they have been in other State properties. They have not been in properties released by the majority patron. That system has not been successful because of various legal constraints.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">The Action Plan for Education outlines a series of actions to be taken to make the Irish education and training service the best in Europe. Since May 2016, we have cut the pupil teacher ratio at primary level twice, provided for 3,000 special needs assistants and more than 5,000 new teaching posts, with an additional 1,280 posts for the coming school year as a result of budget 2018. We have also provided 1,300 new middle management positions at primary level, 1,300 at post-primary level and provided summer works and minor works grants worth €125 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> On pay equity, any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross-sectoral issue and not just an issue for the education sector. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 contains a commitment to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the agreement’s commencement, and that process has started with all the teaching unions involved. The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will lay a report before the Oireachtas on the cost of, and a plan to deal with, pay equalisation for new entrants within three months of the passing of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> I have been able to win substantial extra resources for primary education in the past two years, and it is through the annual budgetary process each year and in future budgets that further progress will be made. I also draw the Deputy's attention to the recently published national development plan which provided €8.8 billion in investment in school buildings over the coming ten years. I will be seeking additional resources in this autumn's budget and it is the overall resources available to the Government, divided across all Departments, that will determine the scope of the improvements I will be able to make.</p>

            <p eId="para_58">I hope those additional resources will make a difference. From my own experience teaching at second level and chairing a board of management at primary level, I know the hard work and commitment of teachers. They enjoy their work in the vast majority of cases and I think that is reflected in the way young people also enjoy school. Like many others here, however, I attended the most recent briefing from the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, in the National Museum of Ireland. The message coming across was that they feel undervalued by the Department. The progress made in class size was acknowledged but we still have a way to go with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> On capitation grants, there is a major disparity between primary and second level. Teachers and their classes enjoy fundraising for causes outside of the school but they are now fundraising to pay some of the bills in school. The inequity of losing tax relief on their union subscriptions, while the relief remained for some in business and for farmers, was also mentioned. Another point relating to middle management is the extent of the paperwork required. How is that contributing to the quality of teaching? On retention and recruitment, does the Minister have any idea of the numbers that have applied for career breaks this year?</p>

            <p eId="para_60">There are many questions there. On class sizes, from 2018 we will have the lowest class sizes in primary schools ever in the history of the State. It is a significant first and it was welcomed across the House. In prioritising resources, we have to look at where the boot is pinching most. This year, there was €550 million to be allocated right across the education sector and half of that went in restoring pay. The remainder went to improving services. I outlined the types of things that we have done. We redesigned the model for allocating resources to children with special needs and it is a better model involving more resources going into special needs assistants and teaching resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> We have extended the delivering equality of opportunities in schools, DEIS, to an additional 110 schools and we have strengthened leadership in the schools to help them manage better with paperwork. It is paperwork but much of it is designed to protect our children better and keep them safe by implementing rules that apply throughout our whole system such as vetting of teachers and implementing data protection, which is important for the confidentiality and privacy of citizens. I acknowledge that many of these things are challenges but we have to manage them rather than pretend they can go away. That is why I am investing in leadership across the areas with the greatest priorities and I recognise that capitation is an area of pressure.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">Teachers are all policied and planned out. There is a limit to what they can deal with. I was in the audiovisual room yesterday and I heard part of the Minister's reply to Deputy Thomas Byrne about teaching principals. It was disturbing to learn of a survey they had done. One aspect of it found that 89% of teaching principals feel adversely affected by the stress of the workload, the increasing mountain of paper and the onslaught of legislative and curricular change. That was what they said. They also mentioned there were 84 circulars last year alone. Teaching principals are caught between the two roles of working as a teacher and as a principal. They have to leave their class to do the work of the principal, the class is being left behind and then there are problems with parents who do not like that. They also earn less than deputy principals in schools with administrative principals. Teaching principals need release time and is that something that can be addressed?</p>

            <p eId="para_63">As I said to Deputy Thomas Byrne, I did increase the release time to teaching principals. Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned the onslaught of curricular change but many others would say that we are reforming a curricular system that was not serving pupils as well as it should. Much work has gone into improving the reading programme at primary level and we are seeing the impact. Our ten year olds now have the best reading standards in Europe, and that is the result of implementation of curricular change and changing the way that material is taught in classrooms. That requires release for continuing professional development training of teachers to look at the new way of doing things.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> We are seeing more use of data, and even in education there is a concentration on data to see how things are going and how things are being done better. These are not all unnecessary requirements and that is the point that must be made. Perhaps we can take out unnecessary requirements but the things that have been done, such as child protection and better curriculums, have been done after talking to experts on how we could best improve outcomes for children and then seeking to work with principals to implement it. That is other side of why we are doing some of these things, and we do recognise the pressure of continual change.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">I want to ask the Minister about the status of the construction and relocation of Curraghmore national school to Ardmore Road in Mullingar. The Minister will be familiar with this project because he visited it with me last February. The very tolerant board of management is very concerned because of the constant delays in delivery.</p>

            <p eId="para_68">I did indeed visit the site and I can understand the Deputy's frustration. This project in Curraghmore is being delivered on my Department's behalf by the school’s local authority. The local authority recently notified officials that the project is six to eight weeks behind schedule and that a recent works programme provided by the contractor indicated a completion date in 2019. That is fully six months beyond the intended date.</p>
            <p eId="para_69">Needless to say, it is a completely unacceptable development for all concerned, particularly the school, as it will have to continue to operate in unsatisfactory conditions with increasing enrolments until its new building is ready. Consequently, my Department has instructed the local authority to inform the contractor that it expects a programme of works that sees the project completed well before the end of 2018. A strong letter to this effect has issued from the design team to the contractor and a revised programme to reflect this requirement is awaited. The county council and its design team, with the support of my Department, will persist in pursuing the contractor for as speedy a delivery of this project as possible. My Department understands the county council is keeping the school informed of developments and this will continue to be the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">I thank the Minister for his reply and for the detail he provided on the action the Department is taking. There are ten portakabins on the existing site and to date €1.5 million has been spent on renting them. Every month the project is delayed, €7,500 will be spent on rent. The principal and board of management were told in January 2018 the school would be delivered no later than October 2018. On that basis, in good faith, the principal agreed to take on 56 junior infants. It will put massive pressure on the school, which is why we need a new location to ensure the service can be delivered in a safe manner. When the delay to October 2018 was announced, the board of management took it in good faith because it is very tolerant. It accepted it due to the adverse weather conditions earlier in the year. It is grossly unacceptable for the date to be after October 2018 because of the specific circumstances of the school.</p>

            <p eId="para_71">I understand the Deputy's concern. While there were some delays and unforeseen ground conditions, from the point of view of the design team the maximum delay should be six to eight weeks behind schedule and not the revised timeline. The local authority will be aware of the protections it has in the contract to ensure compliance and penalties in the event of failure. It is very clear the local authority, backed by the Department, will take a firm view in respect of the case because of the points the Deputy makes about the exposure both in terms of cost and the inconvenience this sort of delay will create for the pupils concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_72">We need to use a big stick when implementing penalties and we must hold the contractor to account for the contract he signed on 25 August 2017. Marty Hanley in Westmeath County Council, who is representing the council in this matter, has been of huge assistance in liaising with the parents, the board of management and the Department. I am interested in the Minister's views on the future of schools and divesting control to local authorities and on how he would assess this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> I would be grateful if the board of management could be apprised by the contractor of the progress of the school every few weeks. It is a brilliant news story for Mullingar. Getting the students into a first-class facility is long-awaited and we do not want to temper it with frustration or annoyance at further delays. We must ensure the safety works are carried out to ensure safe access to the school and also so the staff, principal, students and parents can get settled in as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">I acknowledge what the Deputy has said. The Department has a diversified portfolio of approaches to building schools. We use the NDFA, the ETBs, the local authorities and public private partnerships. We have devolved design teams and the rapid delivery programme. We have a mixture. None of them is absolutely perfect. We have had difficulties of this nature in all of those streams. The important thing is we diversify and try different models and keep the pressure on all of those models. I will not level criticism at the local authority on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. I see the motivation behind it.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. I am informed by the commission that it regularly receives requests for assistance from candidates who either cannot take an examination or cannot perform to their optimum as a result of some life event such as illness, bereavement or other trauma. However, our examinations model is constrained in the degree to which the life experiences of individual students can be accommodated. Each year the commission makes arrangements such as early or deferred sittings and special sittings in hospitals to cater for a wide range of personal emergencies but this is only possible on the day of the examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> The commission recognises that this is a very real issue for candidates and on foot of the concerns raised, the State Examinations Commission has given detailed consideration to the possibility of providing repeat examinations. The State examinations are run within the tightest of timescales and to maximum capacity to deliver a high quality product at both leaving certificate and junior certificate levels. It has been concluded that within our current externally examined examinations model, it would not be possible to hold repeat examinations and to have results available to the expected deadlines.</p>

            <p eId="para_80">I raised the issue because I am not a fan of the leaving certificate system. It does not suit every student. I do not believe in the pressurised two-weeks with the whole country waiting to see how many students get seven A1s and all that nonsense. As part of reform I would like to see a system of continuous assessment, which is why I welcome it at junior certificate level. As part of the reform, there should be a repeat option. There might be an issue around deadlines but in this day and age it is something we should be able to examine because at third level there is always the option of repeating in August. I have heard of students who sat exams in hospital but there is a range of situations in question. I raise this because a person with cystic fibrosis came to us. The person cannot physically do two or three exams in one day. Many students fall into that category. If there was an option of repeating in late July or early August, students who fall into that category could stagger their exams.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_81">I understand what the Deputy is saying but the State Examinations Commission has looked at how it can be flexible by giving rest breaks throughout the period of the exams and going to different venues and so on but it has confined it to the day the exam takes place. It is caught because of the CAO timeframe which is very definite. What is different from a higher education situation is that the CAO allocates places and they must be taken up. In higher education, one is going from first year to second year, for example, so the place is there and it is not a question of someone else waiting to take it if one does not take it. It is much more difficult for them. The senior cycle review has commenced and one of the issues that has been very clearly flagged by the NCCA is the excessive concentration on a pathway into higher education, ignoring other pathways which the leaving certificate system should be accommodating.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> As things stand with the CAO and its timetable, it does not feel it would be feasible to facilitate repeats while meeting the same high standards. It would have to gear the system up for a second exam just at the time it is trying to deliver the first CAO results. The people who had repeated would have a problem in meeting the CAO requirements which would already have been allocated. There are genuine problems and reform of the senior cycle may trigger changes.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">I understand all of that but it would apply to a very small number of students. There should be a repeat module and, if not, there should be an option for students to apply to repeat exams in exceptional circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">Let us say it was the end of July or the first week in August, not many students would fall into that category. Surely there would be some way for their exams to be reviewed, assessed, corrected and ready in time for the CAO deadline. Maybe we need to look at the CAO deadline and make changes. The system currently does not suit all students. Various scenarios arise, including emergencies, family bereavements and illnesses. There is also the cohort of students I mentioned earlier, including those with cystic fibrosis or additional needs. I know accommodation is made available for students with additional needs, but not everyone will fall into that category. I advocate reviewing the senior cycle, especially this area. It might also help with students' stress levels and anxiety if they thought that in the worst-case scenario they could repeat some of their exams and would not have to repeat the entire year. It is such a waste of students' time and energy going back to school to repeat one subject when they may come out with the same result anyway.</p>

            <p eId="para_85">The Deputy has illustrated the difficulty. She started by saying a very small number of people were involved, but at the end of her comments she said, of course, other people who may not have performed to their expectation should have a chance too. We would very rapidly have a significant repeat examination. This would require setting up not only the papers, but also the scoring framework, the oversight and the quality assurance of the testers, and then delivering the results in time for the CAO deadline. Fitting a second run into a very tight timeframe is the constraint. I would love to be able to say that we could do it, but the State Examinations Commission is independent. That is one issue. It is hard to deny the challenge the commission would face or see a way around it.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">I acknowledge the Deputy's continued interest in the issue. I know it is very frustrating for him and the community. As he will be aware, I announced new plans aimed at accelerating the provision of multidenominational and non-denominational schools throughout the country, in line with the choices of parents, families and school communities and the programme for Government commitment to reach 400 such schools by 2030.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> In cases such as that referred to by the Deputy, these can be considered under the early movers' provision of the schools reconfiguration process, which involves voluntary reassignments of patronage under section 8 of the Education Act. To date, such early movers under this process have come about on the basis of local parental support for a move to a specific multidenominational or non-denominational patron. In the case of Faughart referred to by the Deputy, I understand the local community has met multidenominational patrons and has approached the existing patron to request a transfer of patronage of the school to Louth and Meath Education and Training Board. </p>
            <p eId="para_90"> The process is that, if the existing patron is willing to support such a move, given that the local community has set out its support for a transfer of patronage, the existing patron would write to me to request the transfer of patronage of the school under section 8(3) of the Education Act. I would welcome such an application. </p>
            <p eId="para_91"> My Department and the existing patron have been in correspondence in this regard. My Department and patron representatives have arranged to meet in the coming days to discuss the school.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">I welcome that a meeting is to take place. I spent 35 years teaching, 25 of them in a rural community. Anybody who lives in a rural community such as Faughart, of which there are many, will know the school is the focal point not just for teaching but for the community. Archbishop Eamon Martin outlined to the parents' association that he has no difficulty in principle with the proposal. His letter clearly delineates what his issues are with it. While we all understand the need for due process, people have moved their children. The school enrolment was down to 64 from 100 before the problems started. If the school does not reopen in September there is a danger that people will not bring their children back there because they will obviously settle in other schools. Based on the contents of the archbishop's letter, I urge that his issues be clearly resolved to ensure they are not batted from one side to the other in letters. A commitment was given to reopen the school under alternative patronage once the problem with the school was resolved by closure.</p>

            <p eId="para_95">I am sure the Minister is well aware that in excess of 30 of the families involved have pre-enrolled with Louth and Meath ETB which has clearly indicated that it can have the school operational in September if the will is there. While I understand some of the archbishop's concerns, which may relate to the transfer of faith teaching or whatever, the management of LMETB has assured me that faith teaching will be available at a reconstituted school. My only interest in this is to see the community survive through its primary school. While the issues Archbishop Eamon Martin has raised are valid, we cannot delay the process any longer because we will lose the pupils to the other schools they have gone to in the past 12 months, which would not be wise.</p>

            <p eId="para_96">As I am sure the Deputy has, I visit a number of community national schools which are based on the model the ETBs run. They are exemplary models. While they welcome children of the Catholic faith, they give an equal welcome for children of any other faith or of none. Every student is recognised and that diversity is valued. It becomes a feature and a strength of the school that such diversity can be acknowledged and celebrated in the school. I hope the conversations are fruitful.</p>

            <p eId="para_101">As the question I have does not refer specifically to Castleblaney, I hope the answer is along the right lines.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">The reply refers to the demonstration project that was recently announced to provide an in-school and preschool therapy service, to be introduced for the 2018-19 school year. The project will be managed and co-ordinated by the National Council for Special Education. The model has been developed by the Departments of Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs, and Health, and the Health Service Executive, and is part of the Government's overall aim to help every child to fulfil his or her full potential. A total of 75 schools, including a representative sample of primary, post-primary and special schools, will take part, and 75 preschools will also participate. The project is taking place in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7 region of south-west Dublin, Kildare and west Wicklow. As part of the programme, 19 speech and language therapists and 12 occupational therapists will be recruited by the HSE to work with the 150 schools and preschools.</p>
            <p eId="para_103"> The purpose of the project is to test a model of tailored therapeutic supports that allow for early intervention in terms of providing speech and language and occupational therapy within educational settings. This innovative pilot will complement existing HSE-funded provision of essential therapy services. The pilot is designed to test the provision of speech and language and occupational therapies in schools settings. It does not, therefore, include applied behaviour analysis, ABA. The Special Education Support Service, which is now part of the NCSE support service, provides training for teachers and schools in a range of programmes, including ABA.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">I have to admit that ABA is something that was new to me. As I outlined in my question, I have seen it first-hand in Little Wonders in Castleblayney, which is headed by Claire Callan. I have heard her analysis and background to it. As the Minister knows from his research, it is a scientifically based intervention to increase children's academic, social and communication needs. In the particular case I am speaking about in Castleblayney, families have reported huge improvements in their children's lives and homes and in their behaviour and academic abilities. From my experience of listening to parents who have had children go through an ABA service, they have found it has hugely improved their lives, not only in the family but in the child's capacity to be in school, live at home and interact with other siblings. I ask the Minister to consider ABA as something that should be introduced in primary schools and preschools throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_105">The position is as outlined in the very last sentence of the reply. The Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided to teachers in its use. The philosophy of the Department's programme for the education of children with autism is a child-centred approach. It is delivered by special needs assistants and fully qualified professional teachers. They draw from a range of autism-specific interventions. They include ABA but they also include a number of other interventions, such as TEACCH and the picture exchange communication system, as well as the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible, of a full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_106"> The Department recognises there are a range of interventions that can help a qualified teacher to deliver appropriate education for a child on the autistic spectrum. It continues to be led by a professional teacher. What we are doing, and a later question will also refer to this, is looking at proposals to introduce additional therapies to build the capacity of schools to integrate therapies such as speech and language therapy or occupational therapy into education programmes in the school. This would apply whether it be teaching in the autistic spectrum or teaching in mainstream spectrum. ABA is accommodated, and our autism spectrum disorder units use ABA. The teachers have access to training and support in it. They pick and choose from the model as best suits the child.</p>

            <p eId="para_107">I thank the Minister. Do we have figures on how many preschools and primary schools use ABA? I take the Minister's point that perhaps many special education units use it. When it comes to any training such as ABA, early intervention is key. I am trying to see whether the Minister will look further at this with regard to preschools. From speaking to Claire Callan, I understand the younger that children are exposed to ABA services, the greater the impact on and benefit not only to the child but also to the whole family unit and to the child's capacity to be able to socialise with friends and, perhaps, in school. Is this form of special education optional for teachers? Do we have analysis on, or an overall picture of, how ABA is used throughout the country?</p>

            <p eId="para_108">From my understanding it is one of a range of interventions, and special schools or special classes will choose from that range. ABA informs all teaching in special schools and classes. Some schools came from a specific ABA background and 13 centres were set up as private ABA pilots. Subsequently they were integrated as special schools within the Department of Education and Skills. They are part of the range of services available. Depending on the teacher and the appropriateness of the intervention, schools draw on different skills and methods. The Department does not say that ABA should be the sole method. It is a range. In years gone by there was quite a controversy, as some people argued that it should have been ABA only. The Department's view is ABA is one of a range of interventions that can be successful. As I understand it, they are applied and they draw on ABA where it is appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">I welcome this question because it is a good report. It is a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and the Government has noted the contents of the report. In response to the report, I have undertaken to develop proposals for the implementation of the recommendations and to return to Government, following engagement with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health, with a proposed implementation plan to include a governance and accountability framework and detailed costings of proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_115"> Work has commenced on a comprehensive mapping exercise to set out current levels, ranges and costs of all relevant existing supports available from both an education and a health perspective.

            <p eId="para_116"> Work is also under way on the development of a new model for the allocation of resources to schools, as recommended by the NCSE.

I expect to bring proposals for implementation of the review's recommendations to the Government in the coming months.</p>

            <p eId="para_117">Last week during a debate on special needs assistants, my good colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, highlighted how some parts of the report are deemed urgent by the NCSE. One of these concerns complex medical needs. The report states the NCSE wrote to the Minister in early 2017 highlighting a major crisis regarding complex medical needs and noting that nursing support should be provided to schools, SNAs and teachers to address these needs. The report is blunt on this point, stating that if action is not taken, there will be a crisis in schools. The issue needs to be addressed immediately. The report notes the Minister responded by establishing a working group, but here we are, about a year and a half after the NCSE warned of the crisis in schools if nursing support was not provided, and the Minister still has not made any announcement on the provision of nursing support in schools. When exactly can we expect this?</p>

            <p eId="para_118">Special needs assistant, SNA, allocations for September have been made in the past couple of weeks. In some instances, where there have been three SNAs in a school, a small amount of time has been added to the SNA allocation. It is divided between the SNAs, giving the impression that four are working in the school, but a minuscule amount of time has been added to the overall allocation. Has there been an attempt by the Department to give the impression that more SNAs are working in schools when the hours added equate to 0.2 of a working unit? There seems to be an attempt to give the impression that there are more SNAs, but the amount of time involved is minuscule.</p>

            <p eId="para_119">Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony raised a point that I mentioned last week and which was made in written questions yesterday. It relates to nursing. The written reply concerned the concerns of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, about nursing support in schools. It is very worrying that the Minister does not seem to be acting on it. A report has been compiled, but it has not been published. The Minister has said he is looking at what can be done. It is not a costly or expensive option, but, as Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony said today, as I said last week and as the NCSE indicated a year and a half ago, there will be a medical crisis in schools if there is no nursing support for SNAs. I urge the Minister to show more urgency in providing nursing support for students with complex medical needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">I welcome the interest in the report. There is the question of complex medical needs that is clearly highlighted in the report. The NCSE calls for a new approach that would involve ring-fencing nursing support in order that it would be part of a new approach to supporting schools and involve a range of therapies. As of today, nursing support provision is the responsibility of the Department of Health, not the Department of Education and Skills. The provision of nursing support for the schools will be through the Department of Health. What is at stake is the delivery of a new model. The Deputy is right in saying we sat down, in the light of the NCSE's concerns, and work is ongoing between my Department and the Department of Health to improve such support. There are 1,090 full-time equivalent SNAs being allocated; 800 were allocated recently and more will be allocated at the start of the coming year, in January. There has been no change in the way SNAs are allocated. They are allocated on the basis of the profiled need within a school. Every child who needs an SNA has one provided under this process. The NCSE independently decides on the level of need.</p>

            <p eId="para_122">I am worth it. The report also mentions the renaming of SNAs as "inclusion support assistants". Will that recommendation be implemented? The term SNA is very well known at this stage and I wonder if it is necessary to change the title. Irrespective of that happening, how will the Minister ensure SNAs will only do the job they are meant to do? The NCSE's report gives a number of examples of other roles they are carrying out, including teaching, which they are not qualified to do. This happens, despite circulars indicating that SNAs are there to assist teachers in meeting the care needs of students and that they do not have a teaching role. They are also asked to do other things that are not included in their job description.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">Yes, of course. The NCSE has recommended use of the term "inclusion support assistants" to move away from the idea of special need and in order to emphasise student independence. It is about allowing pupils to be included, gain their independence and develop. It is seen to be more appropriate as a pupil gets older and the concept of special needs assistant is less attuned with a growing adolescent.</p>
            <p eId="para_125"> I acknowledge the interesting research included in the NCSE;s report that demonstrates where SNAs are involved in teaching, it damages a child's progress. It is right that we be clear on what an SNA does. A national training programme for SNAs is envisaged to enhance the role and quality of service they can deliver.</p>

            <p eId="para_128">This question relates to the teaching of maths and whether those teaching it have the appropriate degrees. The Deputy will note that the performance of students in Ireland in mathematics and science is relatively high by international standards. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMMS, to which she is referring, found that only six from 39 countries obtained significantly higher mean scores than Ireland in mathematics, with none of those in Europe. The report also notes that there does not appear to be a direct relationship between instructional time and student achievement. Whereas many of the highest performing countries devoted more instructional time to mathematics than Ireland, not all did.</p>
            <p eId="para_129"> The science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, policy statement and implementation plan which I launched in November 2017 aims to make Ireland the best in Europe in STEM subjects by 2026. Within the school system, new initiatives and curriculum developments will support greater participation and improved performance in STEM subjects. Curricular reform at junior and senior cycle will provide enhanced opportunities for teaching and learning in these subjects. This will build on the good progress already made. A report published in 2010 by the University of Limerick indicated that in a study of 51 schools, 48% of teachers included in the study did not have a major teaching qualification in mathematics. On foot of this, with funding from the Department, more than 1,300 out-of-field maths teachers will have gained a postgraduate qualification through the a programme led by EPI-STEM, the national centre for STEM education at the University of Limerick. Whereas the findings are not directly comparable, the TIMMS report suggests the position on out-of-field mathematics teachers taking classes in schools has improved compared with that in 2010.</p>

We are raising it on the back of a report conducted that studied fourth class and second year students. It was indicated that 20% were being taught by persons with no specialist degree. That figure is much higher than the international average of 13%. Given that it is a very difficult and specialised subject, we hope students will be taught by persons with a specialist degree. I understand what the Minister is saying about the general standard, but it seems from the study that as pupils progress from primary to secondary school, the level deteriorates or drops off. That coincides with students seeking maths grinds in fifth and sixth year. Clearly, there is some difficulty. It is about highlighting it and receiving some assurances that, in general, we will try to aim to reach the international average of 13%.</p>

            <p eId="para_133">This question relates to Gaelscoil Bharra in Cabra. The school building was handed over for occupation on 1 September 2017. However, as part of the contract for the project, some outstanding works remain to be completed at the adjacent Naomh Fionnbarra GAA Club, including completion of the all-weather pitch and car park reinstatement work. There are also a number of snags to be resolved in the school building, including issues with the heating system.</p>
            <p eId="para_134">The design team had been in regular contact with Sammon since handing over the building in an attempt to get the snags resolved and the siteworks completed, but in spite of many promises from the contractor, particularly over recent months, no significant progress was forthcoming.</p>
            <p eId="para_135"> On 5 April 2018 Sammon entered into examinership and on 5 June the company was placed into liquidation. The Department then terminated the contract with Sammon Contracting under clause 12 of the public works contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_136"> There is a performance bond in place for this project and the Department has instructed the design team to liaise with the bondsman with the intention of calling on the bond to cover the costs of finishing out the works. The design team has been asked to produce a detailed scope of works which, as there is a live bond in place for this contract, can be used to request the bondsman to have the works completed without the need for a public tender process. This would be the quickest way of getting the works completed. If the bondsman is not prepared to complete the works then the design team will tender for a completion contractor to carry out the works and the remediation of the outstanding snags. Then the bill will be presented to the bondsman.</p>

            <p eId="para_137">The people in Gaelscoil Bharra were in unsuitable prefabs for over 20 years. They suffered from the usual prefab problems in that it was too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. I wish to acknowledge the work of the principal and the staff in working and surviving in those conditions for over 20 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_138"> Some months ago I visited the new school. It is state of the art and the atmosphere is completely different. It is a wonderful school. It has wonderful premises and everything is going well there. The official opening was only a couple of weeks ago. It is really a shame that the outstanding works have been allowed to go on for so long. The danger with outstanding works is that if they are not addressed urgently, quickly and promptly then they drag on and on. That would be a shame for this wonderful school. Those involved have the building they had been waiting on for so long. They are at the mercy of something that had nothing to do with them. What can be done now to progress this and to see it remedied as a matter of urgency?</p>

            <p eId="para_139">The outstanding works concern Naomh Fionnbarra, the adjoining GAA club. The approach is that the bondsman has a liability. The quickest way to get the works done is if the bondsman exercises the right to bring in contractors and completes the work. The alternative would be more bureaucratic. It would involve the Department tendering for the works. We would then get it done and present the bill to the bondsman. We are trying the quicker and less bureaucratic way to get this done. That is the approach we are taking. I have been contacted by a former Deputy who is chairman of the club in question and so I know the level of concern.</p>

We have beautiful weather and they could be used by the community and youth projects. As the Minister is aware, the Department is committed to the use of school facilities outside school time. Is there anything else the Minister can do with the bondsman to hurry up the process? Can anything be done with the GAA club and the school so that the facilities can be in full use and so that this will not drag on after the summer?</p>

            <p eId="para_144">As the Deputy is aware, a project to deliver a new building for the school to which she refers is included in my Department's capital programme. As outlined previously, the site acquisition process in respect of this project proved to be extremely challenging. Although officials in my Department proposed an alternative and more expedient accommodation solution, the school authority stated a preference for the site acquisition process to proceed. The Department officials have, therefore, continued to engage with officials in the relevant local authority under the memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of school sites with a view to securing a site for the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_145"> I have previously outlined to the Deputy that my officials were working to clarify some technical aspects associated with the proposed development of the site. This assessment process has been completed and the outcome communicated to officials in the local authority. Engagement with the landowner is now under way with a view to finalising the terms of the acquisition and progressing matters as expeditiously as possible. Simultaneously, my officials are working to advance the project to planning stages and will be progressing this in tandem with the finalisation of the site acquisition.</p>

            <p eId="para_146">The problem is that we are at the end of the school term now. Parents, teachers and children are none the wiser about when this school will actually be developed. The school has been operating out of a converted farmhouse for years in wholly unsuitable circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_147"> The Minister's has told me virtually word-for-word what he told me on 6 June in a letter. We are one month on and I am still not any clearer on the position. When is the planning application going in? The Minister told me on 6 June that the development of the site assessment and the technical aspects would be sorted. He said that assuming no issues arose the project would proceed straight away to the terms of site acquisition. Is the Minister now saying that no issues have arisen? Is the site acquisition in the process of being finalised? When will the conveyancing process be dealt with by the solicitors? When will the planning application go in? When will parents and children find out when this project, which is planned, will actually begin to be delivered?</p>

            <p eId="para_148">Since Deputy Daly last raised this question, the various technical issues which related to access and connections to services have been addressed. They were the challenges. The clarifications needed were provided. Those involved are satisfied that they can resolve the issues but the resolution will impact on the contracts and so on. That work is being undertaken now. No unnecessary delay is occurring. Those responsible are seeking to progress this but, obviously, before they can submit final planning documents they must have all the i's dotted and t's crossed. That is the reality.</p>

            <p eId="para_149">What the Minister is saying is that the technical issues have been identified and resolved and that these are not impediments to the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_150"> A second question then arises. The terms of the site acquisition can now be finalised. When is that likely? When will the conveyancing be completed? When will the planning application be put in? The Minister says there has been no unnecessary delay. That is fine on one level, but the parents and children have been in this school for well over ten years in most unsuitable circumstances and it has been an incredibly long wait for them. They need some concrete answers on when the nightmare will begin to end.</p>

            <p eId="para_151">I am not a technical person but as I understand it the project requires various rights of way and wayleaves. Those responsible need to be satisfied that the proposed solution meets planning requirements in terms of whatever building standards are to be met. That involves certain infrastructure upgrades that have to be put in place. Certain links in the chain have to be put in place for this to be robust.</p>

            <p eId="para_153">They cannot give a definitive timeframe. It is the nature of these things that, with the best will in the world, we cannot foresee everything. It may involve either getting wayleaves or satisfying planners that the standards are met by whatever is being proposed. None of these things is in the hands of the design team alone. They require a counterparty to sign up. Even with the best endeavours I cannot give timelines. All I can assure the Deputy of is that this is actively being pursued by the officials in my Department and the design team involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_156">I thank Deputy Curran. I recognise the need to improve capitation funding for schools, including DEIS schools, having regard to the reductions that were necessary over recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_157"> Restoring of capitation funding as resources permit is one of the actions included in the Action Plan for Education and I remain committed to achieving this. However, I must be prudent in the context of ongoing budgetary pressures and prioritise where it is not possible to do everything that I would like to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_158"> As Deputy Curran is aware, I have made provision for 6,000 additional teachers, 3,000 extra special needs assistants and 3,000 new middle-management posts. These resources were allocated to improve the learning experience throughout the sector with a particular focus on children with special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">The Deputy will be aware that budget 2018 saw the allocation of significant new resources. We have seen the budget grow to €10 billion, its highest ever. Improvements have been made in the restoration of grant funding used by schools to cover the salaries of ancillary staff. That has involved the provision of additional grants of €6 million. However, the other element of the capitation grant has not increased in recent years. It will, however, be one of the issues we will assess in line with other competing demands on the education budget as we approach budget 2019.</p>

            <p eId="para_160">Will the Minister review the capitation grant as it pertains to small and medium-sized schools? I recently had an opportunity to look at the figures for two DEIS schools with a little over 200 pupils. The capitation grant is €35,000 or so. Lighting and heating in the two schools cost €17,000 or €18,000, while the cost of insurance came to €10,000 or €11,000. If the size of a school doubles, the capitation grant is not doubled. Such schools are struggling and do not have the opportunity, as occurs in other areas, to seek contributions from parents. I specifically ask that, in particular, the capitation grant for small and medium-sized DEIS schools, with perhaps 200 to 250 pupils, be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">Today there are 6,000 adults homeless and 1,724 homeless families, with nearly 4,000 children. Since 2012 and 2013, various housing and homeless organisations predicted and warned about a growing crisis, but the then Government was in denial, stating the level of homelessness would not develop and that the issue would be resolved in a timely manner. We know how that worked out. The denial of a crisis is a factor in the unacceptable levels of homelessness among children. The Children's Rights Alliance has published important research today which outlines the negative impact of homelessness and living in emergency accommodation on children and their educational prospects. The report states children who are homeless in Ireland are experiencing exhaustion, hunger and increased susceptibility to illness because of poor living conditions and long journeys to and from school. The CEO of the alliance, Ms Tanya Ward, put it succinctly when she stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_163">Children who are homeless lose out on every level of their education because they have no home to provide them with the backdrop that they need to learn and grow. Let me paint the picture of what child homelessness looks like on a day-to-day level and the dreadful effect this has on their schooling. For a child, life in homeless accommodation can be tough. They wake up in the one room they share with their parents and siblings. Some must wake their children as early as 5.30 a.m. to make the long journey across the city to school. Many are exhausted and some fall asleep in class. School attendance is affected. The child is hungry because often there is nowhere to store food or prepare breakfast or their lunchbox. The child doesn't always have adequate washing facilities and sometimes goes to school with a dirty uniform.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_164"> Homeless accommodation makes it almost impossible for parents to establish regular routines ... It also impacts on the child's behaviour. </p>
          <p eId="para_165">Such experiences should have demanded an urgent, effective and impactful response from the Government, yet, when one looks at initiative after initiative that the Government has announced, one sees target after target being missed. We read today about the serious concerns of the Dublin city chief executive about rapid build housing. It is estimated that two rapid build schemes, one on Fishamble Street and the other in Coolock, announced in 2016, will be completed in 2020. As I said, there are 4,000 children homeless. The lack of delivery is appalling. I could go through all of the initiatives Governments have announced. The repair and release scheme has a delivery target of 800 units, but the delivery has been nil.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">I could go on and on. What is the reason for the the lack of urgency and delivery in responding to the appalling homelessness being experienced by children?

          <p eId="para_170">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. When it comes to the Cabinet, there is no denial whatsoever of the enormous economic and social challenge we face as a result of the housing crisis and its worst and most distressing aspect - family homelessness, with children not being able to go home at night and having to do their homework on a hotel bed. The Government is aware of the seriousness of the issue and determined to do all it can to alleviate it. It is important to double back a little and not forget how it came about. There was a seven-year period during which almost no new homes were built and almost no social housing was built by the Government because we could not afford to do so because of the perilous state of the public finances. There was an almost seven-year period during which the private sector was not producing new homes because of the collapse of the banks and the construction sector. That is the backdrop against which we are trying to deal with this enormous social crisis which involves a deficit of as many as 250,000 homes, on which we need to catch up on in the next period. However, I believe the actions taken by the Government in the past year or two are starting to show results. For example, when it comes to rent controls, approximately half of those who become homeless do so because they have lost their place in the private rented accommodation sector. In the past two quarters we have seen rents increase by or less than 1%. That is evidence the rent controls the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has brought forward are having an effect.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">We are moving away from the use of hotels and bed and breakfast accomodation which are totally unsuitable for families and towards family hubs which are very different as they have cooking and washing facilities and play areas. While it is by no means a long-term solution and an alternative to a house or an apartment, it is a much better temporary solution. There are 500 such places, with another 400 to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> On the last count, the level of rough sleeping was down by approximately 40%. The reduction is due to the increase in shelter accommodation made available with Government resources. Of course, the underlying problem is housing supply, in which we are now seeing a real increase.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">The Taoiseach is wrong in the backdrop he has suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The Taoiseach and the Government made many announcements of various schemes and the media were fair to them because they reported those announcements faithfully. Some 800 units were to be delivered under the repair and leasing scheme at the beginning of 2017 and zero have been delivered. Some 1,500 houses were to be built under the rapid build scheme by the end of 2018. The delivery to date has been 208. The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, was due to deliver 6,946 units and only 2,400 were delivered. There was an affordable homes target of 400 by the end of 2018 and zero have been delivered. There has been an affordable rent scheme of €10 million promised since 2015 and zero has been delivered. The home building finance Ireland scheme was announced 12 months ago in the budget and was faithfully and fairly reported by the media. What happened? Legislation to establish the body has yet to pass the Oireachtas. We can go on and on with various announcements of the Government. That is the backdrop. Why has there been a failure to deliver?</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> The Taoiseach should not get annoyed with commentators and the Opposition if they point out that there has been a clear failure to deliver the necessary housing to get the children I referred to out of emergency accommodation. It is a blight on our society and the Taoiseach does not care enough about it. We have too much spin. That is why we railed against the strategic communications unit because that was about spin over substance and we need substance in delivering houses for children who need it for their proper development and growth in our society into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_203">Fáilte ar ais. I want to raise with the Taoiseach the comments that he made in New York at what has been described as a private lunch but what I understand was an event paid for by the Irish taxpayer. His remarks, as published, referred to the Irish media. He has confirmed these remarks in part, that he is in sympathy with President Donald Trump and that he believes that Irish journalists have no interest in the truth. No more than the rest of us, as Taoiseach and Head of Government, I am sure he understands that the freedom of the press to report in the public interest without coercion, pressure or undue influence is vitally important and yet he has attacked Irish investigative journalism and he has cited RTÉ in particular. It is interesting that the Taoiseach cites the very programmes that have exposed scandals such as the hospital waiting lists, the disregard for carers and those with disabilities, the failure of the State and the Taoiseach's Government to protect children in care, and the wholesale failure of his housing policy, and we heard again not only about homeless children but also the scandal of a generation that has lost any hope of ever having a secure roof over their heads. The Taoiseach knows that time and again citizens have had to resort to media platforms to get the ear of Government and of Ministers and yet he has a problem with investigative journalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> I suggest to the Taoiseach that if he is genuinely concerned about the Irish media, he might have remarked on the issue of media ownership in New York. He might have also been particularly concerned about the power of Denis O'Brien in Ireland's media landscape. He might have reflected that Mr. O'Brien's dominance has a chilling effect on news gathering and reporting in the public interest and on the ability of journalists to get to the truth. Had the Taoiseach said that, he would have had broad agreement here and from most journalists, but he is not interested in those legitimate issues. He simply wanted to have a go.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> From the paid for content scandal earlier this year to the controversy surrounding his €5 million spin unit, the Taoiseach's interest seems to be in spin and optics. Will he tell us who was at this lunch? Will he publish or provide the names? Is there a record of the meeting? What else was discussed? Did he have any other commentary to make on other sections of Irish society and would he care to share those views with us?</p>

A free, fair and balanced media is a cornerstone of democracy and our freedoms and that is why it is so important. At the same time, it should not consider itself to be beyond reproach or above criticism. On many occasions in Irish society we have had times where groups of people or institutions felt themselves to be beyond reproach or above criticism and we know the results and consequences of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_219">That account of events directly contradicts what those who were at the event are reported to have said. The report reflects commentary by the Taoiseach in which he accuses the media of trivialising matters, and chasing tittle-tattle rather than being concerned with substantive issues. A direct attack on investigative journalism, on RTÉ investigative journalism in particular, is very clear in the recording. The problem is that the Taoiseach is saying one thing, while those who were in attendance say another. Will he tell us how we can fully and finally clarify these matters? The Taoiseach says he is concerned about the health of the media in Ireland. In that context, I would have thought the issue of media ownership would have been the obvious, stand-out issue, but the Taoiseach chose not to address it.</p>

The only reference to RTÉ was in relation to the "Mission to Prey" programme, and a lot of people around the table were not aware of it. Perhaps some of them believed that investigative reporting was always true so I gave an example of a case where it was not, and where a story became more important than the truth. That happens and we should not be afraid to say it. In private, we talk about stories that were sensationalised and, as politicians, we should not be afraid to say that.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">Small businesses in rural Ireland have been haemorrhaging since Fine Gael came to power. Not only have Government policies failed to support rural economies, an anti-rural sentiment has emerged from its cosy relationship with Fianna Fáil, resulting in a sweeping tide of depopulation and rural retreat, devastating counties like my constituency of Donegal. Thanks to this anti-rural sentiment, post offices, Garda stations, GPs and bank facilities are retreating from towns across rural Ireland. This has had a devastating impact on businesses struggling with new and existing challenges arising from the recession, which in turn devastated local communities. I am not talking about businesses ready to export or IDA Ireland-sponsored companies but local coffee shops, hairdressers, butchers, furniture shops and newsagents, businesses that will never be primed for export. These are the businesses that are largely left outside Government supports, yet they are the drivers of local economic growth, creating sustainable local employment across rural communities and helping to maintain rural populations as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> Measuring the health of this sector gives an indication of the overall health of the national economy. For this reason, I carried out a survey of small businesses across Donegal and received more than 100 responses. The results were striking and confirmed our deeply held suspicions of current Government policy, which is simply that Fine Gael does not care about rural Ireland. Over 80% of the businesses I polled were concerned about depopulation and the effects that the retreat of rural services will have on their businesses. I raised this with the Minister with responsibility for small business only to be told that endless amounts of money was being poured into tourism development. While support for tourism is most welcome, it fails to target the catalyst for rural economic growth which is local trade. My survey showed that nearly 80% of small businesses rely on local trade while only 13% rely on tourism. I ask the Taoiseach not to quote the unemployment figures for me and tell me they have dropped in Donegal because the Minister did that. It is emigration that has reduced the unemployment figures in Donegal, not economic growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> The message could not be clearer. Small businesses survive when local businesses are thriving, but the Government's policies have ensured that depopulation continues to be the trend, undermining local trade as much as it is undermining the sustainability of rural towns and villages across the country. Before he spells out a list of what the Government has done for rural Ireland, will the Taoiseach tell me exactly how he intends to curb depopulation, increase local trade and provide real and substantial supports for small businesses across rural Ireland?</p>

          <p eId="para_228">I appreciate that unemployment falls for many different reasons but I do not think it is correct to say unemployment is down in Donegal as a consequence of emigration because, based on the census, the population in Donegal is up. If I can dig the figures out from the folder showing the number of people in employment in Donegal, I will give them to the Deputy. I am sure the number of people in employment in Donegal has increased in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> The Government and I acknowledge the very important and vital role of small business in all parts of our country, particularly in rural areas, when it comes to creating jobs and generating important tax revenues we use to build a better society. I will give some examples of the kinds of things the Government is doing. We reduced the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9%, which was of particular benefit to small businesses such as those in the service industry and hospitality, for example, restaurants, hairdressers and barber shops, all owned and run by the same people. There are many people in this House, especially among the parties of the left, who want to reverse it and increase the rate by 4.5%. It would be a mistake and doing it in one fell swoop would do real harm to small business and to employment, particularly in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> We have seen huge investment in tourism and the Deputy knows, as well as I do, the extent to which Donegal has benefited from the tourism boom, with record numbers of people coming to visit Ireland to enjoy what we have to offer in terms of tourism. In many cases they go to attractions which have been greatly enhanced and improved by Government capital investment. I refer to places such as Sliabh Liag, which is every bit as beautiful and wonderful as the Cliffs of Moher and where we invested to improve access so that more people can visit and enjoy it. There have been particular supports around the local enterprise offices, which were established in years gone by and, as was acknowledged by a Deputy opposite, have been responsible for creating many jobs in Roscommon. I am sure they do the same in Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> Project Ireland 2040 is also coming and enormous investment will flow from that programme into rural areas, in housing, healthcare, broadband and schools. Of particular benefit to rural areas will be the investment in the regional road network, which is very much in need of improvement. The A5-N2 project will soon start to connect the northern part of Donegal to Northern Ireland and the Border counties and Dublin and is a vital infrastructure project to which I am very committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> Investment in broadband is also vital. When this Government of Fine Gael, the Independent Alliance and Independents came to office, only 57% of premises in the country had access to high-speed broadband, but by the end of this year it will be close to 80%, which will rise to 100% in the years ahead when we sign the broadband contract.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_233">The Taoiseach did not mention any of the things the businesses in Donegal mentioned, which include the closure of post offices and the closure of Garda stations, that is, the things that are having an impact on their businesses. The Taoiseach spoke about the reduced VAT rate which has been in existence throughout the lifetime of the decline of rural Ireland but has had zero impact on it. Local businesses are struggling and they are dying on their feet because people are being sucked out of rural areas. Unless we deal with that, we will have empty rural areas and there will be nobody to avail of the VAT reductions to which the Taoiseach refers.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> Over 80% of the people I surveyed said they had not heard of any Government initiatives. Small businesses struggling to keep open have not heard of any response from the Government. Many of them say they have never been asked about these things, which I found startling. Given that Fine Gael is the so-called party of small business, I would have thought it would have asked them what would work for them, but maybe they do not want to hear the answers, which are to keep the shops open, keep the Garda stations open, keep the post offices open and keep the rural areas vibrant and alive.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">I am glad the Deputy acknowledges that Fine Gael is the party of small business because it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">I welcome that acknowledgment. I can guarantee the Deputy that public representatives listen to those engaged in business all the time. There is not a single Deputy or Senator in the Houses who has not spent time or does not engage, perhaps several times a year, with his or her local chamber of commerce. </p>
          <p eId="para_237"> I have been provided with the figures for County Donegal. There are 58,353 people in employment, which represents an increase of 9.5% since 2011. There has been an increase of almost 10% in the number at work in County Donegal since 2011.</p>

They include, for example, Abbott in Donegal town and Pramerica in Letterkenny which at this stage must employ more than 1,000 people. We will see more of such investments. Project Ireland 2040 and the national planning framework, which is associated with it provide for population growth of 75% outside the greater Dublin region. In particular, they identify major growth centres, one of which is Letterkenny working with Derry.</p>

          <from>Deputy Noel Grealish<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_240">As we head into the summer months and preparations for the forthcoming budget start in earnest, I seek an assurance from the Taoiseach and the Government that one section of society will be looked after - the people of middle Ireland whom he likes to describe as those who get up early in the morning. No matter how early they get up, those not on the lower edges economically or at the upper levels, find life a constant struggle. Often referred to as the squeezed middle, they bear the biggest burden of demands on their income and receive the least amount of help from the State. They could be called the forgotten middle because that is what it feels like for them. They are the ones who go to work every day and pay their taxes which are higher than they were a decade ago. They are the ones who carried the country through the recession to reach the point we are at today, but they are getting nothing back. Their rent payments are soaring; their insurance bills have gone through the roof and their school and childcare costs have gone up. Fuel prices are probably at their highest ever level; medical costs are rising, as is the cost of electricity. Some are living with their parents, often with three or four children, while trying to save for a deposit on a house. They cannot find a house in the current market scramble which could be made even worse by the activities of the Housing Agency in buying large blocks of houses in private estates. They are the people who do not receive State benefits or grants to help their children to attend third level education, despite fees having increased by 131% since 2005. They are more or less being ignored by the Government which has most of its focus on other sectors of society to the detriment of those in the middle who make the greatest contribution to the economy. Once an Irish worker earns €34,550 a year, he or she pays half of every euro earned above the figure in direct taxes. Almost half of every €10 above that figure is taken in income tax, the universal social charge, USC, and pay-related social insurance, PRSI, leaving them with just over €5. It is all building to being a problem for the country in the future. The Irish Tax Institute has warned, for instance, that the income tax regime is hindering us in the global race for talent. I acknowledge that some slight progress was made in the last budget, inlcuding a small reduction in income tax for the self-employed and a minor reduction in the universal social charge. There will be greater fiscal space in the next budget to do more. My question to the Taoiseach is how will he look after those in middle Ireland next October in a way that will make a real and substantial difference to them?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_148">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_241">As I said previously, the priority in the budget will be to increase spending on public services and infrastructure. These are areas in which everyone can benefit. Everyone in society, no matter who he or she is, will benefit from greater investment in infrastructure, whether it be housing, healthcare, schools, broadband or actions against climate change. They will also benefit from improvements in public services such as education. The priority will be to increase resources and spending on public services and infrastructure. However, in the budget package we will and should - the Deputy is right - find space to ensure we do something to improve the living standards of hard-working people, the people the Deputy mentioned who get up early in the morning, work late, work shifts and work weekends, the people who are just about managing and very much in middle Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_242"> On the types of thing we anticipate doing, we will be following on what was done in previous budgets. For example, in the last budget we were able to reduce the cost of prescription charges for everyone, not only those with medical cards but also those who received a refund under the drugs payment scheme. We will be examining ways to do so again to reduce the cost of prescriptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> In the last two budgets we improved access to childcare and early childhood education. Everyone is now guaranteed free preschool for two years for their children. That benefits everyone. In addition, there is subsidised childcare for the same length of time. We will also examine ways to improve it. We can help people in many ways and reducing the cost of accessing services can be as important as a pay increase or a tax cut. </p>
          <p eId="para_244"> As always, the self-employed will be prioritised. The Deputy will be aware that we have increased the earned income tax credit for those who are self-employed. We will be examining if the resources are available to do the same again. In recent years we have extended benefits in return for PRSI contributions to persons who are self-employed. They include, for example, access to invalidity pension and treatment benefits for the first time. One thing struck me during the recession when I was knocking on doors and meeting people who were self-employed. Often they had worked in construction as fitters, for example, or architects and had lost their jobs when they were entitled to virtually no social protection because somebody else in the household had an income which very often had been the second income. As a result, they were entitled to nothing. That is why we extended invalidity pension to persons who were self-employed. We are looking at ways to also extend jobseeker's benefit in some form to the self-employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> The Deputy is right that there is real unfairness and a real anomaly in the tax system under which people on very modest incomes pay income tax at the highest rate. That is not the norm in other western European countries. It means that somebody on an average income who receives a pay increase, a bonus, an increment or works extra hours will lose more than half in tax and USC. The first thing we had to do - it was the right thing to do - was reduce USC to take nearly 1 million people out of that net entirely. We have done that in the past few years, but the priority now, having taken so many low paid workers out of the income tax net altogether, is to provide relief for those on middle incomes by increasing the point at which people pay at the higher rate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Noel Grealish<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_246">While I acknowledge the Taoiseach's response and what has been done, it is simply not enough. These are the people who bailed out Ireland during the economic crisis. They paid higher amounts in income tax and the universal social charge was introduced. They also pay the local property tax and most of them paid their water charges, but they believe they have been forgotten and not reaped the rewards for their hard work. On the surface, many of them have good jobs and salaries, but they struggle to make ends meet and are time and cash poor. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to the people he personally described as those who get up early in the morning that they will be looked after properly, not just given small tokens here and there when the budget is brought forward in October?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_247">The short answer to the Deputy's question is yes. Part of my mission in politics is to make sure everyone will experience an increase in his or her standard of living. In that context, we should not forget all those who receive very little by way of support from the State. I refer to people who pay a lot of tax but do not qualify for any or many of the benefits the State provides because of means-testing and so on. That is the reason I have a particular interest in removing that real unfairness in the tax system. The average person working full-time in Ireland earns about €44,000 a year, yet at a figure of €36,000 he or she hits the higher rate of income tax, which is far too soon. I would like to see fewer people pay at the highest rate of income tax and want to see people pay less of their income at it. It is a real disincentive and needs to be improved. However, we must do all of this in the context of prudent management of the public finances. We want to balance the books and reduce the national debt. The economy is growing well and fast. We are approaching full employment and I want to make sure we will not repeat the mistakes of the past. I will not fund increases in public spending or tax cuts through additional borrowing, even though some would like us to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">I put it to the Taoiseach that in the context of the programme for Government and media plurality, the really concerning aspect of his remarks in New York this week is that the Taoiseach is in sympathy with President Trump's view of the media. President Trump is probably one of the worst examples of a political leader who regularly demonises the media and media personalities. The Taoiseach should not have any sympathy with him or his plight with the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> The Taoiseach condemned the print media and said the print media is jealous of social media because it takes the print media's business. That is not the case. Social media has been shown to distort news and to be used in situations such as Brexit and in Donald Trump's election in terms of voters, news stories and fake news.</p>

We have also announced a new funding scheme to provide bursaries to young journalists working in local or community radio stations who produce content with a real public service value. We will carry out a review of the Defamation Act. This is being done by the Department of Justice and Equality.

Is the Taoiseach suggesting that the people who reported his comments were being deliberately misleading? Is this the Taoiseach's position? This seems to be what the Taoiseach is suggesting. Why on earth would people do that? The Taoiseach has not denied the fact that he aligned his views with those of President Donald Trump but the Taoiseach is rather coy in putting some detail around it. Which part of President Trump's analysis does the Taoiseach share? The Taoiseach and his Government have not in any way answered the issue around concentration of media ownership. Anybody looking at the Irish media landscape would immediately say this is the glaring issue that needs to be addressed.</p>

As I have said, there is a particular context to this and I was not quoted in full. I have given an example of some of the other things I said about the media, which were positive.

From the leaked excerpts of the report we are aware that it is highly critical of the changes, including the amendments made up to 21 May, and it has asked that the matter be reconsidered by the authorities in Ireland. In the Seanad last night the Minister for Justice and Equality said that he had not read the report. Maybe he has read it since. It is highly unacceptable that this House would be allowed to consider these matters, and the other House be allowed to proceed with these matters, in the absence of this report. I ask the Taoiseach to agree not to proceed with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill until all Members have had an opportunity to read in detail the analysis by an important international body that is tasked with fighting corruption.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">I am aware of the report by the influential Council of Europe body to which Deputy Howlin refers. The report will be submitted for assessment to the Government tomorrow, as is normal in these circumstances. I have read the report. Without pre-empting any decision of Government, it is my expectation that the report will be published in due course, perhaps as early as tomorrow afternoon. The Bill to which the Deputy refers is not currently before this House but I expect it to be before this House before the end of this term, and after the publication of the report.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">I wish to raise the issue of hate crime. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties today published its report on hate crime in Ireland. The report found that a policy vacuum exists for those people subjected to hate crimes, especially people from African backgrounds and transgender people. I am aware that this issue will be raised on Saturday at the transgender healthcare protest, which will be held at 3 p.m. It is a very serious issue and has been on the legislative books for a long time. I believe the last piece of legislation to deal with hate crime was in 1989. Perhaps the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, will comment on this.</p>

Having heard some reports of the report, I believe that some aspects are disturbing. I would be very keen to act on any recommendations in the report as soon as possible, and conduct a review of the Prohibition on Incitement to Racial Religious or National Hatred Act, in the context of this report. As the Minister for Justice and Equality I want to ensure that we show zero tolerance to any form of hate crime.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">The good weather is causing lots of problems for farmers and for other sections of society. Apart from that, there are hardship cases made to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on a regular basis. One lady, Maria from Emly in County Tipperary, is sick with cancer. Her husband also has cancer. Maria applied for a basic payment scheme in 2015. They have a very small holding that supports one small business. Maria augments her income with a delicatessen which she takes to country markets and so on. These people are being ignored by the Department and I have been writing on their behalf. There is no empathy in the Department for situations like this. There are many cases such as this that have GLAS payments waiting. While we might have sympathy about different issues there are real hardship cases being made to the Department. Will the Taoiseach please ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, to deal with this particular case? The case has been under appeal since 2015 with absolutely no result and no engagement from the Department at senior level. This is totally unfair to a family that is struggling with ill health and a small holding.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">We have to consider the Taoiseach's deeds as well as his words when it comes to the future of media in Ireland. He stated that the dominance of Independent News and Media in print and RTÉ in broadcasting was a problem, but we in the Oireachtas committee conducted a major study that found something different. The real problem is that Sky, Netflix, Virgin Media, Google and Facebook are sucking every penny out of the market and there is no money left for Irish media. It is on its collective knees and needs both help and funding. If we are to have a fair and balanced media, we must pay for it. The Taoiseach has dismissed the recommendations of the joint committee, which set out ways in which to do that. I am sorry, but the bursary for trainees and the reduction in the levy are not the scale of response that is required. If the Taoiseach wants a fair and free print, broadcast and online media and his words are to mean anything, he must stand up for Irish media and fund it, but the Government is refusing to do that. It is a do nothing Government in terms of media support and funding.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">I also wish to raise the issue of media plurality. The Taoiseach cited the concerns in that regard. They play out in many ways, including the effect on the terms and conditions of people who work in the concentrated media sector, for example, pensions. Ownership is a significant issue, given that it covers a number of platforms, including social media.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> Like me, the NUJ has repeatedly called for a commission on the future of media. Would the Taoiseach agree to doing something practical like this? A Bill of mine was debated in the House last year but the Government did not agree to it because I was told its impact on property rights would have been unconstitutional. When it comes to the common good, the balance in Ireland seems to be wrong.</p>

          <p eId="para_290"> We do have media ownership laws in Ireland. We have the Broadcast Authority of Ireland and the former Competition Authority, which is now called the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. They take a view - I cannot remember the exact detail - that ownership should not exceed something like 20% or 25%. We do have laws around plurality of ownership and competition. I think that those decisions should be best made by an independent body. I would have concerns about us as politicians, the Government or the Oireachtas making decisions as to who should or should not own the media. It is best vested in an independent body like the competition authority.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">Yesterday, I raised with the Tánaiste news that was delivered to Roscommon's Oireachtas Members privately last Friday concerning the Rosalie unit in Castlerea, which is supposed to accommodate 33 people, a number that is now 12, with mild mental health issues, and St. Joseph's day care centre in Ballaghaderreen. Last Friday, the HSE announced that both facilities would close. The intention is to move people out of the Rosalie centre, but the HSE does not seem to have a plan in respect of the day care centre in Ballaghaderreen. While the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly's door has been open to us on this matter for months and he has tried to listen to and deal with complaints, the most vulnerable people are being left out on a limb and their families in a desperate situation. It is not good enough. I will not lecture the Taoiseach. Rather, I will ask him one question, just as I asked the Tánaiste yesterday. Will the Taoiseach pick up the phone today and tell the HSE not to close these facilities?</p>

          <p eId="para_314">On page 80, the programme for Government commits to expanding the projects supported by drug task forces. I have raised this issue previously. A year ago, the Government launched the national drug strategy, which the House debated last week. Time and again, the Taoiseach, the Minister or the Government announce additional funding, but the problem is it is all one-off funding, not annual funding. Funding to drug task forces was cut in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and remains at 2014 levels. To achieve the efficiencies and build the capacity needed to deliver these projects, they must have annual, recurring, core funding rather than one-off funding. The Government adds up the money and says people are looking for more and more, but I am looking for a change in how this is done. Task forces need to have certainty for future projects, not one-off funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> The Taoiseach mentioned that there would be €250,000 in additional funding this year for task forces dealing with alcohol-related issues. That will become €1 million next year. If they are to build capacity and effectively deliver their programmes, they need their core annual funding to be reinstated more than they need one-off funding.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, to give Deputy Curran a more comprehensive reply on this, but in principle I accept his analysis. It is much better to offer organisations multi-annual funding, probably on a three-year rolling basis, so that they can plan their programmes and not be waiting until November or December to find out what their budgets will be for the next year. What we have done with a number of other organisations is to have an element of core funding, which is done on a multi-annual basis, and in addition to that have funding for one-off projects or funding on a competitive basis, where people bid for funding.</p>

          <p eId="para_321">The programme for Government includes a promise to do something about the cost of insurance. The Members opposite are the Government and Deputy Paschal Donohoe is the Minister for Finance. The cost of all types of insurance has gone up and it is affecting young and old. Today we had a presentation from a group which stated that people are not even being quoted for cars that are more than ten years old. If they are quoted, the cost is probably double what it was the year before. All these ten year old cars are being dumped and have to be scrapped. Will the Taoiseach do anything about insurance? It was in the programme for Government that he would but nothing has been done. The cost of insurance goes up and up.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">People with 11 year old cars are being loaded with 50% to 60% additional costs. This is affecting people in rural Ireland, young drivers and people who get up early in the morning to go to work. There is no reason for loading in the case of second-hand cars that are 11 or 12 years old if they have a national car test, NCT, and are in perfect mechanical condition. From an environmental point of view, a recent report shows that the cost of manufacturing a new car, in terms of CO2 emissions, is the equivalent of driving 150,000 km in an average Ford Focus car. Those are the facts. The insurance industry is screwing and penalising people in rural Ireland, young drivers and older drivers. Cars of that age have an NCT every year and there is no reason to treat them differently from any other car. It is simply a way of picking the pockets of-----</p>

          <p eId="para_328">In 2015, there were 44,300 owners of cars more than ten years old. In 2018, the number had increased to 139,300. There are many reasons for the increase, one of which is affordability because people cannot afford to change their cars as often. Another is that with the quality of cars today, if they are serviced and looked after, ten, 12, 14 or 15 year old cars can work perfectly. The insurance companies have been mentioned. The Insurance (Amendment) Bill must come before the House in order that we can debate this issue. Insurance companies have been ripping people off for too long and it is costing jobs. If they get their way on this issue, it will close down small garages throughout the country and cause a loss of revenue for the Exchequer. It will also devalue other people's cars because if cars are scrapped at ten years, no one will buy an eight year old car. This policy is having a serious knock-on effect.</p>

Indeed, they have fallen by about 20%.</p>

A recent report from DG SANTE, the health and safety arm of the European Commission, found that many of the post mortem inspections of beef exported to the EU from Brazil are performed by factory staff. Only a small number of post-mortem inspections are done by official veterinary staff. This practice, which would be illegal in Europe, is a food safety issue. How can the consumer be assured that all food sold in Ireland but produced outside the EU is of the same standard as food produced within the EU?</p>

I am sure there are procedures in place to make sure that products are approved before they enter the EU market. In our discussions on Mercosur at a European level, the Government is strongly making the case that we should not allow significant increases in beef coming into the country from South America unless our own industry, which is very sensitive to this, is protected, and we are sure that anything coming into the European food chain is of the highest standard.</p>

          <p eId="para_335">The Taoiseach mentioned investment in rural Ireland earlier. Page 50 of the programme for Government deals with the issue of rural transport. This week, I met providers in County Meath to hear about discussions held between LocalLink, a national not-for-profit organisation for local bus providers, and the National Transport Authority, NTA, about renewal of contracts for the LocalLink service. The fear among local providers in Meath and elsewhere arises because the NTA will not confirm whether commercial bus providers will be able to tender for these routes alongside not-for-profit operators. In County Meath, the local Flexibus service carried more than 178,000 passengers last year across Meath, Louth and Fingal. It provides a life link for elderly and disabled people and has more than 20 years of experience. If the NTA allows commercial operators to enter this sector, the ethos of the service in Meath, Louth and Fingal will change. When will confirmation be provided in respect of the public procurement process? Crucially, will the Government defend the not-for-profit local operators who provide local rural links and ensure the service provider puts people rather than profit first?</p>

          <p eId="para_340">Following on from the CervicalCheck scandal, many people in the thalidomide community had hoped their litigation would be completed in a sensitive and timely fashion, rather than through an adversarial court system. It is clear the Minister for Health has instructed his legal team to endeavour to achieve a technical knockout of the thalidomide litigants' entitlement by bringing a spurious legal point. The chairperson of the Irish Thalidomide Association condemns in the strongest possible manner the actions of the Minister with regard to his unwarranted, inappropriate and insensitive approach. The Taoiseach said recently that we need to create a culture of truth in the health service. Where is the culture of truth for these people, many of whom are still waiting to have their cases settled? Why would the Government not take the same sensible and more humane approach that it took in respect of the CervicalCheck scandal and take care of these litigants who deserve justice now?</p>

          <p eId="para_342">The Government and the State Claims Agency have said they will have a changed approach with regard to victims, particularly when addressing sensitive cases. However, on the thalidomide issue, the State Claims Agency has been extremely adversarial in the High Court. This issue warrants the attention of the Taoiseach and the relevant Minister. The 2013 offer from the Government did not provide any individual assessment of the damage or disability caused by thalidomide use. </p>
          <p eId="para_343">The Government needs to review how the State Claims Agency is dealing with a particular and finite number of people who have a legacy dating back over 40 years. I know that the Taoiseach is aware of the issue and he must be compassionate.</p>

          <p eId="para_346">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_347">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The Bill I introduce is to establish an ombudsman for owner management companies. It will set up the body to help in training board members, assist in dispute resolution and make recommendations on the future development and management of the sector. The ombudsman will be based within the Property Services Regulatory Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> A recent submission by the Apartment Owners Network and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government estimated that nearly 500,000 people were living in multi-unit developments in Ireland, the majority of which are run by owner management companies. I pay tribute to the volunteer efforts of all those involved which are vital in achieving and maintaining quality of life in these developments. However, they fall between several stools and have no Department or resources backing them up. Owner management companies are governed by dense company law, with which many are not familiar, and must adhere to strict housing regulations and deal with property rights under the Department of Justice and Equality. My Bill will provide a new body within the Property Services Regulatory Authority which will help the people who run these companies for the greater good of their multi-unit developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> Key training and information, as well as dispute resolution, will be the core duties of the new ombudsman. The office will also help to develop new policy in the area and highlight key issues of concern. As the Government seeks to build 35,000 new units per annum up to 2040, many of them will be run by such companies. We need to give them support to ensure the highest level of governance is achieved and maintained. The ombudsman will work for the 500,000 people living in these apartment blocks and estates throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> The main objectives of the Bill are to promote good governance within the owner management company sector; to provide information on the duties and responsibilities of owner management companies; to provide training for members of owner management companies; to make recommendations to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on the regulation of owner management companies, including the representation of tenants in a multi-unit development; to assist in the resolution of disputes in an owner management company on a non-binding basis; and to publish an annual report on the work of the ombudsman. Such a Bill will help the sector. A total of 500,000 people live in managed apartment blocks and estates. As we heard at the Oireachtas joint committee, this is an area that needs to be addressed. The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland and the Apartment Owners Network referred to it as a ticking time bomb. It is important to get some of the management companies into shape, both financially and in terms of their corporate governance structures. We need to help and there is a mechanism in place to do so. The Bill is the way forward. I will be happy to work with all parties and the Government to make sure proper regulation is introduced in the sector.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_357">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend and extend the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Acts 2003 and 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">As we heard even in the last few minutes, there are aspects of the insurance market that are dysfunctional. It was as far back as June 2016 that my party introduced a motion in the House which called on the Government to tackle issues prevalent in the insurance industry which were having a detrimental impact on consumers. The cost of insurance working group was set up later that year. It has reported and the recommendations are gradually being implemented, but the actions we have seen so far have not been substantial in nature. Implementation of lmany of the main recommendations has been delayed.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> The Government cites the recent decreases in the cost of motor insurance, as reported by the CSO, as vindication of its policies, but, of course, it comes on the back of a 57% increase in motor insurance premiums. Going up by 57% and falling by 20% is not success and should not be heralded as such. The Government has yet to establish a national claims information database; to legislate for another liquidation such as Setanta Insurance, which still rumbles on more than four years after the collapse of the company; to tackle insurance fraud; to establish an anti-fraud unit within An Garda Síochána; and to establish index tracking business insurance premiums. We have no data whatsoever for the cost of business insurance. The Government has yet to take any action to stabilise personal injury claims, while we await further reports from the Personal Injuries Commission. All the while, the European Commission continues to investigate the industry for anti-competitive behaviour. We have also seen no movement on the issue of flood insurance cover for businesses and households located in areas in which demountable flood defence systems have been installed by the Office of Public Works.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> In recent weeks my colleague Deputy Billy Kelleher introduced an important Bill to strengthen the penalties for insurance fraud. The Bill I am introducing continues in that vein. It has been designed to strengthen the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. We know that only approximately 30% of all personal injury claims are settled, either in the PIAB or the courts. The remainder are dealt with outside the courts or the PIAB and in a way where there is no transparency or actual data. The PIAB was designed to remove pressure from the courts system and establish a more constructive engagement approach, rather than the often costly adversarial legal approach in the courts system. However, the current system is being undermined. It is being undermined by some claimants who see the PIAB process as simply a rubber stamp. They see higher payouts in the courts and, therefore, do not co-operate in any way with the PIAB process. Under the current process, the PIAB provides for independent medical examinations which serve to inform the board in order that it can make an assessment of an appropriate award. If the assessment is accepted by both parties, expensive legal proceedings are avoided. There is currently no penalty or disincentive for a claimant who fails to attend this important, independent medical examination. This means that the board needs to make an assessment lacking critical information on the injuries obtained. Similarly, there are no consequences for applicants to the board who fail to provide evidence of special damages. Again, the board must make an assessment in the absence of this critical information. More often than not, the assessment is rejected and legal proceedings are commenced. The Bill provides that if a claimant fails to provide information or documents requested by the board or fails to attend a medical examination as requested by the board and if he or she subsequently brings legal proceedings, the court shall have regard to the failure to comply with the requests made by the board and discretion to rule that certain evidence, including medical evidence, is not admissible in court. The court has discretion to determine that no award of costs may be made in favour of the claimant. It really is designed to encourage people to engage in a meaningful way with the PIAB process.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> The Bill will also make it mandatory for the book of quantum, on which assessments are based, to be updated every three years. The book of quantum was updated in 2016, but prior to that, it had not been updated since first being published in 2004. There should not be an assumption that it always has to be revised upwards. The Bill will not resolve the dysfunction that persists in the insurance market, but it will make important changes in how the Personal Injuries Assessment Board functions. I urge colleagues across the House to back it.</p>

            <p eId="para_373">I am particularly delighted by the very significant continuing fall in the unemployment rate, which is currently at approximately 5%. However, between 11% and 12% of young people under 25 are unemployed at a time when IBEC has stated that there are 80,000 skills shortages, in particular in the construction industry. This reminds me of the period when Bertie Ahern and Mary Harney were in Government and went around the world advertising for skilled people to come to Ireland while a significant number of Irish people at home lacked the skills to be able to take up those jobs. Does the Taoiseach plan to leave a key group of young Irish people sitting at home while Ireland again sends recruiters around the world to entice people here? That seems to be the Government approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_374"> I do not know if the Taoiseach would be shocked or concerned to discover that there are significantly more than 700 unemployed young people in the constituency which he and I represent. In the neighbouring constituency of Dublin Central the figure is far higher. I am concerned that the Government has forgotten about people in areas such as Dublin West and Dublin Central who could find training that they would enjoy and prosper from but cannot do so because of the cap on further education places. The Government considers skills something to be sourced from abroad rather than developed in our own young people who would go on to get traineeships or apprenticeships, go to college and become completely independent in terms of employment and income for themselves and their families, should they have a family.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_375">I share Deputy Burton's concerns in regard to skills development and valuable pathways for people, younger people in particular, to acquire the skills they need and which are also needed by the economy at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_376"> I welcome the fact that the living wage technical group has recommended a 20 cent increase in the living wage. I note that recommendation is largely due to price inflation in housing and accommodation. It is past time that the Civil Service and public sector, as leaders in good employment practices, ensured that each of their employees earns at least the living wage.</p>
            <p eId="para_377"> I also wish to raise the issue of the gender pay gap, which remains one of the most stark and persistent reminders of the continued inequality faced by women in the State. The programme for Government committed to addressing the issue but progress in that regard has been painstakingly slow. The latest statistics show that the problem is getting worse. Recent figures from the Central Statistics Office indicate that, on average, women are paid 14% less than men compared with a 12% difference in 2012. That deterioration and discrepancy is unacceptable. It sends a clear message that the work done by women is somehow less valuable and less valued than that done by their male counterparts and that must be tackled head on. As the Taoiseach is aware, women play as vital a role as men in our workplaces but that is not reflected in their pay or position in the labour market. It makes a joke of the concept of equal pay for work of equal value, which has been a central tenet of domestic and European law since the 1970s. When does the Taoiseach intend to introduce the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill? What other measures does he propose to tackle this issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_378">The Government has decided to provide only an additional €800 million of fiscal space for new measures next year. The arbitrary fiscal stance taken by the Government is that €500 million will be set aside for the so-called rainy day fund that is likely to be invested abroad and a further €900 million will be unspent. Some €2.6 billion will be added for previous commitments which are already accounted for. The Taoiseach stated during Leaders' Questions that he envisages a tax package forming part of the additional spend. Is it his view that the ratio of 2:1 on additional spend to tax will be reflected in that? If that is so, will that 2:1 ratio include the €2.6 billion of commitments made on additional capital, public pay and demographics which are embedded in the numbers for next year?</p>
            <p eId="para_379"> I have been seeking clarity on the rainy day fund for some time. Where will the fund, comprising €500 million, be placed? Is the figure the Taoiseach gave to the House of a deficit target for next year of 0.1% of gross domestic product, GDP, a sum of approximately €250 million to €300 million, accurate? Is it his intention to borrow that sum to put it aside? That does not make any sense to me.</p>

            <p eId="para_380">I wish to ask the Taoiseach about precarious employment, the creation of meaningful jobs and, in particular, the large amounts of public money being put into the film industry. I do not expect him to have all the answers here but I ask him to give the matter serious consideration. Some €70 million per year is put into the film industry through tax relief and film board grants. At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in January, representatives of Screen Producers Ireland and the Irish Film Board stated that the investment has generated 17,000 whole-time-equivalent jobs. I do not know if the Taoiseach has seen the very long Olsberg report which was issued last week and shows that there are nowhere near 17,000 jobs in the Irish film industry. That confirms the statements of workers in the industry, who have recently protested about the amount of money put into it in view of the fact that there are virtually no permanent jobs, there is no continuity of employment, and there is widespread bullying, harassment and victimisation of people who ask for their rights and so on in it. A report commissioned by Screen Producers Ireland shows that the film industry, which receives €80 million in public funding per year, does not provide 17,000 jobs but, rather, there are 7,000 direct jobs in film, television and animation. When one strips out RTÉ, TV3 and so on, there are 3,000 whole-time equivalents in the film industry. Those are not full-time jobs because those in the industry work from project to project. For €80 million we might be getting 2,000 totally precarious jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_381"> I would love it if the Irish Film Board or Screen Producers Ireland would provide clarity on this issue. How many people are working in the film industry in Ireland today, 4 July? It is likely that there are almost no people working in Troy Studios, possibly ten to 15 in Ardmore Studios and possibly approximately 100 elsewhere, all of whom are on project-by-project contracts. In the context of €80 million in public funds going into the industry, does the Taoiseach believe it is acceptable that there is almost no permanent continuous employment or even some sort of guarantee for people in the industry that they will get employed in the next project?</p>

            <p eId="para_382">The national risk assessment has identified Brexit as the number one risk to the economy and it is one which is becoming more ominous by the day. During both Taoiseach's questions and European statements last week, the Taoiseach and his colleagues failed to answer any of the specific questions put to them by the Opposition about their strategy and the reason the June target the Taoiseach talked about for six months was missed. Subsequently, the Taoiseach told journalists that he is preparing for a no-deal hard Brexit and not preparing for any measures on this island. I do not disagree with that. We should have been preparing for a hard Brexit a long time ago but the Taoiseach should outline here what exactly is involved. Will he state if he has discussed this matter with the European Union and if they have agreed to this particular scenario?</p>
            <p eId="para_383"> Further, on Friday, the Taoiseach stated that it is unrealistic for the backstop to apply to the whole of the United Kingdom. That is in direct opposition to his statement of 8 December last and subsequently that explicitly said that the backstop provided a mechanism for the United Kingdom as a whole. Will he explain when he changed his mind on this matter?</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_384">To pick up on the last point first, what we are doing in terms of preparing for the possibility of a hard Brexit, which we believe is unlikely but for which it is prudent to prepare, is contingency planning for different scenarios. We should be in a position to share that in the next couple of weeks. It is very much contingency planning for all sorts of different scenarios but the most obvious one that may arise if the United Kingdom leaves the Single Market and the customs union, as it intends to do, is that sooner or later we will need to reinforce our customs and Revenue checks in ports and airports, so it is in that space. We will be happy to share that when we are in a position to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_385"> On the UK backstop, again, I am very happy to clarify that. What I said was that a UK-wide backstop could apply to customs but what could not apply was a UK backstop where the four freedoms are separated and that that exceptional scenario could only be made for-----</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_389">No. The Deputy is suggesting there is a conflict between what I said last December and what I said in Brussels last week. I am saying there is not. What I said in Brussels last week was that a UK-wide backstop could apply to something like customs but could not apply if there was to be some sort of division of the four freedoms. The European Union is willing to make exceptions for Northern Ireland to allow the European Single Market to apply to Northern Ireland when it comes to goods and services but not other items. However, such an exception would not be made for the UK as a whole. That is at least what I was trying to say, and I am fairly sure it is what I said, but I am happy to clarify that.</p>
            <p eId="para_390"> Going back to Deputy Burton's comments, I am pleased that there was a welcome for the fact that the unemployment rate is now down to 5.1%. It was 16% at one stage. The long-term unemployment rate, which is people out of work for a year or more, is about 2%.</p>
            <p eId="para_391"> The youth unemployment rate is down from over 30% to 10% or 12%. It has been the case in Ireland for decades, and across the world, that youth employment has generally been about double the national rate. There is a reason for that. It is because when youth unemployment is calculated, people who are in education or training are not included so it is a different measure of how the workforce has done. For example, very few people in their 40s or 50s are in education and training. If we take people who are under 25, a huge number of them, perhaps even more than half of them, are not in the workforce. They are in education or training. The unemployment rate, therefore, is based on a minority of people between the ages of 16-----</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_392">The unemployment rate is based on people not working. The Taoiseach should know that.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_262">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_393">-----and 25. If we move more people under 25 into education and training, the unemployment rate as a percentage potentially increases because of the way it is calculated. Those people get taken out of the calculation because they are not considered to be part of the workforce. The standard unemployment rate is calculated as a percentage of the workforce. There is a difference between percentages and raw numbers but I can provide a written briefing for the Deputy on that if I have not explained it properly. It is not that young people are more likely to be unemployed. It is that the denominator is different because so many young people are involved in education and training, they are not counted as part of the workforce. That makes the percentage higher, if not the probability of unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_394"> When it comes to the minimum wage, the Government takes advice from the Low Pay Commission, a statutory body established by the Oireachtas to make recommendations on minimum wage. We have increased the minimum wage twice during the period of this Government. The living wage is calculated differently. There is no input from employers in that, which I believe is a weakness. If a minimum wage or a living wage is being calculated, it should have the input of employers as well. Ultimately, they are the employers. They are stakeholders. Their views do matter, and their views should be heard. Ultimately, they create the jobs and they can advise us as to whether jobs may be put at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_395"> The living wage does not give adequate regard to the views of employers. It also takes into account housing costs, which are very high, but it is not the case that everyone has housing costs. There are people who own their home. There are people who live at home, for example. It is based on certain assumptions which are different from those made on the minimum wage, which is drawn up by the Low Pay Commission which advises Government on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_396"> Cabinet has approved the heads of a Bill on the issue of the gender pay gap. The legislation will require companies of more than 250 employees initially, moving to companies of more than 50 employees, to calculate the gender pay gap in their companies and publish it. Having published it, I imagine they will be required to explain it, particularly if we see disparities from one company in the same business to another company in a similar business because there will be pressure brought on as a consequence of transparency to deal with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_397"> We have equal pay for equal work and there are often other reasons there is a gender pay gap. It is not necessarily down to a female worker getting paid less than a male worker for the same work. It is often down to women not getting a fair go when it comes to promotion or not being able to rise up the ranks of a company or business because they are not getting a fair number of promotions. Also, women often work shorter hours than men because women often take on more of the caring responsibilities than their partners. That is something companies cannot change but we can change through public policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_403">On the budget, the total budget package for 2019 will be in the region of €3.5 billion. The vast of majority of that is committed but it is important to remember how it is committed. There is €1.5 billion in additional capital spending for public infrastructure, housing, broadband, healthcare, climate action and all those areas. There is additional funding for health and education, especially having regard to demographics, the increase in the number of children at school and the number of patients that will be seen next year. There are the increases in public sector pay, with pay increases for nurses, doctors, teachers, civil servants and local authority workers all programmed in. That has to be paid for. There is also the full-year cost for elements such as the welfare and pension increases, which kicked in in March last year. The vast majority of that is committed but it is committed to good measures. We stand over the fact that we committed that early.</p>

            <p eId="para_408">On the tax package, the focus will be on income taxes. Last year, we paid for the reduction in the USC and the reduction in income through tax increases elsewhere. It was paid for through measures such as the sugar tax, for example, and the increase in stamp duty on commercial property. We paid for the tax package last year through tax increases in other areas. I imagine, although it is far from decided yet, that we will adopt a similar approach, which means the entire budget package, never mind the 2:1 model, will be 10:1, 20:1 or 100:0 when it comes to public spending because the focus is very much on increasing spending on public services and public infrastructure. Unlike last year, it may be the case that the tax package is fully funded by tax increases in other areas. That is the approach that was taken last year, but as I said, the budget is far from negotiated yet and far from written, and a lot can change between now and then. Anything greater than a package of €3.5 billion would require more borrowing. I hear people talk about there being more money available. It is only available if we borrow it or if there is more fiscal space that could be used. Again, it can only be used if we borrow it. It is very much my view-----</p>

            <p eId="para_411">More borrowing is the wrong policy at the moment. The economy is growing fast, tax revenues are very buoyant and we are approaching full employment. Now is not the time to increase borrowing. Now is the time to balance the books and pay down the debt.</p>

            <p eId="para_413">That is the responsible thing to do, in my view. On the rainy day fund, it is intended that will be managed by the NTMA.</p>
            <p eId="para_414"> On the film industry, I have not seen the report that Deputy Boyd Barrett mentions. He indicated there are few or no permanent jobs in the film industry. I suspect that is related to the nature of the industry in many ways. Film projects are discrete projects and television series are often discrete series. Jobs are available for a year or another period of time. The nature of the film industry and programme production is that projects are very often discrete and jobs are not for life. In terms of tax incentives, we are operating in a very competitive environment. That is the truth of the matter. Many different countries have tax incentives to encourage the film and audiovisual industries. Without such incentives, we could lose out entirely. If we were to remove tax incentives, rather than having a better outcome, we would end up with fewer jobs and less investment all around.</p>

            <p eId="para_420">I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 9, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_421"> Cabinet committee B last met on 7 June. A date for the next meeting has not yet been scheduled. The committee covers the areas of social policy and public service reform, including education, children, social inclusion, Irish, arts and culture, and continued improvements and reform of public services. Cabinet committee B acts as the forum through which Government advances policies and services aimed at ensuring all citizens, including the most vulnerable, receive the necessary supports and opportunities to improve their lives and fulfil their potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_422"> The committee aims to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of the relevant commitments in A Programme for a Partnership Government. It provides the opportunity to shape proposals on issues such as equality, disability and disadvantage which require input from multiple Departments. Through policy interventions at Cabinet committee level and measures introduced as part of the budgetary cycle, the Government has introduced a number of sustainable reforms aimed at improving the lives and standard of living of those most in need. These include affordable childcare measures, the increase in the national minimum wage to €9.95 per hour and a €5 increase in all basic weekly welfare and pension payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_423"> The committee has a very broad remit and has sought to bring added value to a number of important social policy matters such as ensuring ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; advancing several important gender equality actions; and implementation of structures and funding to support the north-east inner city initiative. </p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_424">I suppose I should thank the Taoiseach for his rather patronising remarks to myself and Deputy McDonald in respect of young people being unemployed. I do not care whether the figure of 750 young people being unemployed in Dublin West is by his calculation really only 5% - the statisticians in the CSO say it is 11% or 12%.</p>
            <p eId="para_425"> On the gender pay gap, I will have to read back over the Taoiseach's reply. Yesterday, his Minister for Finance told me that the seven top jobs in the Department of Finance are all held by men. That sounds to me as though, for the women in the Department of Finance who are bright, capable and ambitious, a penalty is being exacted for having children and families. It is not that they do not want to be promoted, as the Taoiseach is patronisingly suggesting to women, but that we have not amended the position in respect of women who, over a 40-year career, take three or six years off work because they have a number of children. What is unusual about women taking time off in such circumstances? That is what we need to change. I have said before that I was one of four women around a table of 18 men in the Cabinet. The Taoiseach has actually reduced that number since he came into office. I am not sure he gets gender equality. The reason for the pay gap is that women are concentrated in the lower echelons of the public service. When it comes to the Department of Finance, the budget, the rainy day fund and so on, nobody at the top level is a woman. </p>
            <p eId="para_426"> In the context of the social economy, we have been awaiting a report on social and community-based banking from the Government for some time. The main banks are closing their branches, particularly in rural Ireland and disadvantaged urban communities, and the post offices are planning to do the same. There is a proposal for community-based banking with perhaps a pilot scheme from Sparkasse, the German community bank that has been operating for a long time. It has offered to run a pilot scheme in Ireland to show how a new form of community banking that would include home loans would operate. I am told the Department of Finance - with no women at the helm, by the way - is actually set once again to give this the thumbs down. Is this real in terms of the crisis we have heard about this morning in different parts of rural Ireland? There is also a crisis in a significant number of disadvantaged communities that still have high unemployment.</p>

            <p eId="para_427">A defining feature of Fine Gael's management of the Department of Health has been major Supplementary Estimates announced late in the year. This has been going on for a number of years. After a series of years in which the Supplementary Estimates related only to additional measures announced during the year, we now see permanent use of them to fund core health services. This is not about additional measures or whatever but the funding of core services. This has been accompanied by Ministers and Taoisigh denying overruns until late in the year and also refusing to explain whether the under-provision for services was a political decision or an administrative error. In today's newspapers it is reported that the health budget is again over allocation by €167 million and that the final annual figure is likely to be much higher than that. No explanation has been provided as to what is involved and it appears that we are likely to get another demonstration of the Taoiseach and his Ministers shaking their heads as if it has nothing to do with them. Can the Taoiseach give an assurance that during the preparation of this year's budget, there was no interference by any member of Cabinet in the service plan costings provided by the Health Service Executive? What is the current projection for the likely full-year costs in health?</p>
            <p eId="para_428"> The Taoiseach referenced disability. The Government is not performing on disability in respect of access to services for children, particularly the various therapies I outlined yesterday such as physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy as well as respite services and residential care. In the whole row about decongregation, many people with disabilities are being left behind. I get somewhat annoyed when people declare that we have ratified the UN declaration in respect of disability. It means absolutely nothing on the ground when vast sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 have not been implemented. The Taoiseach wrote to me following my raising of the matter on the Order of Business last week. It really puts a focus on the absence of delivery for children with special needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_429">I am struck by the passive stance the Taoiseach and his Government seem to adopt around the gender pay gap. By way of response to me, he blithely stated that, as a matter of fact, we already have equal pay for work of equal value. I specifically referred to that provision, which has been on the Statute Book since the 1970s, for the simple reason that we do not have equal pay for work of equal value. Women are coming out on the wrong side of that bargain and, in addition, Deputy Burton is quite right to point out that it is scandalous that the top echelons in the Department of Finance are exclusively male. I do not believe there are no women of talent and learning and ambition who could perform at that level. It is the departmental equivalent of a "manel". I see the Ceann Comhairle looking at me curiously; that means a panel made up entirely of men.</p>
            <p eId="para_430">Of course, it is much more serious because it is at the very heart of Government where key decisions are made. I invite the Taoiseach to be less passive and defensive and to engage properly and fully with these issues which, in the first instance, are of concern to women. They go to the very heart of a functioning economy, a healthy society and a representative democracy.</p>
            <p eId="para_431"> I am left with no option but to raise this matter in this format because I have written exhaustively to the Minister for Education and Skills and have received responses worthy only of an episode of "Yes Minister". It relates to the fact that nearly seven months have passed since the subcontractor walked off the site at Naomh Fionnbarra GAA Club in Cabra, which is my local GAA club, with just two weeks left to complete works on a pitch. The outstanding work is minor in nature. A pitch has to be laid and some electrical and fencing work must be completed. This publicly funded project was directly impacted by the collapse of Carillion. Despite dozens - and I mean dozens - of communications from me - I am sure others have been in touch - it appears that the Minister is either not interested or does not care but he is certainly not prepared to do anything to get the workers back on site.</p>

            <p eId="para_432">As the Taoiseach said, this committee also deals with the area of arts and culture so I will continue to draw his attention to the film industry because €80 million goes out in grants from the Irish Film Board and section 481 tax relief. I will put it dramatically so that it will draw, I hope, the Taoiseach's attention. I do not expect him to know everything about this.</p>
            <p eId="para_433"> There is something rotten in the Irish film industry. The law governing section 481 requires that section 481 tax relief - €70 million per year - provide "an effective stimulus to film making in the State through, among other things, the provision of quality employment and training opportunities". That is the law. There is no training system in the film industry. Someone can be a trainee for years, be paid the trainee rate and have no career progression and no certainty of any kind of future employment no matter how long he or she has been in it. If the person steps out of line once with the production company that is in receipt of all this money, that person will not work in the industry again. That is how it works. It is project to project and it is a different kind of industry but it involves the provision of €80 million that is supposed to create an industry when nobody knows whether they will have a job next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_434"> Twelve companies are the recipients of this money. I went to the trouble of meeting the Comptroller and Auditor General for two hours two weeks ago to ask him to look into this. That is how seriously I take this. When I ask those 12 companies that received €183 million in tax relief in the past three years how many people they employ, they cannot give an answer because the number is three or four. That is not on. There is something wrong in the industry. People in the industry accept that it is project to project but something is wrong if the same production company that is getting all this money can employ a person for one project but say to that person when the next project comes along in a month or two that they are not taking that person because they asked about overtime or they complained about working hours in excess of the working time directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_435"> I am asking the Taoiseach to look at this. While we should give lots of money to arts and film because it is a very important industry, it must be an industry where there are some rights for employees and some sort of expectation of being able to work in the industry over their lifetime so that if people do not do something terrible, they will continue to be employed in that industry, because it is public money.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_282">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_436">We have a gender pay gap in Ireland. There are many reasons for it, two of which I cited. I said that women do not get a fair go. They do not get a fair crack of the whip when it comes to promotion in the workplaces because women are very often unfairly expected to carry a greater burden of child care then men. I do not think there is anything wrong about that. I think both those things are very true. That is what I said, so if Deputy McDonald wants to check the record, she can do so. Those things need to change. We need to see more women being promoted in the workplace, be it in the public or private sector, because women do not get a fair go when it comes to promotion.</p>
            <p eId="para_437"> I am conscious that every couple is different but we need to see men taking on their fair share of caring and child-rearing. We can do that through things like extended paternity leave, which we have introduced, much better family leave, and more family-friendly workplaces. Far from being passive, this Government is being active. We are the Government that is bringing in gender pay gap legislation. It could have been done by any previous Government. We are the ones who are doing it. That will require initially companies with 250 employees, reducing to 50 later, to publish their gender pay gap. That will bring about transparency. Companies will be asked to explain why they have a gender pay gap and why their gender pay gap is bigger than that of their competitors. That is an example of where we are being very active and are certainly not being passive.</p>
            <p eId="para_438"> Last year, for the first time ever, 52% of appointments to State boards by the Government were female. We want to get to the point where we have equal representation, from 40-60 to 50-50, but for the first time in a very long time, if not ever, 52% of people appointed to State boards were women and that is because of a major effort to promote that as a policy with hard targets. We will now introduce a new initiative around company boards similar to a measure introduced in the UK, a Government-led initiative to put pressure on private sector companies to put more women on their boards. Interview panels are developed from boards. Therefore, there will be more women on interview panels and, therefore, women will be more likely to get a fair chance of being promoted. This is an issue on which the Government is very committed to acting and where it is doing things no previous Government did and could have done.</p>
            <p eId="para_439"> In respect of community banking, the Government is considering the Sparkassen proposal. What might not come across a lot of the time is the fact that Sparkassen's request is that the Government would put €150 million or more into this. It is one thing if a bank wants to set up in Ireland, and we welcome competition and want more banks to set up in Ireland and give more credit, but it is another thing when the bank is asking the Government to pay for the setting up and to capitalise it. That is a definite difficulty we have. We must also bear in mind that we have some forms of community banking such as credit unions which provide all sorts of community banking and can probably do more. We would like to see An Post provide banking services more. For the Government to stump up the money for an institution to come in and do it is a very different question. This point has been missed in the debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_440"> The HSE service plan must be approved by the Minister for Health. It generally goes to Cabinet as well. There is a debate over the costings. It is the job of the Department of Health to second-guess costings of financial projections put forward by the HSE. It is the job of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to do the same, to examine any costings and projections Departments or agencies come up with and second-guess them. That happens and should happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_441">Every year the Supplementary Estimate is part of the core services. It is as if a proper, accurate Estimate is not given at the beginning of every year and that there is a bit of manipulation going on and a lack of transparency.</p>

            <p eId="para_442">I do not have any particular information about the educational matter raised by Deputy McDonald but I will certainly tell the Minister for Education and Skills that it was raised here when I see him tomorrow.</p>
            <p eId="para_443"> The fundamental idea behind any tax relief or incentive, particularly if it is one that is commercially focused and aimed at the private sector, is that the benefits should outweigh the cost, so the theory at least is that by having these tax incentives in place, film, media and audiovisual productions happen in Ireland that otherwise would not. They would happen in another country if we did not have those reliefs and incentives in place. That is the basic calculation we must do. Does having these very generous tax incentives and reliefs, and they are very generous, benefit the economy in the round because of the investment brought into the country?</p>

            <p eId="para_450">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_451"> The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, is an independent statutory agency operating under the aegis of my Department. The council analyses and reports on strategic policy matters relevant to Ireland's economic, social, environmental and sustainable development. Its membership comprises representatives of business and employers’ organisations, ICTU, agricultural and farming organisations, community and voluntary organisations and environmental organisations, together with heads of Departments and independent experts. This composition means that it plays an important and unique role in bringing different perspectives from civil society together with the Government. This helps the NESC to analyse the challenges facing Irish society and develop a shared understanding among its members of how to tackle them.</p>
            <p eId="para_452"> In accordance with the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006, I have certain functions such as appointing the members of the NESC and presenting reports to the Government prior to publication or laying them before the Houses, as in the case of the annual reports. The council is funded from my Department’s Vote. My Department also has governance responsibilities in regard to the council. In the coming years Ireland will face into a period of significant change, both at home and abroad, which will present some new and exceptional challenges. In that regard, A Programme for a Partnership Government specifically notes that there are policy challenges on which long-term thinking is required. I expect the council to continue to contribute to policy development, with a focus on the strategic and longer term view.</p>
            <p eId="para_453"> The council’s current work programme comprises a key social challenge - low work intensity households, quality tailored services and participation; climate change - governance of the low-carbon transition; and land value, land use and urban development. The Government may ask the NESC to explore a report on certain issues, but how it will choose to do this will be a matter for the council, which is independent in its day-to-day business and working arrangements. The most recent NESC reports are Urban Development Land, Housing and Infrastructure: Fixing Ireland's Broken System and Moving from Welfare to Work: Low Work Intensity Households and the Quality of Supportive Services. In recent months I have brought both reports to the Government in advance of publication. I have also appointed four independent members of the council to fill remaining vacancies, following an open process conducted by the Public Appointments Service through <i>stateboards.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_454">On an issue I have already raised, the NESC's report refers 12 times to the problem of precarious work. When talking about economic benefits, one needs to look at the prevalence of precarious work and the extent to which the State is subsidising and facilitating work that does not have to be precarious. I again cite the film industry as an example. If we are putting in a lot of public money, we need to ensure it is being put in in a way that will create quality employment and provide training for people to create sustainable jobs and industries. I ask the Taoiseach to look seriously at this sector. Anywhere public money is put in, it should not unnecessarily subsidise precarious work, but that is what is happening in many sectors, including the film industry. </p>
            <p eId="para_455"> With reference to the report, Urban Development Land, Housing and Infrastructure: Fixing Ireland's Broken System and so on, Deputy Mick Wallace brought up these issues last night, while I brought them up two weeks ago in a motion against which the Government voted. The House passed Deputy Mick Wallace's Bill, about which I am delighted, but what is the Government going to do about it?</p>
            <p eId="para_456"> There are vulture funds sitting on perfectly good empty units. I have cited two examples several times in the House because they are staring me in the face every week in Dún Laoghaire. A vulture fund, Apollo Global Management, has been sitting on ten empty apartments for about two years in the centre of Dún Laoghaire. It tried to evict the tenants and got some of them out, although some fought it through the Residential Tenancies Board and are still in place. Nonetheless, there are ten empty apartments. Cerberus, which bought a block of apartments from NAMA, has been sitting on 25 perfectly good empty units for about five years. These are just two examples. Does the Taoiseach think it is a problem? Does he think it is acceptable that these vulture funds are also beneficiaries of section 110 tax relief? If he thinks it is not acceptable in the face of a housing crisis, what does he propose to do about it?</p>

            <p eId="para_457">The Taoiseach mentioned the report, Urban Development Land, Housing and Infrastructure: Fixing Ireland's Broken System. It is a welcome piece of work which includes a number of very welcome recommendations such as building affordability into policies designed to increase the supply of housing, starting with land and rental costs; using publicly owned land to increase the supply of housing; and ensuring affordability in creating quality residential developments, all of which are music to our ears. They are very welcome recommendations, but what is important is actually implementing them. Having received and brought forward the reports, has the Taoiseach any serious intention of acting on their very sensible recommendations? I note that yesterday the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, organised a housing summit which really consisted of a reannouncement of existing policies which were not working and which demonstrated an ongoing and lamentable lack of ambition.</p>

            <p eId="para_458">The NESC has probably been the body which has commented most on the climate change risks facing Ireland. Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to study the work it has done on climate change? In particular, has he had a chance to look at the report published last week by the Climate Action Network that ranked Ireland 27th out of 28, second last behind Poland, which is a coal-producing country, when it came to climate change actions? Will he consider commissioning an update from the NESC on a risk assessment of the cost to Ireland of abjectly failing to meet climate change targets? This is not to mention the fact that, of course, we know that it impacts on farmers in terms of fodder shortages resulting, in particular, from winter storms that cause flooding in communities. We are living with the effects of climate change, some of which are probably very pleasant such as the current warm weather, some of which, however, are pretty miserable during the winter. Does the Taoiseach and the Government have concerns about climate change? The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, while not a denier of climate change, barely acknowledges that it is a problem for us.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_459">In recent years the NESC has spent a lot of time focusing on the short, medium and long-term problems in the housing sector. It has brought important experts to the country and emphasised the hard substance in looking at every angle of the problem. It is unfortunate that much of this work has not had the impact on the Government we would have expected it to have and that the Government has not been able to come up with proposals to overcome the chronic delivery deficit between promises and outcomes. Because the Taoiseach is so concerned to ensure issues of substance will be covered in the media, he will have noticed the extensive coverage last week that noted that there were close to 10,000 people on the homeless lists, even after the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, had acted to change the way the statistics were prepared. A further 137 children have become homeless for the first time, as revealed by the figures, yet, when the figures were released, there was no comment from the Taoiseach who had nothing to say about the continuing rise in the level of homelessness under the Government and the increasingly hapless performance of the Minister. Last year the Taoiseach announced at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, "We have a plan and it is working." He came into the House many times to announce that everything was looking up. Will he accept that he was wrong to declare that everything was in hand? What are the new emergency measures the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, told journalists he would soon be publishing?</p>

            <p eId="para_464">If anyone cares to check the record, there is not a week, or even a period of two or three days, that goes by when I am not asked about housing or homelessness and I do not have something to say about it. It is not necessary for me to issue a press statement every time a set of figures comes out. I do not do that as standard, even if the figures are positive, and there are plenty of such figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_465">As to Deputy Boyd Barrett's earlier question, I do not know the circumstances of the developments he mentioned and I do not want to comment on them without knowing. However, we have introduced a vacant sites levy which is now in place. It imposes a levy on the value of vacant land which is not being developed. I am aware that Deputy Wallace has made interesting proposals about how that can be strengthened, which we want to examine. We have given some consideration to the application of a vacant home tax or levy, although there are many complications in doing so. Local authorities have the power to CPO units. Louth County Council has been particularly active in compulsorily purchasing vacant housing units. I would certainly like to see more local authorities using the powers they have to CPO homes or apartments which are vacant to bring them into use as social housing. It is something the Government very much supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_467">It should not matter who owns them. Local authorities have CPO powers to purchase unused properties and add them to the social housing stock. Whether they are owned by the Deputy, me or a vulture fund should not really matter. The objective is to get vacant homes into use at a time when we need more homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_468"> The NESC land use report is very strong and we intend to act on it. We have outlined already our proposal to establish a Government land agency which will identify and take control of publicly owned lands which could be made available for housing development and development more generally. The agency may also on occasion buy privately owned land to unlock its development potential. It will be a real step change in the way in which the Government is active in the housing market. We have seen some examples of how measures like this were introduced in the docklands, Grangegorman and through the Limerick regeneration project. This will be on a much greater scale and it will make a big difference.</p>
            <p eId="para_469"> I have acknowledged in my speech to the European Parliament and elsewhere that Ireland has fallen behind on climate change. I used the term "laggard" in describing our performance. It does not give me any pleasure to say that and I do not say it without wanting to act. We must focus now on what the Government will actually do to enable Ireland to meet its 2030 targets. From the middle of next year, for example, any new buses bought by Bus Éireann or Dublin bus will be low-emission or no-emission vehicles. We have confirmed that in 2025, we will take coal off the grid and no longer burn it at Moneypoint. By 2030, we will have taken peat off the grid and that time will allow for a just transition in recognition of the fact that a great deal of employment in the midlands is created by that industry. From 2030, there will be no new diesel or petrol-fuelled cars for sale in Ireland, which gives us time to electrify the fleet. There will be a renewable heat initiative, a whole programme of deep refitting of public buildings and private homes. We will also have a new refit or RESS scheme to promote investment in renewable energy. We will need to solve the problem of foreshore licences which is creating major difficulties in respect of the development of offshore wind energy. We have run into constitutional issues there which I am determined to resolve. Project Ireland 2040 outlines €22 billion worth of investment in climate action.</p>
            <p eId="para_470"> Rather than commissioning reports, we want to get on with the job of tackling climate change and meeting our obligations under the Paris Agreement and our 2030 targets. We are not doing it to meet targets or avoid financial penalties but because it is absolutely the right thing to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">Tá áthas orm labhairt os comhair na Dála inniu faoi chruinniú Chomhairle an Aontais Eorpaigh a bhí ar siúl sa Bhruiséal ar an Déardaoin agus ar an Aoine seo caite. I attended the European Council in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, 28 and 29 June. On Thursday, we met in regular format to discuss migration, security and defence, the European economy and trade and relations with Russia, as well some economic issues. On Friday morning, we met in Article 50 format to discuss the Brexit negotiations. Later on Friday, we met as the euro summit to exchange views on economic and monetary union. While Brexit is, of course, a priority for Ireland, migration is of concern to many partners and was the main focus of the meeting. In addition to the European Council itself, I had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday, 28 June to discuss Brexit and the situation in Northern Ireland. I welcome that we finally agreed that the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference should be reconvened and this institution, established under the Good Friday Agreement, will now meet on 25 July. I also met informally other EU counterparts over the course of the two days, including the new Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, and the new Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> The European Council began on Thursday with a short exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, and an update from Prime Minister Borissov of Bulgaria. I congratulate the Prime Minister and Bulgaria on the conclusion of its first and very successful EU Presidency. Bulgaria has now passed the baton to Austria, which will hold the Presidency for the next six months. At the main meeting, we exchanged views on security and defence, reviewing progress on a number of fronts, including PESCO, which provides a mechanism through which crisis management capabilities can be developed by member states in support of Common Security and Defence Policy operations, as well as military mobility and funding for capability development. Ireland is a founder member of PESCO and is participating in two projects. We also heard a presentation from the Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, who emphasised the importance of complementarity between the EU and NATO and the need for strong European defence co-operation. Ireland is one of six EU member states which are not members of NATO and this, along with our military neutrality, is a foreign policy strength. We are, however, in favour of co-operation with NATO, which co-operation is set out in the EU's global strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> Turning to jobs, growth and competitiveness, our discussions included the country-specific recommendations, trade and taxation. I am pleased that our views on taxation were taken on board and that the European Council conclusions recognise the long-term importance of the OECD work on this, while also instructing finance Ministers to work on the Commission proposals. On trade, there was strong support for the Commission's proportionate response to the unjustified US tariffs on steel and aluminium and agreement on the need to maintain a rules-based multilateral approach. President Tusk confirmed that he will visit the US on 21 and 22 July. Like others, I believe it is important to keep advancing a positive trade agenda and we restated our commitment to negotiating trade deals with third parties like Mexico, Japan, Mercosur, Australia and New Zealand. Under the heading of digital and innovation, which is a priority area for Ireland, we gave direction to EU efforts to encourage and reward disruptive innovation and help to boost Europe's success in commercialising its world class research.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> Our discussions on Thursday evening included an exchange on Russia and Ukraine. Chancellor Merkel and President Macron updated us on the Normandy format meetings and, in light of Russia's failure to implement the Minsk accords, we agreed to extend the EU sanctions for another six months. I am very pleased that we also endorsed the conclusions on enlargement and the stabilisation and association process, which had been agreed at the General Affairs Council on Tuesday, 26 June, as well as the agreement on the post-Brexit redistribution of European Parliament seats. Ireland will gain two additional seats.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> Most of our time that evening, however, was taken up with illegal migration. This has been a divisive issue and our discussions were difficult and lengthy. This reflects a political crisis more than a migration crisis as the numbers of people travelling to Europe illegally are well down compared with 2015, which proves that the actions which the EU has already taken are working. However, many European citizens and voters clearly fear a return to those previous levels of immigration and the political reality is that some populist and anti-immigration politicians have been elected as a result of them. In our discussions, we reached agreement on several new steps, including increased funding for the Africa Trust fund. Ireland agreed to increase its funding for the fund to €15 million, which is the third highest level <i>per capita</i> of any member state. We also agreed about the need to increase funding for the facility for refugees in Turkey and to establish dedicated funding for migration through the EU budget, as proposed in the multi-annual financial framework, MFF. We also agreed to explore the concept of regional disembarkation platforms and the voluntary establishment of control centres within EU member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">This reinforces the importance of what I have described as the three-pronged approach which we need to take: securing our external borders; strengthening co-operation with countries of transit and origin; and dealing with the management of migrants within the European Union, where a balance of solidarity and responsibility is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> From Ireland's perspective, I stressed the need to develop a close partnership with Africa. We have to build up institutions, improve security and provide economic opportunity in Africa in order that people can enjoy better prospects in their home countries. As a result, this week Ireland agreed to increase its commitment to the EU Trust Fund for Africa to €15 million, as I mentioned. We should never forget why people risk their lives and the savings of their entire families, even those of their entire communities, to make the journey to Europe. It is because they come from countries that lack security, democracy and economic opportunity. This is a root cause and until we fix it, the issue will not be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> The concept of regional disembarkation platforms is at an early stage and we will take careful note of how it develops. As I stated at the meeting, any such platform would have to be managed in close co-operation with the UNHCR, the IOM and relevant third countries and with full respect for international law and human rights standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> As Deputies will be aware, Ireland is less directly affected by migration than many other member states. However, in a spirit of solidarity, we have played a constructive role by opting into the 2015 EU relocation and resettlement measures, sending the Naval Service to help in humanitarian efforts in the Mediterranean and significantly increasing our financial contributions. Last week, at the request of the Maltese Government, we agreed to take in some migrants from aboard the <i>Lifeline</i>. As I mentioned, we have also offered to further substantially increase our contribution to the EU Trust Fund for Africa. I intend that we will continue to play an active and constructive role in dealing with migration.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> The euro summit on Friday took place in an inclusive format, that is, with all 27 member states present - Britain did not attend - with the Eurogroup president, Dr. Mário Centeno, and the ECB president, Mr. Mario Draghi. We agreed that the European Stability Mechanism should provide the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund and that preparations should begin for negotiations on a European deposit insurance scheme, thus guaranteeing bank deposits across the European Union, rather than individual member states being responsible for them. Finance Ministers will bring this work forward and also examine other proposals before we review progress at the euro summit in December. From Ireland's perspective, we support the completion of banking union, with both risk reduction and risk sharing.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> On Friday, over breakfast, the European Council met in Article 50 format - without Prime Minister May - to discuss Brexit. The Prime Minister had outlined her thoughts to us the previous evening at the regular European Council, stressing her commitment to deal with the Irish-specific issues and also to publish a White Paper in July on Britain's vision of a new long-term relationship with the European Union. At the Article 50 meeting we heard an assessment from Mr. Michel Barnier of progress in the negotiations on the withdrawal agreement. He stated serious divergences remained on the Irish issues, including the backstop. We all agreed that the lack of progress had been disappointing since March and that intensified negotiations were urgently needed. The United Kingdom gave commitments and guarantees in December and again in March. We need to see detailed, workable proposals from it to deliver on these commitments. The EU 27 have agreed that, if we do not get agreement on a backstop or the other outstanding elements of the withdrawal agreement, it will not be possible to finalise it as a whole, including the transition period. I am grateful to our EU partners for their ongoing support and solidarity on this issue. Ireland's concerns are at the very heart of the negotiations and the collective view of the EU side is that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> I have always said I hope the future relationship between the Euorpean Union and the United Kingdom will be as close and comprehensive as possible and that it will remove any need for a hard border, but it will not in any way remove the need for a legally robust backstop to apply, unless and until better arrangements enter into force, ensuring there will never be a hard border on the island, whatever circumstances prevail. I reiterated these points to the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, at our bilateral meeting and expressed my view that there was not much time left if we were to conclude a withdrawal agreement and have it ratified by the time the United Kingdom left in March. I also stated that I looked forward to the publication of her Government's White Paper and that I hoped it could be a basis for negotiations on the future relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> The Article 50 General Affairs Council will meet on 20 July. It will provide an opportunity for the EU 27 to discuss the UK White Paper which should be published by then. While I am hopeful we will achieve a close, comprehensive and ambitious future relationship with the United Kingdom, the Government is, of course, continuing to plan for the full range of scenarios. Our work is well advanced and we will be in a position to take the necessary decisions, if and when required. With other EU leaders on Friday, we agreed that we should all step up our work in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> I assure Deputies that the Government will continue to defend and promote Ireland's interests in the Brexit negotiations and across the EU agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> The Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee, will speak about some of the other issues discussed at the European Council.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">Last week's summit was a long one, but it did not mark any major move forward on the most important issues facing the European Union.  For Ireland, it marked a moment when a deadline which had repeatedly been identified by the Government passed without progress and any explanation of what would come next. While the final communiqué addresses a wide range of issues, there were two issues that were urgent, one of which caused negotiations to continue long into the night, while the other was passed over, with no discussion and no attempt to provide clarity. Unfortunately, it was the issue of Brexit that received almost no attention. As migration was the issue that dominated most of the time and attention at the summit, I will deal with it first.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> There is no question that the scale and pace of migration across the Mediterranean in 2015 and 2016 put incredible pressures on many countries. The most dramatic and difficult element of the migration was the entirely man-made humanitarian crisis in Syria. A civil war started by an increasingly repressive regime against its own people was escalated dramatically because of the decision of Russia to intervene, support the regime and target attacks against regions held by moderate forces, rather than those held by ISIS. It is a pity that many, although not all, voices in this House and elsewhere in Europe that are raised loudly in other circumstances had so little to say about the conflict when this extreme escalation was mounted. If ever there was a reasonable definition of refugee, it was people fleeing that conflict. The statement of the German Chancellor, Dr. Merkel, "We will cope", was an exceptionally brave one as it led to her country welcoming hundreds of thousands of refugees. It was, unfortunately, a gesture of human decency which placed her under enormous political pressure, domestically and now throughout Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> The enormous pressures exerted at the height of the migration crisis have been over for some time and many places along the Mediterranean which were nearly overwhelmed are now coping well, yet in spite of this, some politicians in some countries have decided to escalate the issue dramatically. The Prime Minister of Hungary has used it as part of repeated xenophobic and deeply sinister campaigns, including the introduction of laws to close down and intimidate non-governmental organisations.  It is shameful that the Taoiseach and Fine Gael remain silent on this issue and are more interested in solidarity within the EPP than with terrorised refugees. The Prime Minister of Austria has decided to make migration the number one issue for the Council in the next six months and announced that there will be a special summit in September to deal solely with migration. He announced the holding of the summit in a joint press release with his deputy who is the leader of a party that is so far to the right that many members spent their youth promoting a revision of Nazi-era history. It appears that the Taoiseach did not have time to oppose this hijacking of the European Union's agenda by the far right, but he did have time to take a selfie with Mr. Kurz. Obviously, the behaviour of the new Italian Government is deliberately controversial and inflammatory. The issue for Ireland and every other country is that we have to stop this attempt to exploit what is, undoubtedly, a serious issue as an excuse to undermine the humanitarian values which underpin the European Union. </p>
          <p eId="para_499"> Fianna Fáil supports the offer that Ireland participate in relocating refugees from countries that carry an undue burden.  In that respect, we acknowledge the particularly constructive approach the governments of Spain and Greece took last week to promote an agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">In contrast we strongly oppose the enforcement only approach advocated by some governments.  The only reasonable long-term solution is to make a major and sustained commitment to the development and reconstruction of the countries in north Africa and the Middle East from which so many of these people are fleeing.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> In contrast to the deep and impassioned debate on migration, there was no debate on Brexit even though June was supposed to be a critical deadline. During last week’s Dáil statements on this issue, every Opposition party, with the exception of Deputy McDonald's, who told us we were being too tough on the Taoiseach, called for an explanation from the Taoiseach about why he and the Tánaiste had threatened so much if there was no progress by June and why they had simply gone silent when the deadline passed. No explanation was offered. I would remind the Taoiseach that both he and the Tánaiste said as early as 12 December last year that any attempted backsliding by the British would necessitate a suspension of the negotiations.  They have been backsliding since then and nothing has happened. In what is, sadly, an increasingly dominant approach to Brexit at a political level in Government, nobody in this House has received any explanation publicly or privately as to why June was no longer a decisive date. More seriously, we have received no information about what, if anything, the Government intends to do to try and change the current failing dynamic in the talks, insofar as they relate to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> It is clear to everyone that the shambles in the Tory party has prevented the British Government from outlining what exactly it wants the final relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union to be. This is a shambles which has been nearly 40 years in the making and has its foundation in three generations of politicians who scapegoated Europe for everything and angrily demanded a return to a long disappeared imperial grandeur. We do not need the Taoiseach to wag his finger at the failures of the British but we need him to outline what exactly he is seeking as a final status for economic relations on this island and what he intends to do to achieve it.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> There are times when the Taoiseach sounds more like a commentator on events rather than someone who is proposing solutions, and after the deadline for progress by June has passed and Ireland is now caught up in the final stages of the withdrawal negotiations, there is no sense of what his new strategy is. It appears that he kept a straight face last Friday when he solemnly announced to journalists that it was unrealistic for the backstop to apply to the whole of the United Kingdom. What he failed to mention was that he himself was the first person to propose applying the backstop to the whole of the United Kingdom.  On 8 December, at the start of a round of overspinning the draft political agreement, the Taoiseach stated: “So there is a backstop arrangement in which Northern Ireland and perhaps all of the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with rules of the Internal Market and Customs Union”. In the same speech the Taoiseach also stated that the backstop would bring no new barriers between Britain and Northern Ireland, an assurance which showed that he accepted the position of London about an east-west border.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> London’s incompetence and indecision is creating a dangerous vacuum at the heart of these negotiations and we need to remember that we are directly threatened by this vacuum. It remains our position that there is no credible way of having a soft border and protecting the pillars of the peace settlement without a form of special economic status for Northern Ireland.  More importantly, there is no way of addressing the economic problems of Northern Ireland and the Border region without a form of special economic status which provides access to both the European Union and the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> It is as yet unexplained why our Government has decided not to make any proposals for a permanent arrangement for Northern Ireland.  At very best the backstop is simply that, a temporary arrangement which awaits agreement on a permanent arrangement, and given that there has been zero progress in turning the December backstop into an agreed legal text, the lack of any proposals for the permanent arrangement carries with it serious risks. The most important of these risks is that we will be faced with a decision in October or November of accepting an arrangement more directly linked to the yet to be negotiated final status or vetoing any withdrawal treaty, something which seems fanciful given the last six months and the cost of the hard Brexit which would follow such a veto.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> What we need is for the Government to be more open about its clearly changing strategy.  We need to know what is going to change to move away from an obviously dangerous strategy of hoping that London will either get its act together or reverse its referendum decision. Contacts with our European Union partners are always welcome, but given the scale of the dysfunction in relationships between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister and the fact that the Irish dimension of the negotiations have only three important elements, namely, London, Brussels and Dublin, why is a tour of other capitals the major initiative planned for the next month? In March we were told by the Government that it had put down a marker and that substantial progress was needed by June.  The summit’s conclusions state in stark language that there has been no substantial progress. It is long past time for the Taoiseach to put aside the spin and talk candidly about why he has now ruled out his preferred outcome and what he intends doing in the next four months to change the dynamic of these critical, yet floundering negotiations.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_507">The much-awaited European Union summit and European Council meetings last week ended in political and diplomatic failure for Ireland. This was to be a defining moment when we would see delivery on the commitments made to Ireland in December of last year, commitments that the Taoiseach told us at the time were cast iron. Despite this, he returns to Ireland after the summit with no progress, no certainty and no legal clarity. Since December, the British Government has ignored every deadline. It has acted in bad faith and its actions in bad faith are its responsibility and it is accountable for it, not the Taoiseach. That is the point I made so I hope that Deputy Micheál Martin can absorb that simple concept of accountability resting with the British for their own intransigence.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> The Taoiseach, however, has accepted this bad faith and he has not sufficiently challenged it. His approach and that of the other European Union leaders has emboldened the Tory party and their fantasy Brexit. A lot of the excuse-making about the chaos Mrs. May faces simply feeds and verifies all of that because they now believe that they are involved in a game of chicken with the rights and interests of Ireland. We cannot stop Britain from leaving or prevent it from crashing out of the European Union through bluster, whether that is by accident or by design, but what the Irish Government can and must do is ensure that Irish interests are protected, that the rights of citizens are safeguarded and that our international peace agreements are enforced. The Irish Government must make clear that it will not allow the British to impose a hard border or to walk away from the internationally binding Good Friday Agreement. The Taoiseach needs to stop rowing back from his own deadlines and he needs now to deliver on what he described as cast-iron guarantees. There should be no further negotiation on future relations until the British Government delivers on that agreement from last December. The Irish Government and our European Union partners must now develop a contingency plan to safeguard Ireland's interests, the rights of citizens and our peace agreements in the event of the British Government refusing to live up to its obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> We are now sailing in very dangerous waters and our navigation system seems rather scrambled. The approach of the Irish Government has become muddled and lacks the precision needed in these negotiations. It also lacks the steel necessary to influence and inform the wider direction of the European Union strategy in an effective manner. The position of "Ireland first", much trumpeted by European Union leaders and by this Government, now seems like empty words, rhetoric aimed more at keeping Irish public opinion on side than a genuine negotiating doctrine to be utilised in dealing with the Tories. The failure to follow through on the promise of "Ireland first" means that the Rees-Mogg fantasy of a destructive game of chicken between the European Union and the British Government now edges ever closer to a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Tory playacting has been accepted and the Tory strategy of playing for time has been tolerated. This is to the detriment of Ireland and our national interests. It has resulted in stagnation, wishful thinking and a refusal by the Government to recognise the nature of the British Government's Brexit agenda as regards our island. It is simply unthinkable that this should remain the condition of the Government's approach during the summer months.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> We need to see a radical change of tack. We need a lot more plain speaking and the application of common sense when it comes to engaging with the Tories. First, Theresa May needs to be called out directly for the game-playing and stalling for time on the part of her government and this needs to be done publicly, privately and repeatedly. There will be no progress made if the British Prime Minister believes, even in a deluded way, that the Tory approach is working. Make no mistake, right now back in London the British negotiators feel they have what they wanted, that is, the can kicked firmly down the road until October. They have achieved this without delivering any legal guarantees or workable proposals on the Irish question and they have been allowed to dodge the political agreement made last December. They have been allowed to dodge making binding commitments as regards the backstop outlined in that agreement and their obligations to set out how a hard border will be avoided, the Good Friday Agreement upheld and the rights of citizens protected. How can we accept the Ireland first position as genuine when the British have been let off the hook on so many important issues? The Government must outline how it intends to ensure these matters are addressed during the summer. What engagement does the Taoiseach intend to have with the European Union? I understand he intends to make a tour of EU capitals and, unlike Deputy Micheál Martin, I believe that is a wise thing to do. What will be the substance of that and of the engagement between the European side and the British in coming weeks?</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> Waiting until the autumn runs a major risk of Ireland's concerns being rolled into the wider new relationship between the EU and Britain. This would be calamitous for Ireland. We cannot simply wait until the 11th hour, put on our crash helmets, close our eyes and hope for the best. That is not a strategy. To rebuild the confidence of the Irish public in the position of Ireland first, we need to see progress, clarity and legal assurances from the British Government and we need to see that happen now.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> It is clear that we need a Brexit summit focused solely on Irish concerns prior to the October meeting, not a conversation about Brexit over breakfast. This is something that the Taoiseach must put forcefully to our European partners. The backstop agreed in December - signed, sealed, delivered and enforceable - is the bottom line and the very minimum needed to protect our island, jobs and economic progress. We also need to see recognition from the Tories that the people of the North voted to remain, not to exit.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> Given how the negotiations have gone to this point, it is clear the British Government cannot grasp the importance of these issues to Ireland. It either cannot grasp it or it does not care but, either way, the result is the same. If the British Government refuses to do the right thing by Ireland, refuses to produce credible proposals and continues along a path that will only deliver economic devastation and political upheaval on this island, then those decisions should be taken out of its hands and placed in the hands of the people of this island. In the event of a Brexit crash, a disorderly Brexit or a hard Brexit, to which the Tories seem wedded, the British must not imagine that the Irish people will simply sigh and resign themselves to their fate. Mrs. May and her Government need to understand that, in the event of a crash, a chaotic or a hard Brexit, they will have no democratic alternative other than to put the constitutional question on the issue of ending partition and Irish reunification. A shared, agreed, new Ireland is by far a better vision for all the people of this island than the destruction the Tories seem intent on. As somebody who is committed to Irish unity, this is not the scenario in which I would wish a debate on reunification to occur; far from it. However, if it is the case that we are left with that mess, Mrs. May needs to understand that the question, democratically, will have to be put. </p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_312">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_515">I said to the Taoiseach last week that it was essential that Ireland insist on a deadline for the UK to produce an acceptable legal backstop agreement with the European Union on the Irish Border issue. I believe such a deadline could and should be set well in advance of the European Council meeting in October, so that Ireland is not forced under pressure from all sides to accept any kind of last-minute compromise on a matter of such profound importance to the future of this country and all our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> Unfortunately, no such commitment or demand was forthcoming. I acknowledge and welcome the support for Ireland in the agreed conclusions of the European Council meeting but those conclusions are truly worrying, namely, that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop. There need to be intensified efforts in accordance with the conclusions to bring a conclusion to the withdrawal agreement. I welcome the continued support for Ireland of Michel Barnier and Jean-Claude Juncker but we must not forget that the final decision on Brexit will be made by the 27 EU countries and not by the current negotiating team, who are so well versed in the issues and supportive of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> Few could have predicted the drama that unfolded last Thursday night at the European Council. While we have been rightly preoccupied for months with the progress on Brexit, the migration crisis has continued to engulf much of the EU and could still cost Chancellor Merkel her position. The new Italian Prime Minister used his domestic concerns to stall progress on every other European issue. I do not suggest for a moment that Ireland should employ the same tactics but we should acknowledge that issues move very quickly on the European agenda. The other 26 national governments are subject to a variety of domestic pressures and our national concerns may well, at this crucial juncture, become sidelined.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> For six months we were told by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that the June European Council meeting would be the make-or-break moment. The Government billed June as a deadline for the British and our EU negotiators to have certainty about the future but the British did not deliver and Brexit ended up being a side item on the Council agenda. It is, therefore, incumbent on the Government to take the necessary risks to demand that we have clarity on the UK position well in advance of the October summit. I have been saying for a year that constant moving of the goalposts will leave us in a critical position for October.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> As matters stand, the British Prime Minister will present a third post-Brexit model for discussion to her Cabinet colleagues at Chequers this Friday. If we assume that there is an agreed British Cabinet position - and that is a rather big assumption - it will be entirely reasonable for the Government to insist that, over the next eight weeks or so, it gets hammered out into something that provides legal clarity on the Irish question. There is no point in having a proposal that is not acceptable, just to hold the British Tory position intact.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">Alternatively, if there continues to be discord within the British Government, which again is a possibility, resulting in another unworkable set of proposals, then there will be even more urgency to insist on clarity well in advance of the October summit. There is a solid argument for Ireland to seek a special summit of EU Heads of Government in September to copper-fasten the Irish Border agreement in advance of October. It was a suggestion put forward by the former Taoiseach on the day he was presented with the European of the Year award. It has merit. There may well be a need for an additional summit so that we are not facing a last ditch chance in October with a variety of other agenda items.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> On the terms of trade, the planned transition period provides extra time to finalise the EU-UK relationship and the details on the specificities of trade, but once 29 March next year is passed, the UK, including Northern Ireland, is outside the EU framework, and our leverage to protect the Good Friday Agreement, as we have all acknowledged in this House, is very much reduced. To be clear, Ireland's interests are of a shorter timetable than the interests of our European partners on this one matter. The fundamental economic and social pressures that will push them towards a final deal with the UK will not be in force, as the Taoiseach will be aware, until the end of 2020. The risks of a half-baked agreement falling apart in October will be felt disproportionately negatively in Ireland. We have only 268 days left to safeguard the peace and prosperity that has been hard won over more than 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> In terms of the immediate social and economic pressures facing our European partners, migration was obviously the overwhelming and main focus of the Council meeting. Migration numbers, as the Taoiseach acknowledged earlier, have declined. In 2017, there were around 720,000 applications for international protection in the European Union, which is a decrease of 44% on the previous year, 2016, when there was almost 1.3 million applications. If anything, however, and I believe the Taoiseach has also said this, the political migration crisis has got much worse due to the reaction to that 2015 and 2016 peak. Clearly, the crisis has shown up flaws in the EU's systems for processing asylum applications, but the main danger is that migration has been politicised across Europe - it is now, as the Taoiseach has acknowledged, a cornerstone of the Austrian Presidency agenda - often in the context of political movements using misinformation to stoke up fear and resentment for their own political advantage in a variety of European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Many of the asylum seekers are fleeing a brutal war in Syria and others are fleeing conflicts in the Middle East or Africa. I agree with the remarks of Donald Tusk, the President of the Council, that the real challenge now is to implement the migration reforms of last week. We can see domestic political strain in Germany, Austria and Italy and that will manifest itself elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> I welcome the announced transfer of €500 million of development money to the EU Trust Fund for Africa. It is something for which I called, including in my very short address to President Juncker when he was here. A Marshall plan for Europe's neighbourhood to foster economic development in the countries surrounding the EU is the best way in the long term to stem economic migration because it ultimately reduces the economic disparities between Europe and its neighbours, but it will require a great deal more money than is currently on the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> We also need to show leadership on the migration issue in Ireland. Compared with the European countries we talked about, the ones at the coalface, Greece, Italy, Germany, Spain and so on, Ireland has relatively low migration, even on a <i>per capita </i>basis. I was shocked, however, by a headline in the media today that Ireland was found to be seriously deficient in addressing hate crime. That is contained in a major report published today. It is jarring for us because we did not believe that was true. Hate crime is disproportionately focused on visible minorities such as people from Africa or the Middle East. We had rightly prided ourselves as a country that has integrated many newcomers, particularly in the recent past, and that we have not had a rise of a particular political party that is xenophobic, but we should not take these things for granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> As part of playing our role to create a Europe that is open, welcoming and tolerant, we should ensure that hate crime legislation meets international best practice. Similarly, as I have said previously, we need to end direct provision and provide a pathway to Irish citizenship for the undocumented migrants here. Otherwise we are in great danger of institutionalising a second tier of unofficial residents who are forced to live their lives in the shadows. That is not an acceptable situation. We are only dealing with small numbers of people at a time when this country has nearly full employment and we can easily accommodate the few thousand people in asylum centres now. When there are dark clouds over our Continent, let us show moral leadership on this important issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_528">Yes. I am sharing my time with Deputy Barry.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> The forces of hate and racism and even those who associate with outright fascism are on the rise in Europe. As important as Brexit is to this country, it pales into insignificance compared to the rather terrifying developments happening right across Europe and in the heart of the European Union. We are in a sort of happy bubble in this country in that, thankfully, no political party, at least represented in this Dáil, has sought to play the race card. For that reason, there is a sense of myopia about what is happening in Europe and it is quite terrifying. The Taoiseach should be very careful about his choice of words against that background. These developments are to be found not only in Europe but in the United States. The Taoiseach said he was misquoted about his comments in the United States and perhaps that is true, but it is very ill-judged to make any kind of common cause with Donald Trump given that he has been instrumental in encouraging these forces across Europe. They openly say that Trump has encouraged them, and these forces are on the march.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> The fact that this guy Kurz from the Austrian Freedom Party, which is openly associated with and was set up by former Nazis, now holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, that the German political establishment is coming under pressure from the far right and has capitulated to that pressure in this anti-migrant narrative, and the fact that a hate monger and racist like Orbán in Hungary and Salvini in Italy are linked to the far right are frankly terrifying. Detention centres are being set up. There is talk of the wholesale transfer of desperate people fleeing conflicts, but in many cases the European Union or members of it have directly contributed to the disastrous conditions in the countries that have forced those people out of them, leaving 35,000 to die in the Mediterranean in recent years. What is going on is shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> It makes me think of the policies of appeasement and ignoring developments in the run-up to the rise of the Nazi Party in the 1930s where people ignored what was going on and played footsie with these people. I did not know about the selfie the Taoiseach took with Kurz and, if that is true, it is shocking. These are seriously dangerous people. Lives are being lost and incredible misery and hardship are being imposed on desperate and vulnerable people. We need to make clear where we stand on that, that we will resolutely fight and resist these forces of hate and racism and challenge them. I refer to the upscaling of the EU budget for fortress Europe, for the European wall, multiplied by five, and for more external border controls to keep out desperate people.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> It was very annoying to hear Deputy Micheál Martin saying, obviously with a sideswipe at the left, that people were not jumping up and down about the Russians in Syria. Some of us were. I did not notice Deputy Martin on the marches to the Russian embassy. We were there.</p>

          <p eId="para_538">The migration deal that was signed last week has been described by Oxfam as "a recipe for failure, [which] directly threatens the rights of women, men and children on the move". Médecins sans Frontières, MSF, has said that the deal "aimed to turn away even the most vulnerable people from Europe's shores". Compare and contrast the comments of Oxfam, MSF and many other NGOs with the words of Matteo Salvini, who said that progress had been made in principle on the issues of protecting the EU's external border. He said that Italy had succeeded in setting the agenda. Matteo Salvini is Italy's new interior Minister. When he took office he said he would like to organise a census of the Roma population in Italy. This census would be based on ethnicity. This is the man who said he would like to see all non-Italian Roma expelled from Italy. I suspect that this would mean an expulsion of some 100,000 people. This is the man who praised the race laws that were implemented by Mussolini.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> Campaigners at the front line of assisting refugees and migrants are deeply disappointed in the results of the negotiations on migration in the EU last week. Racist barbarians such as Salvini are relatively pleased. They rub their hands and say, "Much done, more to do." The Governments of Europe, including the Taoiseach's Government, danced to their tune last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> Let us consider the deal that was signed. There will be a stepping up of deportations and the establishment of reception centres for states that want them, which will basically turn back migrants. Consideration is to be given to the establishment of regional disembarkation platforms in north Africa. This means people would be fished out of the Mediterranean Sea and brought back to north Africa where they would be kept and prevented from getting into fortress Europe. There will be a stepping up of support for the Libyan Coast Guard. Let us remind ourselves that Amnesty International Ireland has said the Libyan Coast Guard intercepts people who are in distress at sea, transfers them to Libya where they are held in detention centres and exposed to systematic and widespread human rights violations such as arbitrary detention, torture, rape and exploitation. The system of reception centres at the borders and the disembarkation centres in north Africa would be very similar to the set-up that the US has lined up for the US-Mexico border.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> Reflected in some of those decisions made in the EU last week are some of the comments of the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach is reported to have said “Some of these NGOs are doing great work, some aren’t up to much good, quite frankly.” The Taoiseach was referring to NGOs that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean Sea and attempt to bring them onshore in Europe. The Taoiseach made the very dubious claim that these NGOs are encouraging people smugglers. Contrast these comments with those the Taoiseach made about the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán. Victor Orbán is a hero to Steve Bannon. He was described by the United Nations human rights chief as racist, a bully and a xenophobe, which I believe is an accurate description. The Taoiseach, however, has said that, "Victor's view is that he wants Hungary to stay Hungarian." The Taoiseach went on to say that Hungary does not need migrants. What kind of a statement is this to come from the Taoiseach?</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> Recently in the Dáil the Taoiseach said that "We have seen how the power of the free market in Asia has lifted 1 billion people out of poverty in 20 years" and how this was the way forward in the context of migration. Leaving aside the fact that in 2016 the World Bank reported that of 766 million people worldwide who live below $1.90 per day, 33% live in south Asia, the number of people in Africa who live in poverty increases at the rate of 12 per minute under capitalism. Under the privatisation programme of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Zambia, which has the world's third largest copper reserves, has 64% of its population living below the poverty line and 80% are on less than $2 per day. Yet, we leave aside the imperial wars and interventions-----</p>

          <p eId="para_547">I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, that while the Irish were campaigning for a seat on the UN Security Council, we did not hear a lot about neutrality. The fact that Ireland was competing for the gig with two NATO members - Norway and Canada - might have had an influence in that we were probably more eager to align ourselves with the US than with neutrality. It could have been a significant factor. I am not sure whether Bono can spell "neutrality" anyway, so we were not expecting him to come up with it but I thought the Taoiseach might have done a little bit in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> There is an unparalleled humanitarian crisis happening right now in Yemen. I am not sure how much the Irish Government members say about Yemen when they get the opportunity while in the EU. There seems to be an incredible silence, even by the UN, which is not a radical group by any stretch of the imagination, about the fact that 10 million people in Yemen are at risk of starvation right now. It is reckoned that by the end of the year nearly 18 million people will be at risk of starvation. Cholera has also become a massive problem in the region. Cholera was almost wiped off this planet with the use of medication but the United States of America supported the Saudi blockade, which is stopping medical products getting in to the area, and it is frightening to contemplate what might happen there.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is probably aware that a group of Independents 4 Change travelled to Syria last week. While we might not necessarily agree with our good friends, Deputies Boyd Barrett and Barry, who have just left the Chamber, we suggest that they go there to see for themselves the serious problems in the area. Members of the Irish Government should also travel to the region. They could find out that it is not actually a civil war. It is a war between the Syrian Government and various groups. The Syrian Government is supported by Russia and Iran. For legality purposes those countries were invited in by the Government of Syria. They are not imposing themselves on it without being invited in, unlike the Western powers. The Syrian Government is fighting jihadist groups such as al-Nusra and al-Qaeda. The Free Syrian Army is another section that, sadly, the EU armed and supported. This beggars belief.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> We travelled to Aleppo and met some industrialists and factory owners. They showed us some of the industrial estates in Aleppo. There are three huge industrial estates there.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Aleppo once had an industry of 40,000 companies employing almost 1 million people. One of the first things that the Free Syrian Army, Al-Nusra Front and Jaysh al-Islam did when they reached Aleppo was not to attack the Syrian army, but to destroy the industrial infrastructure. They had control over much of the plant in those factories. They looted them and moved the plant to Turkey. For confirmation, Dr. Ed Horgan of Shannonwatch, who was working for the OSCE as an election monitor in Turkey at the time, was on the Turkish-Syrian border in 2015 when lorries took material out of Syria and into Turkey. President Erdoan's hands are covered in blood. He was one of the main reasons so many jihadists got into Syria. The Saudis, Chechens and Israelis were involved. The Americans and other western powers armed and funded them. They have created a hell in Syria, but we are still backing UN sanctions. This is like what happened in Iraq. We will eventually reach the same point that we reached in 1998 when Madeleine Albright, the then US Secretary of State, said after it was put to her that the 500,000 children who had died because of sanctions was a terrible price to pay that, yes, but it was worth paying. Are we going down the same road?</p>

          <p eId="para_552">Another week, another European deal on migration that treats the relatively small number of desperate, traumatised refugees who are trying to get to Europe as some kind of marauding, overwhelming army that has to be kept at bay at all costs. Let us remember why we sit here. Over the weekend and into Monday, 200 migrants died in the Mediterranean. During the first six months of this year, fewer than 40,000 undocumented migrants made it to Europe, yet we call it a refugee crisis. That is not a crisis in anyone's book. An excellent article in <i>The Guardian </i>made the point last week that what European politicians called a migration crisis had nothing to do with numbers and everything to do with politics. Mainstream and fringe politicians are using the desperation of people fleeing the wars that Europe happily engaged in and stoked in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria to distract attention from the real problems at home. Civilians whose lives have been destroyed by war are paying the price for the rescue of the European banking system in 2010. That is the grubby, despicable reality of geopolitics. For those who call themselves liberals, it is not a place where morality is given much quarter.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> In 1917, Kafka wrote a short story, <i>The Great Wall of China</i>, anticipating fortress Europe and the lies that would hold it together for a century. He described the construction of a great wall to keep out all the foreign marauders and the creation of myths by the leadership to make these people seem terrifying. I will not quote him because I do not have the time. The majority of us who speak about these people have never visited the lands from which they are fleeing. The dearest hope of Europe's racist hierarchy is that the people will, as Kafka wrote, "lose themselves in empty air" between those lands and Europe. Why else push them into the sea or detention camps run by armed militias in failed states like Libya?</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> As Deputy Wallace stated, we spent the past week with some of our colleagues in Syria. It was not the first time we went there. For the record, we paid for ourselves, went where we liked and talked to whom we liked. We would defy anyone to say that the children we met on the roads and the people we met on the streets who waved at and welcomed us and told us their stories were somehow paid by some regime. These were Syrian citizens. We met businessmen in Aleppo. I laughed as we sat there, as one of them would have been at home in Fine Gael. He was tailor-made - a businessman who wanted to make money. He came from one of the oldest families in Syria. He traded in textiles and olive oil until 2010 when he suddenly started getting leaflets. Civil movements had erupted and people had taken to the streets to challenge Assad following the Arab Spring. Many participated genuinely in those demonstrations. Six years on, not a single area that has been taken over by the rebels has any form of democratic control. These areas are run by religious courts and jihadi, bearded men primarily from other countries. People's freedoms disappeared. The people of Aleppo who stayed out of the war and were just making a living suddenly found their factories surrounded and leaflets coming in telling them to get out or die. Some of them were assassinated and their factories taken over or destroyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> In his constituency, we made representations to the Tánaiste about discussing Aleppo with a genuine and reputable documentary maker who had gone there last November. I lay down a challenge to the Government to issue a visa to Fares Al-Shehabi, who is from a distinguished Syrian family, is not a member of the Ba'ath Party and is a Member of the Syrian Parliament, so that he might come to Ireland as a businessman and Sunni Muslim who believes in secular values and talk about what has happened in Syria.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> Deputy Boyd Barrett can talk about the crimes that Russia perpetrated in Syria, but I defy him to travel there and ask the people what they think about the Russians. In many cases, they think the Russians are heroes.</p>

          <p eId="para_560">Deputy Danny Healy-Rae will not be here, but I am not sure about Deputy Michael Healy-Rae. If he arrives, I will give way.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> I am happy to make a few brief remarks. For most of us who followed the European Council meeting, the main point that jumped out was that Brexit received all of 60 seconds of consideration on the agenda. That must worry any right-thinking Irish person, given Brexit's imminent onset. For anyone watching, it was obvious that the bulk of the time was given over to saving Chancellor Merkel's backside from her own internal political disputes on the issue of migration. It was not the first time, and will not be the last, that German concerns dominated the Union's political agenda. It is a pity that we did not see such interest or support from Chancellor Merkel and others in power, including EU chiefs, during our banking crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> We read in yesterday's UK newspapers that Prime Minister May's Brexit White Paper is expected to propose that the UK remain indefinitely in the Single Market for goods after Brexit so as to avoid the need for checks at the Irish Border. When President Juncker appeared before our joint sitting, I put the example of the newly constructed border compound between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia to him. How could it be any different here if there was a hard border? It could not. I cannot imagine it.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> It is also understood that, while the UK is offering concessions on financial services, it wants restrictions on the free movement of people. Therein lies the problem. We all know that the EU will never agree to this. According to reports, a former head of the European Council's legal service stated: " ... it would be impossible for the EU to split the four freedoms underpinning the bloc's internal market, which are written into the 1957 treaty that founded the European project [we joined in the 1970s]: free movement of goods, services, capital and people." Where are these freedoms now?</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> All of this demonstrates that we are set for another round of tortuous political wrangling that will do nothing but create a deeper level of political and economic uncertainty. Such uncertainty is already with us and growing with each passing day thanks to the utter confusion across the water. It could continue during the summer, yet only 60 seconds were given to discussing Brexit. People were concerned with massaging Chancellor Merkel's ego and giving her the royal salute. We must face up to reality. It is time that we did.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Where is the failure proof position and the cast iron guarantee the Taoiseach announced last Christmas? I think the heat is having an inordinate effect on the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> I do not normally find myself agreeing with my colleague Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett, but he put his finger on the main issue when he asked President Jean-Claude Juncker a very simple question: can we trust him? Can we trust the European Union to finally back us when push comes to shove? Our experience following the economic crash has not been good. Their banks recklessly shovelled money into Ireland and they then penalised and crucified us. They are still doing so. Where are our friends when we need them? Will they back us? President Juncker might say it, but will it be the reality? That will be a key issue when all of what is happening back and forth finally comes to an end, for better or worse. It is time it came to an end. Can we trust the European Union not to throw us to the wolves as collateral damage in the broader scheme of things? That is the worry that thousands of Irish people and I have. Our experience has not led us to believe we can trust the European Union. Our bitter experience is that our grandchildren and great-grandchildren will be paying back these so-called friends. With friends like them, we do not need many enemies. Perhaps they sense that, regardless of what they do to us - they have good reason for thinking this - we will go back to pleading to be accepted as the best in the class. We have history and form in that regard. I call it lick-something-that-starts-with-an-A.</p>

          <p eId="para_568">I did not offer any profanity. It is what we are good at. We want to be the best boys and girls in class at all costs and have to be up there with our cheerleaders, as we are proving every week. Perhaps they sense that, regardless of what they do, we will go back to pleading with them. Why would they treat us otherwise when that is what we do continuously? Going back to looking to be the best boys and girls in the class is not a mistake we ought to make again. I observe how quickly the Council can act when it comes to saving the skin of the esteemed German Chancellor. We spent the entire summit minding, charming, supporting and manicuring her and ensuring she would not be damaged in any way politically. We had to do so at all costs. We should mind our own business when it comes to doing so. She is big enough to look after herself, as is her country. It confirms what the European Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs said after the Council meeting, "The facts and reality tell us we are no longer in a migration crisis. The crisis we are confronted with is purely political." If anyone took a glance, it is a political crisis which has nothing to do with migration. They do not care, as Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace, among others, said, about migrants. I call on everyone not to protract this political crisis any longer and to get down to the real business and real work of finding real solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> The migration crisis is being made fundamentally worse because it is not being addressed at a pragmatic level; rather, it is being addressed in a piecemeal political manner that is making things much worse. Perhaps someone ought to point out to the German Chancellor the next time he or she sees her that her actions at the Council have proved that she is primarily interested in political survival, not addressing the scale of the migration crisis in the way ordinary people are demanding and deserve, especially the unfortunate migrants. We do not blame any politician for trying to mind himself or herself and hang on to power, but do we and the other countries of Europe have to use the entire summit to try to create a way out for Ms Merkel? As far as I can see, it is a case of smoke and mirrors. We should be more preoccupied with our economy and the difficulties that face us and the uncertainty no outcome to the Brexit negotiations causes for businesses in Ireland, especially those that export so much.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> I keep asking the Minister of State about migrants in these debates. We have never had any real debate in the Dáil about the migrant crisis and the persecution of Christians and minority Muslims in the Middle East, which we supported in allowing Shannon Airport to be used to refuel planes. The bigger state went in with our tacit support, even though we are supposed to be neutral, and wrecked the place. I salute Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace for going there to see what was happening at first-hand. I went to Lebanon - I did not get to Syria - where I saw the refugees, the torturous way they were being dealt with, the never-ending poverty trap they were in and the refugee camps, about which we do not seem to care. That is what we should be raising at EU summits, given our track record as a neutral country that stood up against what was wrong and sent proud peacekeepers all over the world. We should not be out this week to primarily save Ms Merkel's skin and somebody else's next week. One can be sure it would be one of the stronger nations in Europe, one of the big boys, not the ordinary boys and girls in the class. We want to be the best in the class, look after and suck up to the biggest in the class and neglect like-minded countries and the problems they face on their borders with migration. We see the crisis unfolding on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> I do not know how the Minister of State can go to summits and devote 90% of the time to saving Ms Merkel's skin, while ignoring the thousands of lives that have been destroyed. Havoc was caused in Aleppo and other places, as Deputy Clare Daly said, which wiped them out and there was no proper democratic solution. It is time we stood up as a nation, the proud people we are, and played our rightful part in the European Union, not just massage Ms Merkel and try to be the best boys and girls in the class.</p>

          <p eId="para_572">I was fascinated when listening to Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly talk about their experiences in Aleppo. I was interested because last year I was on the border between Syria and Turkey where I met many people coming from Aleppo, many of whom had been blown apart by the conflict. I would be hard put to know where to point the finger of blame, whether at Russia, America, Saudi Arabia or everybody else involved in the conflict, which has drawn people from so many areas. A strength of our country is our neutrality in the sense that we try as well as we can not to take sides, particularly in highly militarised conflicts where, in knowing what is right and wrong, one can become increasingly confused in the fog of war. That neutrality gives us real strength and integrity and we should protect, defend and develop it. We should not be passive. There may be times when what is right and wrong in a conflict is clearly exposed and one can call what one sees, but sometimes that takes bravery. </p>
          <p eId="para_573"> Today is 4 July and in a sense we should be willing to call out our biggest benefactor. The United States of America is the biggest investor in this country, but we should not miss the opportunity to describe what President Donald Trump's Administration is doing along its border as being fundamentally in breach of United Nations' values and rules. It is an example of where we could be brave and stand up and call out what is wrong by not going to the Phoenix Park tonight to attend the ceremonies. It is not out of disrespect to the American people but to make a protest. Sometimes it is not just a matter of calling out what is wrong but also of stepping up and being proactive, generous and active to do what is right. Given that the Council meeting was rightly concentrated on the issue of migration which is dividing and tearing Europe apart, I would like to see us going into that forum and to see the Taoiseach in New York giving an example of how we could step up to the plate in using our neutrality in a positive way. Such an example would be following through on some of the words spoken last year about increasing our overseas aid. I recall that in the last budget it was increased from a very low level, but we are still at a figure of 0.33% of GDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> I understand the Taoiseach said last December there would be a ramping up of overseas aid, starting with this upcoming budget. In April we had a public consultation on what the public wants from the overseas aid programme. I would like to see specifics at this stage in terms of what we are thinking in that regard. That would give us a certain strength as we apply for a seat on the United Nations Security Council or at the European Council meeting and in a discussion on migration we could rightly say we are playing our part in addressing the root cause of the problem, which is the chronic poverty, climate stress or war in Africa and the Middle East being the key driver of migration. We have reached only 0.33% of GDP while our target is 0.7%. In other words, we have reached less than half of our target. As a State, we are undoubtedly one of the greatest beneficiaries of globalisation. All the investment in our country is often in the European headquarters of EMEA, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Our corporate tax returns are going through the roof because of the benefit of being in that position. Instead of putting money into the rainy day fund, which I support, we should put it into overseas aid straight away. I know one has to be careful and that one cannot ramp it up immediately. One has to make sure one uses the money wisely. That would give us an authority and help us encourage other countries to do what needs to be done in addressing the root causes of the migration crisis and other wars. We should be proactive in saying the aid is not tied and that it is not connected to economic advantage. There are certain things we are good at and we should double down on those. I would like to have seen that as one of the statements. I know the budget has to be done in October but we all know that now is the time when budget deals are being done. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to give me an indication of what deal we are looking for in overseas aid. What is the scale of ambition we are ramping up to? That would speak volumes, that we are not all plámás but that we made difficult decisions in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> I read with interest what the Taoiseach said in his speech on the discussions around PESCO and the militarisation of Europe that is taking place. Earlier, there was a meeting of elected representatives in the Dáil who have an interest in neutrality. One of the things on which we agreed is that there is no clarity on what we are spending, what our commitments are and what is happening in terms of the development of PESCO. I tried to ask straight questions of the Minister of State with responsibility for defence to try to get transparency on what is involved but it has proven to be incredibly difficult. We have an advantage in our effort to get a seat on the UN Security Council by differentiating ourselves from both Norway and Canada who were involved in possibly one of the worst examples of western intervention, the bombing of Libya. Ed Horgan said in his letter to the newspaper today that Canada dropped up to 300 bombs and Norway dropped twice that number.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">That was a disastrous intervention. You will remember, a Cheann Comhairle, our time in Egypt when we met the authorities there and they pointed out that to its west Libya was in flames, to the right, Syria was in flames, to the south, Yemen was in flames and Iraq was in flames to the south east. In each of those countries there was international intervention. I keep going back to the same questions. What is our place? What is our role? What is our benefit? You will recall the discussion we had, a Cheann Comhairle, with the Arab League. It was apparent from that visit that one of the strengths we have is that we come with a different perspective in that we are not the experts on everything. We are not telling everyone what to do. We are not taking sides. That is a useful position for Ireland as a neutral state. It does not need investment in PESCO for us to provide that role. It needs investment in the overseas aid budget, in honouring the sustainable development goals and in aligning ourselves to that strategy. The world needs countries like that at the moment. The world needs Ireland to step up to the plate and we could benefit from it. We would feel as a people that it does us proud and its suits our tradition in a variety of different ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> As part of that, and in response to the ongoing migration crisis, we should take more than the 25 additional programme refugees I understand we recently agreed to take from Malta. It is important that it is not just an issue for the Austrians, the Italians or other countries on the border. As distant as we are from the immediate entry points, we should be willing to review the Dublin convention and we should be willing to play a more proactive role. That is all the more important in a world where both America and Britain are going down the route of economic nationalism. That is not the way to go. It is a way which leads to conflict and competition rather than to co-operation, which is what we need. Ireland stands out. We are between those two big countries, which are historically powerful. We are small. We are only a little cork on the ocean of what is going on but if we stand up and are an example of what might work in an alternative way, it would not be insignificant and could play a beneficial role. We should grab that opportunity. More than anything else, I am keen to hear what the Minister of State has to say. Let us grab the opportunity and invest in overseas aid. Let us ramp it up in a way that does us proud and sends out a signal that this, more than anything, is the way to go to manage migration.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Helen McEntee)<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_579">In his statement, the Taoiseach spoke in some detail about the European Council's discussions on Brexit, migration, jobs, growth and competitiveness, and economic and monetary union. As he indicated, I will now speak about some of the other items discussed by Heads of State and Government, including the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, digital and innovation issues, and the enlargement and stabilisation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> First, I will speak about enlargement concerning the Western Balkans in particular. In relation to the enlargement and stabilisation process, the European Council welcomed the agreement reached between the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece regarding the long-running dispute over the name of the former. It is very good to finally have movement on this issue which has been a source of tension for countries in the region. It gives a positive impetus to the prospect for an improvement in relations there. While the deal has yet to be ratified, it is important that we welcome and support it at this early stage. It is clear that the constructive role of the EU, and the prospect of EU membership, are powerful drivers for co-operation and mutual respect, even in very divisive situations. It is worth bearing that in mind when we look at our candidate countries and enlargement policy in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> The European Council also endorsed the conclusions of the General Affairs Council on enlargement. Those had been agreed, after lengthy discussion, at the General Affairs Council, which I attended and spoke at earlier that week. The conclusions relate to the seven candidate and potential candidate countries. They reaffirm the Union's commitment to enlargement, welcome the reform efforts across all of those countries, and outline the progress that has yet to be made there. In particular, the Council agreed to respond positively to the progress made by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. A small number of member states felt that these two countries need to carry out further reforms before accession negotiations could be opened. Following the query that was raised in intensive discussions, we agreed that the Council should set out a path towards opening negotiations with them in June 2019. If progress continues to be made on the reform priorities, a decision can then be taken by the Council to allow negotiations to be opened. The Commission will now begin the preparatory work required to ensure that, if the conditions are met, negotiations can be opened by that time next year, which is welcome progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> Ireland is a firm supporter of EU accession for countries willing to take on the responsibilities and obligations of membership, provided that all conditions are met, and we support the European perspective on the western Balkans. We were also strongly supportive of the EU strategy for the region, published in May, which outlines a framework for those aspiring to join the Union in the foreseeable future. That was a priority for the Bulgarian Presidency and it deserves credit for its hard work, including in successfully convening and chairing the informal summit in Sofia in May, which I attended with the Taoiseach. It produced a declaration and a priority agenda outlining practical initiatives for further co-operation between the EU and the western Balkans. I had the opportunity to visit the region and to meet with my counterparts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">I encouraged them to seize the momentum provided by the renewed focus on the western Balkans and assured them of Ireland’s support as they carry out the reforms necessary to meet the high standards expected by the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> The June European Council set out important strategic directions on innovation and digital policy issues, reflecting the very constructive discussion by our Heads of State and Government in Sofia in May. Specifically, the strong focus is on supporting breakthrough and disruptive innovation in Europe. It is very encouraging that the Commission is proposing a €100 billion research and innovation envelope under the post-2020 multi-annual financial framework, MFF, including a new European innovation council, EIC, with a focus on supporting top-class innovators with ambition to scale internationally. Ireland supported the pilot running of the innovation council under the current multi-annual financial framework and we are pleased to see the concept gaining wide support. We must also continue to unlock the full potential of Europe’s digital Single Market, setting a direction that is open, competitive, innovation-friendly and open for business. This includes high levels of protection for personal privacy under the new general data protection regulation, GDPR, underpinning trust and confidence in new digital services while removing unnecessary barriers to the free flow of non-personal data. A fully developed Single Market will remove unnecessary barriers to doing business digitally and across borders, which will present significant opportunities for all business, particularly Irish small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and consumers. The digital economy is an increasingly important driver of economic growth globally as information and communication technology, ICT, related technological development transforms operational and business models. Most young people in school, as well as future generations, will work in jobs that have not yet been created as we move more and more into this sector. Ireland’s participation in the development of the EU's digital Single Market is an enabler of our digital economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> By early May, the Commission had presented just over 30 legislative initiatives under its digital Single Market strategy. The most recent package was issued on 25 April and largely completes the legislative framework envisaged by the Commission for the digital Single Market. The Parliament and Council have already agreed on a third of the Commission proposals. Many of the proposals are particularly significant, including those on roaming, which people understand and have seen recent changes in, general data protection, geo-blocking, portability and the 470 MHz to 790 MHz frequency. The co-legislators are likely to soon agree on a further five proposals. Ireland has been very proactive in encouraging and pushing forward work on the digital Single Market with the current Presidency and the previous Estonian Presidency which had the issue in high priority during its term. We will continue to co-operate closely with like-minded member states in supporting a high level of ambition for Europe's digital transformation.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> I will outline the European Council discussions on the multi-annual financial framework. The Commission proposal for the multi-annual financial framework, which was published on 2 May, and its subsequent sectoral proposals mark the beginning of a very important and lengthy debate. The main discussion among Heads of State and Government last week regarded the timeline, with the European Parliament and Council now invited to examine the proposals in a more comprehensive manner as soon as possible. The Commission in particular hopes that agreement can be reached before the European Parliament elections in May of next year. Although this is an ambitious timetable, Ireland is prepared to work at an accelerated rate if it can help to reach agreement. It is worth noting, however, that neither Ireland nor any other member state is interested in sacrificing quality for speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> In recent years, Ireland has moved from being a net beneficiary of the EU budget to being a net contributor and will be a net contributor for the full period of the post-2020 multi-annual financial framework for the first time. We are nonetheless open to contributing more, but only where it brings clear added European value and provided that our core priorities are protected. It is important to note that there is a variety of opinions on whether member states should pay more. We are willing to contribute more but not at the expense of our core priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> This is a time of change within the European Union. We understand that we must deal with new priorities, including security, climate change and other issues, as well as the departure of the United Kingdom. The migration debate at the June European Council underlined the need for the EU budget to remain relevant to changed circumstances and there is little doubt that there will be a significant increase in the EU funds spent on migration over the next budget. It is also important that policies with demonstrated European added value continue to be properly supported. The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, remains a priority for Ireland because it delivers excellent value, protects agriculture and gives us the tools to support change as we prepare for the challenges of the future. Cohesion funding is also important, especially in helping less developed member states. Ireland received cohesion funds in the past and we are well aware of the transformational impact they can have in unlocking a country's economic potential and we would like to see newer member states avail of those benefits. In its proposals, the Commission has also emphasised other policies that function well, including ERASMUS+, the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation and the PEACE and INTERREG programmes, which are particularly welcome here. The Commission also proposed that we double our funding in regard to young people, which I very much welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> From Ireland’s perspective, we will carefully consider the implications of these proposals within the budget. We have given our very strong view that CAP and other well-functioning programmes such as ERASMUS and Horizon 2020 should not be cut. Our negotiating position will be that there should be no cut in CAP payments to farmers. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, recently attended a meeting with like-minded countries on the issue and I have raised it regularly, including at a discussion with Commissioner Oettinger last week. As I noted earlier, we are willing to increase our contribution to the EU budget to protect these and other well-functioning programmes where there is demonstrable EU added value and we will work with our allies across the Union to achieve that. The Commission has also put forward some ideas for additional ways to fund the budget, including proposals in regard to a possible tax on plastics or a common consolidated corporate tax base. Although it will examine these carefully, the Government believes direct payments from member states are the fairest and most effective way to fund the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> I thank all Deputies for their statements and assure them that the Taoiseach and I will continue to report to the House in advance of and following the regular meetings of the European Council.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, for her comprehensive report on the meeting of the European Council. It seems that many issues aside from those reported in the media were discussed at it. As expected, the migration crisis dominated the agenda of the two-day European Council summit last week. Migrants from the Middle East and north Africa - and Syria, Afghanistan and Eritrea in particular - who cross the Mediterranean are a major concern for the European Union. Indeed, it is one of the biggest challenges facing Europe at this time and has the capacity to threaten its future existence. Migration is also one of the great global issues of the day, as is evident from political issues in the United States. As a result, a new wave of populism has emerged in the politics of Italy, Hungary, Poland and Austria, where right wing parties are now in the ascendancy. We see too that the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is under pressure on the issue as she seeks to accommodate her junior coalition partner, the Christian Social Union in Bavaria. However, all right-thinking people must condemn unnecessary scaremongering in regard to migrants and asylum seekers. Political parties should not exaggerate the problem for their own political ends. Some deliberately target vulnerable people, mostly Muslims, to gain political support. That is not in accordance with the liberal democratic values of the European Union and must be rejected. The reality is that arrival rates of migrants and asylum seekers to the EU have declined in recent years, as was pointed out by other contributors to this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> What was agreed in the joint statement after a long night of discussions in Brussels last week? What compromise was reached? Incidentally, this episode gives an indication of what might happen at the October summit, at which Brexit and the backstop issue will be finalised in the withdrawal agreement. The warning given by the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, is relevant: in the early hours of the morning when patience is wearing thin, Ireland could be forced to compromise on the question of Brexit. That is a real worry of which we must be conscious in view of how the European Council operates on big, contentious issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> The European Council agreed to examine the establishment of regional disembarkation centres to process rescued refugee asylum applicants in non-EU third countries, presumably in north Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">These would be migrant processing centres. Agreement was reached to stem illegal migration and increase funding to control the EU's external borders to strengthen Europe's frontiers, so to speak. It would be important also to increase aid to these African transit states and to increase economic opportunities in these failed nation states.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> In addition, everything should be done to stop the boat smugglers and to discourage migrants from getting these boats. We have to stop migrants heading off on these perilous journeys to Spain, Italy and Greece in particular. What is needed is a humanitarian response. There must also be burden sharing and an openness to the proposal for mandatory quotas. I note there is resistance to that concept from Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria. We need to show solidarity with other EU states in respect of this problem and encourage a dispersal for those caught up this nightmare. We also need a common European asylum policy. It is obvious to everyone that the Dublin regulation is hopelessly out of date and no longer fit for purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> In terms of Ireland's position on this matter, we are not on the front line and are somewhat removed from it all but we should honour our commitment to take another 2,000 migrants, bringing the total to 4,000. We are to treble our contribution to €15 million to EU funds to support migrants through the EU Trust Fund for Africa. Ireland must adopt a humanitarian response. Operation Sophia is working well and we should be proud of our participation in that. I hope to get to ask the Minister of State a few more questions at the end of the debate.</p>

        <speech by="#LisaChambers" eId="spk_339">
          <from>Deputy Lisa Chambers<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_598">I am both disappointed and concerned that we did not have any progress on the Irish issues and the Border in last month's Council meeting even though we had known for some time that that would be the case. It is even more disappointing to see the measly four paragraph conclusion paper published by the Council regarding Brexit. It illustrates that Brexit most definitely was not top of the agenda and that we are not the only show in town, although one would be forgiven for thinking otherwise given the spinning the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste embarked upon, citing the June Council meeting as a key deadline in these negotiations that they had set for significant progress and one that has now been missed.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> It appears all that happened in regard to Brexit at the June meeting was to welcome a small amount of progress on other elements of the withdrawal treaty and to give Prime Minister Theresa May a stern talking to, which I am sure she is getting quite used to at this stage. Essentially, the EU warned Theresa May to get a move on and honour the commitments she and her Government gave last December and March. We await to see the progress on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> Reports coming from the United Kingdom suggest she will propose a third option, distinct and separate from maximum facilitation, or max fac, and the customs partnership about which we have heard, and that she will seek approval for that. We await the much hoped for white smoke from the incoming White Paper this weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> What we do know is that we do not have an agreed backstop. There has been zero progress on the Irish issues since last December. We are expected to have a withdrawal treaty in place by October and ratified by next March and the UK still has not decided what it wants. Ireland is in a very precarious and vulnerable position with time fast running out. It is becoming a real possibility that the UK may crash out of the EU next March with a no-deal Brexit scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> The focus of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to date has been to overspin short-term developments as big political wins and, in the process of doing so, they have failed to give a true and accurate picture of the genuine state of play of Brexit negotiations to our citizens. We saw that with the backstop last December, which did no one any favours. That allowed complacency to set in in government and across the business and farming community because our Government essentially told us that everything would be okay.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> We do not know the Government plan in terms of a scenario of a no-deal Brexit. Despite the numerous information briefings the Tánaiste has provided, and many glossy policy papers, having sat in those briefings I am none the wiser as to the Government's plan for a no-deal Brexit. I can get the information we get from <i>The Irish Times</i> or <i>The Guardian</i>. It is not anything additional to what is in the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> We do not even seem to be prepared for a soft Brexit, never mind a hard Brexit. The Taoiseach seems far more interested in touring the European capitals on the mainland rather than trying to build relationships with the UK in what is already a very strained situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> Can we really just sit back and wait for Theresa May to put a solution on the table? The Minister of State will know the saying about doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome. It is utter madness at this stage just to sit back and wait for the Tory party, some of whose members have been openly hostile to Ireland and want to call our bluff, to use their words, to provide a solution to the Irish Border issue. Is it not time now to start putting some of our own proposals on the table when we are essentially in the 11th hour of these negotiations?</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> It must be remembered that for most member states, Brexit is merely an inconvenience. It does not affect every member state in the same way it affects Ireland, and other member states have other issues to worry about. The European Union is under attack from so many avenues. I refer to the change to a populist government in Italy, the anti-migrant rhetoric of Viktor Orbán in Hungary, a member of a party associated with Fine Gael's own party in Europe, the European People's Party, German Chancellor Angela Merkel coming under huge pressure in terms of the migrant crisis, and severe levels of poverty and unemployment across many of the southern member states. All of those threaten the European project and it would be wise for us to remember that here in Ireland. I read recently that 5 million Italian citizens are living below the poverty line. That provides a stark contrast to the projected problems for our county in the event of a hard Brexit and reminds us that we are not the only issue the European Union is dealing with. Guy Verhofstadt gave a sobering warning in this Chamber last month when he said something we in Fianna Fáil have been saying from the very beginning and I have been saying since taking up my post. Although a hard Brexit is unlikely, we must prepare. It was only after that remark in this Chamber that the penny finally dropped for Government. Scenario planning then began to deal with all the possible outcomes, including a hard Brexit. That planning should have started 18 months ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> It is now time to step up preparations considerably to do whatever we can to encourage businesses to take up the available supports, something they have not done in the numbers we expected them to have done at this point. We must diversify our agrifood markets and start working on improving relationships with the UK. These are all actions the Irish Government can and must take now.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidCullinane" eId="spk_340">
          <from>Deputy David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_608">Last December, the Government told the Irish people that it had a cast-iron guarantee regarding the North and that in the event of a no-deal scenario, there would be no hard border or no hardening of the Border on the island of Ireland and this deal was designed not just to avoid any hardening of the Border but to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and to protect the rights of citizens on the island, including those in the North who are Irish citizens and who, as a consequence of that, would continue to be European Union citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> The reason that was described as cast iron was that it was a backstop, and a backstop is not some temporary arrangement. A backstop, by its very nature, is a permanent arrangement. It was never meant to be ideal or the only option on the table. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were right when they said on several occasions that the backstop option was only in play in the event there was no deal between Britain and Europe on trade or if a better deal was not put on the table. It was designed to make sure we had an insurance policy if the current talks between Britain and the European Union fail. That was the nature of the backstop arrangement. We now have the British Prime Minister talking about a temporary backstop arrangement, with time limits imposed. It is not a backstop at all. It has now become a UK-wide extension of the implementation period and, essentially, nothing more than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> I had some quarrels with the Tánaiste over this because my observation of where the British Government is at is that it has torn up the backstop agreement and is clearly focused on some sort of arrangement or deal at the end of the day that will cover Britain in its entirety and would see the North being part of that arrangement. We are now left with no guarantees.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> We have to go back to the start of this process when many people in this Chamber supported an Irish position, which was that we must avoid at all costs stumbling into October still negotiating with Britain on the wider issues without having any guarantees and any solutions for Ireland. We were promised by the Irish Government that would not happen. We were promised that even before we would even move on to phase two of the negotiations we would have a resolution of the Irish issues. That came and went and then we had this backstop agreement. We warned the Minister of State's Government at the time it was published.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">We warned the Government not to oversell the agreement, not to be naive, to keep its feet on the ground and see it as the political agreement that it was. It was not a legal agreement. Flesh had to be put on the bones of the December agreement which needed to be built on. It did not include services or all areas of trade. It was not even envisaged that the North would stay fully in the customs union and the Single Market. It only envisaged the North staying in the customs union to protect what it called the all-island economy, the Good Friday Agreement and North-South co-operation. Even then, it was quite limited, but at least it was something. However, that something has now been taken of the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> I have attended almost every meeting of the stakeholder forums which the Tánaiste hosts once a month. I go to listen and engage and the Tánaiste sets out the position of the Irish Government. None of it is secret. There are some things he will share with us in confidence, but the overall thrust of the Irish Government's position that it wanted progress by June was very public. It was the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach who set the bar that we could move beyond June if we did not have real and substantial progress on the Irish issues. When he came to Dundalk, Mr. Barnier made a very similar commitment. I was at the lunch where the Tánaiste and Mr. Barnier were at one that we could not move past June without having what they both described as real and substantial progress. I have my view on what the bar should have been, but even by the Government's own measure, its strategy has failed. That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> The European Council's statement following the meeting expressed concern that no substantial progress had been achieved on a backstop solution for the North and Ireland. For all of the talk and promises that we would have real and substantial progress and were not going to stumble into October without any resolution of the Irish issues, that is exactly what happened, yet we move on regardless. There are no consequences for the British Government and no pressure. Brexit was not the dominant issue at the Council meeting. There was no real reprimand for the British Government or, it seems, real pressure exerted by the Irish Government. That is a dereliction of its duty. All other European partners have their concerns and issues, all of which I respect, but the Irish Government's position has to be to protect the interests of those who live on the island of Ireland. At the end of the day we cannot depend on anybody except ourselves and have to make sure that at the very least the Irish Government is holding Britain to account, forcing the European Union to hold it to account and using whatever leverage we have to make sure that will happen. That was the Irish Government's stated intention, according to its rhetoric, but it seems that it was comfortable in allowing the phase 1 negotiations to move on without real concrete solutions. Now it seems content to leave the June summit without concrete solutions, even though it stated all the way along that it would not allow that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> The Minister of State must accept that this is not a good outcome for the Government. It is certainly not a good outcome for Ireland or the people I represent who now have very real concerns about what is going to happen. Leaving aside all of the differences we can have on these issues, with the British Government and the European Union and leaving aside all of the different scenarios with max fac, max fac plus and all of the things we are hearing that might come from the Chequers meeting and the White Paper in which Mrs. Theresa May will put some options on the table, the hard reality is that the British Government is still intent on taking the North out of the European Union, the customs union and the Single Market. There may be some sort of customs partnership, but we do not know how it would work in practice. What we do know is that services will not be included. Not every area of trade will be included. There are real question marks about whether the European Union will agree to any type of arrangement which will allow Britain to stay in the Single Market without supporting the four freedoms which include the free movement of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> I have no difficulty with the European Union defending its position and making sure the rules of the Single Market and the customs union are protected. We are a member of the European Union and it is taken as a given that that must happen. However, if there is divergence and the North is not aligned with the rules of the Single Market and the customs union, we will have a problem. That would be a step backwards and we did not vote for a step backwards, North or South. We should not accept it under any circumstance. The Government has an awful lot of work to do between now and October to recover lost ground. Pressure needs to be exerted on the Minister of State and the Government to come back with a solution that will protect the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts, avoid any hardening of the Border and protect the rights of citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> I also want to address the immigration issue. It is important that it featured at the summit as it is a huge issue. I listened intently to the debate and opinions expressed by Members on whether Russia or western allies were right. I do not side with Russia or western governments in the conflict in Syria. They have all failed that country and region. I am very concerned about the welfare of the people who live there and the fact that many of them are being forced to flee and are not being given the protections and supports they should have. As other Deputies said, we are very fortunate that we do not have a far right party or politicians to any great degree in this state. We should be very proud of this, given what is happening elsewhere in Europe.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">There are some examples, but we have to be fair. By and large, the Irish political system, although not unique, is certainly in a better position than that in some other European countries where the far right is on the increase and much more strident. The Irish people are very tolerant and know that we need to do our best. However, we are a little removed from the crisis. Countries such as Greece, Germany and Italy are seen as being at the coalface and have their concerns. We must at all times uphold people's human rights, EU rights and conventions. The solution is to deal with the root causes of the conflicts in the countries in question and make sure we do not have regimes in them that treat people in that way or others who are involved in terrorism which also forces people to leave.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruth Coppinger<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_620">I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> About a week ago the Dáil debated a motion which condemned President Trump's immigration policy whereby he was separating children from parents at the US border. Even Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael joined in and initiated the motion. Looking back, I have to ask if it was really motivated by concern about what was happening to the children and their parents, or if it was just because President Trump had fallen out of favour with the European Union and, therefore, it was an opportune time to condemn him. The same parties have been deadly silent on EU immigration policy whereby children are not being separated from their parents by border guards because they are not even reaching here; rather, they are floating lifeless in the water of the Mediterranean Sea. Anybody who was not moved over the weekend by the pictures of the three babies floating fully dressed in children's clothes, looking as if they were alive, had a heart of stone. They were the latest victims of the migrant crisis in which people are trying desperately to reach Europe and will risk anything to do so. Some 100 people were feared dead on the rubber boat which capsized off the coast of Libya.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> Italy has closed its ports to ships that are rescuing migrants. The European Council stated it was determined to prevent a return to the "uncontrolled flows" of 2015 and stem illegal migration. President Macron said we would look for a European solution. That solution is to have regional disembarkation platforms, hopefully in north Africa or elsewhere outside Europe, to stop people from getting here and save the European Union the trouble of even having to deal with these human beings. Europe has a population of 500 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">In 2018 a total of 42,000 people came, which is actually not a lot. Even in 2015, the figure was 1 million, in the context of an acute crisis. A total of 16,000 migrants have died or gone missing at sea since 2014, yet not once have I heard Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or any of the other big parties represented in this Dáil condemn the European Union for that policy. </p>
          <p eId="para_624"> Médecins Sans Frontières asked the European Union to show some basic decency - it used these very frank words - by allowing search and rescue operations to bring people to a place of safety and not return them to Libya. Please excuse me, but I am using the words of Barack Obama. Can we be clear on why Libya is a "shitshow"? It is because of the Clintons and Barack Obama who took a decision to intervene to try to change the regime in Libya to increase US influence in the Arab world and US economic interests in that oil rich country. Again, I have never heard it being condemned by the Minister of State, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Taoiseach or anybody else. In fact, Hillary Clinton was awarded a doctorate in this city last week for her efforts. It was done in conjunction with our European partners, as Barack Obama said at the time. There was loss of civilian life and infrastructure on a large scale, as well as the promotion of unaccountable militias, religious fundamentalists and, of course, Islamic State. </p>
          <p eId="para_625"> I want to take up some of the issues that were raised. It is not the case that no political party has played the race card because individual councillors have been playing it for many years. I will give three examples in Fine Gael. The Limerick councillor Stephen Keary said welfare recipients saw Ireland as the home of hand outs and easy pickings. Councillor Brian Murphy talked about Sharia law operating in Ireland and subverting our legal system. Councillor Darren Scully said he would not represent black Africans. These comments are seized on on social media forums and elsewhere and the people in question have not been kicked out of Fine Gael. </p>
          <p eId="para_626"> The left should not support any imperialist intervention in the region. I have not visited Syria, but I have spoken to Syrian refugees fleeing the barrel bombs and all other weapons used in the region in which Russia is assisting a murderous regime. That is the reality and we should condemn it, as well as western intervention.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_344">
          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_627">I will focus on the galloping pace of militarisation of the European Union. We consistently need to ring alarm bells about it because the Government's approach is to state "there is nothing to see here". We are joining PESCO which represents a real and qualitative increase in the State's role in the militarisation of the European Union. The notification states "a long-term vision of Pesco could be to arrive at a coherent full spectrum force package – in complementarity with Nato, which will continue to be the cornerstone of collective defence for its members". That is just one recent illustration of the pace of militarisation. If one looks at the European Council's conclusions, item No. 1, which has been well discussed, is the issue of migration which is about raising even higher the militarised walls of Fortress Europe, while item No. 2 is security and defence. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_628">The Union is therefore taking steps to bolster European defence, by enhancing defence investment, capability development and operational readiness. These initiatives enhance its strategic autonomy while complementing and reinforcing the activities of NATO, in line with previous conclusions. </p>
          <p eId="para_629">It goes on to call for the fulfilment of PESCO commitments, welcome progress on the issue of military mobility and call for the swift implementation of the European Defence Industrial Development Programme, further progress on the European Defence Fund and a further deepening of EU-NATO co-operation. This is happening in a context where there is a certain weakening of ties and a certain breach between US imperialism and the big European imperial powers. It is also happening in a context where there is the threat of rising Russian imperialism. It was President Juncker who spelled it out clearly in 2015 when he said a common European army would convey a clear message to Russia that the European Union was serious about defending European values. These values are, of course, about keeping migrants out, allowing people like Viktor Orbán to do what he likes, allowing people like Matteo Salvini to come to power in Italy, enforcing austerity, with a complete lack of democratic controls on the periphery of Europe and using trade deals to exploit less developed countries for the benefit of European corporations. They are the European values they are talking about defending and its pace is increasing. The Meseberg Declaration by the French and German Governments, in addition to a joint intervention force, called for the exploration of the use of the majority vote in the field of Common Foreign and Security Policy. What that means is an end to the veto over the European Union intervening directly, as opposed to using the likes of PESCO. That is what the French and German Governments are now calling for and they may well get their wish ultimately. They have also committed to together progressing towards a better integrated European defence policy. That declaration already has its real world implications with the establishment of a joint European military intervention force. The French and German Governments also have a clear wish for it to be linked with PESCO, in which Ireland is involved. </p>
          <p eId="para_630"> The final issue I want to highlight in the framework of militarisation is the establishment at the last meeting of Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers of what is called the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence, CARD. It will be a review conducted by the European Defence Agency to "provide a better overview of national defence spending plans". It is an EU body that will monitor defence spending to ensure governments across the European Union are spending 2% on average. It is the military equivalent of the sixpack, the twopack, European surveillance and the methods used to monitor implementation of austerity. The same undemocratic moves are being made to enforce and increase the pace of militarisation. </p>
          <p eId="para_631"> What is most shocking for people is the massive increase in military spending - it is taxpayers' money in Ireland and across Europe - contained in the latest proposal for the multi-annual financial framework, a seven-year budget for the European Union. The Commission proposes a budget of €13 billion for the European Defence Fund. That would place the European Union in the top four of defence research and technology investors in Europe. To really highlight the point - this comes directly from a Commission document - it is 22 times the current level of spending. This is money that could be used for investment in public services, but instead it is money that will go to the manufacturers of killing machines - drones, bombs and weapons of all sorts - while some of it will end up with Israeli armaments companies, in particular.</p>

        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_345">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_632">I go back to the EU motto and values. Its motto is unity in diversity, while its values include human rights and freedom, human dignity, democracy, equality and the rule of law. I must ask where are these values at times, particularly in dealing with the migration issue. It is almost as if the European Union is circling the wagons and battening down the hatches. It is internal EU policies that seem to be dominating or, in the case of Germany, about compromising in the interests of the ruling coalition. We have the rise of populism and a very disturbing form of nationalism which seems to be dictating policies on migrants. Of course, the irony is that the causes of migration today can be traced back to the old imperialist and colonialist powers of Europe, including Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands and Belgium and the empires they carved out for themselves in Africa and other countries, with no respect for ethnicity or culture, not to mention land grabs and the grabbing of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> I know that migration is a complex issue. The European Council does talk about adopting a comprehensive approach, but such an approach must be allied with a caring approach because we are dealing with people who are extremely vulnerable. On other occasions the European Union will talk about tackling the root causes of migration. We know what they are. They are conflict; climate change which leads to drought and famine; the lack of health services; the abuse of human rights; and poverty. Where are the comprehensive EU plans to deal with these issues?</p>
          <p eId="para_634">I know the EU is a massive aid donor but there is a need to look at exactly where multilateral aid is going and the effect it is having, if any, or whether it is being swallowed up in bureaucracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> There are other issues that relate to the causes of migration. One is war and conflict. We have to ask who benefits from that, and those who benefit are those in the arms trade. Who is in the arms trade? It is those countries that carved out empires in the developing world, now allied with other countries like the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia. It is a powerful irony that the EU will give aid with one hand while some EU countries are sending bombs with the other. We know that if people are living in peace and with respect for human rights, this creates an atmosphere in which people will stay in their countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> Another reason people will migrate is if they cannot make a decent living in their country, and, of course, tax comes into that. While the EU is making some progress, many of the countries from where migrants are coming are being deprived of badly needed financial resources through tax injustice. I pay tribute to the Irish NGOs doing work on this issue. African countries are faced with very powerful multinational lobbying groups. There is at times a need for capacity building on their side so they can deal with these issues on an equal footing and not be taken advantage of.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> I believe Europe strolled into the migrant crisis without a common policy and even without a coherent loose position. Despite this, different academics will tell us that after the events in the Middle East emerged, the migrant crisis could have been predicted and prepared for and the consequences could have been significantly mitigated. Different nations are taking up different positions based on their geography, security fears, labour market issues, the presence of far right parties and, of course, the fear of the electorate. It is sad we are seeing sound, comprehensive, caring policies being displaced. The way the EU is going is very disturbing, with more extreme views than ever before.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> I have raised the Libyan issue and the Mediterranean issue. The Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence is meeting Médecins sans Frontières again tomorrow to get an update. It is bizarre that we are supporting a Libyan Coast Guard that will return people to detention centres in Libya where there is torture, rape, starvation and slavery. It seems that once the flow is stopped at the European borders, it is believed that the problem is solved. However, a real human rights abuse is happening. It is unfair to the Irish Naval Service, which has a very humane record, that it should be seen to be facilitating that kind of human rights abuse with the Libyan Coast Guard, many of whose members are, as NGOs and migrants themselves will say, worse than the smugglers. At the same time, the smuggling has to be stopped due to the risks people are taking and the amount of money they pay before going on these totally unsafe boats.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> We are told the EU will continue to stand by front-line states such as Italy in this respect. I thought it appalling that the boat was stopped from docking in Italy. It was gratifying to hear the voices of ordinary Italian people who were equally horrified at what their Government was doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> On the positive side, I read in the conclusions that the EU and its member states will rise to the challenge through increased co-operation with countries in Africa and increased development funding. I hope it is co-operation at an equal level, which would be a positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> There is an agenda for reform of the new common European asylum system. While there will be a report on progress during the October European Council, how will that be measured?</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> It is said that the Union is taking steps to bolster European defence, enhancing defence investment, capability development and operational readiness. This is the whole militarist agenda coming from the EU which is very disturbing. <i>The Irish Times</i> today contains a letter from Dr. Ed Horgan, who is retired from our peacekeeping forces. While he is talking about the UN Security Council, the points he makes are also valid for Ireland's voice in Europe. He asks why, if we want to be a member of the Security Council, we are not bringing something different and promoting our neutrality. Canada and Norway, as he points out, are members of NATO and have been involved in bombing other countries. Is it the case that we are suddenly ashamed of our neutrality? We know of the undermining of our neutrality that is happening at present and we should be more ashamed of that. Mr. Horgan speaks as a former member of our peacekeeping forces and his point is that it is extremely disrespectful to those 88 Irish peacekeeping force members who lost their lives on peacekeeping missions because they were there as part of a neutral Ireland peacekeeping force.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> That brings me to the European Defence Fund and the figures on militarisation. I would like to have this clarified. All of these increased figures will come from the EU budget yet we know humanitarian needs are greater than ever. I would hate to see competition between the defence budget and the humanitarian budget. The budget for the research and technology phase until 2019 is €90 million but, from 2021 onwards, that will increase to €4.1 billion. The development phase budget is currently at €500 million for 2019-20 but it will be €8.9 billion after that. Where is this money coming from?</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> Ireland has to go back to being that independent neutral voice but we are moving ever further away from that. Having been with other Deputies in Syria last week, I believe we can see more than ever that Ireland needs to be that independent neutral voice. There is no good or bad side in war because it is the ordinary people who suffer the most in war. Certainly, allying ourselves with any particular side is not doing any good for our formidable reputation as a humanitarian country with a strong record on human rights. We need to remember this point. Whatever about being on the Security Council, we need to bring something different to our bid to be on it. That comes back to our human rights agenda, our independence and our neutrality.</p>

          <p eId="para_646">I have some questions and it would be good to get answers. While I do not want to pin the Minister of State down to providing the answers today, it would be great to get a response.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> To put things in context, I echo the words of Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan. We are also of the opinion that we should not be taking sides in any war. It was unfortunate that Syria had to seek the help of Russia and Iran for protection because it was about to be obliterated by the jihadists, who were being armed by the Saudis, the Israelis, the US and, sadly, the EU. Syria would rather be independent and not dependent on any imperialist power, of which the Russians are one. There is no such thing as a nice imperialist power, no more than, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said, there can be a nice side in any war.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> A huge problem is brewing in Syria. The jihadists were holding out in many different regions of Syria and they are slowly but surely being forced out of them. Deals are being done where the government and the Syrian Arab Army get the people to move out and offer an option to the jihadists to move to Idlib. At this stage an incredible number of people have arrived in Idlib, which is controlled by the jihadists with the help of Turkey. It is not far from the Turkish border and we were not too far away from it ourselves last week. There are now thousands of jihadists in Idlib and nobody wants them. The US and the EU armed and funded them, as did the Saudis and the Israelis. Turkey let them across the border, or at least, if some crossed from Jordan, most came from Turkey. Now, nobody wants them.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Turkey, which let them in, does not want to let them come back. The Arabs do not want them. Certainly, Syria does not want them. Syria says it is prepared to work with Syrians who took sides against it but not with the foreigners and I note that 95% of them are foreign.</p>

          <p eId="para_651">Europe does not want them. I can understand why Europe does not want to flood the EU with mad jihadists but what is the EU plan to deal with the jihadists in Idlib who nobody wants but who the EU was actually involved in funding and arming? My final question is as follows. Does the EU have any concerns around Erdogan's relationship with the Kurds and the threat of genocide against the Kurds in the near future? Is that on the EU's radar and is it concerned? I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his patience.</p>

He attended the launch of the Irish-Cuban parliamentary friendship grouping and met the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence. There are issues in relation to Cuba and the agreement signed with the EU. Can Ireland be a voice for progressing that further? I ask also about our own Irish-Cuban relations, which I acknowledge is a completely different matter. However, there is a European aspect to this.</p>

          <p eId="para_657">I apologise. Syria was not discussed at the most recent European Council but was discussed at the February Council. Ireland is extremely concerned by what is happening and has continued to provide aid to support those affected in Syria. We have provided €110 million since the conflict started albeit we would like to do more. We are working with our European counterparts. We regret that the UN Security Council has been unable to take meaningful action to maintain international peace and security. It is disappointing that there are those who have vetoed effective UN action. Those parties bear a heavy responsibility. The Russian veto risks offering a licence to attack civilians with impunity. Different states have formed different conclusions as to how best to act in these different circumstances. Our position has been always to move away from military action and to encourage the government at hand to deal with this situation itself. I might come back to the Deputy with greater detail from the Council meeting in February and let him know when Syria will be on the agenda again. Deputy Daly raised a question about someone coming to Ireland, which I will bring back to the Tánaiste also.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> A number of issues were raised about Brexit and the migration crisis, respectively. There has been a great deal of talk in the context of Brexit of the backstop ceasing to exist or being no longer on the agenda and of the strategy put in place by Ireland or the EU having failed. I remind Deputies that Brexit has not yet happened, that negotiations are still ongoing, that the deadline for Brexit is March 2019 and that the deadline for the withdrawal agreement is October 2018. We were extremely disappointed that sufficient progress was not made in the June European Council. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have been very clear in stating that without progress the likelihood of having no deal or agreement grows. Obviously, we need to ensure in the next weeks and months that this does not happen. Every focus is on ensuring we have an outcome in October. As to the suggestion of a September summit, many Deputies have already pointed out that preparations for the Council itself take a number of weeks. Rather than prepare for a summit at which there will be no actual conclusions, our focus must be on the discussions, engagements and negotiations between the EU task force and the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> There was also a suggestion that it is a waste of time for the Taoiseach or another Minister or Member of the House to travel to other member states. I acknowledge that when one travels to Poland, Austria or Italy, for example, Brexit is not at the top of their agendas. While it is not a priority for other member states in that regard, Ireland is top of their agenda when it comes to the overall withdrawal agreement and the outcome of Brexit. That is because of our continuous engagement and travel to other member states while welcoming their representatives to Ireland. We have ensured the Irish backstop is on their agenda. On foot of that engagement, we have been able to come to the point we are at. I stress that while the conclusions may seem short and while they outline that sufficient progress has not been made, they also outline that without the Irish protocol, there will be no withdrawal agreement. Without a withdrawal agreement, there will be no transition period. That is something the UK Government must take very seriously at this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> It has also been suggested that we are not preparing for a hard Brexit and that it was not until Guy Verhofstadt visited Ireland that we started to prepare. I assure Deputy Chambers and others that following the vote, immediate action was taken to engage with our Departments and industry to ensure they identified the possible challenges and threats in all eventualities from a hard Brexit to the best possible outcome. They have since been engaged in identifying what procedures, measures and changes to legislation and so on are necessary. Obviously, we are not going to start explaining to people in the middle of negotiations what those possible measures are when the outcome is not yet known.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> A number of issues were raised having regard to migration. I point out that while there was a significant difficulty in reaching a conclusion at the discussions last week, a framework for moving forward was agreed. The challenge now is to implement that framework. Ireland has been consistent in offering solidarity and support to those member states most impacted and we have agreed to increase our contribution to the Africa Trust fund, first from €3 million to €6 million and, now, to €15 million. Many Deputies have referred to the need to address root causes and this is one of the ways to do it. We will continue to work with organisations in Africa to ensure we identify and address the root causes which are leading people to travel.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> Strengthening our borders and, in particular, Frontex is about stemming illegal migration. Last year, illegal migration decreased by 80% and the overall figure has decreased by 95% since 2015. However, we are absolutely dedicated to helping those migrants who are in sincere need of our support and to working with member states and hosts. We have demonstrated that by our involvement in Operation Sophia to tackle illegal smuggling. Our sailors have rescued more than 17,000 people at sea who might otherwise have drowned. We also accepted migrants from the Lifeline ship last week and while it may seem like a small number, we were one of the first member states to offer our support and solidarity in that regard. We are working to ensure that all of these measures are put in place and that we accept our fair share of the burden. I do not mean that people are burdens, but refer to the process. We are also providing financial and other support wherever we can. The question of militarisation was also raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> The budget has only been discussed and a proposal has been made of €896 million for the proposed MFF. The very first discussion of the overall individual issues took place only last week in a meeting with Commissioner Oettinger and as such discussions are at a very early stage. The Government has stated consistently that while we support the need for newer funding avenues, the older, traditional measures must remain. CAP, research and innovation funding and cohesion funding must be also supported. While an initial figure has been put out there, we are at only the very early stages of negotiations.</p>

          <p eId="para_665">I also welcome what the Minister of State said about the multi-annual framework and the need to protect the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, in particular. Some reform of CAP is needed, but the policy is of major importance to Ireland and we should do everything possible to protect the payments under CAP.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> I have a question about PESCO. I understand we are participating in two projects. There is a need to report back to the House regularly on this and maybe to put a formal mechanism in place because there was a great deal of concern about joining PESCO when the vote was taken in the Dáil. It is not necessary to go into the detail of the two projects, but how would the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, feel about putting a mechanism in place to report to the House on our participation in these projects and the contemplation on participation in further projects?</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> The elephant in the room is the major trade dispute with the US, and it would seem that President Trump is threatening the multilateral world order. It would seem also that the EU is very much on its own in respect of many issues because of the changed policy in the USA. There is a major trade dispute under way. Was there much talk about that at the European Council meeting? Are the Heads of Government concerned about that? Is there a danger that these tariffs will be extended to agricultural products? That would be a real concern for us in Ireland and the EU generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> The eurozone reform is being driven by France and Germany in particular. There has been a suggestion that a eurozone budget will be created and other proposals arising from that. Does the Minister of State agree that Ireland would be cool towards these proposals? These discussions are under way. We would need to be careful in respect of these proposals if we are to bring the citizens along with us in support of any measures along these lines.</p>

          <from>Deputy Helen McEntee<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_669">I thank the Deputy for his comments and questions. First, in terms of enlargement, Ireland has been consistently a supporter of the enlargement process, something which would have transcended Governments, given how it has transformed itself significantly through membership of the European Union over the past 45 years. There are three states, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro in the official accession process, and significant progress is being made in a number of the chapters in each country. There is still a significant way to go. I was glad to see that at the summit earlier this year timelines of 2025 were given for those countries to join. We need to work with and encourage them. Certainly in visiting them I got a sense that if we as the European Union do not engage with them, other larger powerful forces will. We need to continue to engage.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> We are also talking about the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. We had a lengthy and somewhat difficult discussion at the General Affairs Council last Tuesday where a number of member states had concerns that to open up the process to these two states would not be the right course given that they felt the states did not make enough progress in other key areas of reform. I was glad to see that agreement was reached. It was an important step in showing a European front, that we are open to this process and that we want possible member states to work with us to aim to become part of the European Union. It was a good signal to agree an overall framework to move forward. The two countries have not yet progressed as far as is possible. We need to keep negotiations and the process with Turkey open while, given the challenges we face, not moving it forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> In terms of the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, I stress Ireland's priority is to ensure that our traditional forms of funding are maintained in terms of CAP, Cohesion, research and innovation, but we understand there are newer issues that need to be addressed. We will have much discussion about that in the months, and possibly years, to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> The trade dispute was discussed but, as far as I am aware, it was not a significant item on the agenda. With the Council, there was a considerable agenda. From an Irish point of view, we do not want to see this escalate any further. The imposition of the counter-tariffs has taken it to the next stage, but we would hope that we would be able to reach an agreement and a settlement. The Commission is working on this. We have made clear our position that we want this to be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> Eurozone reform is a topic that we thought would be opened up for much lengthier discussions last week. In the end, it was not. Ireland is clear in that our focus is on completing the Single Market, particularly in the area of services, the banking union and the capital markets union. Any proposed reforms that would require a referendum or change in those terms is not something that is a priority for us at present and not a direction that we are keen to go, but we are open to any proposed suggestions that may be put to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> In terms of PESCO, I am sure there would not be any issue with these projects being raised on the floor of the House, although the Business Committee would have to find space for a mechanism through which to do that. The Minister for Defence would have to agree to it but I see no reason that could not happen. Our projects are very much focused on collaboration and peacekeeping, in particular, in terms of maritime surveillance. I saw a comment last week that throughout our entire membership of the European Union there has not been a day where we have not had peacekeepers working somewhere throughout the world. This is where we want to focus all of our efforts through our membership of PESCO.</p>

          <p eId="para_676">As the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, outlined, the European Council considered a number of important issues on Thursday and Friday last. Meeting in three different formats, leaders discussed migration, security and defence, jobs, growth and competitiveness, digital innovation, external relations, economic and monetary union as well as, of course, Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> While Brexit remains the priority of the Government, migration, which is of concern to many partners, was an important focus of the meeting. As the Taoiseach outlined, although we are less directly affected than other member states, we have played a constructive role in the EU response to migration. In advance of the meeting on Thursday, the Taoiseach confirmed that Ireland is to take in migrants from the <i>MV Lifeline</i>. He also announced a significant increase in our contribution to the EU Trust Fund for Africa, bringing it from €6 million to €15 million, as the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, highlighted, and the third highest contribution <i>per capita</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> The European Council called for substantial socio-economic transformation of the African continent so that the people are less likely to attempt dangerous journeys to try to get to Europe. This was especially welcome from our perspective, as the Taoiseach stressed. The EU needs to develop a close partnership with Africa to help build up institutions, improve security and provide economic opportunity there so that many people can enjoy better prospects in their home countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> Much of the focus of the discussions last week was on strengthening external border controls, including through bolstering resources for Frontex and addressing the internal management of the Schengen area. While Ireland is not a member of Schengen, we co-operate in many areas and seek to be helpful where we can. As there was no major breakthrough in terms of reform of the common European asylum system, leaders agreed on the need to find a speedy solution to the package and they will review this again at their meeting in October.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> The discussions on security and defence provided a welcome opportunity to review progress across a number of fronts, including permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, military mobility, co-operation with NATO and strengthening the civilian Common Security and Defence Policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> Ireland is a founder member of PESCO and we are participating in two projects: a centre of excellence for EU military training missions and the upgrade of maritime surveillance systems. This in no way affects our policy of military neutrality and we will continue to make our distinctive contribution based on our own traditions and strengths.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> Leaders also considered a number of issues relating to jobs, growth and competitiveness. There was strong support for the Commission's proposed response to the US steel and aluminium tariffs. Ireland fully subscribes to the EU view that these tariffs are unjustified and in conflict with WTO rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> There was a relatively short discussion on digital taxation, with more time devoted to effective VAT collection issues. Ireland supports the position that all companies should pay their taxes. We need an approach, however, that is global, evidence-based, sustainable and focused on aligning taxing rights with the location of real substantive value-creating activity. It was positive that Ireland's position was acknowledged in the European Council conclusions, which emphasised support for the ongoing OECD work in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">We will engage positively as we always do. We were cautious about rushing to take short-term measures which can have unintended consequences. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, spoke in some detail about the discussions on the multi-annual financial framework. From Ireland's perspective, we are open to spending more if it adds European value provided our core priorities, particularly the Common Agricultural Policy and cohesion funding, are protected. As the Taoiseach outlined, leaders agreed at the euro summit that the European Stability Mechanism should provide the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund and that preparations should begin for negotiations on a European deposit insurance scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> As Deputies are aware, the European Council meeting on Article 50 format adopted a set of conclusions on the Brexit negotiations. Leaders expressed disappointment at the lack of progress on the withdrawal agreement and called for intensified negotiations. As the Taoiseach stated, the United Kingdom gave clear commitments in December and again in March and we need to see detailed, workable proposals from the UK to deliver on these commitments. The EU 27 leaders agreed that if we do not get agreement on the backstop and the other outstanding elements, it will not be possible to finalise the withdrawal agreement as a whole, including the transitional arrangements. While we are hopeful that we will achieve a very close, comprehensive and ambitious future relationship with the United Kingdom, the Government is continuing to plan for the full range of scenarios and the EU 27 leaders agreed that we should all step up our work in this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_687">I am pleased to raise this critically important and urgent issue. If a society is measured by how well it looks after the most vulnerable, and if there is to be a degree of compassion in our country so that we can deliver a fair society, we must bring about dramatic improvements in this area. The waiting times for an assessment for autism in Cork are a disgrace and a scandal. The HSE has given me the latest waiting times and the figure for St. Joseph's Foundation is 18 months, for the Cope Foundation it is 25 months and for the Brothers of Charity it is 28 months. It is not the fault of the service providers in question as they can only do what they can with the resources they are given.</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> I recently raised an individual case of a young girl who is just short of three years of age. She joined the list in January 2018 and she has been told she is likely to get her assessment after 28 months, in May 2020. The lack of a public diagnosis can have very serious implications. Where is the early intervention for children who are facing these waiting lists? Some schools in Cork have a policy whereby they do not accept a child on the waiting list to attend the special school, or a unit in the school, in the absence of a public diagnosis. Some parents pay for a private assessment to be done and can thereby access domiciliary care, home tuition and the incapacitated child tax credit. Not everyone can afford a private assessment, but even if they can, many children cannot access appropriate education without a public assessment and diagnosis.</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> This is a priority and the way these children and their families are being treated is a scandal. I hope there will be a radical intervention to make a tangible difference.</p>

            <from>Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_690">What steps is the Minister of State taking to address the disgraceful situation whereby the waiting time for an autism spectrum disorder assessment for children in Cork city and county, many of whom are in my constituency of Cork South-West, can take up to 28 months? The Minister is aware that children with disabilities are legally entitled to an assessment of need under the Disability Act 2005. Moreover, assessments should commence within three months of an application being received and completed within a further three months. I am aware of the roll-out of the new standard operating procedure and note the concerns about this raised by various stakeholders at the Committee on Health last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_691"> More than 1,150 children in Cork are waiting on stage 2 of the assessment of needs process. These children are waiting for clinical assessments to be completed and roughly 900 have been referred for an autism spectrum disorder assessment. Many of these will wait up to 28 months for an ASD assessment. Why has Cork got such a large waiting list? Why has Cork been left waiting so long? Behind these figures are human beings, parents and siblings, people who are waiting for an official diagnosis to be able to plan a future for their family.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Finian McGrath)<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_692">I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue today. There have been significant year-on-year increases in the number of children applying for assessment, including for autism spectrum disorder and for disability services generally, which has led to delays in timeframes. The clinical picture of autism is complex and variable because of differences in the severity of autism itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_693"> In the 12 months prior to October 2017, Cork-Kerry community healthcare had received a total of 1,110 referrals for assessment under the Disability Act. In January 2017, approximately 808 applicants were waiting to move from stage 1, the assessment officer stage, to stage 2, the clinical assessment. I understand that a number of initiatives had been put in place in Cork-Kerry community healthcare, including recruitment of additional administration staff and additional assessment officers to screen applications. By October 2017, the waiting list had reduced to 137. The backlog has now been cleared and all assessment of need applications are commenced within a month. There are, however, a very high volume of applications coming through for assessment of need in Cork, with upwards of 100 applications being received per month.</p>
            <p eId="para_694"> At the end of April 2018, there were 1,150 children awaiting stage 2 clinical assessment as part of the assessment of need process in Cork. Approximately 800 of these cases have been referred for an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, assessment. The Cork-Kerry community healthcare organisation recognises the long waiting times for clinical assessments within the current assessment of need process, and a pilot project has commenced with the South Lee ASD team to look at reducing the time taken to undertake an ASD assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> In an effort to standardise assessment of need procedures and to facilitate timely assessments, the HSE identified a requirement to develop a standard operating procedure, SOP. This SOP is intended to replace the suite of approximately 50 guidance notes that have been issued since 2007 and will define the assessment. It will ensure a standardised approach across the State in respect of the operational application of the Disability Act 2005 and provide an important opportunity to balance and ensure equity in terms of assessment and support interventions for vulnerable children and young people with a disability. The HSE recognises that early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are paramount and need to be improved and organised more effectively. This process is well under way nationwide.</p>

            <p eId="para_696">I hope the Minister really gets this issue. The intervention to deal with this will have to be radical because it is a sick joke that children have to wait 28 months for an assessment for autism while they go from aged two to aged almost five. It cannot be tolerated.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">There is much talk about the confidence and supply agreement and the Taoiseach says he wants to extend the agreement and enter negotiations. One part of the agreement calls for improved services and increased supports for people with disabilities, particularly for early assessment and intervention for children with special needs. Given that this has not happened, before the Taoiseach comes knocking, looking for more time and an extension of the agreement, he needs to deliver. This is one issue on which we will not accept failure. It must be delivered.</p>

            <p eId="para_698">I am glad the Minister of State accepted that the waiting lists are increasing but acceptance is not good enough. At this stage we need strong and fast action. Early intervention is of the utmost importance. It must be remembered that even after a diagnosis these children will face long waiting lists for therapies. The assessment of need must be worked on. Combined, the waiting lists for assessment and therapies make early intervention almost impossible. A diagnosis is required for many schools throughout Cork and to achieve this, the Minister of State must take action and hire more staff.</p>

            <p eId="para_699">I assure Deputies Michael McGrath and Murphy O'Mahony that I get the point and accept they have a particular issue. We have a national issue but I also understand there is a particular issue with services in Cork. I acknowledge that we have to take action on disability services. However, the disability service is already engaged in a major reconfiguration of existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multidisciplinary geographical based teams as part of its national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people aged up to 18 years. It is also anticipated that the combined efforts being undertaken by Cork-Kerry community healthcare and the HSE nationally relating to the assessment of needs process and progress on disabilities will have a significant positive impact on the waiting lists as we progress through 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_700"> The Deputies asked me what I have been doing. I have been in regular contact with officials in the HSE on this issue. Last Monday afternoon, I sat down with the HSE and Department of Health. That was among my six priority issues. I have discussed this previously with both Deputies.</p>
            <p eId="para_701"> I appreciate the Deputies' support on this issue when it comes to the broader political issue in terms of the confidence and supply agreement. I am putting people with disabilities and similar issues at the top of the agenda and I welcome the Deputies' support, which is needed. I will continue to be in regular contact with HSE officials on this issue to ensure this remains the case. People with disabilities cannot be left behind and I will accept my responsibility in that regard. I appreciate any support on this issue because a debate is taking place on whether we should have tax cuts or investment in services. From my point of view, I favour the latter and, in the context of this debate, services for children with disabilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_702">I welcome to the Gallery the sole survivor of the Miami Showband massacre and the brother of the three young Reavey brothers who were shot dead in a sectarian attack. They are here because they head up a group known as the Truth and Reconciliation Platform. To my knowledge, the only real condemnation of the appointment of Drew Harris as Garda Commissioner was made by Stephen Travers who survived the Miami Showband massacre. Mr. Travers condemned the appointment for all the right reasons and we all heard him on "Morning Ireland" outline those reasons. I am shocked by the silence in this House about this appointment. I lived through the Troubles and, as a young woman from a republican family, I witnessed the distress of families who were victims of sectarian attacks, from both sides. This group represents families, victims and survivors from both sides and should be commended on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_703"> The appointment of Drew Harris as Garda Commissioner is like sticking a knife in their back. Mr. Harris has a record of blocking truth for the truth and reconciliation process that is needed to achieve closure on many issues in the North. I refer to what was said about him by a Belfast judge, Mr. Justice Treacy, in 2010 when he accused Mr. Harris of an extreme abuse of power in closing down the Historical Enquiries Team, removing its budget and powers. In doing so, he make clear that the state was not genuinely committed to addressing the concerns of the families, survivors and victims.</p>
            <p eId="para_704"> When one has a conversation with survivors, families and victims one realises that for many years they have been blocked from finding the truth. The Minister should think about that. How would he feel if his son, brother or someone else close to him was killed and he wanted to know who killed him and why and how he was killed? As the Minister will be aware, the collusion of the British and Northern Ireland state in these killings is common knowledge and a Belfast court has ordered an investigation into the matter. We have been trying to achieve a similar investigation into state collusion in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. The survivors and relatives of the victims of the Miami Showband massacre are taking a case to court. We know there are major question marks surrounding the involvement of Drew Harris in the blocking of information to these families. </p>
            <p eId="para_705"> I have a simple question for the Minister. Could he envisage a scenario in which the Garda Commissioner, namely, Drew Harris, is arrested and taken North to attend a trial that the survivors and families of the Miami Showband massacre manage to secure and give evidence on why he blocked the release of at least two files that pertain to what was known as the Glenanne gang? This group colluded with British MI5 forces to carry out at least 89 sectarian murders. How would the Minister, as a member of the Cabinet and Government, feel if the Garda Commissioner, who he so proudly appointed to do such a great job, was arrested on the ground that he blocked justice being delivered to the families, relatives and survivors of these horrendous sectarian murders? That is a possibility in the future and I would like the Minister to address it because that is what is at stake with this appointment. Put to one side the hurt and the stab in the back to the families and victims of collusion, who need closure, how does this appointment compromise the State, the Minister's office and the role of the Garda Commissioner potentially in the future?</p>

            <p eId="para_706">I want to acknowledge the hurt, loss and sense of suffering on the part of all victims of the Troubles in Northern Ireland and on the island of Ireland over the years. I also want to acknowledge the broad welcome the appointment of Mr. Drew Harris as Garda Commissioner has received. This is the first occasion upon which the independent Policing Authority has recommended a candidate to Government, following a rigorous selection process conducted by the Public Appointments Service on its behalf. A great deal of work went into ensuring that the widest possible field of qualified candidates put themselves forward. I welcome the successful conclusion following the recent decision by the Government to appoint Mr. Drew Harris as the next Garda Commissioner.</p>
            <p eId="para_707"> As a well-respected Belfast-based newspaper stated during the week, Mr. Drew Harris is not an outsider, he is a policeman, he is an Ulsterman and he is an Irishman. He has defended the institutions of democracy and rule of law all his life. His father was murdered by terrorists with a political agenda in breach of democracy and rule of law. As Garda Commissioner, Mr. Harris will have the full functions of that role, including safeguarding the security of the State. On taking up office in September, he will, like all entrants to An Garda Síochána, make a solemn declaration, under section 16 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the State. The incoming Commissioner is a person of huge ability and the highest integrity. I know he has enormous respect for and knowledge of An Garda Síochána, having worked with members of the organisation as close colleagues over the course of his career.</p>
            <p eId="para_708"> As I have said, this is the first occasion the independent Policing Authority has exercised its function in regard to the filling of this important position.</p>
            <p eId="para_709"> All those who put themselves forward were subject to robust scrutiny by an independent expert interview board which determined that Mr. Harris was the best person for the office. lt is only right and fair to give him the opportunity to be judged based on his performance in his new role, which he will take up at a time of major reform and investment that will redefine An Garda Síochána as an organisation. In addition, the start of his tenure will coincide with publication of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland which will chart a new course for policing in the decades ahead. I am confident that Mr. Harris has the necessary ability and vital policing, security and change management experience required to lead An Garda Síochána at this critical time. He will bring his talents to the challenge of transforming An Garda Síochána in order that it will become a model of policing excellence, equipped to deal with the huge range of challenges such as those facing police services worldwide. He can be assured of my support and that of the Government and most members of the House in his endeavours.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> I am sure the Deputy will agree that dealing with the legacy of the Troubles on the island is a complex and sensitive task, one to which there are no easy solutions. In my previous role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade I spent a great deal of time working with the main parties in Northern Ireland and the British Government to identify ways to address the legacy issues that continue to hold back politics in the North. In 2014 we, collectively, agreed a framework of measures in the Stormont House Agreement. The Garda authorities will continue to co-operate with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in all relevant criminal investigations, be they historical or contemporary, in accordance with the arrangements in place. Regrettably, the political impasse in the Northern Ireland Executive has delayed the roll-out of these measures under the Stormont House Agreement. With the Tánaiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Taoiseach, I will work hard to seek the re-establishment of the Executive for the benefit of all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> On the issue of unresolved and Troubles-related criminal investigations in this jurisdiction, the Garda authorities will fully pursue any new evidence or information that comes to light, with a view to bringing the perpetrators of crimes to justice. </p>
            <p eId="para_712"> My Government colleagues and I look forward to working with Mr. Harris as he takes up this exciting, not to say challenging role, in which we wish him every success.</p>

            <p eId="para_713">As usual, I did not get the answer to the question asked. I have got used to not really expecting answers to really difficult questions. I believe, however, that the Minister may have given this issue some consideration. If he did not, he should have. He started his statement by referring to the rigorous selection process that had reached the decision to appoint Mr. Drew Harris. He must have thought about the possibility that in the future a person who had blocked information going to the families and survivors might possibly be arrested and brought before the courts in the North of Ireland and face a demand to give evidence there. If he has not considered this possibility, the process was not rigorous. Having blocked for six years the issuing of files to families, last August Mr. Harris was ordered to hand them over within 12 weeks. Last week the families received some of them. I do not know exactly how many they received, but two were held back. They relate to the Glenanne gang and a person known as the "Jackal". He refused to hand them over. The refusal to hand them over could be the subject of a court case. Is it right that a court should have to order the head of the PSNI, formerly the RUC, to hand over files within 12 weeks and that almost one year later he had only just about handed them over? I ask the Minister to picture the families who have waited six years for files and all of their lives for justice. At the end of July it will be 43 years since the Miami Showband massacre. The families have been denied access to the files by the State and now they will see a situation where a person who was the head of the PSNI will be the Garda Commissioner with access to files on their loved ones, files which they cannot access. Is that fair or just? Is it the justice the Minister wants to present?</p>
            <p eId="para_714"> On 31 July we will, sadly, commemorate the slaughter of the members of the Miami Showband. On behalf of the survivors, I ask the Minister and the Garda Commissioner to join us at the commemoration to meet the families and have this discussion with them. It will take place in Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_717">Neither I nor the Government will delay the appointment of Mr. Drew Harris. The appointment of a new Garda Commissioner is always significant, but it is particularly so with the appointment of Mr. Harris, the first person from outside the jurisdiction to be appointed to the position since the establishment of An Garda Síochána almost 100 years ago. The new Commissioner is a person of huge ability and the highest integrity. He worked in the PSNI throughout its transformation following the peace process. I am sure that experience will help him greatly in his new role as Garda Commissioner. Co-operation between the PSNI and An Garda Síochána has never been as good and this appointment will serve to cement that relationship even further.</p>
            <p eId="para_718"> As we approach the centenary of the establishment of An Garda Síochána, the organisation is on the cusp of significant change. The expert Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is in the final stages of its work and its report will chart a new model for policing in the decades ahead. The new Commissioner will take up his post at this critical time. I look forward to the Deputy's contribution, with that of every other Member in the House, in ensuring the institutional framework agreed under the Stormont House Agreement can be established at the earliest opportunity to deal with the issue as raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_719"> I offer my condolences to all those involved, especially those affected by the brutal massacre to which the Deputy referred. I will not comment, however, on any court decision in Northern Ireland, no more than I would comment on any court decision here.</p>

            <p eId="para_724">I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his office for affording me the opportunity to raise once again this very important issue. I want to discuss the impact on the town of Naas of the stalling of the town centre development. It was thought up some years ago as a flagship development that would attract a major anchor tenant that would, in turn, attract footfall which would be of huge and dramatic importance in the development of the town and the resurgence of commerce and the business sector in the area. Unfortunately, owing to circumstances that affected many parts of the country at the time, the development ceased and the company is now in receivership. Since 2008 there have been numerous attempts to bring it back into focus, but it has not yet happened. Every time someone inquires about it, there are various responses, as the Acting Chairman will be aware. We hear such responses as a breakthrough is about to be achieved, or that there are very positive things happening, or that they know where they are going and need the right sequence of measures to be put in place, but whatever has happened until now it is not enough. We have had the excuses which have come from all quarters. The fact is that the town has been blighted by the development that has not proceeded. There is symbolism in the cranes that have been immobile for ten years. No matter what way the town is approached, the first things that can be seen are the cranes. </p>
            <p eId="para_725"> I have had discussions with various people who have been involved in various proposals. I have also raised the matter in the House on several occasions and hope I will not have to raise it again. I thank the Minister of State for coming into the Chamber to address this Topical Issue. This is a crucial time. We either make a breakthrough now or it will not happen at all.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">I have made approaches to the arbitration authorities in an effort to apply pressure and get something done in the shortest possible time. I have been in touch with the local authority, as has everyone else. I have been in touch with the Minister, the Minister of State and their offices. There is little else I can do other than launch myself into space as a symbol of protest at this situation having remained immobile for so long.</p>
            <p eId="para_727"> Suffice it to say, there is still time to make a positive intervention. I am not blaming the Minister or his predecessors, but it is unacceptable that a business element in a major provincial town would be stalled in this fashion for ten years. Naas is well known throughout the country as being a market town and has always had a great reputation, as have its business people, and it has always enjoyed significant employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_728"> There needs to be a return of footfall to the town centre. Various developments have tended to draw the commercial sector outside the town. If that is allowed to continue, there will be more serious consequences and public confidence in the town will fail. So will confidence among business people, who invest their money in the town's businesses. It will all be to no avail unless something dramatic is done.</p>
            <p eId="para_729"> Will the Minister of State examine the issues and contact the parties involved with a view to bringing them together and knocking heads together, if necessary, in order to kick-start what has to happen sooner or later?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy John Paul Phelan)<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_730">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which I am taking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. As someone who is familiar with Naas, I know the cranes to which Deputy Durkan referred. Sadly, there will not be much news in the response that I must give him.</p>
            <p eId="para_731"> I recognise and appreciate that the Deputy is eager, to say the least, to see this particular matter brought to a satisfactory resolution. As indicated in previous parliamentary responses on the issue, however, the management of the stalled development in Naas is primarily a matter for Kildare County Council in the first instance. With processes under way involving NAMA and arbitration, it would be inappropriate for the Minister to become involved. It would not be proper for the Minister with responsibility for planning matters to make representations on this issue because, under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, he is precluded from exercising any power or control in respect of any case with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be involved, except in very specific and extreme circumstances, which do not appear to apply in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_732"> The Deputy will be aware that the hearing of evidence in the High Court in regard to a land title issue on Corban's Lane was completed on 14 June and that the relevant judgment is awaited. Consequently, the arbitration hearing cannot recommence until the High Court land title case is resolved and the judgment issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_733"> I am informed that Kildare County Council continues to engage in advanced discussions with NAMA and the receivers in an attempt to ensure that a satisfactory sale of the site in question will come about. The council has confirmed to the Department that it will brief all relevant Oireachtas and municipal district members as soon as there is progress to report.</p>
            <p eId="para_734"> As the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy English, have outlined, and subject to a satisfactory planning approval, there is no impediment to the appropriate development of the site. Kildare County Council recognises the strategic importance of the site and will continue to support and work in partnership with any stakeholder involved. In recent years, the council has initiated and supported a number of projects with the strategic objective of ensuring that the social and economic development of Naas is protected and enhanced. This work is underpinned by the work of the Naas roads and transport steering group, the URBACT group and the Naas regeneration group. Kildare County Council has also received approval from the National Transport Authority to prepare a traffic management study for Naas which will form one element of a strategic social and economic plan for the town.</p>
            <p eId="para_735"> While I am sure the Deputy is frustrated by the length of time it is taking to get the matter resolved, I know that the local authority is doing all it can within the parameters of its role. We must recognise the due processes that are necessary given the receivership issues that arise in this case, but I am hopeful that there will be further progress to resolve the matter and facilitate the development of this strategic town centre site.</p>
            <p eId="para_736"> This is the first time I have been asked a question on the issue. While we are precluded ministerially from getting directly involved in the planning affairs of local authorities when planning matters are before them, I am not precluded from inquiring of Kildare County Council about the current position. In light of the Deputy's interest, as well as my own, in the development of Naas town, I would have no problem with ascertaining that information.</p>

            <p eId="para_739">-----a major business centre in the province. Sadly, people's confidence in the marketing impact of Naas is beginning to wane. The Minister of State identified the reason, namely, the ten years. Who wants to wait ten years for statutory processes to conclude? If we have to wait ten years for people to make their minds up about something, it is time to ask questions. We have had to ask questions about a number of planning and development issues that have arisen across the country in recent times, although I will not go into individual cases now. The Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Rourke, knows as well as I do that if it takes so long to make a decision on a simple matter, I hate to think what would happen were we ever faced with a very difficult issue to resolve.</p>
            <p eId="para_740"> I accept the Minister of State's bona fides on this. While a Minister cannot directly involve himself or herself in a planning application, he or she has the right to find out what is happening, why it has been delayed, what the rate of progress has been annually in the past ten years, what rate is expected in the next ten years and how much longer we must await the outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_741"> I have pursued this matter every which way. I have spoken down the years to every party involved. I have raised it in the House and received ministerial responses. It is unfair to Deputies and the Minister that we must continue waiting in this fashion for a simple answer to a simple issue that has been ongoing for such a long time. It is the old story of ransom strips. We cannot afford ransom strips. Incidentally, the people who feel offended may be right, but we are entitled to a decision. We cannot go on forever. We deserve a response to a matter of this nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_742"> The Minister of State could have a serious impact on this issue. It would be to the benefit of the area and public representatives everywhere who want to see progress when progress is demanded and required.</p>

I am familiar with the site and the lack of activity thereon, but I am not as familiar as the Deputy or the Acting Chairman with the ins and outs of what is happening. The arbitration process is stalled pending the court's verdict on the case that concluded on 14 June. However, ascertaining information from the council is my job, and I have no difficulty with getting that information for Members.</p>

            <p eId="para_745">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, for taking time out of his busy schedule. We are all busy.</p>
            <p eId="para_746"> This issue has been ongoing for more than ten years but has now come to the fore. The River Blackwater is of considerable benefit, not just financially but also in terms of amenities, in Fermoy. The Blackwater runs down to the estuary in Youghal. The first of the two major issues involved is that the weir is falling apart. Water levels have dropped dramatically. We have very warm weather at the moment, but the levels are still probably 3 ft lower than they would be normally.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">The weir falling apart will have a detrimental effect on the migrating salmon, and the Blackwater is famous for salmon fishing.</p>
            <p eId="para_748"> We have a very old rowing club based on one side of the weir. It dates back to the 1800s. Rowers from this club have rowed in the Olympics. They will lose their sports club. The weir dates back more than 200 years but it has come to a point where this will have a huge effect. It is affecting people's lives within Fermoy and the general area from Fermoy to Youghal. In late April, hundreds of people demonstrated on the bridge in Fermoy to try to get something done and to call on the Government to act on this before it is too late. Unfortunately, we feel that it is a bit too late, but better late than never. Cork County Council has accepted that the weir is in need of repair but said it is a funding issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_749"> The biggest worry here is the economic impact, the tourism impact and the impact on sport. It will be lost forever. We are trying to promote sports, tourism and so on and I keep saying that, every time we seem to sweep down in certain areas of east Cork, we feel like we are being left behind. If we lose the weir, we will lose massive sporting recreation and fishing amenities. We will lose probably ten sports clubs, such as aqua clubs. When that is gone, it will be gone forever and we will be calling it "Ireland's Ancient Eastish". It will be missing a piece again. It will not move up the map. I appeal to the Minister of State to meet the campaign group and members in Fermoy. The local people have the best local knowledge.</p>
            <p eId="para_750"> It is bigger than our history of waterways, fishing, sport and the pride and beauty that we have in this country. The important thing is that we will lose a vital piece of our heritage in east Cork, predominantly in Fermoy, and everything that goes with it. It would be shameful to miss the opportunity and look back in years to come and be so regretful. One of the natural beauties that we have is that estuary and the River Blackwater. I encourage the Minister of State to go down and look over the bridge. I took photographs and will show them to him afterwards. It is vital to everything that happens inside Fermoy. If we lose this weir, I am afraid that so many people will be affected by this economically, in sport, in tourism and so on, that it will fall apart and we will end up with "Ireland's Ancient Eastish", as they call it.</p>

            <p eId="para_751">I thank Deputy Buckley for submitting this Topical Issue matter. I acknowledge its importance. In recent weeks I have had conversations with all his colleagues in the constituency. The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and Deputies Kevin O'Keeffe and Sean Sherlock have brought it to my attention. I thank the Deputy for raising the important issue in the Dáil and giving the opportunity to put it on record.</p>
            <p eId="para_752"> Cork County Council is the owner of the weir in Fermoy, as the Deputy pointed out, and is the authority responsible for carrying out any works to the weir. Local authorities are under the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. My Department and its State agency, Inland Fisheries Ireland, are responsible for the protection, management and conservation of Ireland's inland fisheries and sea angling resources. The council has advised that both a project to ensure a permanent solution to fish passage and a project to ensure temporary repairs while the permanent solution is awaited are required. There has been ongoing liaison between my Department, Inland Fisheries Ireland and Cork County Council to advise how any proposed works can be consistent with fisheries and environmental obligations, particularly the EU Habitats Directive. Compliance with the directive is the key issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_753"> The engineering advisers of the council and Department have agreed the essential details of the permanent proposals. A number of options were considered by the engineering advisers and the primary consideration in agreeing the proposals was that they meet the requirements of the EU Habitats Directive. This is especially important for the free passage of wild salmon, a species included in the directive. The IFI regional director and senior officials of the Department met the council on Wednesday, 29 November 2017. The council advised that it is engaged in land acquisition to facilitate the permanent works. This is a matter for the council and, in the meantime, the Department has agreed to the council's temporary repair proposals for the weir. At the November meeting, Department officials requested an indicative timeline on the council's proposals for the permanent and temporary works. An update on this is awaited, following which the senior officials will again meet the council.</p>
            <p eId="para_754"> Funding of the works is entirely a matter for the council as the owners of the weir infrastructure. The Department and IFI have undertaken, however, to support any bid the council makes for central funding in the context of fisheries and habitat issues. The local authority is the owner. That is not to say that we would not support whatever call it would make to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for funding. As indicated in my response, the council has not responded to the request by officials from November of last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_755"> I have no problem in visiting Fermoy, making it my business or meeting the four Deputies or a group at some stage. I ask that the Minister of State and Deputies in the council go back to Cork County Council and ask it what it has done since November to progress this. Has it acquired land? Has it a design? Is it engaging consultants with regard to planning permission? Is it moving forward with a plan and costing that we can go to Government with? That is important. There is a valid case. Everyone accepts that work needs to be done but Cork County Council, as the owner, has to make the progress and present a case, together with the Deputies or such, and meet the relevant Ministers about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_756"> There is a bit of history in this with regard to proposals that the Office of Public Works, OPW, had to assist in this, going back to 2008 and 2010. There were a number of objections. There were plans to include it in the OPW contract for the Fermoy north flood relief summer scheme works in 2008. As a result, there were protests, and the then Minister of State, Conor Lenihan, agreed to a deferral of the planned works for a period to allow the council to carry out repair works to the fish pass and weir and some repair works on the weir. I understand there were extra plans in 2010. The OPW agreed to include weir works in the tender documents of the Fermoy south flood relief scheme, which was the remaining element of the overall flood relief scheme. No agreement was ever reached by the council on the rock ramp, however, and the works were not carried out. Opportunities were presented to Cork County Council at the time. There may have been funding issues etc. in that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_757"> I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. It is important. I ask that he go back to Cork County Council and let it update our officials about where it is with its plans to bring it along in design and planning.</p>

            <p eId="para_758">I thank the Minister of State for his honesty and his in-depth answer. It seems to be a bit endemic in certain areas that some people are, unfortunately, not doing their jobs and others are trying harder. Going back to the issue of funding, the Minister of State mentioned that Cork County Council may have problems with funding. It comes from the central Government funding too. There has to be a bit of cohesion. It is not just the weir or river. It also has economic, tourism and sports impacts. There was the regatta there just a couple of weeks ago. A total of 212 races were held on that river. One can imagine the social impact it has and the positive mental health impact. It is a win-win.</p>
            <p eId="para_759"> I am very pleased with the in-depth answer because we are sometimes not told everything and I was not aware that somebody on the other side might not be pushing the boat - pardon the pun - far enough. I thank the Minister of State for that answer. I will raise it with Cork County Council as soon as I get out of the Chamber this evening. I will certainly tell the Minister of State, if he does not mind, and keep him updated. I appreciate his honesty.</p>

            <p eId="para_760">As the Deputy is no doubt aware, a by-law was recently signed relating to catch and release and fly fishing only, downstream from the weir, within 10 m. Seven signs have been erected to notify the public of the new by-law. These were erected yesterday. Staff are monitoring daily all activity relating to the Fermoy weir, both with regard to water levels and angler presence. Fish stocks are under stress with the low water levels and high temperatures of water. We are told that there is a satisfactory flow of water going over the weir at one of the breaches in the south bank of the weir in the proximity of the mill race. IFI is confident that, at present, the situation is okay in the event of any fish running or migrating upriver. I was presented with some photographs taken today, showing that there is sufficient water for fish to get up. The consensus is that if fish were to arrive now that temperatures have dropped slightly, passage across the weir in Fermoy would be possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_761"> This is something that came from the local angling community. It wanted a by-law because it was felt salmon stocks were under threat and we were happy to be able to ensure it was enacted. I understand and accept the importance of the weir to the town in terms of tourism, angling and flood prevention. It is important that the project would be progressed in whatever way possible. When Cork County Council presents a definite plan to the Department I would be happy for officials to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on funding and I will possibly do so also. It is important that Deputy Buckley and the other local Deputies and Ministers engage with Cork County Council. It may be the case that matters have progressed further than I am aware of at this moment. I understand the council was in discussions on land acquisition and perhaps it has now acquired the land. It is important that the design and planning information is presented to my officials in order to progress the matter further.</p>

          <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_776">The terms of this motion are self explanatory. I must say at the outset that I am absolutely flabbergasted and appalled at the Government's refusal to accept the motion and, in addition, at the tone and content of the countermotion. We are seeking justice, humanity and compassion for people who have suffered over many years due to circumstances entirely outside of their control. All we are getting in the countermotion is the same old cant, legalese and jargon to which we have already been treated.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> The Minister will be aware that reparation has been made for the victims of abuse in residential institutions. I do not say it to belittle them in any way, but the abuse many of those victims suffered is less than the abuse we are talking about here tonight. However, the Government's attitude to people who were abused in primary schools by teachers who were members of religious orders is markedly different from their approach to the victims in residential institutions. The attitude of the Government to the people on whose behalf we are speaking tonight seems to be coldly adversarial, determinedly so. If the Government has learnt anything from the recent cervical cancer scandal, it will surely realise at this late stage, that that sort of attitude to helpless victims is repugnant to the majority of the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> I have deliberately couched this motion in very narrow terms to prevent the Government using the "floodgates" argument. We are talking only about victims where the perpetrators have been convicted before the courts of this country. Since 1973, which is 45 years ago, only 72 people have been convicted. The ratio of victims to people convicted is 2.5. If we multiply 2.5 by 72, that is 182. What we are seeking to do is to allow them to enter the present redress scheme which was set up in 2015 in the wake of the Louise O'Keeffe case. If one multiplies 182 by €84,000, the maximum figure is €15 million, and that depends on everybody making a claim and on everybody getting the maximum amount and not a penny less.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> The fact of the matter is, as the Minister will be aware, Louise O'Keeffe, one of the survivors, fought a 15 year legal battle for justice. Her case was turned down by the High Court. She went to the Supreme Court where she was also turned away. An interesting thing happened on the day of the European Court of Human Rights decision in Louise O'Keeffe's case; a fulsome message of congratulations was sent by the Taoiseach, the head of Government, to Louise O'Keeffe, congratulating her on her victory. What is extraordinary about that is that the day after the Supreme Court decision, Louise O'Keeffe and all her fellow plaintiffs got a letter from the State, of which the Taoiseach is the head, threatening them that if they did not withdraw their cases forthwith they would be visited by action for costs that would literally take the roofs from over their heads. That was a naked, shameless threat from the person who then congratulated Louise O’Keeffe when undaunted she went on to the European Court of Human Rights and got a judgment to the effect that the systems in place in Irish primary schools were insufficient to protect children from that type of activity. However, even as the Government was compiling the fulsome congratulations it was planning how best to prevent people availing of the European Court of Human Rights judgment.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> The Government set up a redress compensation scheme, allegedly, to allow the victims the right to access compensation without having to go through the convoluted casino of the Irish judicial system, but it put two insurmountable barriers in their way. The first one relates to a prior complaint. That has been rubbished by every legal scholar and commentator in this country and beyond. In any case, even if everybody else is wrong and the Government is correct and prior complaint is the kernel of the Louise O'Keeffe case, there is nothing in the Louise O'Keeffe judgment that forces the Government to confine itself to cases where there was a prior complaint.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> Second, the Government insisted that people should have taken legal action within the period set out by the statute of limitations. That was despite the fact that every legal adviser in the country knew and advised those plaintiffs that there was no point in taking legal action because they had no case. If they could get over the hurdle of the need for a prior complaint, then they had to face the, arguably, larger hurdle, that they ignored the advice of their legal advisers and proceeded to take a case which they were told was a waste of time and money.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> On 22 May my colleague raised this matter with the Taoiseach and asked him why those barriers were being put in the way of this particular group of victims. The Taoiseach's response was that compensation in redress schemes was made on the basis of evidence. Deputy Martin responded that what greater evidence did he need than people who were brought before the courts and convicted. He could have added that the majority, if not all, of those perpetrators admitted the offences. What greater evidence does one need than that? The Taoiseach's response to that was that in that case it would have to be considered. He stated, "If, as the Deputy said, there is no doubt that abuse has taken place in these cases, certainly that is something we can examine. I will take the matter up with the Minister for Education and Skills soon." I take it that the Taoiseach has taken up the matter with the Minister. If the countermotion is his response, that is a poor lookout for justice, humanity and fairness in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> Let us get away from the legal distinctions for a moment and talk about the victims. As the Minister knows, they are real people. John Allen was abused at the age of nine in the famous North Monastery primary school in Cork, as he cried for his mother. Many years later when the perpetrator of that abuse, the man who ruined his life was brought before the courts of this country, John Allen went into the witness box and pleaded with the judge not to send that individual to prison, and his plea was accepted. I hope for John's sake that Shakespeare was right when, to paraphrase him, he said the giving of mercy benefits those who give as well as those who take because John Allen and his fellow survivors have got damn all mercy from this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> I have some knowledge of the life experience of those people. I will not invade their privacy by spelling out details here on the floor of the Dáil, but suffice it to say that any cursory examination as to what happened to those people in later life will show a lamentable litany of broken relationships, broken marriages, broken homes, broken dreams and broken lives. They were people who were robbed of much of the potential with which they were born through circumstances entirely outside their control. This was done as a result of the actions of teachers who were paid by the State in schools those people had to attend, because it was legally obligatory to do so, and the schools were managed by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> Some may ask whether this is about money. It is not. No amount of compensation can turn back the clock and undo the damage done to people's lives. The maximum compensation of €84,000 available from the redress board is scant and pitiable for the suffering endured by the people concerned. It is not, therefore, about money; rather, it is about the State making a tangible gesture as evidence of its good faith and an admission that a wrong was done by employees of the State while the people concerned were under its care and control. It would be evidence of its compassion and recognition in deed, as well as word.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> Many members of the Government, including the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, recently fought a referendum campaign to abolish the eighth amendment on the basis of compassion. How can one be selective when it comes to compassion? How can one have compassion for one group of victims and none for another? Which group of victims is more deserving of compassion than the people concerned who often came from deprived backgrounds, were abused as children and have suffered as a consequence for the past 20 to 30 years? A Government of any persuasion or composition which denies the victims of convicted perpetrators access to the redress board does not deserve to call itself compassionate.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> The sad thing is the suffering continues. In the words of Yeats, "Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart." The people concerned have become disillusioned, disaffected and embittered following years of evasion, half-truths, hiding behind legal niceties and fine legal distinctions, bullying and intimidation. Their suffering must stop immediately because it manifests in suicide, suicidal ideation, health or marriage breakdown and, in many cases, a descent into the darkness of depression and mental illness. On a day when Members have been told that corporation tax receipts have gone through the roof, for the paltry sum of a maximum of €15 million the Government could bring to an end the suffering of the people concerned who have suffered so much. I urge the Minister with all of the sincerity at my command to take the opportunity to do the right thing.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_391">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_788">I join my colleague, Deputy Willie O'Dea, in supporting the motion we have tabled on behalf of the survivors of child sexual abuse in primary schools. I have raised this issue in recent years with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny; the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton. I have met the Minister on several occasions to discuss this specific issue. I acknowledge that previous Governments, of which I was a member, were wrong to pursue Louise O'Keeffe all the way to the European Court of Human Rights. That court vindicated her allegations of having been a victim of child sexual abuse in Dunderrow. That should have been the end of the matter for the Oireachtas and the Government. The judgment dealt with systemic neglect in the 1970s in the absence of a proactive regime which would have protected children in general. The nub of the issue is the very narrow definition and interpretation the Government has taken of the ECHR's judgment in the Louise O'Keeffe case as it applies to other survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> We speak in the context of the shock and horror expressed in the House in respect of a range of cases, the most recent of which is the CervicalCheck scandal. The Government correctly decided that it had to quickly take various steps to help the victims of that scandal. There have been similar situations in respect of mother and baby homes and so on. I find it very difficult to comprehend the absence of genuine compassion for the survivors of child sexual abuse in primary schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> I have had detailed discussions on the matter with John Allen who has fought this campaign for nearly 17 years. He is an extraordinary, a sensitive and very intelligent gentleman who has steadfastly pursued this case, but, unfortunately, he has not been met with a compassionate response by the State. I have written letters on behalf of several women from County Tipperary who have been affected by this issue and, with Deputy Willie O'Dea, met some gentlemen from Limerick on the matter. The motion is reasonable and quite limited. I met Conor O'Mahony of the child law clinic in University College Cork who has taken up the case of the survivors and written to the independent assessor appointed by the Minister. He makes the key point that the Minister is misrepresenting the basis of liability in the O'Keeffe case by focusing on the issue of prior complaint. In his submission to the independent assessor he states: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_791">The judgment makes reference to matters of which the State “ought” to have been aware. The Minister says that this refers to the complaint. His argument is that because the State had not established a mechanism for handling complaints, it was not aware that a complaint had been made - it did not have actual knowledge of the complaint. Because the State ought to have established a mechanism for handling complaints, it ought to have been aware of the complaint, and therefore it was found to have had constructive knowledge of the complaint. It is on this basis that victims who cannot demonstrate a prior complaint are being excluded from the settlement scheme. The fundamental flaw with this argument is that it entirely misrepresents what the O’Keeffe judgment was referring to when making reference to matters that the State “ought” to have been aware of. First, it should be noted that the Court specifically found that the State had neither actual nor constructive knowledge of the complaint made in Dunderrow. Second, the violation was found in respect of the State’s failure to respond not to a specific risk in Dunderrow, but to a systemic risk that arose in the National School system as a whole, and not just in Dunderrow or other schools where a prior complaint had been made. Since the risk in question was systemic in nature, it applied in every National School and implicated every child. The duty that this placed on the State extended beyond reactive measures on foot of complaints and included proactive and preventive measures designed to prevent abuse before it occurred. The judgment in <i>O‘Keeffe</i> was based on a range of failings, including an inadequate inspection regime and a lack of direct State control of teachers. These failings all applied on a systemic level, and applied in the same way whether or not a complaint had actually been made. They were therefore common to all victims of sexual abuse in National Schools in the l960s and l970s ... By imposing a condition of prior complaint on the availability of redress, the State has shifted the onus from itself [to take proactive and preventive measures] to vulnerable children who are victims of sexual abuse [to make disclosures leading to complaints]. Moreover, not only does the onus shift to the victims to report, but to do so contemporaneously [since delayed reports in adulthood will not have been made “prior” to the abuse of other victims] ... This is an unconscionable position that ignores consensus in multiple international research studies that the vast majority of children who are victims of sexual abuse do not disclose that abuse. </p>
          <p eId="para_792">Members of the House know that to be true and the Minister's Department has corporate knowledge of it through the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse which I established in 1999 while Minister for Education and Science. The idea of modifying the Statute of Limitations at the time was based on emerging jurisprudence that the victims of traumatic or sexual abuse in childhood could not report such abuse at the time and generally did not do so until many years later. It is extraordinary, cruel, insensitive and contrary to any known research that a prior complaint should be a prerequisite for access to the rather limited redress scheme which has been developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">Conor O'Mahony further stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_794">Those that do usually wait a significant period of time ... before doing so; and even in the minority of cases were the abuse is disclosed, this often does not result in a complaint to the authorities. Thus, “prior” complaints are incredibly unlikely to exist, and indeed, even though there are 360 known victims of sexual abuse in National Schools, a prior complaint has only been established in respect of a single abuser to date. The condition of prior complaint is not designed to limit the scope of liability [and this is the crucial point], it is designed to eliminate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">That is the purpose of the redress scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> Only seven offers of settlements have been made under the scheme the Minister has initiated, all of which relate to prior complaints in respect of that one single abuser, even though we know at least 360 cases arise for consideration. That is a settlement rate of approximately 2% and is clearly not indicative of a sensitive or compassionate approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> I want to return to what the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said to me here on 22 May when I raised the issue. He might have been caught unawares or just wanted to say the right thing to me on the morning. I would like the Minister to confirm whether the Taoiseach spoke to him about this because, as Deputy O'Dea pointed out, the Taoiseach stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_798">If it is the case, as the Deputy said, that abuse has occurred and there is no doubt about that fact, then that is something we will have to consider. However, people will understand that when it comes to any scheme of compensation or redress scheme, there needs to be some evidence when claims are being made that alleged abuse took place. That was very much the case in previous redress schemes. However, if, as the Deputy said, there is no doubt that abuse has taken place in these cases, certainly that is something we can examine. I will take up the matter with the Minister ...</p>
          <p eId="para_799">When I put the case to him, the Taoiseach said there should not be an issue if the evidence is available. This motion is about victims of abuse where the perpetrator has admitted his guilt and is in jail. The State and the Government are saying they will ignore the fact that there were court cases, that there was an admission of guilt and that the people responsible are doing time. They are convicted paedophiles. We know that happened through systemic faults in our system. There are not hundreds or thousands but a number who were convicted. We are asking that in those limited cases the very least we could do is to allow the victims of the perpetrators of that abuse into the redress scheme as some acknowledgement of the pain and hurt they have experienced. They continue to experience enormous trauma, pain and hurt by the lack of acknowledgement and the lack of any decent response from the Government to their plight.</p>

          <p eId="para_800">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_801">To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann” and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_802">“notes that:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_803">- sexual abuse, and child sexual abuse in particular, is a heinous crime wherever and however it occurs;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_804">- everything that can be done should be done to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice and to ensure that those responsible for such crimes provide redress to the victims;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_805">- in respect of residential institutions, the State accepted that it shared responsibility for abuse along with those who staffed and managed the institutions since, as set out in the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Ryan Report), the State was responsible for committing children to the institutions, for licensing their operation and for directly inspecting the institutions with respect to the care and protection of children within them;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_806">- under the now-closed Residential Institutions Redress Scheme, over €1.24 billion was paid to some 15,000 survivors of abuse, the bulk of this coming from taxpayers’ funds;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_807">- in respect of day schools, the 2014 European Court of Human Rights’ (ECHR) judgment found that the State failed in its obligation, in specific circumstances, to protect Louise O’Keeffe from sexual abuse by a teacher; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_808">- the State in 2015, introduced an <i>ex gratia </i>scheme of payments for victims of abuse by teachers and other school employees;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_809">recognises that the requirement for evidence of a prior complaint of abuse (arising from the ECtHR judgement) is needed to access the <i>ex gratia </i>scheme in those cases where the State should reasonably have known of the danger posed by the abuser and taken steps to address it;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_810">further notes the appointment of an independent assessor to hear the appeals under this scheme and that he is reviewing the legal implications of the ECtHR judgment, and awaits the outcome of the independent assessor’s considerations;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_811">agrees that:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_812">- the <i>ex gratia </i>scheme should be open to all those to whom the criteria apply, only some of whom may have been abused by the criminally convicted; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_813">- all the services of the State should be applied to support victims of crime; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_814">calls on all persons and institutions who have evidence of complaints in respect of sex abusers to freely provide that evidence so that the victims of abuse may secure redress, whether through the <i>ex gratia </i>scheme or through civil proceedings against those abusers and/or their employers, as relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">I thank the sponsors of the motion for putting it before the House. No one can doubt that child sexual abuse is one of the most appalling crimes that can be perpetrated because it is inflicted on people in their most vulnerable years and is done by persons in positions of trust. Like all Members of the House, I believe we can spare no effort to stamp out that practice, to protect children from such perpetrators and to bring such offenders to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> We must also support the victims, in their needs as victims of crime, in accessing health and welfare services to overcome the huge difficulties they have encountered in their lives that Deputy Martin and Deputy O'Dea described. I believe we should be generous in affording them access to those State services that can assist them in dealing with what has been a very traumatic experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> We must also spare no effort in ensuring that the child protection measures we put in place are rigorously enforced. Much work has been done since the European Court of Human Rights judgment to ensure we have a robust scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> The motion raises the question of liability to compensation. There is no doubt there is a clear liability on the part of perpetrators and those who oversaw them. When it comes to the issue of the State, we can see what has happened. In the case of industrial schools, the State failed. It clearly had a responsibility for the management of those schools. The State sent children to those schools. The State licensed those schools. The State inspected those schools to ensure the welfare of those children, and the State failed catastrophically in its execution of its clear and direct responsibilities. The Ryan report shows that litany of failings.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> When Deputy Micheál Martin was in government, the State rightly introduced redress in the case of industrial schools. Under that redress scheme, the State has paid compensation to 15,000 victims. A sum of €1.5 billion has been paid out in respect of those claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> At the time the Government of which Deputy Micheál Martin was a member put in place this scheme, the case around the State's liability in respect of primary schools was regarded differently by the State and has been since that time. The State did not enrol the children in those schools. They were not State institutions. The State did not employ the staff in those schools and the State did not manage the schools. That was the clear position of the State when the current Opposition was in government as it is now.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> That was tested in the Louise O'Keeffe case. Louise O'Keeffe went to the European Court of Human Rights which found that in the case of Louise O'Keeffe, where there was a prior complaint but the perpetrator was not pursued in any way by the State, that established a clear failure by the State. That, in turn, meant the State had a responsibility and a liability even in the case of primary schools it did not manage, as I mentioned. That is what led to the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme that was put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> I recognise that many applications to that scheme have disputed the State's interpretation of the ruling that underpins it and how they, as applicants seeking to establish prior complaint, have been facilitated in that. It was in the light of understanding those concerns that I appointed an independent assessor to examine the appeals against that <i>ex gratia</i> scheme. There is no desire on the part of the State not to pay out in a case where the circumstances are similar to those found in the judgment in the Louise O'Keeffe case. That is the reason I have appointed an independent former High Court judge, Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, to assess the cases before him. That is not being done by me, as a Minister, legal advisers to the Government or the Attorney General. It is being done by an independent former member of the High Court to assess the issues, whether the ruling the State used to underpin the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme is properly rooted in the judgment and the process applicants have gone through to try to establish prior complaint. I believe we should await the findings of Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill in respect of the cases put before him. That process is designed to explore the arguments Deputy Micheál Martin made, and Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill will deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> While both Deputies spoke eloquently about the very large number of victims and described how all of them have suffered grievously, in the motion they seek to open up a situation where the State would introduce a scheme purely for those who were victims of convicted perpetrators. I understand the argument they put forward here and to the Taoiseach, with whom I have discussed the matter. Essentially, the motion states that compensation should be paid to certain victims but not to others.</p>

          <p eId="para_826">It is to be paid to certain victims, not on the basis of the State's responsibilities for failings that led to the abuse that they suffered, but based on the fact that there was a conviction of the perpetrator in their cases.

          <p eId="para_828">There are many reasons a victim's abuser might not be successfully prosecuted. The victim might have been too traumatised to pursue the case. The evidence might not be sufficiently strong for the DPP to prosecute. It may not have been possible to secure a conviction beyond reasonable doubt in the courts. There are many reasons a person who was a perpetrator might not be convicted. For the State to set up a scheme that would seek to treat some victims in one way and treat other victims, perhaps as traumatised or even more traumatised, differently would not be fair.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maurice Quinlivan<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_843">I am sharing time with Deputy Funchion. I have been a Deputy for two years and the Minister's amendment to the motion was the most shocking thing I have seen in this House. Tomorrow, we will vote on the motion before the House and the Minister knows the Government will lose that vote. Given that he knows his amendment will be lost, I am perplexed as to why he proposed it. The motion has the support of all parties in the House. The Government will be isolated tomorrow when we vote against its amendment and support the original motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> This is an issue I have been deeply involved with since before I was elected to the House. When I was a councillor I met some of the lads who attended Creagh Lane national school in Limerick. I welcome the lads who are in the Gallery. I particularly welcome John Allen from Cork, and echo the comments made by Deputy Micheál Martin. Mr. Allen is a fine person. I have dealt with him a number of times and his commitment to seeking justice not only for himself but also for others is to be commended. The other lads from Creagh Lane who are in the Gallery are John Boland, Christy Rainbow, David Phayer, Ger Naughton, Buddy Boland, Georgie Kennedy,<b>
						</b>Tom Hogan, William Buckley and Ger Smyth. I also mention those who had intended travelling today but could not make it in the end. I specifically want to remember those who have not survived and are not here tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> I and my party have worked in a co-operative way on this topic. Sinn Féin suggested what could be included in the motion, refrained from putting forward our own motion and did not table any amendments to ensure the motion passes, which I have no doubt will be the case given the widespread support for it among all parties, apart from the Minister's party. With the support of Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and others, the motion will pass and I expect the Minister to take action on it immediately. The will of the Dáil should not be ignored by this Government whose actions to date on this issue have been despicable. I expect Fianna Fáil to use the leverage it has under the confidence and supply agreement to ensure action is taken once the motion is passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> I will speak briefly to the specifics of the motion. It notes the Louise O'Keeffe judgment and the narrow interpretation the Government has made of it. I asked the Minister in parliamentary questions who exactly provided the advice that a prior complaint was required. Unfortunately, he failed to provide the requested information on that occasion. Perhaps he can shed some light on the matter tonight. I also asked previously about the total absence of consultation talks. Maybe the Minister can update us on their progress. I asked why the Minister is refusing to provide information to the State Claims Agency relating to <i>ex gratia</i> scheme applications despite the agency having requested it in November 2016 and having sent numerous reminders to the Department. Will the Minister update the House on that? I have asked countless parliamentary questions seeking information on this topic and most of the time the answers received provide no information. I can only assume this stonewalling is because the Government knows it is wrong, but just does not want to deal with the issue. That is simply not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> Creagh Lane was a small national school in the heart of Limerick city. It should have been a place - an education facility - in which children were nurtured, supported and encouraged to reach their full potential. Unfortunately, for many this was not the case. It was a horror story and a true nightmare for many of them. These children were failed by a State that should and could have protected them. It is disgraceful that the men from Creagh Lane have had to put up such a fight. Having been subjected to the most horrendous sexual abuse as children, they were denied redress due to barriers put in place by Fine Gael. Some of these lads were recently quoted in <i>thejournal.ie</i>. Christy Rainbow, who was abused at the age of eight, said: "School was about survival, I'd be looking at the teacher thinking 'just stay away'." Thomas Hogan, who was abused at the age of six, recalled screaming and having to be tied into a buggy with a rope to be brought to school. He said: "The children never spoke about it, we just kept our heads down and our mouths shut." John Allen from Cork said: "I shut down. All I know is I was crying for my mother."</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> I know most of these lads personally. I went to a similar type of school not far from Creagh Lane a few years later. Many of them had not spoken about their abuse for years. Families and friends were unaware of what happened to them and what they went through. Some did not speak about what happened to them until after the case against their abuser was concluded in 2009. I remember one survivor telling me, when I met him in the Dáil just after the conviction of the ex-Christian Brother, that his mother asked him if the reason he looked back every day when he was leaving for school was that he wanted her to take him back.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> The Government's handling of this matter has been shambolic and shameful. It is clear it does not understand the hurt and stress it is continuing to cause to survivors. It has forced them to protest outside the Dáil gates to try to get their story highlighted in the media and to travel to Europe to highlight the injustice done to them in the European Parliament. Their testimonies on that trip were powerful and will remain with me for the rest of my life. The Government's failure to give these men the justice they require has meant they have had to retell their heart-wrenching stories again and again, thereby reliving their awful experience, and has forced them to plead for the redress to which they should be fully entitled. This is a scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> In his reply to Deputies Willie O'Dea and Micheál Martin, the Minister tried to muddy the waters by talking about floodgates opening or other victims being left behind. That is not intention of the motion, as the Minister well knows.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> I want to address the official statistics pertaining to child sexual abuse perpetrated by religious persons in Irish schools, which give an insight into the possible reach of this motion. The official statistics are contained in the "Review Reports by Diocese" and "Review Reports by Religious Order/Congregations" sections on the <i>safeguarding.ie</i> website. These statistics confirm that only 72 religious were convicted of child sexual abuse in Ireland since 1 January 1975. Of these, 39 were priests and 33 were missionaries, and of these 33 missionaries, 12 were Christian Brothers, so this will not open up a floodgate. As this motion is dealing specifically with access to redress for people where the perpetrator of the crime has been convicted, there is no floodgate issue and the number of people is limited. The Minister is aware of this as Victims Of Child Abuse in Day Schools, VOCADS, has provided him with these statistics. Our party leader, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, raised this issue with the Minister. At the time, she said that of the 210 survivors the State had bullied into dropping their legal cases of abuse, 15 had applied to the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme and of that number, eight had failed. This is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> I return to the Government amendment to the motion. The Minister knows that with the help of Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil and others, the amendment will be massively defeated so why has he tabled it? The Government amendment states that the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme should be open to all those to whom the criteria apply. The Government still thinks it is a case of excluding people who cannot prove a prior complaint. I am very disappointed by this stance and, quite frankly, I am confused as to why the Minister is trying so hard to block access to redress for people who were failed so badly by the State, who are now looking for justice and who are being put through hoops by the Minister. Will he give the reasons he is blocking people from accessing redress? Is it because he is worried there will be too many of them and that it will cost the State? What exactly is his reasoning? This House and, more importantly, the people in the Public Gallery who are directly affected by this, deserve to know. Sinn Féin will not be supporting the Government amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> The State has failed these men terribly. It failed to protect them when they were children in school at their most vulnerable. It failed them when the individual who perpetrated the awful abuse was not brought to justice for years after the events took place. It failed these men when they were forced to grow up with no supports or help for the awful trauma they went through, and it continues to fail them by putting barriers in the way of redress and making them plead for compensation. I ask the Minister and this Government to ensure this failure ends here tonight. </p>

        <speech by="#KathleenFunchion" eId="spk_413">
          <from>Deputy Kathleen Funchion<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_854">Sinn Féin is supporting the motion and we welcome the fact that it is being brought forward. I welcome the people in the Public Gallery and commend them on their courage. It is disgraceful that they must come here and have their stories told like this. This should not happen. They should be getting all the supports along with every other victim of child sexual abuse. It should not even be up for question and I do not know how they cope with this on a daily basis. I find this subject very difficult, even listening to the material quoted by Deputy Quinlivan. I do not know how anybody could listen to that and not do everything in their power to help people in that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> It is really far-reaching and quite disgraceful on the part of the Government to say that it did not force these children to go to school or that it did not send these children to school. Every child is expected to go to school. We still have the system whereby if a child misses 21 days, the State will be down on him or her like a ton of bricks. It is ridiculous to say they were not forced to attend these schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> I thank and commend Deputy Quinlivan who has taken a huge personal interest and done a huge amount of work in the area. I commend him on his efforts. As we are aware, much of this comes on the back of the bravery of Louise O'Keeffe who was forced to go all the way to the European Court of Human Rights. The Irish Government now says that the Louise O'Keeffe case and the entitlement to redress only applies to people abused by someone who had a prior complaint against them. This is completely unfair. These men were abused as children by someone in a position of power and are now being punished for not being capable of speaking up at that time, a time when the Catholic Church was the ultimate power in this country and when they were just children. Let us not forget that.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> We know from the Ryan report that the State was aware of the sexual abuse of children in school in the 1940s but did nothing about it until it was forced to in the 1990s. As survivor Thomas Hogan said in <i>thejournal.ie</i> recently, "I can't recall very much about being seven, but I can recall the fear of that and I can recall the anger of it, not being able to say or do anything about it." These children could not speak up. This was not a choice on their part and to say that a prior complaint needs to have been made is not only insulting to them but belittles the suffering they experienced. I find that particularly difficult. Perhaps it is because my son turned seven last week but just thinking about the situation, what these children went through and what they are now being forced to go through as adults is nothing short of disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> The Government claims the floodgates will open but these are very specific cases and there is nowhere near enough people for floodgates to open. To be honest, if it is a case of floodgates opening, let them open. Anybody who has been abused at the hands of this State should be given whatever support and counselling services they need. Some Fianna Fáil Deputies talked about the effect on relationships, families and every single part of a person's life. It does not matter whether the floodgates open because people need support and it is not good enough that we come in time and again, apologise and say the stuff that happened was disgraceful. We are standing over it today because we will not give adequate support to these victims and are forcing them not only to relive it but to come up and tell their stories publicly. I find the whole thing disgusting.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> The State has never taken responsibility for this abuse. Thomas Hogan has stated that if, at the time his abuser, Seán Drummond, was convicted, the State had come out and said it did not do its job at the time and was sorry, that would nearly have been enough. The Government did no such thing and has instead fought victims tooth and nail to deny any culpability. Redress is owed to these men and we welcome this motion which it is hoped will ensure this is what they get.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> John Allen has been mentioned on a number of occasions tonight. This quote from him sums up the situation. He said, "Instead of standing next to me, the Government is standing opposed to me. It's morally wrong." It is not too late. We have not voted on this. It is not too late to withdraw the Government amendment and it is not too late to support the motion and ensure everything is done to address the situation and that all of these people get the support they need. That is the least we can do and that is the least they deserve. I am sure most Deputies will be supporting this but I appeal again to the Government to withdraw its amendment and to do everything in its power, given that it is in power, to ensure these men and all victims of child sexual abuse are looked after. It is about time we started dealing properly with our horrific history. We seem to be doing it in piecemeal amounts. It takes a huge amount of public pressure and protest for things to change. We need to look at these situations, deal with them and ensure that people are given every support. It is the least we owe them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_861">I thank Deputy O'Dea and Fianna Fáil for using their Private Members' time for this motion. Raising this issue is a very good use of Private Members' time. I thank all the Deputies who played a role in raising these cases down the years. I hope that when this motion is passed tomorrow, the Government will recognise the democratic wish of the Dáil and implement the motion. Unfortunately, we know it will not do so, which is thoroughly undemocratic.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> Like others, I pay tribute to the survivors, including the survivors in the Public Gallery. I have had the privilege of meeting the Creagh Lane survivors on a number of occasions. It is hard for anyone to campaign for years and years regardless of the issue but this involves people campaigning in a such a way when they have been abused, are suffering all the effects of that abuse in terms of their mental health and personal life, and then face a State that is determined to stand in the way of their getting justice and that is trying to bully them into dropping their case or saying it will pursue them for costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">To continue despite all of that, to take the case for justice here and to take it to Europe really takes courage. They are responsible for pushing it this far and it is the role of those of us who are supporting this motion to try to push and assist in amplifying their voices to shame the Government into dropping its opposition and allowing them to be included in the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> It is clear to everybody who is here that while this is a very distressing issue, in its facts it is a very simple one. The argument of the Minister, which has been answered by Deputy Funchion, is that while the State makes people go a school, it was not to know there was this abuser in Creagh Lane or the other cases where this applies. The State paid the teacher, however, and that teacher abused those boys in an horrific and repeated way. That man has been convicted so there is no dispute over the facts. Those people face threats and bullying from the State all over again, however, in an effort to have the State avoid owning up to its responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> To come to the meat of the issue, I want to respond to what the Minister has said. It is shameful and it has been shameful for years every time this issue has been raised. I would not think the Minister got involved in politics to say to these people who are victims of horrific abuse by a man who was paid by the State that they should not get justice and should not be included. I am sure the Minister does not want to be doing that but here he is doing it. He has done it previously and he is doing it again this evening. The Government is doing it with its amendment, which has the same effect. I appeal to the Minister not to do it, to do the right thing and to speak out on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> The Minister raised a couple of arguments that were disingenuous and that do him and the Government no service. The Minister said Fianna Fáil's motion calls for some victims to be covered by a scheme but not others. That is not true. The motion calls for some victims to be included, victims in cases where the position is clear and there is no dispute, and where the perpetrators have been caught and convicted. It does not call for anybody not to be included. It calls for these people to be included. What the Minister accuses the motion of is precisely what the Government is doing. By resting on the idea of prior complaint, the Minister is treating some survivors differently than other survivors on the basis of this prior complaint. It is the Minister who is guilty of saying some survivors are entitled to be included and some are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> The second key argument he makes and has made over the years is to hide behind this exceedingly narrow definition or interpretation of the O'Keeffe case. The Minister made a revealing slip of the tongue earlier when he spoke about people objecting to the European Court of Human Rights ruling, and he then had to correct himself and say they are objecting to the interpretation of the ruling. That is a very important distinction. Louise O'Keeffe's opinion and other opinions do not agree with the excessively narrow interpretation that is being put on this by the Government. It is shameful for the Government to hide behind legalese and to say it does not have to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> Even if the Minister's interpretation was correct, so what? It would just mean the Government does not have a legal obligation to include these survivors in the scheme. It would not mean it is barred from including them in the scheme. It would simply mean it is not compelled to do it. Is that what the Minister is waiting for? Is he waiting for the European Court of Human Rights to rule again and to decide that these people have to be included? That is the argument that is being made, namely, that unless the ruling is such that these people have to be included, we are not going to include them. The Minister should forget about that and do the right thing. He should stop abusing survivors all over again. He should do the right thing by survivors tomorrow in terms of the vote and then take action. Exactly as Deputy Funchion said, these are not floodgates. These are people we are talking about, people who were abused where the State has a responsibility. Everybody who is affected in that way should be included. That is not some crazy notion and a Government that is serious about doing the right thing would simply do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_870">The case of Louise O'Keeffe deserves to be remembered not only for the heinous crimes that were perpetrated against her but mainly for the way the State has tried to distance itself from them. It is a signal in regard to how the State deals with such cases. This has been done on our behalf and on behalf of every citizen of this State, but who gave the State the right to do it? Rather than admit its responsibility and ours, the State tried to cover it up and deny any responsibility, which is wrong, although that is what the State is continuing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> It is worth remembering what has been written about Ms O'Keeffe's case. <i>The Irish Times</i> stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_872">When the little girl of eight and her classmates were abused there was no one to whom they could turn. Similarly at the criminal hearing there was no representative of the State to offer support to these victims. It was a case of “hear no evil, see no evil and thus there was no evil". [...]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_873">Nobody seemed to care that it took more than 20 years before any girl summoned the courage to make a complaint to An Garda Síochána. Accountability is important, in terms of recognising past errors but also in seeking to prevent their repetition. A civil legal case was therefore taken to get such accountability.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_874">The State denied any and all responsibility for the acts of the teacher. Yet the State dictated how many teachers may teach in a school, it pays their wages and their pensions on retirement, negotiates such pay and working conditions, sets their qualifications, gives them recognition to teach in school (without which they cannot teach) and sets the curriculum. [...]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_875">Forty-one years after an eight-year-old girl was sexually abused by her principal in school, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in her favour: the State had failed to “put in place any mechanism of effective State control against the risks of such abuse occurring”.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_876">The judges said it was “an inherent obligation of a government to protect children from ill-treatment, especially in a primary education context”.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">This is the key point. It is the State's responsibility to protect all children in primary school, yet here we are, all these years later, and still the State, meaning us, is not willing to stand up and face its responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> No one is clear of responsibility in this case. Fianna Fáil was in government when much of this happened and Fine Gael has been in power when dealing with the fallout from the case. I would hope that if I were in the position to deal with these cases, I would deal with them compassionately, but I do not know for certain. My main concern would be dealing with the victims rather than the burden on the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> The Minister's response is horrific and terrible. Why is it that we will only do the bare minimum when dealing with these issues? Is it that the State thinks people are only trying to make money out of the situation? It is as if someone would put themselves through years of pain and suffering to get the amount of money that is involved in this case. The Minister has not done this on my behalf or on behalf of millions of Irish citizens so who has he done it for? He is only our representative in dealing with this. We are telling him it has to be dealt with and resolved, and he should do it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_880">I have no hesitation in supporting this motion and I thank Fianna Fáil for bringing it forward. The motion does not exclude people. It asks for certain people to be included. It is at the discretion of the Government to make it as broad as it wants.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> I took the trouble to get the European Court of Human Rights judgment and I have read it. I advise the Ministers to read it, not alone in regard to this case but in regard to the background and what the case highlighted in terms of previous reports. To take such a narrow interpretation of this judgment is simply not based on reality and it is certainly not based on a reading of the case. I do not know how, given the circumstances, the Minister can sit there and justify a narrow interpretation of it based on a prepared script without reading the case. It is in very clear English and is very simple. It is a majority ruling. It is important to realise that this case is based on a case taken in the Irish courts, beginning in 1988, when Ms O'Keeffe instituted proceedings, and going right up to 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">Can Members imagine such a period of time? It was 26 years. More importantly, we are approaching nearly 50 years. I could take any year and note that we have failed utterly to learn.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> I refer to the judgment to put things in perspective. The Government argues that a narrow interpretation is justified and that the State did not know. This case is based on a young girl who was abused repeatedly by a school principal, who was a married man. The patron was the Catholic Church. It is acknowledged in the judgment that the inspector from the Department went to that particular school more frequently than was usual. As such, the Department was quite aware that something was not quite right. Ms O'Keeffe had to go to the High Court where costs were awarded against her and she then had to go to the Supreme Court where the only thing it could do for her was reverse the costs order. She then had to go before the European Court of Human Rights. It is quite unbelievable that the argument was made that her application was manifestly unfounded. I do not know how any Irish Government could argue that. The majority judgment went against that. The Government argued that she had lost her victim status. The Government argued that her case was manifestly ill-founded. The judgment does not make for very pleasant reading. While I might accept that arguments have to be made on a legal basis, to persist now with those arguments against all of the evidence is unforgivable.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> The judgment puts the case in perspective. In addition to the complaints being made at the time, the court looked specifically at the knowledge of the Government. It went back as far as the Carrigan report of 1931, which was followed by the Cussen report on the industrial schools in 1936 and the Kennedy report in 1970. I will stick to the Carrigan report as my time is limited. The Department of Justice refused to publish the report at the time and one can see why. Page 16 of the judgment states that the police Commissioner was an important witness for the report. He gave evidence of responses from 800 police throughout the country looking at statistics between 1924 to 1930 on the offence of defilement, carnal knowledge or rape of girls under ten years of age, between ten and 13 years of age and in other age groups. The Commissioner submitted a detailed analysis of those statistics noting, <i>inter alia</i>, that there was an "alarming amount of sexual crime increasing yearly [against young] children from 16 years downwards". The Department responded with a phrase like one of Lord Denning's that it could not possibly publish the report because the conclusion would have to be drawn "that the ordinary feelings of decency and the influence of religion had failed". That is exactly what happened. The ordinary feelings of decency and religion had failed utterly. Had the Government taken action on foot of the horrific rate of sexual crime in 1931, things might have changed. The Cussen report, the Kennedy report and any number of reports up to the present day tell us that the State was fully aware and colluded with the religious orders to keep things quiet.</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> For the third time, I appeal to the Minister to read this judgment. It does not talk about prior complaints in isolation. It refers to systemic difficulties, a failure to inspect and a failure to analyse the risk on the basis of the knowledge that was there. That knowledge was there. It is one of the clearest judgments and it is worth reading. I ask the Government not to add insult to injury by interpreting narrowly a judgment which does not deserve such treatment. I have only mentioned a fraction of what was in the reports referred to. If we are going to learn anything at all from this judgment, let us stop putting our heads in the sand and let us put our hands up.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_886">I commend Fianna Fáil on tabling this motion which makes it clear that the conditions in place to access redress are causing huge distress to the victims. I agree with the point in the motion that it is unjust that citizens who have been sexually abused by perpetrators who were employed by the State in primary schools and subsequently convicted of sex abuse are excluded from the State's redress scheme because they are unable to prove that a prior complaint was made. It is very strange. It seems that we are determined to do all we can to make the lives of these most unfortunate people more difficult than they are. It is reprehensible. All one would need to do is ask Louise O'Keeffe to know how true that is. It was true when she took her case and it remains true many years later today.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> I was appalled to note that the State Claims Agency, which manages litigation against the State in cases of child sexual abuse in schools, has settled only seven cases out of court to date. One has to ask what is going on and why an adversarial attitude prevails even to this day. With all due respect to the process of law and the requirement to satisfy a certain legal caution, it is clear that the will to provide redress as a matter of urgency is not there. It takes will and means to do it and it must be done. I acknowledge the progress on victim support in recent years, even if it has been very belated. It was in that spirit that I welcomed the publication of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016, which was the first comprehensive primary legislation to attempt to place the victim at the centre of the picture rather than to appear to give preferential treatment to the perpetrators of crime. That is what appeared to be happening all the time and we hope things have changed with the legislation. However, we have yet to see the fruits of that change.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> We need something of that spirit now as we debate how to approach redress and compensation pathways for the victims of sexual abuse. Let us not forget that this country still has an enormous child abuse problem. In reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs confirmed to me that the numbers of children being referred to child protection services for abuse from 2011 to 2016 was just under 250,000, which is an outlandish figure. While abuse takes place in several forms, including physical, sexual and malnourishment, this is a huge figure to see on our watch with all our education, legislation, awareness and agencies to deal with young children. It is truly horrific and deeply disturbing to see that in excess of 248,000 referrals across all categories of abuse, including physical and sexual, occurred in the period. The information provided to me shows that last year 36% of referrals were for emotional abuse, 16% were for sexual abuse, 23% were for physical abuse and 25% were for neglect. This amounts to a 50% increase in total referrals from 2011 to 2016, which is staggering. Of those nearly 250,000 referrals, more than 110,000 have been deemed to be of sufficient gravity and concern to warrant the immediate implementation of child protection measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> In light of that information, it should be clear that we need to put in place, as a matter of urgency, better pathways to a more humane and compassionate redress scheme. Certainly, we need to be less adversarial and to remove the legal eagles from the situation. While they are acting on instructions, any situation in which they become involved is subject to delay and adversarial conflict as that is the nature of their work. I am not saying they are deliberately adversarial but they are making things adversarial on behalf of the State. I appeal to the Ministers to be more compassionate, to enter the modern era and to examine why so many children continue to be referred to the Child and Family Agency, the Garda and other social services.</p>

          <p eId="para_890">I wish to share time with Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> I thank my colleague, Deputy Willie O'Dea, for bringing forward the motion. On behalf of the victims of sexual abuse who have been excluded on an unfair basis from the fruits of the Louise O'Keeffe decision, I thank the Deputy and my party leader for their commitment. I pay tribute to the victims, many of whom are in the Visitors Gallery and many of whom have told me their stories of abuse and neglect by the State which are dreadful and appalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> The Minister has tried to deal with our motion in a way that misinterprets it entirely, possibly deliberately so. We are not trying to create a category or a special category for certain victims of abuse. What we are trying to do is facilitate those victims of abuse whose cases essentially have been proved by way of a conviction by allowing them to qualify for redress. There would be no exclusion of anybody else. The courts are always open for any other victims of abuse who do not fall within the terms of our motion to take cases, but this is for persons for whom prior complaint has been an insurmountable and I suggest illegal hurdle put before them. The most ludicrous exemplar includes the first victims where there could not possibly have been a prior complaint. It makes a mockery of the Louise O'Keeffe decision and the law set down by the European Court of Human Rights to exclude these individuals and the others affected by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> I note that Deputy Catherine Connolly set out a summary of the law. Having read the Louise O'Keeffe decision, there is no harm in outlining it. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_894"> In sum, having regard to the fundamental nature of the rights guaranteed by Article 3 [the prohibition of torture] and the particularly vulnerable nature of children, it is an inherent obligation of government to ensure their protection from ill-treatment, especially in a primary education context, through the adoption, as necessary, of special measures and safeguards.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_895"> Furthermore, this is an obligation which applied at the time of the events relevant to this case, namely in 1973.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">Nowhere in the statement of law by the European Court of Human Rights which we adopted as part of our membership of the European Community and under the Constitution is it stated there must be a prior complaint. Where prior complaint comes in is in the application of that general legal principle to the particular case of Louise O'Keeffe. It is deeply wrong, immoral and unjust to use the application of a general legal principal to exclude the people concerned, who are nearly all men, from benefiting from the redress scheme. We do not know what benefit it would provide, but all the law can give to the victims of a wrong is money. It cannot undo what has been done. It can certainly punish offenders, but it cannot do anything else. However, this is not about money; rather, it is about what the liable person - in this case, the State - can do.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> I refer to a decision made in the High Court by Mr. Justice Max Barrett - it is an awful decision to read - in the case of one of the victims who is described in the judgment as Mr. A. I will not give his name, but it may well be known. There were other plaintiffs also. The judgment of Mr. Justice Barrett given on 26 May 2016 was incredible in the sense that issues of contract law were brought in to prevent the gentlemen from taking their case against the State because they had been served with a discontinuance notice a number of years previously when the State had a couple of victories in court cases related to this issue. In the judgment the word "victories" is in inverted commas because they were not really victories because the Louise O'Keeffe decision subsequently overturned the decision in her particular case and the plaintiffs had withdrawn their cases. Mr. Justice Barrett, in stating they could not come back, felt he was obliged by law to do so. Whether that is right or wrong is a matter for him. However, his comments were absolutely searing in terms of the way the people concerned have been treated. The judge stated he felt he was making the correct decision as a matter of law, but he freely admitted "that he wished that matters were not so. Some of the claimed facts that underlie the plaintiffs' cases and which were placed before the court make for deeply unpleasant reading."</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> The judge stated his was a court of law and that he could not change the decision. What he said was:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_899">But the Irish people, with their great and proper sense of justice, may well conclude that the path of rightness in this matter should lead ultimately to a different end [effectively our motion], regardless of the end reached here today. This Court, as an Irishman, would respectfully agree were they so to conclude.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> The people, as Mr. Justice Barrett stated, "with their great and proper sense of justice," might well conclude that the path of rightness leads to a better position, but they can only act through the authority of the Government of the day. Deputy Richard Bruton is the Minister for Education and Skills. He is the authority who could act in accordance with what Mr. Justice Barrett said. He felt he could do no different in a court of law but that the people could take "the path of rightness." I urge the Minister to take the path of rightness, as urged by the judge as the moral and right thing to do, and accept our motion, not to use the floodgates argument, as this involves a limited category of persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> We have heard so much about Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill. As I understand it from reading the terms of reference he has been given, he is not there to overturn or interpret the particular advice the Government has received. He is there simply to apply it. That is in fundamental disagreement with what the victims are here for today. I do not want the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, to take personally the assertion that he is not his usual effervescent bubbly self today. He is in different form and I do not blame him because this is a difficult position for him to adopt. It seems clear from his body language and tone of voice that he is extremely uncomfortable. A plain reading of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights and Mr. Justice Barrett's judgment and his exhortation of the people suggests the Minister is right to be uncomfortable, right to be queasy and right not to be in his usual best of form when delivering the Government's position. </p>
          <p eId="para_902"> I will leave it at that, but I urge the Government to withdraw its amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_903">Child sexual abuse is one of the most shameful aspects of the country's history. As Graham Green said, "There is always one moment in childhood when the door opens and lets the future in." When that door opens, how wrong it is to allow a trusted person, a teacher, to exploit and claim a child's innocence which in many ways leads to a difficult future for the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> Our long history of failing to protect vulnerable members of society was highlighted again last year in the Grace case and with the horrendous revelations about the Tuam mother and baby home. They were only the latest shocking stories in a catalogue of abuse and neglect suffered by children at the hands of official Ireland. As far back as 1931, the unpublished Carrigan report identified an alarming amount of sexual crime and criminal interference in schools with children, aged 16 years downwards. However, despite the unavoidable awareness of what was taking place, the then Department of Education adopted a policy of avoiding culpability and instructed schools to direct complaints to school managers - parish priests - with no Department involvement whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> Louise O'Keeffe had to fight for years to make the State accept responsibility for the breach of her human rights in failing to protect her from abuse in Dunderrow national school in the 1970s. This eight year old child was let down in the most grievous manner by her school and the State, yet the Government tried to evade liability, insisting that the board of management held responsibility. She fought in the High Court and the Supreme Court and even faced losing her home to pay all of the legal costs involved. The O'Keeffe judgment of the European Court of Human Rights held that there had been a violation of Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman and degrading treatment, and Article 13, which sets out the right to an effective remedy. We owe Ms O'Keeffe a huge debt of gratitude for blowing this wide open. The court also ruled that there was an inherent obligation on a government to use special measures and safeguards to protect children from ill-treatment, especially in primary education when they were under the exclusive control of school authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">These safeguards were sadly lacking in many of our schools in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> The subsequent redress scheme, as interpreted by the Government, is completely unjust, requiring that applicants show their abuser to have been the subject of a prior complaint. The redress scheme, as we know, limits redress to those victims who could establish that their abuse had occurred in the aftermath of a prior complaint which had not been acted upon. This goes against all international research findings showing that the vast majority of survivors of child sexual abuse do not disclose the abuse or wait a significant period before doing so. Louise O'Keeffe’s abuser, Leo Hickey, abused more than 20 children, yet we know only one complaint was made at that time. </p>
          <p eId="para_908"> Fianna Fáil proposes to allow victims of abuse in primary schools, whose abusers have been convicted in the courts, to qualify for compensation under the scheme without the requirement of a prior complaint. I commend this motion because child abuse and neglect offend the basic values of our State and society and we have a responsibility to provide adequate redress to those we have failed so badly in the past.</p>

          <p eId="para_909">I acknowledge that this is an important debate and that Fianna Fáil used its Private Members' time to table the motion for debate. I also draw attention to the Government's countermotion, which includes a number of points, of which the final four merit attention. The amendment notes the appointment of an independent assessor to hear the appeals under this scheme, and this has been acknowledged by most speakers. It states the independent assessor is reviewing the legal implications of the European Court of Human Rights judgment and notes that the assessor has called on the Dáil to await the outcome of his considerations. That is an important point. The assessor is reviewing the legal implications of the judgment. Deputy Connolly spoke very well on this issue and asked us to read the judgment. The Government has gone beyond that and asked a former High Court judge to independently review the judgment before reporting back to us. I am told the report will be available by the end of the summer. I call on colleagues to await that report because there is a reason we have courts and independent assessors.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> Deputy Thomas Byrne argued that this was not happening. It is happening and I reiterate that the former High Court judge is reviewing the legal implications of the judgment. He has also written to the Minister indicating that he is considering whether the imposition of the condition that requires that there had to be evidence of a prior complaint of child sexual abuse is consistent with, and a correct implementation of, the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Louise O'Keeffe <i>v</i>. Ireland. As the review is ongoing, it would be prudent of the House to wait for the independent assessor to produce his findings. We could then have a further discussion on the matter and move forward from there.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> In the Government's amendment, we also agree that the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme should be open to all those to whom the criteria apply, only some of whom may have been abused by the criminally convicted. The Minister made that point earlier. We agreed that all of the services of the State should be applied towards supporting the victims of crime, especially victims of child sexual abuse. We ask the Dáil to call on all persons and institutions who have evidence of complaints of sexual abusers to freely provide that evidence in order that the victims of abuse may secure redress, whether through the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme or civil proceedings against the abusers and-or their employers, as relevant. That is also important. While I know this is in the scheme as currently interpreted, we await Judge O'Neill's findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> We must never let down our guard in efforts to combat sexual abuse. This is especially true in the case of child sexual abuse. Our child protection system must be continually improved and monitored. I am glad to say that significant improvements have been made in recent years. In this regard, arrangements for Garda vetting of new teaching and non-teaching school staff were introduced in 2006 on a non-statutory basis. Garda vetting was placed on a statutory footing with the commencement of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 and 2016. All registered teachers currently teaching in Irish schools have been vetted. This amounts to approximately 98,500 teachers on the Teaching Council’s register. Under the Children First Act 2015, mandated persons, which include registered teachers, psychologists and other categories of professionals as listed in Schedule 2 of the Act, are required to report child protection concerns over a defined threshold to Tusla.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> It is vital that our system has moved forward, complementing other significant areas of social progress in our country. Unfortunately, society was not always so open or progressive. In many cases, we, as a society, tolerated systems, structures and practices which were both aberrant and abhorrent. Tonight we have shone a light into the past and it is not pleasant. As Deputy O'Dea pointed out, it is very ugly. In reflecting on our history, we have to come to terms with it and we will learn from it. We cannot change our past but we must use it to shape a better future.</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> Those who have been prepared to come forward to seek justice for having been sexually abused, and not only in the school system, are to be wholly commended. Not only have they displayed great courage and forbearance, but they have done society a service by assisting in bringing the perpetrators of abuse to justice. Many of these survivors have been further vindicated in securing redress though the courts in actions taken against their abusers and those who employed and supervised them. This is an important pathway in a system where, under the Constitution, the State provides for education but is not the employer of teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Louise O'Keeffe case provided clarification on the specific conditions in which the State failed in its obligation to protect a child from abuse by a teacher. Those circumstances relate to the fact that there had been a prior complaint of sexual abuse to the school authorities against the teacher in question. The importance of the prior complaint test was further highlighted in the domestic courts in the High Court judgment of Mr. Justice Noonan in June 2016. While this may seem restrictive, it is important in the public interest to ensure that the State and, by extension, the taxpayer do not assume financial liabilities without good cause. If this occurs, not only is it unfair to the public, it also potentially allows those responsible for the abuse to evade their obligations, which would be a terrible outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> I acknowledge that this is a difficult and contested area and that the State must act in a way that is fair and proportionate. The appointment of the independent assessor to the <i>ex gratia </i>scheme recognises this. In light of the assessor's requests for submissions from various parties, including the Minister, in advance of his assessing the appeals referred to him and in reviewing the legal implications of the judgment, it is clear that he is giving the matter serious and careful attention. The approach proposed in the Fianna Fáil motion of including in the <i>ex gratia </i>scheme survivors of convicted sex abusers, even in the absence of a prior complaint, may seem attractive on the face of it, but it has been argued that this would only open up the scheme in a limited way, as relatively few abusers have been convicted. However, what might seem like an inclusive measure, is actually an exclusive one. I must reiterate the remarks of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, that it would be manifestly unfair to those whose abuser was not convicted. The State is willing to provide redress where there is a just reason for doing so, but the State must also act in the public interest in a way which is fair and equitable to all. The amendment to the motion reflects this and I commend it to the House<b>.</b></p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Finian McGrath)<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_917">I thank Fianna Fáil for tabling this very important motion. I welcome into the Public Gallery members of Victims of Child Abuse in Day Schools, VOCADS, and all other survivors who made the journey. Separately I pay tribute to Louise O'Keeffe for her work on behalf of survivors. I commend John Boland, John Allen, Mark Vincent Healy and all the other people directly involved. I am very grateful to all the survivors in the Gallery for the service they and those like them have given to our State. Over a teaching career, an abuser had access to thousands of children. The survivors' efforts in having these abusers removed from our school system saved many thousands of children from decades of emotional and mental torment, addiction, broken families and, in many cases, suicide. Their selfless actions, which came at huge personal cost - I have in mind the personal humiliation many of them had to suffer while helping others - allowed many children to reach their full potential. Tonight, I thank the survivors for their efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> I have worked with survivors of sexual abuse for many years and my special adviser, Damian O'Farrell, has a close relationship with the secretary of VOCADS, Mr. John Allen. On behalf of survivors, I corresponded with the Minister of Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and earlier this week the Minister kindly facilitated a meeting in Government Buildings. Those in attendance included the Minister and the Attorney General, who were accompanied by senior staff and advisers. The Office of An Taoiseach was also represented. I thank the Minister again for his work and understanding on this issue. I attended with my special adviser and raised several matters on behalf of the survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">The first is that the 2014 scheme, to which survivors are seeking entry, is an <i>ex gratia</i> scheme. It was also mentioned that some survivors had died in tragic circumstances while waiting to access the scheme. Then there was prior complaint being a condition of entry and the near impossibility of proving, or even showing, prior complaint, in respect of which we raised the point that the vast majority of victims of child abuse did not disclose their abuse and that, as a result, the number of prior complaints on which one could rely was minuscule by comparison. Also on survivors' behalf, we raised the significance of the Ryan report which highlighted the lack of integrity of the then Department of Education, on the same historical records of which survivors now have to rely to show prior complaint. The Ryan report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_920">The Department of Education dealt inadequately with complaints about sexual abuse. These complaints were generally dismissed or ignored ... The Department, however, gave the impression that it had a function in relation to investigating allegations of abuse but actually failed to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">In addressing this matter at the meeting I reiterated that I was referring to the Department of Education in historical times only. I acknowledged and commended the Department of Education and Skills for the vast body of work it carried out to protect schoolchildren. To further demonstrate the difficulties in having to rely on prior complaint, we also gave as an example a mid-1990s written complaint which had effectively been ignored and in which case the teacher who was subsequently convicted had been allowed to teach for a further three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> I thank and commend Louise O'Keeffe, John Allen, John Boland and Mark Vincent Healy and all of the survivors and victims for their efforts on this issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_423">
          <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_923">I thank everybody who contributed to the debate. I thank Members of all parties and none who indicated that they would support the motion when it is put to the House tomorrow. I was interested in the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, but noted that he did not indicate how he would vote. As the survivors in the Visitors Gallery would like to know, perhaps he might communicate his intentions to them later.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> This is more of the same. The Government's approach in the Louise O'Keeffe case was not to state, "The State has been found wanting, so what can we do for the victims?" Its approach was to ask: "How much further does this force us to go? What do we have to do? What is the least we have to do as a result of this judgment?" In order to facilitate that approach, it gave the judgment the most narrow interpretation possible. I will not go over the mistaken interpretation, the asinine and narrow interpretation which the Government deliberately gave the Louise O'Keeffe decision as it has been dealt with very effectively by Deputies Micheál Martin and Catherine Connolly. Even if the Government was correct and the Louise O'Keeffe judgment in the European Court of Human Rights meant what it stated it meant, the Government is not prevented from allowing people to access the redress fund where the evidence is absolutely clear. The Louise O'Keeffe judgment does not restrict it from going further than requiring a prior complaint.</p>
          <p eId="para_925"> We have heard all of the international evidence of children not speaking about this type of activity until later in life, the difficulties in proving prior complaints and issues back in the 1960s and 1970s, but, as if all of those things were not enough, the Government set up a second hurdle, that one had to have brought legal proceedings within the time set out in the Statute of Limitations. Anybody who consulted a solicitor about legal proceedings was told that the courts would take the view that as the teachers involved who were paid by the State were employed by school management, the State did not have a liability. That legal advice was correct and has been upheld in a number of decisions in the High Court. When the plaintiff went into a solicitor's office, he or she was told that there was no point in pursuing his or her case as he or she would be wasting his or her time and money, as well as that of the solicitor. Now we are saying if they did not ignore that advice and tell the solicitor to go ahead anyway, we cannot accommodate them. That is cynical. The Government set up a redress scheme allegedly to help people, but it framed it in such a way that virtually nobody could access it successfully. If it is so confident about its redress scheme and its legal advice that it is a wonderful scheme, how come so few have managed to avail of it? It is because they cannot surmount the two barriers the Government has erected in their way.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> The interpretation in the Louise O'Keeffe case and the artificial requirement to have brought a legal case are buttressed by another argument, a constitutional argument which is pretty convoluted from what I could make out of the Minister's explanation. It sounded to me suspiciously like gobbledygook, but I would like to see the Minister's advice on it, if he has received any from the Attorney General or anybody else. He seems to be saying that adopting our motion would mean that we would divide victims into two classes, as though we wanted to compensate one class and not the other. That is farcical, as we want to see all victims compensated. In the motion we are simply trying to reach a situation where, if the evidence is clear and the case proved beyond reasonable doubt in a criminal court conviction, the victims would be given access to the redress compensation scheme. That is not an unreasonable demand. There is no question of the floodgates opening or a victim in the absence of a conviction challenging the scheme and opening it up. Any legal opinion to that effect is not well founded and before I could give it any credence, I would like to see such advice in writing.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> The Government is emphasising the role of Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, which surprises me to some extent. I have read the terms of reference for his appointment and it is not clear to me that he is an appeal judge in respect of decisions of the redress board, or that he can reverse any of its decisions. The Government insisted on its interpretation of the Louise O'Keeffe judgment, but it is telling us tonight that it has now appointed Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill to see if it is, in fact, correct. I do not want to personalise the issue, but the Government has been extremely slow in its correspondence and communication with Mr. Justice O'Neill. It has been a while since he was appointed, but the activity and timelines do not indicate seriousness of intent on the part of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_928"> We will be pushing the motion and I hope we will receive the support of all non-Fine Gael Members of the House, as well as of the Deputies in the Minister of State's group. We are simply seeking justice, but the Government continues to hide behind evasions, legal niceties, legalese about such things as vicarious liability and references to the High Court and the Supreme Court, but these are victims of people who have admitted openly in court what they did and been convicted. Those who carried out these appalling acts had their salaries paid by the State. The acts were carried out in schools which were under the management and control of the State and which the victims were compelled, by law, to attend.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">We have had a number of Private Members' motions, and I have had one or two of them, where despite the Dáil expressing its will, in a fairly emphatic fashion, the Government has simply refused to act. That is the definition of new politics. Old politics was where the Government had an overall majority and it voted down the Opposition. With new politics, the Government does not have a majority, it loses a vote but it does nothing. </p>
          <p eId="para_930"> I want to be absolutely clear with the Minister. I agree with Deputy Thomas Byrne in that I believe the Minister feels uncomfortable about this. From my dealings with him on a day to day basis, I know he is a reasonable man. I know he has a conscience and I know he knows that those people have been treated unfairly. In terms of the difference between the State's approach to people in residential institutions and to people who were abused by known abusers in primary day schools, I know the Minister knows that, in effect, there is no difference between them and there is nothing to justify their different treatment by the State. I know he knows all this. I advise him that if this motion is carried in the vote tomorrow, I will do my damnedest to insist this is one occasion on which the will of the Dáil will be made to operate. Let the Minister maintain his amendment, if that is his wish, but let him also know this matter will not finish tonight or tomorrow after the vote.</p>

          <p eId="para_1180">We have discussed this matter at length.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">The issues that keep cropping up in this debate include road safety, first and foremost. We have cracked the nut with regard to the fact that road safety can and should be achieved through other mechanisms rather than a <i>carte blanche</i> opportunity to cut back so many hedges over a period. We have discussed the damage that can be caused to particular heathland around the country, and that we know the biodiversity of the planet and this country is collapsing despite the Government articulating a message that it is supporting the country's biodiversity. We discussed the fact that the biodiversity and our own existence are symbiotic. We rely on each other. It is important for our existence that we maintain biodiversity. These amendments simply seek to introduce into the Minister's wherewithal the protection of human life and the biodiversity of the country. If the Minister looks at the words of amendment No. 24 and votes against it, she will be voting against an amendment that simply states that the Minister may, where no other satisfactory solution exists, derogate from the restrictions of section 40(1) of the Act of 1976 to permit the management of vegetation referred to in section 1(a) and (b) being carried out in the interests of public health and safety; in the interests of air safety; to prevent serious damage to crops, livestock, forests, fisheries and water; and for the protection of flora and fauna, subject to the regulations that may exist. A vote against that proposal is a vote against the protections of the particular interests in society that would allow for the management of vegetation. It is hard to believe an amendment as positive and benign as this one would be viewed as a threat by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182"> Amendment No. 25, the other amendment I have tabled on this section, is similar and provides that the Minister may make regulations to extend, in part or parts of the State, the period of protection referred to in paragraph (a) in order to protect species covered by Article 1 of the birds directive, and to protect individual hedgerows of archaeological, historical, ecological or landscape significance. This issue was raised in last night's debate. The name of the Bill is the Heritage Bill 2016. This amendment outlines our wonderful heritage and opportunities for us to protect it. I ask the Minister to have an open mind and not to take the view that the Government will drive on regardless, a decision has been made and the Government will nail it down by not allowing for proper debate or space for Opposition to put forward positive, supportive amendments. I ask her to accept the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_436">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1183">I regret I was not able to speak last night. I had a public meeting to attend. I spoke strongly against this Bill on Second Stage because the original intent was an abominable tactic by the then Fine Gael Minister to give free rein to cut hedgerows during August. It was a disgraceful proposition. I thank Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív and others who are strongly pushing the agenda to protect birds and wildlife. Deputy Ó Cuív, through an amendment that was accepted in the Seanad and which Fianna Fáil supported, severely emasculated the measure the Government was proposing to allow any hedgerow to be cut in August. In my view, the measure is no longer operable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184"> I hope the Ceann Comhairle gives me a little latitude. I am speaking about section 7 and Deputy Tóibín's amendment. The truth is that the Minister must introduce regulations to give effect to the measure on cutting hedges on the roadside in August. The procedure is so complicated, and is cleared up by section 8 which Deputy Tóibín seeks to amend, that I believe section 7 will never come into effect or have any impact whatever. It is made clear in section 8 that hedges can be cut in accordance with the Roads Act, which allows hedge-cutting in the interests of public safety. Section 7 is now a dead duck. That is the truth of the matter. Deputy Ó Cuív put forward a compromise to try to represent all views in this area. There is no doubt that section 7 is a dead duck.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185"> I had concerns when I studied section 8 and I have looked closely at the amendment. The section seems to codify existing law. I hope that much of the debate up to this point, apart from the early stages, will amount to much ado about nothing and the position that pertains now, before the Bill has passed, will continue to be the law and there will be no change. There is no way the Minister will introduce regulations for section 7 when hedges are already allowed to be cut on the roadside. It was crazy from the outset to propose in this section that hedges could be cut and the impact on wildlife would be studied thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186"> I agree with Deputy Tóibín that it is a complete oxymoron to describe this legislation as a heritage Bill. I have no doubt the Minister, Deputy Madigan, would not have introduced the Bill if she had been the Minister at the time. She is simply doing this as a holdover from the previous Minister, who displayed no understanding whatever of the urgent necessity to protect species such as the yellowhammer which nests in August, while also respecting the important principle of road safety and ensuring the safety of human beings. The Minister would have to make regulations under section 7 and in my view, any such regulations would be pointless as they will not achieve anything. They will simple complicate matters. It is open to the Minister not to bother issuing any regulations because regulations would do nothing more than allow what is already allowed under section 8. This is messy, which is not good, but sometimes things are done that way to try to get everybody together and get legislation passed. I hope that is the case. I have expressed my strong views on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187"> I have worked closely with my colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív. I pay tribute to him for listening to the wide range of views in the Fianna Fáil Party on this issue. We support the protection of our wildlife and national heritage. The preponderance of opinion in Fine Gael does not quite get that. Nobody in this House, certainly not in my party and most other parties, can be accused of trying to undermine road safety or do anything that would endanger the safety of drivers on our roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188"> This Bill has changed to the point of emasculation. I hope I am right in that regard. If that is the case, as I believe it is, it is welcome. I thank Deputy Ó Cuív, the Green Party, Deputy Tóibín and others who have played a strong role in this debate. I also thank our colleagues in the Seanad who have worked hard on this legislation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Martin<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1189">In this section, the Government is determined to attack our hedgerows and the wealth of wildlife to which they are home. Our hedgerows act as linear forestry. They provide feeding for birds, insects and mammals. They are integral to biodiversity, pollination, nesting and future breeding. Bumblebees and wild honey bees will also suffer by extending the permitted times to slash and cut down vegetation and flowering wild plants. Bees are clinging on but they face a barrage of man-made hazards, including the pesticides that the Minister referred to last night. Pesticides are the biggest perpetrators but that does not mean we should ignore the effects that hedge-cutting has on bees. It is predicted that one third of all bee species in Ireland will be extinct by 2030 and extending the hedge-cutting dates will amount to death by 1,000 cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190"> Amendment No. 26 proposes to delete section 8 in its entirety, removing the exemption from section 40 of the Wildlife Act for work carried out under section 70 of the Roads Act. This is a point which several Deputies have raised but the Minister has not properly acknowledged. This section does not fall under the same trial period restrictions as section 7(2) but provides a permanent, complete and unregulated exception. The unregulated nature of this exception is very worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">The Minister made the point that in the context of hedge cutting under section 7(1), as a result of any ministerial regulations put forward, there would only be the cutting of a single year's growth and that flails would be prohibited but there are no such regulations under section 8. The Minister cannot hide behind the regulations she claims she will make because this is a complete and unregulated exemption entered into primary legislation. Under section 8, anything goes. More than one season's growth goes. Flails are fair game. Amendment No. 27 restricts the disapplication of section 40 of the Wildlife Act and section 8 solely to work carried out by a local authority or pursuant to a notice from a local authority. This amendment would stop section 8 from opening this exemption up to work carried out under any subsection of section 70 of the Roads Act, but would allow people to engage with local authorities to either have obstructions or hazardous material removed or to remove it themselves on foot of notice from a local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192"> Does the Minister intend to introduce a ban on the use of the flail during the nesting season where cutting for road safety is necessary? Its basic design is such that it fires hedge debris back into the heart of the hedge at high speed. Anything in the hedge that could not fly away would not stand a chance. The dangers of this type of machinery are writ large in operators' safety manuals. It is incredible to think that it can be operated on a public road by operators who have not had to pass a competency test in its safe operation. There have been fatalities with this type of machinery. A reciprocating, finger-bar type cutter would be less disruptive but such cutters are not as widespread or readily available as flail machines in many parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193"> When a local authority cuts hedges for safety purposes during the nesting season, there is invariably a flag man or two operating to ensure traffic safety while the work is under way. Does the Minister intend to create an equivalent obligation on landowners for hedge cutting to be carried out by individuals? That would make it costly for landowners and no doubt there would be those who would seek to cut corners. Will we be increasing the risk of accidents by permitting landowners to carry out unsupervised hedge cutting on the roads during the busiest month of the year? Has that been considered?</p>
          <p eId="para_1194"> I also wish to clarify statements made by the Minister yesterday. She referred to the work of Birdwatch Ireland, in the context of sections 7 and 8, as being both a flagrant distortion of the facts and unscientific. She repeatedly said yesterday that Birdwatch Ireland had said the decline in numbers of the curlew was due to burnings. Birdwatch Ireland never claimed that. It agreed with the Minister's experts that habitat loss and degradation are the primary reasons that there are only 120 breeding pairs of curlews left in the country. However, Birdwatch Ireland has advised that a relaxation of burning regulations could put the curlew over the edge as a result of habitat loss and degradation. The curlew is not necessarily in the position it is in because of the burning and Birdwatch Ireland never made that claim. However, the Minister's new regulations will sound its death knell. It is important that the Minister understands that she is misinformed and is misattributing to Birdwatch Ireland statements that it simply has not made. With respect, when one is making accusations of misinformation, it is important that one is properly informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195"> The changes in this section and the previous one are the most significant roll back of the legal protections for wildlife in the history of the State. Now is the time when we should be increasing our protection for vulnerable wildlife rather than reducing it. There are no positive changes for wildlife as a result of the Bill. Tá an Comhaontas Glas go mór i gcoinne an Bhille seo mar is léir don dall go mbeidh tubaistí gan aon mhaith ag eiceolaíocht na hÉireann agus cothóidh an Bille seo slad mór millteanach ar oidhreacht nádúrtha na tíre.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T21:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1196">I wish to speak about the protection of a very important species, namely, the human species. I am going to relay a true story about a lady. I will not give her name because she is now deceased but it is no harm to recount her story and how she was affected by this issue we are debating. Despite her advanced years, this lady travelled on a certain road every morning on her bicycle. She visited cattle she kept in a certain location outside of the village in which she lived in south Kerry. She was used to travelling the road, year in and year out. The road used to be maintained by Kerry County Council by means of councillors' allocations until such time as councillors not just in Kerry but throughout the country were stopped from using their councillors' allocation to cut hedges. From then on, it was the responsibility of the landowners. As the Minister is aware, in many cases the approach taken was haphazard. One landowner might cut his hedges but in another case the landowner might not even be living in this country. Certain sections of the road were being maintained and others were not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197"> On a particular morning, the lady to whom I refer was cycling on her bicycle on the road and, unfortunately, she was caught by a briar that was hanging out over the road. While we are talking about the protection of birds and bees, will anyone spare a thought for this woman and what happened to her? A very strong briar caught her face and the briar pulled the eye out of its socket and out of her head. That is what happened to her as a result of an overgrown hedge. I would like to hear people talk in this House about the protection of human life when it comes to cutting hedges on the roadside. I would also like people to think about stories like that in this context. It is not as if I do not have a fondness for wildlife and an urge to protect it as much and possibly more than some of the people who profess to be the God-given saviours of wildlife and fauna. I have always said the best people to protect the countryside and all the animals that are in it are the people who own certain sections of it because they were brought up with land and they adore every inch of it whether it is their own, their neighbour's or their friend's.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198"> I want that woman to be remembered tonight while we are discussing hedges. In a time when some people might go running to a solicitor or head for the High Court, does the Minister think she ever mentioned it to Kerry County Council, the landowner or anybody else? She said not a thing in the world. There was never a solicitor's letter written to anybody and there was never a word about it. Her sight was gone from her eye as a result of the horrific injury she suffered that morning but there was never a word about it. She never did or said anything; she went quietly along for the rest of her remaining years with one eye. That was what happened to her as a result of overgrown briars on roadside hedges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199"> When we are talking about wildlife - birds and bees - I would like us to remember humans. Road safety is of paramount importance and it is discussed in the House a great deal but we must bring it into focus when we are talking about the cutting and maintenance of hedges. Whatever month it is, hedges should be cut for reasons of road safety but only roadside hedges, not those in fields or anywhere else. Hedges should be cut on minor and major roads in the interest of the motorists, cyclists and walkers who use them. That is our first duty in the interest of road safety for the users of the roads. County councils should be allowed to restore the practice that obtained in the past whereby hardworking councillors throughout the country could use their councillors' allocation. Local authorities did a great job of maintaining hedges at that time but, unfortunately, many of our roads are getting narrower, which means cars stay out too far from the hedges and go around bends in the middle of the road when another car is coming. There is nothing being said about that. Whatever one does, one should not kill or endanger a bird or bee, but do not mind people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">It seems that a particular traffic agenda is being put forward by some Members. Anything that can be done to protect road users and assist our councillors, local authorities and landowners to cut back roadside hedgerows when necessary, whether that be in January, June, February, April or at any other time, should be done in the interest of the safety of road users.</p>

          <p eId="para_1202">How many accidents the cause of which is unattributed occurred as a direct result of overgrown hedges? Neither the RSA, local authorities, the Garda Síochána nor any other organisation has an accurate figure for the number of deaths, serious injuries and other injuries caused by the lack of maintenance of hedges on our roads. The Members who continually talk about birds and bees should start thinking about humans as well because the human species is fairly important and keeping them alive is quite high on my agenda.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_441">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1203">The story told by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae is horrific and was tragic for the lady involved. There is no doubt that hedgerows should be maintained such that they are not a danger to people such as that lady or any other road user. That is beyond question. The Members who are concerned about the Bill do not suggest that we should disregard road safety but, rather, the contrary, as we have repeatedly stated. Most of those on my side of this debate have vociferously advocated for road safety in many other debates in the House. Although the story told by the Deputy is a terrible one and there is no doubt that we must find measures to ensure that hedgerows and roadways are maintained such that they are not a danger to road users, whether walkers, cyclists or motorists, it does not follow that the measures in the Bill are the way to go about doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204"> It is equally important to maintain the biodiversity of the country and the planet because humans, birds, bees, plants and trees are interconnected and interdependent. We need each other. If we disregard one species in the misguided belief that we are prioritising another, we will be cutting off our nose to spite our face. That is what is happening on the macro global level: we have damaged our environment to the extent that it is questionable whether we will be able to sustain human life in the longer term and whether some parts of the world will remain habitable. Parts of the planet are turning into deserts because of a lack of biodiversity and the impact of climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205"> Great civilisations have collapsed because of degradation of the environment. As I have previously stated in the House, the great civilisations of ancient Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt collapsed because they did not pay enough attention to the maintenance of the canal network which fertilised the river plains and maintained the biodiversity and fertility of those areas. That is where the biblical myths of plagues of locusts and so on come from. The civilisations collapsed because they failed to protect the things that sustained them. That is exactly what is now happening on a global level. When a third of bee species are threatened with extinction, it is not just about the bees, it is about us and the pollination of the crops we need to produce the food we eat to survive. That is what we are talking about. Nature is about interconnection. It is an ecosystem in which all species are interconnected and interdependent but we are destroying huge parts of that ecosystem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206"> I often raise the issue of forestry but hedgerows and scrub are of similar importance. Scrub is a baby forest. A hedgerow is a linear forest. The desperately low level of forest cover in this country is a serious problem. Farmers may point out that they have to make a living from the land and they are absolutely right. I agree with them. We must help, support and incentivise farmers to protect biodiversity and increase afforestation and the natural wild growth which will sustain biodiversity. It should not be an us-against-them debate. I have no doubt that the vast majority of farmers know far more about land and wildlife than do I. However, the economic pressure on farmers can sometimes lead them into conflict with the best guardianship of the land as a whole. That is not through a lack of care and it is not the fault of farmers but that pressure exists. It is evident in debates on the national herd and its expansion, which is tied in with global markets and profit. It is not the fault of small farmers and this debate is not about being against farmers. We want to support farmers, who should get handsomely paid for maintaining the diversity of the land, increasing afforestation and allowing the regeneration of natural scrub and forestry. We should not allow the current tension on this issue to lead to the further depletion of biodiversity on the land because that would damage us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207"> On amendment No. 26, which seeks to delete section 8, I agree with Deputy Michael Healy-Rae that at the root of this problem is that local authorities no longer have enough employees to maintain the roads and cut back dangerous trees or hedgerows. We now leave it to individuals to do so and give them the legal power to make decisions about whether a hedgerow is a danger to road users. That is not the way we should do things. People should be employed by the local authorities to maintain the hedgerows rather than <i>carte blanche</i> being given to landowners<i>
						</i>to cut down hedgerows in a manner which is damaging to biodiversity and which, consequently, affects animal and human life.</p>

          <p eId="para_1210">A woman I knew was knocked down and killed on a road and it was never ascertained whether the driver who struck her, who did not come from a pub but who left the scene, had been drinking. He did not come forward. That incident inspired me to fixate on every aspect of the issue of road safety. Amendment No. 27 would contribute to road safety. Rather than giving <i>carte blanche</i> to landowners as the Minister and Fianna Fáil suggest, the amendment proposes being very forensic and specific by making reference to section 70(2)(b) and (9) of the Roads Act 1993 such that a person authorised or instructed by the council to cut back a hedge in a situation where there is a safety hazard would be compelled to so, which may take place at any time of year and that the local authority, should it consider that the person may not do so, retains its traditional ability to cut back the hedge to ensure road safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">No one should question in any way the interest of Members on this side of the House in road safety and their willingness to address that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212"> Another protection we want to ensure is protection of nature, which we believe is important for the reasons Deputy Boyd Barrett outlined. We are part of an ecological system and when we narrow that system, it brings risks, consequences and knock-on effects that sometimes take a long time to see and are not easy to correlate but are very real. The protection of many bird and bee species is not an insignificant issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213"> The Minister's attack in the debate last night on Birdwatch Ireland was incredible and inexcusable. Birdwatch Ireland is a very large reputable organisation that is part of an international organisation. Fifteen thousand people in this country dedicate a lot of their time on a voluntary basis to this cause and to disparage and discredit them in the way the Minister did it last night was wrong. I do not know whether the words she used came from the Department. If they did, there is a real question for the public service to answer in its attitude and approach to the passing of this legislation. If they were the Minister's words, I ask her to withdraw the comments and apologise to perfectly decent and good people who are asking that science would apply in the application of this legislation. On Committee Stage, the Minister changed the percentage in terms of the effect of what was happening in every second sentence. If we are talking about scientific accuracy, fairness and rigour we should start here in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214"> We should scrap this entire Bill and do the scientific analysis that is called upon to understand exactly what is happening in our natural world. Part of the problem is that we do not know what is going on because we do not do enough monitoring. We do not know enough about what is happening with our breeding birds and when they are breeding. The best scientific analysis we have indicates that this provision threatens the yellowhammer, one of the birds on the red list which is threatened with extinction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215"> There are many different avenues we could take in promoting our amendments. The Minister was satisfied yesterday that we had gone through a consultation process yet the vast majority of the responses in that process had raised serious concern about the threat to wildlife in the provisions for change being advanced. In terms of that consultation process, I have a letter from the head of environmental assessment in the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to the National Parks and Wildlife Service. When asked to consider the approach that should be taken, it stated: "[...] any changes are to be considered that they be based on scientific evidence as to their relative merits as biodiversity protection and enhancement measures and as general environmental protection measures." The EPA further states: "If insufficient evidence is available at this point in time and if there is a need for further research and study of the existing controls then it would be more prudent to leave the controls as they are until such research is completed."</p>
          <p eId="para_1216"> I listened intently on Committee Stage to the reason we were doing this and the only accurate answer I could measure was that it would be handy for contractors. That is not scientific evidence that justifies what will be open season on hedgerow cutting in August. I see no other reason. In discussions with Fianna Fáil on this it seems the only reason it will not vote against the Government is because it believes the local authorities would not respond quickly enough. If that is the concern, that behoves us to resource the local authorities and the National Parks and Wildlife Service and to take road safety and environmental protection seriously and not throw our hands up in the air and say that in respect of environmental laws, no one believes in them, no one applies them in Ireland and we can never get local authorities to answer a telephone call. If that is the reason this Bill is going through the House, that is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217"> I beseech Fianna Fáil Members, for their own health of mind, to consider amendment No. 27, which is all about road protection and doing the right thing in terms of road safety but doing that through our local authorities. If they are not to be trusted we should up their game and give them the resources they need to get this right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218"> Every Member knows that once the word goes out from here that the hedgerows can now be cut in August, that will be done wholesale. No one will be prosecuted and what is advanced in terms of science and environmental protection will go out the window because people will say that is the new rule. That would be a tragic loss.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T21:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1219">As someone who comes from a farming background and is still farming, I wish to make a few points about issues that were mentioned earlier. I have a hedgecutter with flails and anyone who has driven one would know that it does not throw the cuttings into the hedge. It puts the cuttings behind the vehicle and a person has to clean up the cuttings. That clarification needs to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220"> Regarding the question as to whether these contractors and farmers are going out to do this work willy-nilly and the safety procedures they will follow, the law of the land applies to a contractor or a farmer. The safety procedures they have to follow are the same for a council worker, a contractor or a farmer. They have to put up the signs, set up properly and must have insurance cover. The reason they have that is because we saw what the national parks were put through a year ago. I read about it in the newspapers and saw it on television. They put amenities in place for people in certain counties and then had to spend hundreds of thousands of euro defending themselves in the courts because they were sued. The same applies to a farmer or a contractor. The insurance premium for a contractor is high, but that is the reality we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221"> I said last night and I repeat now, and I ask the Minister to listen, that under GLAS farmers have to adhere to stringent measures, one of which applies to placing sand down for bees. I explained about this last night. I do not have 40 letters after my name but I listen to what farmers are saying. One would learn more from them in an hour than many a person with 40 letters after their name. Farmers tell me day in, day out that the sand has worked, everything is lovely but, unfortunately, some wildlife are eating other species of wildlife. That is something we may have to address. I do not know how we will solve that but the principle of what is being done by farmers to improve the environment, through the GLAS scheme, is working. That must be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222"> The issue of scrub vegetation needs to be addressed. I am sure Deputies Boyd Barrett and Eamon Ryan would agree with me on that. Heather grows in Deputy Ó Cuív's area and in mountain areas but it does not grow to be a tree, and neither do briars. However, under the single farm payment scheme a farmer must show that his land is being grazed. The hills were overstocked at one time. The experts then came in and said the stock had to be cut down to X amount. Sheep will not decide to eat a bit of grass to make sure the agricultural inspector thinks everything is lovely. They will go to the sweetest pick, as we call it down the country, and a piece of the land may not be grazed. Unfortunately, those farmers' grants will be cut. Under the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, a budget should be given to the national parks to assist farmers who have designated land because they are fearful when someone calls to their property with respect to the grazing section of their land. This issue has not been solved. Something needs to be done about it, and I would be fully in favour of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223"> It was said earlier that from August onwards, farmers will be driving up and down the roads doing this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">That is not their aim; there is plenty to do other than doing that. There are roads in rural parts of Ireland that are about 2 m or 2.5 m wide. This minute people would probably only get a bicycle down them. There are cars being scratched on either side. These are the problems that have to be addressed. Some of it is ordinary grass, and there are branches or the hedge growing out. It is not that they are going to demolish every hedge; that is not their business. The one thing they need to be able to do is go up and down the road as best as possible. I will finish at that because I am not going to hog the time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1225">A lot of politicians are all talk about the protection of the environment when in fact they collude in its destruction. We only have to look at the situation in Bantry Bay where this Government and previous Governments granted a mechanical harvesting licence against the people's wishes. The licence will cause havoc to the sea waters of Bantry Bay and will have a huge effect on the livelihoods of fishermen. Not alone this Government but previous Governments going back many years played a part in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226"> Tonight we are debating whether the burning of our uplands in March and the cutting of our roadside hedgerows in August should be allowed. I am a farmer and like all farmers I have full respect for all living creatures, from livestock to birds to bees. I do not have a wish to create any harm to any living creature but I have to be realistic. A bit of common sense has to apply about the livelihoods of people who are dependent on the land. It is becoming massively difficult for farmers. I see this in my own constituency in areas of west Cork, farmers on the Mizen Head, Bantry, Skibbereen, Ballyroe, Timoleague, Ballinascarthy, Sheep's Head, Beara and Dunmanway. The list goes on. They are all finding it difficult to make a living and they are pushed to the pin of their collar.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227"> I have pleaded with the Minister not to punish farmers whose land has been burned through no fault of their own. In the current heatwave the risk of farmland getting accidentally burned is extremely high. I have seen farmers being accused of burning their own lands in the prohibited period, but in all honesty no farmer in his right mind would do this and suffer the severe penalties afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228"> I heard one Deputy saying that farmers should get paid for the protection of nature on their lands. They do not realise many of these farmers got fined tens of thousands of euro four or five years ago for having gorse on their land. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine issued them with massive fines. I know there is a legal case pending in that regard but it has been ongoing for quite some time. There is no help here. There is no funding available for farmers to protect their lands because every time they do so, there is a massive fine applied to them. A lot of farmers' land was burned through no fault of their own out of season last year and a lot of them have not received payments. If a fire was started on the roadside by somebody passing, that farmer and many of his neighbours ended up being refused payments on the basis that their lands were burned through no fault of their own. The Department has to have more understanding of this issue. If it cannot legally prove who burned the lands, it should step back and make the payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229"> People are talking about our hedgerows and I ask them to look again and take note of the continued problem of litter being dumped into them. We are all here tonight talking about this Bill and what is the best for nature. We need to accept that billions of tonnes of plastic in landfill or in the sea are destroying our natural habitats. We need to address this urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230"> Someone who is in the countryside at the moment need only look over the hedgerows to see the sad sight of cattle standing in dry, dusty pastures with severe water shortages. These cattle are being fed from the first cut silage and next winter's fodder without any sign of growth. Farmers have suffered greatly in the last year with the fodder crisis and now the shortage of water. This affects them into next year, not just now. I am calling on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to put provisions in place. Let us not repeat the mistakes of the fodder crisis we had earlier this year by reacting when it is too late. We need action now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231"> One Deputy mentioned road deaths. We have had a lot of discussion about that issue in the last number of months. It has led to at least some understanding of rural Ireland and is some start in the right direction but it has taken us quite a long time to get the Minister to make moves. People make a lot of assumptions. During Storm Ophelia, roadside trees were the cause of three deaths in one day alone. People make assumptions if somebody dies or if somebody leaves a scene that the person was drinking. That is a crazy assumption and until they have proof people should not be making such assumptions and they should not be voting on a certain issue until they understand what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232"> Verge cutting in August is a mistake - it should be all the year around - but it is a move in the right direction. When I was a child, Cork County Council workers used to be out every day during the summer. They did a fabulous job keeping the roadside lovely and clean and kept the people safe and sound in their community. Now when they are driving into a crossroads, people are pushing half the car out across the main road to make sure the road is clear to pass on the left and right and they are getting blown off the road. It is an absolute terror. I commend the thousands of people who are out with their strimmers every night cutting back the roadsides along their roads because of the dangers. It is obvious that a lot of city Deputies do not understand. It is beautiful weather and I invite everyone from the urban side of politics to book a holiday in rural Ireland and get to see the real facts of what is happening there, how people are trying to get about their daily business. They could do it in the 1960s, 70s and 80s and by God all those birds and bees were well protected by them but they cannot do it at all now. We cannot cut a verge. </p>
          <p eId="para_1233"> I commend Cork County Council on making a fund available when the season is open. In my own community in Goleen every verge was cut in October or November last year by way of a grant that was applied for. It cost maybe €10,000 but it was well used and greatly appreciated by everybody. I heard nobody objecting to it. I have people coming into my constituency office pleading with me to get the verges cut and saying their road is in an appalling state. We are not talking about inside a ditch at all. I am in organic farming myself so I really have a fairly good understanding of nature. We are talking about roadside verges that have to be maintained. People are going back to the car rental companies and they are not getting their deposits back. It is shocking bad for tourism. Their cars are being damaged and torn asunder with briars. I will support the Bill as best I can.</p>

          <p eId="para_1234">I want to say this as sensitively and as diplomatically as I can. There is an argument and a construct being put before us that somehow the rural Deputies are being set in conflict with the city Deputies. I utterly reject that on the basis of what has already been said. Despite the danger of repetition, I think it needs to be said again that there has been the deregulation of local authorities' role in the maintenance of our local environment. Despite the introduction of the property tax, which was fiercely resisted, the facilities, staffing and autonomy of the local authorities to carry out the role they are supposed to perform has been seriously undermined. Therefore, whether people are near Goleen or in Kilgarvan or in Ballyfermot or Crumlin, they will witness overgrowth, neglect and problems with the way our environment is ignored by local authorities that are underfunded and understaffed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235"> This Bill does exactly what we do not need. It introduces risks to our environment and to our already endangered species; it introduces a divide between rural and urban Ireland on a very false and obscene basis, to be honest, and it does so without consulting the people who have to live and work in these areas or indeed the scientists and naturalists who understand what is happening with the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">I am appealing to the Minister to scrap sections 7 and 8 and to open up a public consultation on these issues - one that unites the country and all people with an interest in a society that funds the maintenance of the public space in a proper way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237"> I must admire rural Deputies who are very eloquent in the way they tell stories. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae would have us listening to his lovely Kerry sing-song accent all night talking about the woman who nearly lost her eye-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1239">-----and that is a dreadful story. By the way, people in cities almost lose their eyes sometimes when they pass by hedgerows and trees that are not cut properly by local authorities. I have every sympathy for that woman and I believe every word the Deputy said but it is not just a problem in rural Ireland. It also happens in cities where there is neglect of our environment. We regularly trip over uneven paths and break bones and regularly fall over tree stumps that are breaking up through the concrete on our roads. Another eloquent story I heard yesterday was told by Deputy Ó Cuív when he described how they used to cut back the hedges and bend back the trees to allow them to grow in a certain way so they were training them back and at the same time, preserving the wildlife. He referred to the method involved by using a beautiful Irish word. I would love to know more about that. Why do we not revert to that sort of maintenance of our environment instead of saying "Here you go. Off you pop and slash and burn"? It is not good enough and it does not represent what is needed in this tiny island which is already suffering the effects of climate change, which some people do not believe in, and other aspects of the degradation of the environment. It should not be the farmers or the city slickers that bear the cost. Instead, the Minister should scrap these sections and open up a proper scientific debate and public consultation about what needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240"> One of the conclusions will be that we need to fund the local authorities and control this properly. Most of the Deputies here - including myself and Deputies Boyd Barrett and Gino Kenny - previously served as councillors. We know the difficulty local authorities face in putting their budgets together. We know how many people come screaming at us complaining that the councils are not cutting down the trees, that trees are growing over roadways and that children are running into them. There are ways around all of that. One way is to draft an alternative Bill which directs the Government to restore the local authority fund in full. The Government slashed that fund to bits over the past decade. It needs to restore both the fund and the staffing complement, end any embargo on recruitment and begin to look at these issues in a sensible, controlled and regulated way where matters are not left to individuals. Deputy Michael Collins's neighbours should not have to be out cutting hedges every night of the week. Regardless of whether people enjoy doing that, they should not be obliged do it. Hedge cutting should be done by the local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241"> I want to challenge the idea that minor roads are dangerous. My car gets scraped every night on the roads I come through in Ballyfermot. I am sure rented cars get scraped when they are going through Kilgarvan or Connemara but that is not the issue. Places are made dangerous because they are badly maintained. It is not that we set out deliberately to say "Eff you in the country. All we care about are the birds and bees." Of course, we care about the people who inhabit the area. We were one of the chief organisations to mount that protest over the harvesting of kelp in Bantry Bay. Our branch of People Before Profit in west Cork got stuck in there and helped to organise that because we care about the environment and the relationship people in this country have with it. The Minister and her Department clearly do not. What was in their heads while they were drafting this Bill to placate some element of Irish society instead of treating the environment as a precious gift that belongs to all of us and that we must research, look at scientifically and moderately and discuss together instead of dividing us between them over there and us over here as if we have a problem? We should be working together on the one theme and that is heritage. The Minister has responsibility for heritage. She has an opportunity tonight to behave in a ministerial manner and support these amendments.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_450">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T21:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1242">If we could bottle all the conversation here, we could sell it at a profit - perhaps to tourists. I appreciate the difficulties facing people who are farming either on a small or large scale. It is a business but it is very much a heritage issue where people are in many ways custodians of the land that they hope in turn to pass on to their families or somebody else in their community. Many young people - and I am quite sure individuals over here are very knowledgeable about it - are turning against consuming meat of any kind because they find the kind of farming that is now practised lacking in humaneness and are no longer convinced of the quality of many agricultural standards, regardless of whether these relate to animals or to what companies such as Monsanto have done in terms of using chemicals and science in the area of agricultural development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243"> We all - farmers and people who live in urban areas - have a mutual interest in ensuring that we respect and care for the environment and that we hand it on to our children and grandchildren. Traditionally, that has been a really strong value in rural Ireland and it has given rise to the sense of kinship, community and meitheal that is so strong. What is disappointing and sad about this debate is the fact that it is a confrontation between two sides that do not want to compromise. Unfortunately, Fine Gael is brokering this negativity in a way which really does not help people in cities and which, in the long term, has the potential to be very destructive for farming, farm-based agribusiness development and tourism in rural areas. Deputy Michael Collins spoke about west Cork. We all understand that unlike west Dublin, west Cork is very unlikely to get an IT company popping in to set up operations and create 1,000 jobs. In real terms, farm incomes and sustainable businesses, including agribusinesses and tourism interests, are vital to keeping people in and visitors coming to these areas. I am not nervous about the people who are talking about farming understanding what they are talking about but I am nervous about the approach that is driving this Bill, which is essentially all about how to do it in the most convenient way but which could turn out to be the most destructive way. Many Deputies, Senators and parties have made a reasonable request to the Minister to consult and to share the relevant information on the scientific evidence regarding what is best. It is true that many people in towns and cities worry when they see hillsides burning. Again, if the latter is done at appropriate times of the year and in a controlled way that does not put species in danger - be it in terms of pollinators, insects, birds and other wildlife - that is critically important. I am disappointed that the Minister is unwilling to address these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244"> Deputy Ó Cuív and I have had a lot of involvement with the rural social scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">Deputy Ó Cuív initiated what is a very good initiative that is very popular in rural Ireland. I think the small extension which the Government has made consequent upon more prosperity is ridiculously small. Right around rural Ireland there is a problem with employment. There is some employment but there is not enough for all of the people who want to be active and who can contribute. Part of the solution to some of the problems which have been aired tonight is around essentially looking after the habitat in a way which is good for humans and lets the people living there, whether it is the middle of winter or the middle of summer, live in a reasonable way, just as we want to do in the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246"> Will the Minister cite the science on which her approach has been based? In the context of tourism, I cannot understand the reasons for extending the burning seasons or the unwillingness to accept the arguments in regard to hedge cutting. Deputy Ó Cuív made a remark last night that if one looks out from his part of Cornamona, one will see the hedges are getting bigger, not smaller. I know the area pretty well, as the Deputy knows. All over Ireland, but particularly in the east, the big difference is that more and more fields are being amalgamated, with the hedges being grubbed out. Therefore, although there may be some bigger hedges, there is a massive reduction in the number of hedgerows on the island of Ireland. We have no data in terms of an actual count, which again is scientific data we should have for a proper discussion. I support the amendments. The Minister needs to think twice.</p>

          <p eId="para_1247">I am glad to get the opportunity to talk again on the Bill because, as I see it, it is one of the most important Bills to come into this Chamber since I have come here. What this is about is the right of people in rural areas to have a safe road to their door, and that is all they are asking. The Members around me in the House have no briars prohibiting them from getting to their doors. I have no personal gripe with them but I have listened to enough rubbish now and I am taking no more of it. This Bill is about allowing people to go safely on narrow roads to their door and allowing their children and old people to walk and cycle without their eyes being taken out. All we are doing here is extending hedge cutting to allow people to cut in the month of August. If I had my way, the roadside hedges would be cut all the year round, full stop. We are entitled to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248"> Those supporting these amendments have the Luas, trains, buses, taxis and everything else and they do not give one damn. They are taken to their door and they do not have to operate a car, pay tax or insurance or pay for anything else, but they want to stop the people in rural Ireland from having a safe passage to their door. I regret it but that is what they are trying to do.</p>

        <speech by="#DannyHealyRae" eId="spk_453">
          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T21:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1251">They were addressing me when they were looking this way. I can look around too, Acting Chairman, and I am entitled to do that. I will tell you one thing, Acting Chairman. I have no gripe with birds, bees or any other thing like that, and I would love to hear the curlew singing. However, they have the countryside besides the roadside - they have all the rest of the country. We are not saying when the hedges should be cut in the rest of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252"> In addition, we are asking that farmers be allowed to burn their scrubland because they are being fined by Europe if they do not have their ground clean. In that type of ground, if anyone in the House does not know it, people cannot operate a lawn-mower, a mowing machine or a forage harvester. The only way they can clean these places is by what I would call controlled burning. Farmers are being blamed for burning and gorse fires. I want to mention two sad stories from places where people did not get their payments for their Christmas dinner, in Tuosist to the west of Kenmare and in Awnaskirtaun near Rathmore. The people involved did not set the fires or put the fires there. They reported them to the fire brigade and gave every help they could to stop the fires but they are still without most of their payments, which is not right. All they are asking for is to be allowed to burn their ground for the month of March. It is allowed in the North of Ireland, which is the same country, until 15 April. What is so different about us here? It is ridiculous.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253"> I heard Deputy Burton say there is something wrong with the way farmers are producing meat and that people are moving away from meat. Farmers were never more regulated and they produce their products to the highest standard. They have done everything they can to help the environment by building slatted tanks and slatted sheds, they are holding effluent and doing everything that is required and requested of them. They are doing their level best and it is very wrong to blame the farmer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254"> What I will fight for is the people of rural Ireland, who are entitled to a safe road to their door. There are deaths on our roads and I would like to eliminate as many of them as possible. We had the death of poor Denise Crowley before Christmas last year. We asked for a simple thing, to change the speed limit signs in Glenflesk village. Down the road at Rusheenbeg, where five people had been killed one after the other, we asked for a safety barrier but we did not get it and we have not got it yet, although several other elected representatives have asked for it besides me. What we are asking for now, and it has been asked for in our local authority for the last ten years or more, is that the roadside hedges are cut so people can come and go safely.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255"> If people were interested in ground nesting birds, there are other things we could do. We could talk about vermin, mink, foxes, magpies, grey crows, badgers and rats. They are hurting the nests way more than what it is suggested this Bill will do in regard to cutting roadside hedges. That is a fact. They should go after them but they will not do that at all. They will only go after the poor people in rural Ireland and ensure their roads are made narrower, with trees falling down on them. We cannot touch a tree, a bush or a briar. They say: "Let them suffer on, let them manage any way they can, and do not allow the roadside hedges to be cut."</p>
          <p eId="para_1256"> I am very critical of the Government for certain things it is not doing and will remain so. However, I support it 100% in what it is doing in the Bill. If I had my way, and I had an amendment down on this, I would ask that the hedges be cut all year round, but we will take this much for now because the people really need it to make the roads safe. Our roads are narrow whereas there is no problem up here. Here, they have motorways, with three lanes going down one side and three or maybe four coming up the other side, and the sides of those roads are being cut all year round - they are cut the whole time. Why make fish of one and something else of the other? It is just not fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257"> I have no personal gripe about this but it will hurt rural Ireland if it is not addressed. I appeal to those putting forward the amendments to give over because it will create a divide eventually if they try to stop these roadside hedges being cut and stop burning for the month of March. These are minimal requirements and we would not fight so hard for them except people out there are waiting for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">I ask the Minister to progress the legislation as quickly as possible given the huge number of people who are asking for it. Their roads are in a shocking state.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T22:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1259">Deputy Eamon Ryan is correct in one regard but it does not relate to the amendments under discussion. He is right in that the Bill in its original form allowed contractors to cut in August. I have no doubt of that. However, a Fianna Fáil amendment was accepted in the Seanad to do away with that justification. No contractor is pulling out a machine to do just one of the eight faces of a hedge in a field. We are talking about an issue that Fianna Fáil has dealt with. I have to take issue also with Deputy Burton on the market for meat drying up. Cattle have been of huge importance in Ireland going all the way back to mythology and Queen Medb but that has not been so true of the growing of grains. When one looks at the topography of a large part of the country, one realises that a lot of fields, including most of the fields where I live, are not fit for ploughing. Cattle and sheep have been the way to farm those lands for centuries upon centuries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260"> We have had a great Second Stage debate, but we should look at section 8 and the proposed amendment to it. Section 8 provides that the Road Traffic Act 1993 is excluded from any prohibition in the Bill. We should look at what the Road Traffic Act provides as that is what is at issue here as opposed to the talk that has been going on here for the past hour. It states explicitly that the owner or occupier of land shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on land is not a hazard or potential hazard to persons using public roads and that it does not obstruct or interfere with the safe use of a public road or the maintenance of a public road. The Wildlife Act as enacted contradicted the Road Traffic Act. If one tried to bring a prosecution under the former of a person who had cut a hedge in the closed period on a road for safety reasons, his or her solicitor would have quoted the Road Traffic Act to the judge and said there were two Acts in conflict. The legal understanding I have is that what we are doing here is to have these rhyming for once. The Road Traffic Act will not be made illegal by another Act even though in itself it is still legal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261"> I remember being on a local authority. Time and again, it said the legal responsibility to cut roadside hedges rested with the owner of the land and not with the local authority. Certainly, my local authority cuts hedges in winter, for which we are grateful. It does the main roads and not every bóithrín. One gets lots of people ringing to beg one to get the hedge cutter in given the major challenge presented by the type of farming and society we have, particularly with older people who have no way of cutting hedges in occupation of properties. We are allowing an owner-occupier to cut a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on land to ensure it is not a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road. It is no more or less than that. Any other cutting of hedges in the closed period will be illegal. It is as simple as that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262"> One must also consider the practicality of this. Does anyone think a person will hire a contractor just for the fun of cutting outside hedges? I note the cost of hiring a contractor and getting that contractor, the required safety equipment and the necessary warning signs in place to cut a few hundred yards of hedge. It is not just a question of coming down the road and cutting the hedge. Why would anyone do that in the middle of summer if there were not an urgent safety issue? A great deal of hedge cutting in the area where I live is more likely to be done with hand-held strimmers than by the larger tractor-mounted equipment. Little is going to change. The idea that there is a whole lot of people out there waiting to cut hedges fails to recognise the sensible dynamic here, which is that one can cut a hedge for one reason only, namely safety. That is the only thing that is legal. There is no incentive in any event to go beyond that as it would not be economical for the farmer. The problem is often one of getting owners to cut hedges which are lethally dangerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263"> There has been a wide debate. I agree that nature is under threat not only in the countryside, but in the cities as well. I grew up within a mile of this building and I note that a lot of the lungs that were in the city have disappeared in my lifetime. Many of the large gardens and even the urban farms that used to exist are gone. There was a great deal of life in the city when there were long gardens at the backs of the houses not far from here, which are now covered in Tarmac or which have been built on to provide mews housing. There has been an intensification of building in the city, which I regret. I remember being woken up by the dawn chorus here. While I regret that, it is a question of having to house our people. One cannot have it every way. There are massive challenges for wildlife and I do not make light of them. What we are doing here, however, is minor. We are simply making it legal to do no more or less than is required of a landowner. It is not something optional but is rather an obligation on a landowner under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993. We should stick to the subject.</p>

          <p eId="para_1264">I thank the Acting Chairman for letting me in. I am sorry I was not here earlier, albeit I was here for the votes and I am aware that this is a difficult and challenging matter. The Bill has had a long gestation and it has been widely debated. We have met people from all sides on it. I should declare an interest first in that I am an agricultural and plant contractor who is often involved in clearing vegetation and work like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265"> We have to get the balance right between the environment, our flora and fauna and the need to have productive crops. I recall that ten years ago, set-aside was at its height. There is still set-aside. One was paid by Europe to spray the finest land in the Golden Vale in Tipperary and everywhere else in the country. It was part of the EU's deal-making. To this day, I consider it to have been abhorrent. It was a scorched earth policy. Everything was sprayed in the fields and one was paid to do it. It was regressive and contrary to nature. A field mouse could not live there. There were just ploughed fields. It was like the scorched earth one sees in wartime. As such, policies we have had here and at EU level over a long number of years have been detrimental to wildlife.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266"> I remember cutting hay with a finger bar mower. One cut from the headlands in and tried to mind the corncrake and pheasants. There was generally a buachaill or cailín on the tractor too and one often got off the tractor to encourage the pheasants and other wildlife to move away from the machinery and back to the sward. That does not happen with the massive equipment being used now. A large mower is brought to a field to cut an 18 ft or 20 ft swathe with everything going into the middle. God help anything that is before it. That is mechanisation and modernisation, however, and the way agricultural contractors and farmers must operate to keep up with the times.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">The cost of these machines is unbelievable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268"> The reason I support parts of the Bill is that when it comes down to either the health and safety of a human being or the safety and protection of wildlife species, I come down straight on the side of the health and safety of a human being.

          <p eId="para_1270">I know that. I am making the comparison. It is part of it, a chathaoirligh. Road safety, the cutting back of roadside hedges and the felling of trees on the roadside are paramount. It must be done. As a young boy of only about seven, I was in a car one Saturday afternoon when a tree was felled. I was cut out of the car with my late mother and my late brother - they were not killed in the accident, thankfully, but they died since. We were cut out by a fire brigade so I know what it is like to have a roadside tree fall on a vehicle. That time, the man cutting it did not block the road. At that stage, one did not get a licence. It fell the wrong way on top of us. I have been in many a storm ever since and I am frightened of my life of trees. A young man lost his life in my area in storm Ophelia, with a tree and another one 20 miles away in Aglish in County Waterford did too.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271"> It is important that we are in a position to act. There is nothing worse than residents, homeowners and road users contacting us on a daily basis to say that they cannot walk, cycle or do anything on the road because of the bushes hanging out. We are told a lovely excuse from the local authority that from March to September we cannot cut the hedges. They love to give that answer which is ridiculous. Health and safety and the protection of life and limb and well-being must be a priority above all else. That is why I am here. I am trying to achieve the balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272"> Gun clubs and other clubs such as fishing clubs do Trojan work maintaining hedgerows. They want an organised burn of the hill for the gorse where I live, in Tipperary, on the Knockmealdown Mountains. They have done considerable work. In Monaghan, I have a brother-in-law involved in an organised burn in the Slieve Felim Mountains and they outed themselves to protect it and not go to NPWS. I would not encourage anyone to even light a match in this powder-keg weather, but that is done at different times of the year to nurture the gorse and wildlife. There are a lot of misunderstandings about what they do. The Ardfinnan, Ballybacon, Grange and Newcastle, ABGN, Gun Club does Trojan work and has been doing it for 30 years. It has a wildlife sanctuary. It has a pond and a whole lot of wildlife in it. It had a wonderful Santa village there for everybody to see at Christmas time. It does Trojan work and I salute them from the bottom of my heart.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273"> It is not merely ideology that one should not cut anything, let the growth hang out into the middle of the roads. If one comes out of a field with a tractor with an implement in front of it, one is as far as where the Cathaoirleach is sitting away and out in the road before one can see where one is going whereas if the hedge is cut back, one is a quarter of that distance and the roads are safer, and cyclists and pedestrians can pass. The verges need not be cut but the overhanging ditches have to be cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274"> I wondered where some of the Members were going but we must have road safety and adhere to health and safety. We are told about it in every other aspect of life yet we want the sides of the roads in the country closing in and meeting each other. What good is that for tourists? They cannot see a signpost, a yield right of way sign or a directional sign, all of which are covered in the bushes. I see it in my area at the moment, with dangerous junctions not even cut. It is an excuse for many local authorities not to do the work that they should be doing. They did it when they had no machine when they had ordinary men with the slash and billhook. There is much hot air being spoken here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275"> It amazes me at times as well, following up on the recent referendum, we will mind the birds and the eggs but we have no problem with abortion and killing babies.</p>

          <p eId="para_1291"> Deputy Thomas Byrne is not here. However, the existing situation is not acceptable. Because of the conflict between the Roads Act and the Wildlife Act, a landowner who is obliged to deal with a hazard under the Roads Act should not find himself or herself in breach of the Wildlife Act. All this provision is designed to do is to resolve this conflict. I might just leave the Deputy's comments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1293">I thank the Acting Chairman. Deputy Byrne is not here and I may come back to his comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294"> In response to Deputy Catherine Martin, flails are not fair game. The landowner is allowed only to deal with a hazard or a safety issue. We do not need to ban flails under the section 8 provision as they are not permitted in any case. This will allow dealing with a hazard only, not the entire hedge. With regard to section 7, they will be prohibited in regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295"> Large numbers of groups and interested parties campaign publicly and make submissions and representations to my Department. BirdWatch Ireland is only one of these stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296"> The debate on this Bill has been long and extensive. It is difficult for people to distinguish the truth when misleading and exaggerated opinion is presented as fact. Let me give the Deputy some of those facts about what is in the Bill. It is a fact that only roadside hedges, a fraction of the entirety of the hedgerow resource that we are lucky to have in this country, are subject to the provisions of this Bill. It is also truth that any cutting provision under this Bill can only be carried out in one month, which is August. A further important fact is that this will be carried out in accordance with strict statutory regulations, which I will make, designed specifically to protect wildlife and conserve our natural heritage. It is another fact that the regulations will limit cutting to the current year's growth only. There will be no wide-scale deep cutting, and no cutting with heavy machinery or flails. It is also a fact that under the Wildlife Acts it is an offence to wilfully destroy, injure or mutilate the eggs or nest of any bird species. The other fact is that it is being done on a pilot basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297"> There are further facts relating to managed burning. Fourteen per cent of this country is designated under the habitats and birds directives and burning in any designated area is an activity requiring ministerial consent. Burning under this Bill can only be carried out in March and, depending on the circumstances in each case, for a defined period in that month.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298"> Another important fact is there are statutory regulations on burning. It is limited to the current year. It will also be done on a pilot basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299"> Deputy Catherine Martin mentioned words such as "slash". It might be more appropriate to highlight the Deputy's own party's political muscle in slashing the NPWS's budget by 75% at the first sign of financial trouble and how quickly it abandoned principle. In government, the Green Party like to talk and walk and we, in government, in so far as our heritage is concerned, walk the talk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300"> Flails will not be allowed in August. The regulations will seek to address the issue in a practical way. BirdWatch Ireland is one of several voices in this debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1304">I am not misinformed and stand by my comments. My experts are the leading experts in the country. Even in Irish, the Deputy is using the language of the red top. We need an even-handed level-headed fact-led debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305"> Deputy Michael Healy-Rae also is not here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">I am sorry to hear about the lady who lost her eye. As legislators in a democracy our job is to legislate in a balanced way for the entire citizenry. Our country dwellers are the architects and layers of our hedges and we need to respect this and their respect for the landscape they have created and nurtured. I am glad Deputy Boyd Barrett agrees that safety issues are important and that hazards must be dealt with. Section 8 ensures that a person dealing with a hazard is not in breach of the Wildlife Act 1976 by doing so and to oppose the section is to say that the conflict between the Roads Act and the Wildlife Act 1976 should continue and a person complying with one is in breach of the other. To me that is not acceptable. Deputy Boyd Barrett is not here so I will leave the remainder of my response to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307"> Deputy Eamon Ryan's amendment No. 27 would mean that a landowner dealing with an immediate hazard would have to await a local authority order or action and could not comply with their obligations under the Roads Act. The Deputy is fantastic at reusing and recycling arguments already made and addressed but the protection of nature and the birds under section 22 of the Wildlife Act 1976 stands. There is a convention in this House of not attacking officials who accompany a Minister and it is unfair of the Deputy to attack officials who have no right of reply in this House. I did not refer to contractors on Committee Stage. The Deputy is misremembering, perhaps due to the amount of repetition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308"> I thank Deputies Fitzmaurice and Michael Collins for their contributions. Farmers are the primary custodians of our landscape and biodiversity and I spent a lot of time talking to my colleague Deputy Creed about how our two Departments can work more closely together to mutually reinforce our policies and shared interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309"> I refer to Deputies Bríd Smith and Burton's contributions. This Bill also applies to urban hedgerows. The funding of local authorities is a matter for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and this Bill will introduce a regulated regime for cutting hedges in August. The Deputies are introducing the rural-urban divide, I never brought that up. There was a consultation, this is a pilot scheme and Deputy Burton approved the Bill as Tánaiste.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310"> I thank Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Ó Cuív for the clarity they brought to some of the issues this Bill is seeking to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311"> Other than his final comments, Deputy Mattie McGrath's contribution reflects the complexity and interlinking of issues dealing with biodiversity in that the single issue of cutting the road facing side of hedges is not the Armageddon that some Deputies have described.</p>

          <p eId="para_1318">The amendment says that it is in the interests of public safety and air safety, to prevent serious damage to crops, livestock, forests, fisheries and water. All of the voices I have heard articulated so far are represented in my amendment. My amendment represents what the Deputies want to achieve, it just does so in a manner which protects the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319"> The Minister spoke about the fact that we are only dealing with a fraction of the environment but it is a fraction of a collapsing environment. We are dealing with a narrowing and reducing environment and ecosystem and the Minister's Bill reduces that even further. The Government's record on the environment is abysmal. We are laggards in Europe on this. Britain, for example, last year created more solar power than nuclear and coal power. This country does not even have a solar power system, we do not have feed-in tariffs or renewable heat incentives. This Government talks the talk on the environment but is worse than the Tories in Britain on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320"> I suggest to the Minister that instead of seeing two sides pitched against each other, she should bring together the interested parties in farming, heritage and road safety at some point in the future and get them to sit down together to work out a way of resolving this in sympathy and in partnership with each other. It can and should be done. These amendments do exactly that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1321">I have to respond. I start by defending our record for environmental legislation and spending on the environment which is a priority we hold. I do not want to get involved in party political issues, but to get a lecture from Fine Gael, which is a party that is now recognised internationally as leading a Government that is failing on climate and biodiversity - and this piece of legislation typifies it - cannot go unanswered. The Minister referred to walking the walk and talking the talk but it was Fine Gael back in 2000 who demanded the extension of the seasons which are now contracting. The Minister's own party was at the origin of some of the changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322"> I take back the criticism of any civil servants because there is the tradition of not directly criticising civil servants but I have to wonder where the sense of invective I hear is coming from because that is also something that is not typical in a debate. Invective towards parties who are not here is not typical either and I accept the Minister's analysis that it comes from her own instinct alone, rather than from the officials. I apologise and I recognise that might well be the case. The core of this issue is what we are trying to address, namely road safety. We are not trying to address those who do want to preserve the hedgerows and create road safety, but the critical issue is to tackle those who should - if the Minister is listening. Can the Acting Chairman stop the clock so that I can get the Minister's attention?</p>

There is a contradiction within the existing legislation but our amendment No. 27 resolves that in a way that does not open the floodgates. The Minister mentioned facts, but the fact that will go out in the public discourse and understanding if this Bill goes through as it currently stands is that the hedgerows can be cut in August and the mountain tops can be burned in March. That is the one fact that will go out there. All of the technicalities of the regulations or the promises that it is only a pilot project will not work across the country. The word has already gone out that Fine Gael has given approval to cut the hedgerows in August and burn the hills in March. That is the fact that we are opposing.</p>

This debate is an attempt to ensure those habitats survive and agriculture also survives, but in a way that protects the environment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1330">When the Minister suggested I was causing an urban-rural divide because I mentioned it, her argument was extraordinarily weak. I stated the obvious about what has been going on in this House. People who live on farms, or who are farming contractors like Deputy Mattie McGrath, contractors on land and roads like Deputies Michael and Danny Healy-Rae, or other contractors like Deputy Michael Collins, argue with us on the basis that we do not understand what we are talking about. They keep saying we have no idea what it is like and Deputy Fitzmaurice thinks we have never gone down the country. This has come from the way the Bill has been constructed and that is what I am saying about the Minister. She is not so much using urban-versus-rural language as constructing a Bill that causes people to argue on a completely false basis. If she really wanted to deal with overgrowing hedgerows and the dangers on tertiary roads where the small clever birds live, as opposed to the major roads where the stupid birds live, as was discussed yesterday, and if she wants to deal with the problems that arise from overgrowth, both in cities and in the countryside, she would fund the local authorities to do those things in a regulated way. Local authority funding has been slashed and burned for the past ten years and local authorities do not have the resources or the staff to carry out this sort of work. The Minister says it is nothing to do with her Department but that is not a good enough answer. My thesis is that if one funds one Department properly, the other would not have to put through this slash-and-burn Bill. The Minister is in a Cabinet; surely we deserve joined-up thinking from the Cabinet that runs the country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Declan Breathnach<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T22:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1331">I have listened with considerable interest to the debate and I had not intended taking part in the Chamber, although I have contributed at parliamentary party level. None of us is an expert, although we can indicate that we are until the cows come home. I have had considerable experience of various environmental schemes, from REPS to GLAS, over the past 20 years. I have experience of their practicality and of the guidance given by environmental officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332"> I reiterate what Deputy Ó Cuív said about the Road Traffic Act 1993. With any issue of road safety, there was always provision for the local authority to ensure a farmer could take measures to ensure a road was safer, while protecting wildlife. When a reputable planner signs off on the need for maintenance along a public road, it has never been challenged by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine if it is written in the plan. It has not been an issue for 20 years and I know people who availed of REPS and GLAS and were allowed to cut hedgerows in their plans, within reason and according to the diktat of the planner, who receives reasonably good advice from the Department. I do not know why we cannot also conserve water through such plans and this should be incentivised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333"> We spoke about the farmer and the cowboy having to be friends but there have to be practical solutions in the interest of protecting the people who walk or cycle the roads of this country and I would not be satisfied unless I could cut briers and other things for the people who utilise the countryside, as well as for those in cars and lorries. We debate things <i>ad infinitum</i> in this House but I cannot understand how we cannot find practical solutions that are acceptable both to environmentalists and farmers.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Martin<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T22:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1334">The Minister likes to talk about facts but BirdWatch Ireland is just one of the science-based conservation organisations which she has refused to meet or to consult on this Heritage Bill. The facts are, regrettably, that last night in this Chamber, when members of that organisation were not here to defend themselves, the Minister accused their work of being a flagrant distortion of the facts and unscientific. She accused them of saying the decline in the number of curlew was due to burning but they never said that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335"> Several Ministers and Deputies have said in the course of this debate that the burning season in Northern Ireland extends into April but that has done nothing to stop illegal and uncontrolled burning. The same Deputies have not made the point that the hedgecutting dates in Northern Ireland are in line with those in the Republic. The dates in the North, which exclude August, are the way they are because of a review which held that the dates were valid to provide protection to birds during the breeding season. The Members involved have been quite selective in their comparisons. Cutting a hedge in the period between March and August impinges negatively on the overall wildlife of the hedgerow and any suggestion that a hedge can be cut without impacting on the wildlife in the hedge is simply not credible. The question is to what degree there is an impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336"> For Deputies to ask us to depend on the birds to be wise enough not to nest in roadside hedges is beyond ludicrous. Other Deputies talked about protection of the human species and road safety, having done nothing but delay the passage of new road safety legislation through the Dáil with no thought for those whose loved ones have been lost on the roads. That is very hard to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337"> I will finish with another fact. All the organisations up and down this country which preserve our environment and wildlife have said that sections 7 and 8, as they stand, are a disaster for Irish wildlife and our natural heritage. Nach bhfuil sé oiriúnach go bhfágfaidh an tAire Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta scrios ar chomhshaol agus ar oidhreacht nádúrtha na tíre?</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T22:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1338">This debate has taken an unfortunate acrimonious twist, unnecessarily personalised in some cases. I agree with Deputy Breathnach that we should be able to come up with practical solutions that guarantee the environmental integrity and biodiversity we need while ensuring road safety. Everybody wants to maintain biodiversity, protect and enhance the environment and wildlife and ensure road safety so one would think we could come up with a solution. The problem is that the Minister has driven this through without a proper engagement with stakeholders, scientists, farmers, the rural communities, naturalists and wildlife people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">As is very often the case with important and controversial issues in this country, there is a perfunctory public consultation and not a proper one. In many cases, public consultation is a box-ticking exercise where the proposed measure was a <i>fait accompli </i>from the beginning, that is, the Government decided what it wanted to do and it was going to do it. That is not the way to do business and it is unnecessarily divisive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340"> I would say to our colleagues from the rural constituencies that I agree with them that farmers are under pressure. Various regulations can put farmers under serious pressure and we should listen to their concerns. However, our colleagues should not respond by attacking people from the city as if they know nothing and have no right to speak on these matters. We all share this country and planet and we all depend on the wildlife and the biodiversity being maintained. </p>

          <p eId="para_1343">There has been a reasonable level of debate on this Bill in committee and in the Dáil. Some Members consider there has not been enough debate on it but I do not know how long more they want to talk about it. There will be an extended burning season. Hopefully, Muintir na Tire will work on plans with the Garda and the farmers and there will be properly controlled burning in the future. I hope that will be the successful outcome of the extended burning season.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344"> A previous speaker said that we had held up the passage of the road traffic Bill. I spoke for 29 minutes in nine months on that issue, which works out at three minutes a month. That did not hold up the passage of the Bill. We started with nothing when we began to debate that Bill and now we have secured €400,000 for rural transport and another 40 or 50 new driver instructors. We have gained. Hopefully, if we can spend another few months on it, we might get more for rural Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_1345"> I have been calling for many years for each local authority to carry out a survey of roadside trees, which have caused a number of deaths but, unfortunately, that is not happening. We need to address that issue. When there is a storm trees pose a hazard and can cause a major accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346"> Quite a number of urban Deputies visit my constituency during the summer months because of the beauty of the landscape. We do not want our community turned into Jurassic Park. We are trying to continue to live there in a normal manner. There has been a lack of understanding about this issue. If one was in my area for a while, one would see people out with streamers cutting back verges leading out onto roadways every night of the week. That is crazy. It is very important for people to have the possibility to extend the period for the cutting of roadside verges. I guarantee Members that if a referendum was held on that, it would have a landslide victory in rural Ireland. It is a common sense issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1347">I listened with interest to the contributions and I do not want an urban-rural divide in any shape or form. We need to mend those fences rather than have such division. As was said, we live on a small island and we have to live, work and manage together. I declare my interest as a small business person. It do not believe it is a crime. Deputy Healy-Rae, Deputy Michael Collins and myself employ people, generate income, pay our insurance premiums, taxes and everything else. I believe we are an asset to the economy. I have been in business since 1982. No one has a monopoly on this issue. As I said, the gun, shooting and fishing clubs do tremendous work to nurture our wildlife, as well as the vast majority of farmers. I condemn anyone who sets a hill alight in March, April or whenever, especially when the weather is very dry, and this year has been exceptionally dry, because of the threat of the fire spreading and the danger that poses to the fire services. I pay tribute to the fire personnel and the mountain rescue people for the work they are doing. The environment must be protected but the safety of lives must be paramount with respect to wildlife. It is important to achieve a balance in that regard but we must be able to cut back the hedges for safety and allow tourists to visit the areas in their hired car. If they hire a car in Dublin they are required to pay a deposit and if there is a scratch on the car when they return it, they will lose their deposit. That is why the roads are closed. Tá siad dúnta. We must be mindful of that in making our areas welcoming and achieving a balance in protecting the flora, fauna and wildlife. We must look at the bigger picture. Set aside was prevalent for decades and it did untold damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348"> I stand by the comments I made in the debate. The Minister decided not to reply to them. She did not have to but I believe I am right that the people who are concerned about the birds and the bees care little for human beings.</p>

          <p eId="para_1350"> Deputy Burton referenced the fact that there was no science and no database. All that is needed here is common sense. The roadside hedges have to be cut to allow people come and go safely on narrow roads.</p>

          <p eId="para_1360">Last night and today, I thought we had disposed of all the amendments to section 7, therefore, I will address the amendments before the House now, all of which address section 8. We should be clear about the purpose of section 8. It is bringing the Wildlife Act in line with what is already in the Roads Act 1993, no more and no less. Deputy Eamon Ryan specifically mentioned his amendment No. 27. If we were to insert amendment No. 27 in the Bill as opposed to what the Minister has done, we would only be transposing part of the Roads Act 1993. The problem then would be that other parts of the 1993 Act would be in conflict with the Wildlife Act. If a farmer or an occupier took a reasonable step to ensure that a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on the land is not a hazard or a potential hazard to persons by cutting it in the closed months, no more and no less - we have to talk about the facts of what the law states and not alter the things that have nothing to do with the cold words in front of us - they would be on the right side of the law under the Roads Act 1993 but on the wrong side of the law with the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">We cannot have that conflict. Fianna Fáil will not support the amendment because it is creating a crazy, legal contradiction, no more and no less. I ask the Deputies to reflect on this. This is what these amendments are about. They are not about anything else even though we have spent an hour and a half debating points which were mainly germane to section 7 of the Bill.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1604">“(1) Where a person who holds a relevant licence (in this section referred to as “the applicant”) duly gives notice of his or her intention to apply for a licence under this section in respect of a relevant premises and, at the proceedings in relation to the application, the applicant shows to the satisfaction of the Court that a relevant licence is in force in respect of the premises, the Court shall cause a certificate to be granted to the applicant entitling him or her to receive a licence in respect of the relevant premises (in this section referred to as a “producer’s retail licence”), unless the Court prohibits the issuing of the licence on the grounds of—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1605">(a) the character, misconduct or unfitness of the applicant,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1606">(b) the unfitness or inconvenience of the premises, or</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1607">(c) the unsuitability of the premises for the needs of persons residing in the neighbourhood.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1608"> We had much debate on this in committee. We were of the impression that a few things were going to be adjusted in the Bill because the majority agreed with them on Committee Stage. We notice the Government has not gone there just yet so we may argue again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1609"> Amendment No. 1, page 3, lines 10 to 25, is, in a nutshell, trying to get rid of the tour. Truth be told, it is just about impossible to monitor it. The three amendments have been grouped but there is a substantial difference between them. Deputies Clare Daly and Alan Kelly have put forward essentially the same amendment in that they both make the distinction that the necessity of the guided tour should be only for consumption of alcohol on the premises and should not be necessary for off-sales. While I agree with that, if we are engaging in the making of good legislation, we should try to get rid of the tour altogether. I will explain why. As we discussed on Committee Stage, the way the Bill has been amended by the Department sets up a situation whereby small breweries will more than likely not qualify for the ability to give guided tours. On Committee Stage, I stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1610"> For an applicant to qualify for an off-sales licence, or off and on-sales licences, he or she must show that guided tours can be held on the premises and that the premises is suitable for guided tours in the first place. This automatically rules out a great number of the microbreweries in Ireland from qualifying for these licences. Many microbreweries are packed to the rafters with fermenters, pipework and brewing and packaging materials as many producers start out with small enough kits and, as they see increasing demand, purchase more fermentation and storage vessels until they have no more room to move in their workspaces. These breweries which are doing a lot in a small space, generally due to lack of investment and available funds to expand to bigger premises, are both precisely those who need the help this Bill could offer them financially and, because of the way in which the Government amendments are crafted, those who will not benefit from the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1611">It is unfortunate that I have to repeat much of what was said on Committee Stage but it is necessary because the Department did not address the concerns we raised at the time and so I am forced to do so. On Committee Stage the majority rejected the idea of a tour for off-sales and agreed with the extension of the hours of the tasting rooms and off-sales to 7 p.m. as opposed to 6 p.m. in order that people could avail of the stated purpose of the legislation. For the life of me I do not understand why the Minister is not able to accept the change to 7 p.m. On Committee Stage a large majority voted in favour of 7 p.m. to avoid the situation whereby overcrowded and unsafe breweries working at capacity must qualify for the facility to give guided tours to have the ability to have off-sales, which is highly unlikely in the first place, and if their premises are deemed suitable for tours they must give a tour for every six-pack of beer sold at the door.</p>
          <p eId="para_1612"> At the very least, all of Deputy Clare Daly's amendments must be accepted. My amendments go a little further and do away with the tour restriction altogether. The notion that someone who would call once a week for a six-pack of craft beer to a local brewery would have to do the tour every time is fairly irrational. Even the Ceann Comhairle agrees with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1614">Where is the logic in that? People who have not been in a craft brewery will want to do tours but if a person has had the tour, bar a change in the premises, he or she is unlikely to want to have a tour every time he or she goes in looking for a six-pack. The long and the short of it is that we are dancing around issues here for God knows what reason. I presume it is to placate the vintners. It just does not make sense. If we insist on the guided tours, who in God's name is going to monitor them? Who will make sure the tours are done and are done right? Where will the evidence come from? If someone does not do tours, how will the Department deal with the individual who sold a six-pack of beer to a fellow who did not want to do the tour for the umpteenth time? How will the Department monitor that? Let us suppose the Department does come up some sort of censure, will there be an appeal process involved? The Minister is looking for trouble. I do not see clarity in the approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1615"> The Department has defined the terms of a guided tour in Government amendment No. 13. It must include "an explanation of, or information relating to, the process whereby the intoxicating liquor is manufactured". It must be "carried out in person" and it "requires a ticket to be issued to the person participating in the tour, whether a fee is paid for the ticket or not". A number of problems arise in that regard. Let us say one is a small producer brewing beer and one has a team of probably three people at most doing what is quite intense and physical work. The place will be a bit of a mess. The floor will be wet. It is a normal brew day. There is no time, nor is it safe to give a tour, as described by the Government in amendment No. 13. There is nothing wrong with the description of a tour. It is good to describe these things, but it means that the brewery will by law not be allowed to sell a case or a can of beer for takeaway to anyone who comes to the brewery for the purpose of getting a six-pack. Because of the work that is taking place at that particular time, the brewer is not going to be a position to facilitate a tour. We are being impractical.</p>

          <p eId="para_1620">I will speak to amendment No. 2. I thank the Minister for his support for the Bill. I also thank the Members who have supported it, especially those who have tabled amendments. Many of the amendments are in the same spirt. My amendments, Deputy Clare Daly's amendments and Deputy Wallace's amendments are in the same spirit. I hope we can get the Bill through the House this week because the Seanad has committed to deal with the Bill next week. The sun is shining and if we can get the Bill enacted, craft brewers will be able to benefit from the legislation in a summer where they can grow their business. There are four craft brewers in my county. I encourage Members to adopt the amendments in that spirit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1621"> I agree with the majority of what Deputy Wallace said. Deputy Clare Daly's amendments and mine are very similar. I drafted the Bill and worked with the Minister's staff, who I compliment and thank for their help, but it did come across from the brewers who were watching Committee Stage that it would be impractical to have to do a tour to buy off-sales. The happy medium I propose in my amendment No. 2, which is linked to amendment No. 6, is that one would have to do a tour to get on-sales. Under the Bill, the brewers are only allowed to sell what they produce. Can one imagine if one was in Spain, Italy or France and one wanted to visit a local vineyard to purchase some wine but one was not able to do that? It is insane - absolutely crazy. This is a very practical Bill which has had the unanimous support of this House politically. The amendment I propose, No. 2, which is linked to amendment No. 6, is to allow for on-sales after a tour and off-sales regardless of whether a tour is taken. It is very similar to Deputy Clare Daly's amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1622"> I encourage the Minister to adopt the amendments. To be honest, in the spirit of all the rest of the amendments, I think this is the crucial amendment. I have no issue with the time of 7 p.m. I think it is a good thing. The Minister could possibly link my amendment with Deputy Clare Daly's, as I think they might work, so that we do not have to bring the Bill back from the Seanad with an amendment because we may not have the time for it this summer and I am very conscious of the need to enact the Bill this summer. I encourage the Minister to take this amendment on board, purely on a practical basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1623"> This is a fledgling industry. It is potentially a great industry. It is located in the four corners of Ireland, in rural areas, towns and cities. There is great culture and heritage involved. Fáilte Ireland is willing to start a marketing campaign for craft breweries as a tourism product. We see people coming into Ireland from central Europe, Germany, California and Florida looking to visit these breweries. I met some tourists even in the past two weeks and they cannot understand why they cannot buy produce. The amendment will allow the spirt of the Bill to be fully kept but it will mean that for many of the reasons Deputy Wallace has outlined, it will allow for off-sales whereby people can come in and buy a modest amount directly from the brewer without having to continuously do tours.</p>
          <p eId="para_1624"> Breweries will not always be in the space where they can have tours, for example, if they are in mass production, which is the case at certain times of the week when they front-load production because they know they will not have visitors, for example, on Mondays and Tuesdays or early in the day. That would allow them to plan and to ensure the space will be suitable for visitors later in the day. I hope the Minister can take on board my amendment. Over the next day or so I hope that between us we can get these couple of amendments through. I do not have much of an issue with the Minister's amendment. I will support the change to 7 p.m. as long as it does not require the Bill to come back from the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1625"> This is the critical amendment which the House must consider and I hope the Minister will support it. It is the one issue I believe needed further consideration and on which the industry reverted to me after Committee Stage. I had hoped that it would be dealt with through discussions with the Minister's officials but, unfortunately, that was not the case. There may be very valid reasons for that but I hope the House will support the amendment for the spirit in which it is being put forward and its practical nature.</p>
