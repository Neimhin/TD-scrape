        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">Budget 2012 introduced perhaps the single most damaging cut to education, that is, the removal of <i>ex quota</i> guidance counselling provision in second level schools. The Institute of Guidance Counsellors conducted an audit since then and it states that the current practice is "a portrait of inequality". One member of the institute described a wave of self-harm among teenagers that would alarm any parent. Teachers who are expected to teach as well as be guidance counsellors described it as a "bottomless pit" and "fire fighting", saying "you can just do what you can". That is the story in second level schools throughout Ireland since this cut was introduced. I spoke to Senator Joan Freeman, founder of Pieta House, last week and she also told me about the extremely damaging impact of the cut in terms of the mental well-being of young students in second level schools who, until then, had access to guidance counsellors. This week, I met members of Comhairle na nÓg in Cork, the Cork City Comhairle or youth council. They conducted a survey on the absence of career guidance for them and their peers in second level schools. Again, there were very damaging conclusions regarding the absence of career guidance for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> There has been a 51% reduction in one-to-one counselling supports in secondary schools. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, carried out a major study on this in the context of a report on the value of guidance counselling. It stated clearly that it has had a devastating impact on working class students in working class schools and that it has embedded disadvantage across our education system. That is the reason I was anxious, in the confidence and supply arrangement with the Government, to ensure that the reintroduction and restoration of <i>ex quota </i>career guidance would be part of that agreement and would be delivered by the Government. I realise there is resistance to this among, perhaps, officials within the Department or other people.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">The suggestion that general improvements to the staffing schedule will somehow improve guidance counselling is not a runner, because we need the <i>ex quota</i> provision restored. Does the Tánaiste accept that the need to restore <i>ex quota</i> provision for second level schools is a very real issue for young people and teachers? Is the Government committed to bringing back <i>ex quota</i> guidance counselling to our schools?</p>

          <p eId="para_4">The programme for a partnership Government strongly reasserts the central role of education. Indeed, the very first line is, "Education is the key to giving every child an equal opportunity in life." There are plans to commit a huge amount of extra investment in our education system at every level. I recognise what Deputy Micheál Martin says about the importance of guidance counselling. We had to take extremely difficult decisions because of the cycle of boom and bust our country was in. There is a commitment in the programme for a partnership Government to reduce primary school class sizes, reintroduce guidance counselling to secondary schools and increase financial supports for postgraduate students with a particular focus on those from low-income households. As the Deputy said, this was part of the discussions in respect of forming the programme for a partnership Government. There is a very clear commitment to reintroduce guidance counselling. Based on my own experience, I believe it is extremely important in terms of identifying issues in schools, dealing with mental health issues and working in a preventative way with children who need particular advice and support. That will be discussed during the Estimates and there will clearly be consultation in the appropriate committee about how this reintroduction will be carried out in the coming year.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T12:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_5">I welcome the Tánaiste's response and her personal observations about the value of guidance counselling, particularly in terms of mental health. The real value of a career guidance counsellor is that young people with issues in their family environment or personal issues can go to a counsellor and have a one-to-one session without any stigmatisation around the issue of mental health. They can get counselling in a very good environment - again, with the proviso that there must be fully qualified and dedicated guidance counselling provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> The reason I put the question is that some of the replies have been somewhat ambiguous. A spokesperson for the Department of Education and Skills said that the aim would be to provide a whole-school approach to guidance counselling, including group work, class-based activities and other activities that focus on providing the best possible outcomes for students rather than exclusively using one type of activity. In later replies to parliamentary questions, there was talk about discretion being left to the schools and principals. This is not good enough and is not acceptable. I put it to the Tánaiste that what is needed is dedicated <i>ex quota</i> provision of career guidance counsellors outside the normal staffing schedule in second level schools. That is the key point.</p>

          <p eId="para_7">Obviously, the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, made some provision for a 50% restoration of the cut that had been made in this area, which schools will have from 1 September.</p>

          <p eId="para_11">In respect of the Deputy's point about dedicated provision, clearly that will form part of the Estimates discussion. The Minister will examine the precise costings relating to that. There is a commitment in the programme for a partnership Government to reintroduce guidance counselling in secondary schools, but the Minister will discuss that with all members of the education committee and it will be discussed in the context of the budget.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T12:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_12">There is not a single family across this island that has not been affected by the challenge of mental health issues. It is now accepted that one in seven adults will experience mental health challenges in any given year and that the real figures for suicide across the island of Ireland are as high as 1,000 people annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> I want to ask the Tánaiste about the Mental Health Commission's annual report which was published on Monday. The State's mental health policy, A Vision for Change, has been in place since 2006 and the Mental Health Commission has undertaken a strategic review as part of developing a new strategic plan for 2016-2018. The commission's report illustrates how much remains to be done. This includes a need for independent monitoring of the A Vision for Change policy. Given that the policy is ten years old and allowing for increases in population and other demographic changes, I imagine the Tánaiste agrees that this is very urgently needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> There are also significant issues around funding or the lack of funding. The current level of funding for mental health is still less than the 8.24% target based on the 2005 figures envisaged in A Vision for Change. The staffing levels are about 75% of the A Vision for Change recommended number. According to the Mental Health Commission's report, there is a serious deficiency in the development and provision of recovery oriented mental health services. This concept, which is about aiding a person's recovery rather than managing the illness, is crucial. The report states that the reason for this is the combined effect of poor manpower planning, lack of change in professional training schemes, cuts in public expenditure, delays in recruitment and a shortage of appropriately trained staff. </p>
          <p eId="para_15"> I do not have the time to go through all of the report's details but I would like to raise some very specific issues. One issue is 24-hour staffed community residences. The commission remains concerned that some of these are too large, have poor physical infrastructure, are institutional in nature and lack individual care plans. It goes on to say, which is very alarming, that there is a fundamental issue of identifying precisely the number of residences and people living in them. In other words, we do not know. This is an alarming revelation. The commission also expresses concern about the admission of children to adult services. In 2015, some 95 children were admitted to adult units. I am sure the Tánaiste will agree that this is totally unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> The Government has yet to introduce draft legislation to bring about the changes envisaged in the review of the Mental Health Act 2001 which was published in December 2014. My question is straightforward. Does the Tánaiste accept that the Government has to act on the findings of this report?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_10" as="#Tánaiste">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_17">I accept that the whole area of mental health needs ongoing investment which we need to prioritise. I hope the health committee will prioritise a discussion of the full implementation of A Vision for Change, which also needs a review. The report that Deputy Adams referenced, the Mental Health Commission annual report of 2015, reflects the very widely accepted need to develop further a complete community-based mental health service with a prevention and recovery focus. I am sure there is no one in this House who does not agree with what the Deputy says about the need for priority focus and ongoing improvement and investment in the whole mental health area. Thankfully, we have seen changes and we have seen the move from residential to community care but unfortunately the economic situation impacted on the development and implementation of A Vision for Change. What we have to do now, given that we have the resources available, is make sure we accelerate funding in this area. That is what the Government has done. We are committed to providing additional resources in this area. If one looks at the recent Government decision to allocate an extra €500 million to the health area, that involved an increase in mental health funding from €785 million in 2015 to a projected budget of €826 million in 2016, which represents an increase of €41 million or 5.2%. That funding is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> The recruitment of front-line staff has been difficult but needs to continue and vacancies are being advertised as I speak. Hopefully that will begin to build up the complement of posts that are necessary. Up to 1,150 posts have been filled up to the end of 2015, with 270 posts approved for the child and adolescent services, which also need development and staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">A number of priority development areas have already been identified that will be ongoing this year. They include the improved counselling services and the provision of three new Jigsaw centres, which are extremely important to young people in local communities. I am sure Deputy Adams will agree that the provision of those extra centres will be important, particularly for the more vulnerable children in areas across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> Deputy Adams made a point about children who were admitted to adult psychiatric units. Indeed, it is shameful that we continue to have such a situation, even though it has significantly changed, from more than 200 children being admitted to adult inpatient psychiatric units down to 95 last year. Every one of those is one too many and we must accelerate our efforts. There is increased funding and it will begin to deal with the issues I have identified in a more comprehensive way. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is determined to have a strong priority focus on the mental health issues that Deputy Adams has identified and that we all know need continuing attention.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T12:15:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_21">I, and other Teachtaí, have been raising these issues regularly and I do not minimise the challenges involved. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, well. Sinn Féin will co-operate with her in dealing with this crucially important issue. In fact, the leasuachtarán of Sinn Féin, an Teachta Mary Lou McDonald, has national responsibility for our mental health and suicide prevention portfolio. I believe firmly that an all-party and all-island approach is required and there should be full co-operation with our colleagues in the North. I have long argued for an all-island suicide prevention strategy and for a campaign similar to that undertaken by the Road Safety Authority. Although the Taoiseach has made positive responses to this over the years, this has yet to be put in place. I commend that approach to the Tánaiste and to the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> I welcome the Tánaiste's assertion that mental health services need investment and I look to her to deliver on that. However, I do not accept that the recession played a part in underinvestment. It was Government decisions which led to under investment. In fact, an unfortunate insight into the Government's attitude was the fact that funding which was ring-fenced for mental health was used for other purposes.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">Regarding the compliance issue, six approved mental health centres achieved full compliance with all the regulatory requirements in 2015. While what Deputy Adams says is true that other centres were non-compliant to varying degrees, I am advised that, given the nature of the requirements where centres were non-compliant, the potential for full compliance is strong. Certainly, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has urged the maximum effort on the part of all of those non-compliant centres to meet the requirements. It is important that we have such inspection and that there is a continuous monitoring of the implementation of the inspectorate regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> Regarding Deputy Adams's point about North-South co-operation, when I was the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I was involved in North-South meetings and the topic of mental health was discussed and various North-South initiatives were considered. I agree with Deputy Adams that collaboration and best practice models need to be exchanged, North-South. I believe that has happened. Perhaps it could happen more but that certainly was on the agenda at some of the meetings I attended.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">Following up on the same topic, the ten-year strategy published in 2006 set out a comprehensive model of mental health. It gave a framework for building and fostering mental health across the entire community and providing accessible community-based specialist service for those with mental illness. In other words, it told the Government back in 2006 what to do, more importantly, how to do it and, even more importantly, in the knowledge that any government might not do it, made a strong recommendation that a monitoring body be set up. That monitoring body was set up. It was set up for two three-year periods, between 2006 and 2009 and between 2009 and 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">Significantly, it was disbanded for some reason, so we have no independent monitoring group, as per A Vision for Change. When it sat, the monitoring group and the Mental Health Commission repeatedly pointed out that the implementation of A Vision for Change has been slow and inconsistent. This week, the Mental Health Commission again confirms that A Vision for Change is extremely important and puts the patient at the core in terms of recovery. However, it points out that much needs to be done. Additionally, it points out a serious number of failures and issues to be rectified, with the first being the setting up of an independent monitoring commission. That has not been done and I would like the Tánaiste's answer on that. The second issue is an immediate review. Since coming to the Dáil I have heard statement after statement being made with goodwill. There is no answer from the Government as to when the review will be set up, who sits on the panel and when there will be a review report.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> Some of the specific issues highlighted by the Mental Health Commission have already been mentioned. Although I am paraphrasing the Tánaiste, it is not appropriate for her to say they are not that bad. There are serious problems, notwithstanding the good work of the staff. Of the 61 inspections, only six facilities were fully compliant and only one of those was run by the Health Service Executive. Well done to that centre in Ballinasloe in east Galway. There were 95 children admitted to the wrong facility. In 1997, the European Commission of Human Rights indicated that we were failing to comply with our obligations by not providing appropriate facilities. We are doing the same thing 19 years later. Spending on mental health was as high as 14% of the budget in the 1990s, when we had very little money, but it is now down to 6%. A Vision for Change specifically asked for a figure of at least 8.2%.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> With regard to improvements in the economy, it costs more not to deal with mental health. On page 176 of A Vision for Change from 2006, it is stated that the cost of a failure to deal with mental health issues is €11 billion. I believe that figure is wrong, but it is in the document. Will the Tánaiste answer those two specific questions?</p>

          <p eId="para_37">I spoke about the importance of compliance and I certainly accept what the Deputy says about it. I did not mean to suggest in any way that the issues of the other centres which have not met full compliance were in any way insignificant. The point I made is that the potential for full compliance is certainly there. That is what the Minister of State will be pursuing with respect to the points made in that report. I have no doubt she will be addressing the range of recommendations in the report, including the question of monitoring. I do not have a specific date but I have no doubt it will be an important part of her consideration with regard to the implementation of the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> A full policy review in the area has been announced by the Minister of State, which is important. Everybody accepts there have been major changes in how we deal with mental health in this country. I am thankful that the stigma that was there has certainly changed, and I notice this very much among young people. We know issues remain and we need a more concerted effort across all society to ensure people get the kind of help they need with mental health difficulties at an early stage. The help, in the first instance, should be in the community, with inpatient facilities as needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> There is a full chapter in the programme for Government on mental health and commitments on a variety of issues that have come to people's attention in recent years, including access to a GP and other mental health services in primary care, which is extremely important. A Vision for Change was accepted very much as a roadmap to improved mental health services. We now have the funding, which had, unfortunately, decreased at a time when there was little choice in the matter because of the cycle of boom and bust economy. I am thankful we are now in a position to reinvest in the area, and the Government has demonstrated its commitment to investment in the health services with the announcement of €500 million in extra funding just two weeks ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">A proportion of that is for mental health services. There is also a commitment in the programme for Government to review this annually and to have increased investment in mental health services. The issues Deputy Connolly has raised will get the attention they deserve and I have no doubt that the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will be making a statement on the report.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">I thank the Minister for her reply but I do not think her reassurances are good enough at this stage. She has an obligation, as does the Government, to reinstate the implementation body. It was part of A Vision for Change, so she is not complying with her duty of care under that strategy. She has failed to tell me why it was disbanded and why it has not been reintroduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> In respect of the review, this has been mentioned continually and yet no date has been given. I specifically asked what date the review started, when it will be finished and who sits on the review panel. A Vision for Change was a ten-year strategy, which finished last January. We are now in June and we still have no mention of the review and no date for it. The blueprint was written back in 2006. It had a chapter on suicide. In 2006, the incidence of suicide was at crisis levels. We do not need statements on how it should be done; it is all there. We need confirmation on how that report is going to be updated, reviewed and implemented. It will save the economy money, so saying the Government does not have money or did not have money is not an explanation. It is actually costing the economy more to do nothing.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">I want to raise the very important issue of medical cards. I have permission from an applicant to mention this case. I have written to the medical card processing unit on 11 occasions between 14 March and 10 June, contacted them by telephone on more than 15 occasions and asked two parliamentary questions of the Minister for Health with regard to the individual. The man developed encephalomyelitis, which is a general term for inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, in 2012. Since then, he has been left with a great number of neurological defects, which are proving impossible to manage. During this time, he has seen 22 consultants and attends the Santry Sports Clinic in Dublin weekly for treatment as this is the only place in the country that he can be treated. He needs regular botox injections to control the spasms and four times the normal amount of Lyrica to control the pain. As late as Wednesday, 15 June, he received 31 injections in his head. Another example of his condition is that if he was to run after his child in an emergency situation his rib cage would automatically go into spasm to protect his lungs and actually squeeze his lungs, restricting his breathing. He applied for a medical card on 19 January 2016 and was refused a card on 22 February 2016. His application was appealed and refused again on 5 May 2016. His case was then again reviewed by a senior medical officer and the decision was upheld on 8 June 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> This is one example of the many cases I have dealt with - I am only one politician in this House and we should think also of all the county councillors dealing with the issue of medical cards - where more than adequate medical information has been provided to entitle people to a medical card and time and again they are being refused. How could any right-thinking person have refused this individual his medical card?</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> With regard to the current waiting time for cataract operations, I must first compliment the staff in our hospitals providing this service as they are only operating within the resources that are available to them as the demand for the service is very high at the moment. However, I know of people in my constituency who have gone blind while waiting for cataract operations and this continues to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">I have been informed by the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, that as of 24 May 2016 in the south and south west hospital groups there are 461 people on the waiting list to be seen. The previous Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, determined that the maximum waiting time should be 15 months but this is not happening as people have had to be taken off the list and are going blind because it has taken so long for their operations to be performed.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">The details of the case described by the Deputy are very distressing. Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE and the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from approximately 52,000 in the middle of 2014 to over 106,000 at the end of May 2016. The programme for Government commits to maintaining that humane approach to discretionary medical cards. The Deputy has provided many details today; perhaps he could forward precise details on the case in question to the Minister for Health. The medical card assessment team is now liaising much more closely with local health officers to ensure that any significant extra information is taken into account. However, the legislation is clear that qualification for a medical card is means tested and some people are not eligible because their income is too high. We want a humane approach and to take into account all the facts relating to medical situations, such as undue hardship that may be caused by the decision not to give someone a medical card. The case referred to by the Deputy has been refused on appeal but, given the details he has outlined, I suggest he forward them to the Minister for Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> There is now increased funding to the health services for cataract operations and there is a commitment in the programme to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which can address cases where urgent operations are needed. The Minister for Health can engage directly with the Deputy regarding cataract operations.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">I appreciate the Tánaiste's response but the case I gave her today is just an example. Every politician in this House knows of cancer patients and I recently had a child with a prosthesis who was refused a medical card. These decisions are being taken by deciding officers and, while I am not a medical person, I have enough cop on to know that a discretionary medical card is meant for a person in this man's situation, for others like him and for people with cancer. They might not always want a card but at a time when they are ill and their illness is causing them financial hardship, they should be entitled to a card. That is why we call them "discretionary" medical cards. I am simply asking for more discretion to be given. It is completely beyond me how any medical officer can stand over some of the decisions taken in this regard. It is outrageous to allow people to go blind for the sake of €2,700, the cost of a cataract operation. I personally know of people who have gone blind. I can give their names, addresses and PPS numbers and it is outrageous that this should happen in a civilised and modern society.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">The Government's intention is to provide the best possible health service. There have been very significant increases for the health services over the years and €500 million was given to the health services just two weeks ago so that we can deal with the situations outlined by the Deputy and prevent the consequences to which he referred. A good health service works at a preventative level to ensure these situations do not arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> The individual who assesses an application has to consider whether undue hardship exists in determining an entitlement to social and medical cards. Discretion is allowed and we want discretion to be used in appropriate cases. The Minister for Health will want to hear about it if there are ongoing issues regarding the appropriate use of discretion and I am sure he will address it.</p>

          <p eId="para_56">On the first point, in terms of extending the Dáil time, I have no difficulty with it, but it may point to a need to examine the scheduling of today and whether one should have lengthened the day at the other end. We commenced today at 12 noon. I know that the Dáil reform committee has examined the issue, but there is a logic to reviewing it fairly quickly. For example, there is no reason today's sitting could not have commenced at 10.30 a.m., which would have obviated the need to go to 11 p.m. tonight. This is intended as a constructive suggestion. The same would apply to Thursday mornings. I do not see the need to be waiting around. I know the rationale behind it. People felt the committees should be separate from the plenary session and not running in parallel. However, we are cutting ourselves short in terms of available time to do things and, in my view, some of the debates are very short. For example, yesterday's European debate was quite short. I would prefer greater time to debate matters. If that means sitting a little longer during the day, that is fine. I do not have an issue with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> On the second point and the cancellation of Questions to the Taoiseach next week, which I understand as it is because he will be at the European Council meeting, will the Chief Whip make provision to reschedule them, perhaps on the Thursday of the following week?</p>

Last week, a number of Deputies across the House as well as Senators attended a presentation by the INTO on the starting salaries of young teachers and all of the difficulties the situation creates. In the programme for Government, there is a commitment to set up a public sector pay commission to examine public sector pay.

This is despite the fact that the Government has failed to implement many of the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention, including those pertaining to the rights of citizens living outside the State to vote in presidential elections. The Government also intends to exclude politicians - including those from the Northern Ireland Assembly - from the citizens' assembly. The last Constitutional Convention worked well, so why change it?

            <p eId="para_111">The CSO collects and reports on a number of statistical outputs relating to employment and wage levels. These include the quarterly national household survey, which is the official source of estimates of employment in the State; the job-churn related statistics from administrative data sources that explore the flow of jobs and workers between firms and within and between sectors, which began in 2012; the monthly unemployment statistics, which began in 2015; the earnings, hours and employment costs survey, which is the official source of short-term earnings and labour costs estimates in the State; and the new structure of earnings survey, which is planned to be published before the end of July 2016 and which will include detailed structural earnings for 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">These statistics will be primarily based on linking existing administrative records and survey sources rather than primary data collection.</p>
            <p eId="para_113"> The above outputs fulfil a number of national demands as well as meeting Irish requirements in the context of European statistical legislation governed by EUROSTAT, the official statistical office of the European Union. The harmonised European statistical requirements generally mirror those requirements of other international organisations such as the OECD and the United Nations.</p>
            <p eId="para_114"> The CSO is continually engaging with national and international stakeholders to assess the relevance and scope of statistics on employment and wage levels. Where gaps are identified, the CSO will consider proposals to expand the scope of the statistical domains, subject to resource constraints and burden on respondents.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">I thank the Chief Whip for her reply. The question is to ask the Taoiseach the proposals he is considering to expand the scope of statistics being collected and reported relating to employment and wage levels beyond those required for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development comparisons. While extensive work has been undertaken by the CSO on employment and various methodologies are used, significant work is required on wage structures across the economy, especially at the lower end. Up to 600,000 people earn wages of less than €30,000 and it would be useful if specific work could be undertaken on wage levels, especially low to middle income wage levels in the economy. There is a view across western Europe and developed economies that there is a growing disparity between corporate incomes and those of workplace employees and between different sectors. In the financial and technology sectors prospects are far better, but wages have been reducing in the retail and manual sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_116"> It would be useful if statistical work was also undertaken on the impact of the minimum wage on overall wage levels. While the minimum wage has brought up wage levels, there might be an argument that in some sectors employers have brought incomes down to meet the minimum wage. It has been my view that in the hospitality sector, for example, over a decade or so that happened, in essence, in many jobs and that once the minimum wage was set, incomes for certain posts came down to meet it. Very little work has been done on that point. We need to critically analyse the wage structure within society and the economy because much academic work undertaken points to the fact that wide gaps are opening up. There are people on very high incomes but the middle income group is declining as well. That is happening in the United States and in most developed economies. It could be a feature of globalisation but ultimately it is having an impact on the nature of democracy. The issue could be the subject of a particular statistical analysis by the CSO. Will the Minister of State ask the CSO to give consideration to that?</p>
            <p eId="para_117"> Did the Minister of State say there is no proposal to expand the scope of statistics being collected and reported relating to employment and wage levels beyond those required by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development comparisons? My understanding from the reply is that the <i>status quo</i> will prevail? Could the Minister of State indicate whether that is the case?</p>

            <p eId="para_118">The final line of the reply outlined that the CSO is continually engaging with national and international stakeholders to look at how we collect data and the best value we can get from data. As to whether we would consider expanding the scope of statistics being collected, the answer is "Yes, we will". When new opportunities are put to us, they are evaluated based on the cost of collecting the data versus the return. One such example is a pilot that is currently being undertaken by the CSO, which was established in the second quarter of this year, namely, the minimum wage quantum survey, the details of which will probably be released later on this year. It might go some way towards establishing the kind of information Deputy Martin seeks - that we all seek - on the basis of the kind of wages that are paid and for what contract hours, to establish whether they are if-and-when contracts, zero-hour contracts or continually 20-hour or 40-hour week contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">While a real effort was made to impart the information to me, much of what is done is based on sampling surveys, as opposed to conducting a detailed analysis of every single worker in the country because obviously that would not be cost-effective. However, the trend obviously is something of which the Government is aware and is tracking. It will be interesting to look at the detailed data that come out of this second quarter pilot survey on the exact quantum of the wages and it will be fed back to the Deputy as soon as possible. There is also a lot of the other stuff the Central Statistics Office, CSO, seeks to track with regard to the living wage and its interaction with the Low Pay Commission. Obviously, it is something on which the office is working but it is open and willing to consider both international best practice and changes it would be necessary to apply here arising therefrom and any suggestions people in this House and beyond might have. However, it must be cost related to the benefit of the data we get back on a statistical level.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">I welcome the reply and would be interested in the minimum wage quantum survey referred to by the Minister of State. She might indicate when Members can expect it to be completed. On the Minister of State's point regarding the sampling methodology, essentially the surveys she mentioned earlier such as the household quarterly survey, the earnings hours and so on all are sample-based surveys. She might revert to Members at a later stage, but what would it take to conduct a proper research-based statistical analysis involving primary data? I ask because the State carries out a census and when I was Minister for Health long ago, I was involved in initiating the longitudinal study to provide long-term data to inform policy on children and young people. That was a long-term commitment made by the State at the time. Likewise, there is a case to be made in respect of wage and employment structures. What would it take for a full-blown primary data procurement approach to understanding them fully? While sampling can give a good indication, it also may miss things along the way. The Minister of State may respond at a later stage as to what it would take to go outside the box and take a form of approach other than just a sampling approach.</p>

Best practice is needed when it comes to comparing wage levels here with those in the OECD and elsewhere.</p>

            <p eId="para_126">I thank Deputy Adams but do not agree with him that there is a race to the bottom. There obviously is a flux and a change with regard to the economic climate that has being dealt on the country for the past ten years and certain people have taken advantage of that. However, it is the job of the Government to make sure it puts in place policies that recognise people do so and fix it.</p>
            <p eId="para_127"> In response to Deputy Micheál Martin, I expect the quantum survey results to be available by the end of the year and, as soon as I receive them, they will be laid before the House and will be available to the Deputy. This morning, I asked the very question asked by the Deputy as to why one cannot simply approach an organisation such as the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, which collects all the data with regard to people in employment. It was explained to me it is not quite as simple as that because although the Revenue Commissioners are charged with collecting tax, they do not collect the exact data that would be necessary to provide the statistics the Deputy and I would need. It was brought to my attention that, thankfully, almost 2 million people are employed in Ireland and to conduct a survey of a size that would provide exact statistical data would be an enormous task. On an annual basis, the CSO conducts a survey with 30,000 businesses, which is a mammoth task for it to do each year. The CSO explained to me that, in Swords, the office is working with 2 million pieces of paper - perhaps it was 200 million pieces of paper - arising from the census results and, consequently, it would be an extremely large project to ascertain the wages and standards of each employee in the country. That is why the CSO works on statistical trends because obviously there is a huge variance between the cost of obtaining the information on the 2 million employees and what can be done with samples. However, as soon as I have to hand the results from the quantum survey, I will give the Deputy the nod and will let him know when it is ready.</p>

            <p eId="para_129">8. <b>Deputy Gino Kenny</b> asked the <b>Taoiseach</b> the average wage for child care workers; and how this compares to European Union and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures. [17147/16]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#ReginaDoherty" eId="spk_82" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach">
            <from>Deputy Regina Doherty<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T13:05:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_130">The exact information the Deputy is looking for is not currently available. The statistics on the average wages are compiled from the quarterly earnings, hour and employment costs surveys, EHECS, the periodic labour costs surveys and structure of earnings surveys conducted under EU regulations. While these surveys include breakdowns by sector and by occupation, the figures do not include a separate breakdown with regard to the child care sector. Accurate results at this level of detail cannot be provided from sample surveys.</p>
            <p eId="para_131"> In the EU statistical classification of economic activities in the European community, NACE, revision 2 system, child day care activities are classified as a sub-group of NACE code 88, social work activities without accommodation. Figures are available for the latter sector from the quarterly EHECS survey, showing an average earning per week of €465.12 in the fourth quarter of 2015. This is the average earning for all occupations working in the social work activities without accommodation sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_132"> Some comparative EU statistics are available for the social work activities sector from the 2012 EU labour costs survey. Annual earnings in the social work activities sector in Ireland were €32,896 in 2012, the fourth highest average earnings in the EU. The UK had a comparative figure of €28,583, while the EU average was €25,468.</p>
            <p eId="para_133"> Average hourly earnings for the social work activities sector are also available from the 2012 EU labour cost survey and show that Ireland earned the fourth highest average hourly earnings in the EU, with mean hourly earnings of €20.21. This compares to mean hourly earnings of €15.87 in the UK and a €15.76 average across the EU. Denmark recorded the highest average hourly earnings in this sector with a figure of €26.70.</p>
            <p eId="para_134"> There are no comparative earnings statistics available on child care workers for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, member countries. The Central Statistics Office, CSO, is currently preparing updated results on the structure of earnings for the years 2011 to 2014 based primarily on administrative rather than survey data. Broad sectoral and occupational statistics from this source will be published before the end of July and more detailed breakdowns will be subsequently available on request from the CSO, subject to the confidentiality rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_135"> While this will enable a more detailed structural table than before, the CSO does not expect that it will be possible to provide tables on earnings on specific detailed occupation codes within the child care worker sector. To identify earnings of child care workers, individual occupations would need to be coded with a four-digit level of international standard classification of occupations. That does not occur currently.</p>

            <p eId="para_136">Strangely enough, I received the Minister of State's response earlier on. It is a bit chaotic here because I was supposed to speak at 3.30 p.m. I was looking over the Minister of State's response and was listening to her when she was verbally responding. It is probably slightly misleading because I was just looking up the SIPTU average hourly rate for child care workers and it is €9.56. If a person is earning that, he or she will probably earn €380 per week for a very important job. I was at a major protest outside the Dáil about a year and a half ago about child care workers who have been so badly paid. There is a huge turnover of child care workers. The Government said that it would address it and so forth. From my research on this, Ireland had the highest cost of child care in the OECD but I do not know the position at this moment. It is a very important industry. It came into the news about two years ago because of the turnover of workers as well as job practice and employment legislation. I do not know if the Minister of State can comment on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_137">There is a variance between the details I read out and the information the Deputy got from SIPTU. SIPTU, in my opinion, classify child care workers at a different mean level. For argument's sake, the OECD and the CSO take child care workers as a sector. That could be somebody working in a crèche right up to somebody working for Tusla, as a clinical social care worker. That is where the mean figure is coming from.</p>
            <p eId="para_138"> I agree with the Deputy that we expect a very high standard, and rightly so, from our child care providers and yet they are probably among the lower-paid workers in the country. I was also at the protest outside the House a couple of years ago that the Deputy mentioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">A great deal of work is being done with the sector. Many educational resources are being provided, including compensation for improvements in standards in the sector not only with regard to education but also in terms of facilities. However, the salary is very much on the lower end of the scale, which is why the Low Pay Commission and particularly the aspiration to move to the living wage are important policies for the Government. That is where I hope we would pursue it.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_85">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_140">I am disappointed that there appears to be an incapacity within the system to get the average working wage for child care workers. I note the reply suggests that because it is a broader social work category which the CSO examines, it is not in a position to look at child care work. That is poor from a policy formulation perspective. We are not in a position to identify officially, and with statistical precision, what the average child care worker is being paid. That will clearly impact on policy development. We have all met with workers in the child care sector and there is a real issue in this regard. In fact, the sector is in crisis because of the downward spiral in wages. Many young students undertook early childhood studies and secured bachelor of arts degrees because, over the last decade, it was considered to be a growing issue and one the country wished to provide for and so forth. My view is that the sector is under the wrong Department. The sooner it is more aligned with education, the better. I tried to do it once but the Department of Justice and Equality wanted the responsibility under the current programme and then it moved to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_141"> The salary levels are too low but it would be useful if we could have statistical work carried out on them. Many young people will not choose these courses in college or further education colleges because of the wage structures afterwards. There is a huge responsibility. All of the providers are at the end of their tether as well because of the various inspections and so forth, and then they cannot keep personnel in work because they wish to go elsewhere. The years from birth to three years of age are the most important three years in a person's development. They will learn more in those three years than they will learn for the rest of their lives and yet the level of wages for those workers, and I acknowledge there is a historical background to this, is way below anything in primary teaching or otherwise. Therefore, clear choices will be made where people have signed on for early childhood education due to a love of it and, after four or five years, there is no appreciable improvement in sight in terms of career prospects or wages. My concern is that there is a very bleak prospect for the sector in general and that we will go backwards in terms of attracting the right personnel into the sector with proper prospects.</p>
            <p eId="para_142"> I ask that the CSO looks again at how it is carrying out the various statistical analyses. From a policy perspective, this country should be seeking to get a proper understanding of what is happening with wages in the child care sector. I am not referring to the higher levels but to those not just in crèches but also in early schools, and the difference between what is happening in the private sector as opposed to the community sector and the State sector. There is an opportunity there to do something more fundamental. More, and more specific, statistics on the child care sector would be very welcome.</p>

            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_143">The Minister of State said earlier that she does not agree that there is a race to the bottom, which does not mean there is no race to the bottom. There is. The child care sector employs approximately 25,000 women and, as Deputy Gino Kenny said, the average pay is €9.56 per hour. Many of the workers must do significant preparation and administrative work which in many cases is unpaid. That is unacceptable and causes burn out. In spite of the high cost of child care to parents, the educators on whom the quality of care depends are undervalued and underpaid. There is no job security or paid leave for many. Many child care workers are laid off in the summer months and many services are unable to pay staff for anything other than core hours. There is evidence that highly skilled graduates are being lost from the sector. The pay and conditions of child care workers must be a consideration for a quality child care system to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_144"> I understand the Department of Education and Skills is carrying out a comprehensive review of the education and training qualifications in early childhood education. When will that review be complete? Would it also be possible to carry out a review of wages paid to child care workers, with a view to introducing salary scales and raising payments accordingly? Will the Government also review the rights of child care workers with a view to strengthening and enhancing them?</p>

            <p eId="para_149">Yes, I know. However, it is not necessary to conduct a collective survey of every child care worker in the country to find out what the average wage is. If SIPTU can arrive at €9.56 for the average child care worker in preschool, obviously we can do it based on sample surveys. I say that because the cost prohibiting us collecting the data is relevant and we must be aware of that. However, let us have a look at it. Deputy Gino Kenny raised this in the first instance, so let us find out if we can get a sample of the particular sector we are discussing to see if it corroborates or matches what SIPTU has announced and perhaps that could feed into some policy decisions to which the Deputies are keen to have changes made. I can come back to the Deputies on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_150">10. <b>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan</b> asked the <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality</b> the measures she is taking to improve the working conditions of rank and file members of An Garda Síochána; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [17508/16]</p>

            <p eId="para_151">The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality will be aware that there is considerable disquiet among the public and in An Garda Síochána regarding the pay and conditions of younger and newer members of the Garda. In that context does the Minister or the Government intend to introduce any measures to improve the working conditions of rank and file members of An Garda Síochána and, if so, when is it intended to introduce them?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_93">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_152">I assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to ensuring that members of An Garda Síochána enjoy a high standard of working conditions and that they are properly resourced and equipped to carry out their duties. Even during the difficult economic period, every effort was made to protect the Garda budget. In line with the recent economic improvement, the 2016 Garda budget allocation of €1.5 billion, for example, includes over €67 million in additional funding from the previous year. In addition, the Government has recently approved €55 million to maintain the necessary policing response to tackle gangland and associated crime. This will allow for concentrated policing targeting gang related crime, the continued intensive and strategic targeting of burglaries and related crime through ongoing support for Operation Thor and continued support for measures against terrorism.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">In respect of the Lansdowne Road agreement, my officials are in discussions with the GRA and the AGSI as we speak with the objective of creating a pathway to their re-engagement with that process. I have met representatives of both associations in recent weeks to convey my support for such re-engagement and that of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and to encourage the associations to continue to actively engage in the process, which I very much hope they will. </p>
            <p eId="para_154"> In the programme for a partnership Government, we have committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement and provide reassurance to citizens. Key to achieving that goal is the commitment in the programme for a partnership Government to continue to accelerate the Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_155"> In accelerating recruitment we want to ensure - this is linked to the point made by Deputy O'Callaghan about working conditions - that there is proper supervision and training for recruits when they come and leave. This point was picked up on by Garda Inspectorate report No. 11 in respect to criminal investigations. When there were large numbers going through Templemore at a particular period, the inspectorate was concerned that the arrangements made for supervision for recruits having left Templemore were not adequate and that people did not get the kind of supervision that is necessary. It is important that we keep that in mind in terms of working conditions. </p>
            <p eId="para_156">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_157"> In accelerating recruitment it is, of course, essential to ensure that An Garda Síochána has the capacity to train larger numbers without any diminution in the quality of its excellent BA programme in applied policing and to provide appropriate supervision and support to newly qualified gardaí to ensure that victims, and the public generally, are well served by their policing service. My officials are engaging with Garda management as a matter of priority in respect of the preparation of a recruitment plan for the next five years that will deliver increased numbers of gardaí without any compromise on the quality of those recruited or the training programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_158"> The programme also commits the Government to doubling the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role, undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures and to increase further civilianisation to free up gardaí for front-line policing duties. The civilian staff of An Garda Síochána make up approximately 14% of the organisation and fulfil a huge range of critical support roles. Further opportunities to increase the use of suitably qualified civilians and release gardaí to front-line roles will be explored in the context of the ongoing consideration of the report of the Garda Síochána Inspectorate "Changing Policing in Ireland - Delivering a Visible, Accessible and Responsive Service", which makes a range of recommendations on this matter. I expect to bring proposals for the implementation of that report to Government before the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_159"> Of course, gardaí must have the modern technology and resources necessary to detect and investigate crimes and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24-7 basis. Some €330 million, including €205 million under the capital plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda Síochána to deploy the latest cutting-edge technologies in the fight against crime. </p>
            <p eId="para_160"> High-visibility policing requires high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles. Investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government's capital plan 2016-2021, which provides €46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that gardaí can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime. This is in addition to the €34 million that has been invested in the fleet since 2012, with more than 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_161"> Our gardaí should have proper modern accommodation. The Garda station building and refurbishment programme 2016-2021 entails an investment of some €60 million in direct Exchequer funding and a public private partnership. Works under the plan include building of new Garda stations and property exhibit management stores. In addition, the plan provides for redevelopment, refurbishment and upgrading of Garda stations at some 30 locations around the country, including custody management facilities. There will also be cell refurbishment at some 15 Garda stations. These projects are in addition to the investment of some €100 million for the construction of three new state-of-the-art divisional and regional headquarters in Kevin Street, Dublin, Wexford and Galway. </p>
            <p eId="para_162"> Taken together, this step change in investment in policing demonstrates this Government's commitment to investing in 21st-century policing and will ensure that the gardaí can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime. It will also serve to provide better facilities and ensure a high quality standard of working conditions for members of An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_163"> The position of whistleblowers in An Garda Síochána is topical. It is important to acknowledge that members of An Garda Síochána may now communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer, or to GSOC, as a prescribed body, under the provisions of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and are entitled to the protections provided by the Act. </p>
            <p eId="para_164"> In addition, the recently launched modernisation and renewal programme for An Garda Síochána contains a number of initiatives aimed at improving the working environment of members, including, for example, the development and implementation of a new HR strategy, better workforce planning and engagement with members, the development of a continuous training and development strategy, a renewed employee assistance programme and the introduction of a performance management framework.</p>

            <p eId="para_165">Obviously, we welcome the further investment of €55 million in respect of targeting and dealing with organised crime. The question I am seeking to address is the issue of pay for new recruits in An Garda Síochána. The Tánaiste will recall that the agreement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael contained an agreement to establish a public service pay commission. The agreement also contained a recognition that the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts would be gradually and by negotiation repealed.</p>
            <p eId="para_166"> Obviously, the Tánaiste cannot determine when the public sector pay commission will commence, but has she had discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform? Has he given her an indication as to when that commission will be up and running? Without it, we will have great difficulty in recruiting the 2,000 or so extra gardaí we require.</p>

            <p eId="para_167">I can confirm to the House that there is no shortage of people applying to become members of An Garda Síochána. Very high numbers continue to apply to enter training and I welcome that. Clearly, we want to see everybody within the Lansdowne Road pay agreement. Gardaí were subject to the same pay reductions as all other public servants over the course of the financial crisis and, similarly, have benefited from the partial restoration of pay commenced on foot of the Lansdowne Road agreement, notwithstanding the fact that both the GRA and the AGSI have rejected that agreement. I am very aware that both bodies feel very frustrated at the pace of pay restoration, but the Government must take a very sustainable and prudent approach to public sector pay, so I restate the commitment to the Lansdowne Road agreement. We are involved in discussions with both bodies and are having very positive and constructive discussions. I am sure the Deputy will join me in hoping that these can be brought to a fruitful conclusion.</p>

            <p eId="para_168">We hope those talks do progress, but that will not disguise the fact that there is frustration among rank and file gardaí about the Garda pay review. I think it was due to finish in June 2014 but, regrettably, we have lost the Chair of that review body. In the context of negotiations and discussions with the Garda representative associations, does the Tánaiste anticipate that the Government will cease paying increments to gardaí from the beginning of July because the GRA rejected the Lansdowne Road agreement in November 2015? Will any provision be made to allow any member of An Garda Síochána who does not wish to be part of the rejection of the Lansdowne Road agreement to enter into an agreement on an individualised basis? What is the Tánaiste's view on the decision by the Garda representative bodies not to work additional hours agreed under the Haddington Road agreement?</p>

            <p eId="para_169">I very much hope that the situation relating to increments described by the Deputy does not arise. Clearly, the discussions and negotiations in which we are involved are aimed at ensuring this situation does not occur on 1 July 2016. Detailed discussions and negotiations are ongoing and various options are being put on the table. I believe both bodies have entered into the discussions in a very constructive manner and I hope they come to a positive conclusion, but they are not concluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_170"> The programme commits to the establishment of a commission for public sector pay to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay. I realise that this is an issue, notwithstanding the fact that pay increases somewhat shortly after graduation because of rosters. I know this issue is of huge concern to both organisations in respect of younger members.</p>

            <p eId="para_173">As the Deputy is aware, I published the report of the O'Higgins Commission of Investigation (Certain Matters relative to the Cavan-Monaghan Division of An Garda Síochána) on 11 May. As I have previously stated, it deserves the most careful consideration so that we can do everything possible to avoid a repeat of the issues which gave rise to the commission in the first place.</p>
            <p eId="para_174"> On 19 May 2016 the Garda Commissioner wrote to me asking that I use the legal powers available to me to ask the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to investigate matters alleged to have occurred in respect of a meeting in Mullingar involving certain officers. Section 102 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 permits me to do so if I consider it desirable. I informed the House during the debate that took place on the O'Higgins report that I was consulting with the Attorney General about the precise nature of such a request.</p>
            <p eId="para_175"> On the basis of the advice provided by the Attorney General, I sought additional information from the Garda Commissioner. The Garda Commissioner provided me with more detailed information on 3 June 2016. Having considered the Commissioner's detailed request, and satisfying myself that it was desirable in the public interest that this matter be investigated, as to leave it unaddessed could undermine confidence in An Garda Síochána, I made a request to GSOC on 16 June 2016. My powers under section 102 are not to be exercised lightly and, in all the circumstances, I do not believe that there was any undue delay in making this request.</p>

            <p eId="para_176">What was the additional information sought by the Tánaiste? Was it new information or information that was available to the O'Higgins inquiry, particularly in respect of this issue? It was my understanding that all matters relating to this would have been discussed before the inquiry so I am curious as to what the additional information sought by the Tánaiste was. The Garda Commissioner made a request on 19 May 2016 and the first time we were aware of it was the following week at the beginning of the Dáil debate, which was held on 25 May 2016. As of 8 June 2016, in a reply to a parliamentary question, it was stated that there was no referral, but the Tánaiste is now saying that this referral was made to GSOC on 16 June. I take it that GSOC is now investigating this complaint.</p>

            <p eId="para_177">These are very significant powers in respect of investigation. I must consider every investigation very carefully in terms of whether it is the right thing to do. I had to consider the commission of investigation and the context and I had to get the advice of the Attorney General as to whether she considered it appropriate given the various issues involved. The information relating to the Garda Commissioner was more general. She had given me a detailed request and I felt it was in the public interest and went ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_178">It was a number of weeks but there were various pieces of work that needed to be done before I requested GSOC to do this investigation and it is now in a position to do that independent investigation.</p>

            <p eId="para_180">I do not know the details of the interaction between Transparency International Ireland and the Garda Commissioner. The Garda Commissioner has said she wants to make every effort to ensure that whistleblowers are dealt with appropriately in the Garda Síochána and that the culture of whistleblowing changes so that it is a safe place if members of the force wish to report issues of concern to them and want to make protected disclosures within the force. As part of that, she has said she will work with an outside body, namely, Transparency International Ireland, to do that work. I assume the work has started but I can ask the Commissioner for an update on that and communicate with the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_182">Since December 2015, there has been a vacancy on the Court of Appeal. The Courts Act 2015 was enacted in December 2015 which increased the number of High Court judges by two, so there are vacancies for two more High Court judges. There are also vacancies in the Circuit Court and the District Court. When does the Government intend to nominate appropriately qualified individuals to fill those positions? Is it the case that the Government is awaiting the establishment of the judicial appointments commission? If so, when will that happen?</p>

            <p eId="para_183">In the programme for Government, there are some very significant commitments on change in the area of judicial appointments. I will be bringing proposals to Government for a general scheme of a judicial appointments Bill as soon as I am in a position to. The new judicial appointments commission is an important element of the policy framework agreement between our parties. The commitment in the new programme for Government will be reflected in the provisions of the general scheme, including the composition and chairing of the new authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_184"> There was a public consultation process held on this issue. Consultations indicate it is important to ensure the Judiciary retains the independence that is critical for the discharge of its constitutional function; that it reflects, as far as possible, the diverse nature of the society from which it is drawn; that it enjoys the confidence and trust of society; and that the Judiciary is appointed on merit. There are approximately eight vacancies across the courts at present which the Government will be considering in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_185">Sometimes people think that the filling of judicial vacancies is a matter to convenience judges or lawyers, which it is not. It is required in order to ensure that citizens who appear before our courts, who are anxious to secure and seek justice, have an opportunity to have their rights vindicated. When there is an absence or shortage of judges and vacancies that have not been filled, it interferes with the constitutional rights of those citizens and the families of victims of crime to have their cases heard promptly. We are now in a situation where we have waited for six months for the appointment of appropriately qualified persons to the Court of Appeal and the High Court. There needs to be some level of urgency to the Government's deliberations on this matter. Where the process has gone through the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and we are just waiting for Government nominations, it is crucial that the Government proceeds to make nominations to fill vacancies in the Judiciary rather than waiting to find out what will happen with the judicial appointments commission.</p>

            <p eId="para_186">I note what the Deputy says about the impact of vacancies on the court. We expect at least ten this year. The business of every court is affected to some degree and we do not want to see justice being delayed. I cannot be definitive on the matter today but the Government is likely to determine the approach to be taken on this matter in the coming weeks, taking all relevant matters into account. I note the point the Deputy makes about the impact of vacancies and I am very aware of that in the various courts. I would like to fill those vacancies as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_187">If there is a desire within Government to try to delay the nomination of judges pending the establishment of the judicial appointments commission, I urge it to bring forward legislation promptly in respect of such a judicial appointments commission. That is something that Fianna Fáil intends to do. We believe the judicial appointments commission process should be amended so that the independent advisory body to Government will nominate a smaller number of individuals. At present under the Judicial Advisory Appointments Board, the number is seven and we think it should be reduced to three. We also think that individuals should be ranked on merit.</p>
            <p eId="para_188"> I am happy to work with the Tánaiste on the judicial appointments commission. Can she give an indication as to when she intends to bring that legislation before the House as it seems to be having an impact on the Government's decision to nominate individuals to fill vacancies?</p>

            <p eId="para_189">I am sure the Deputy will agree that in advance of drafting that legislation, it is important to have consultation with all the relevant stakeholders. I welcome the Deputy's offer to work with the Government, particularly given that the policy he has outlined in terms of a smaller number is much in line with the changes we discussed during Government formation. The Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, conclusions in the fourth evaluation round in Ireland found the Judiciary to be among the most trusted public institutions in the country. We have been very well served by the judges in this country despite some of the critical comments one hears about the nomination and selection of judges. That has been found to be the case based on the independent evaluation carried out by the Council of Europe. It is very gratifying that the principle of judicial independence was recognised by an international evaluation team, such as GRECO, and that the independence and professionalism of our judges is undisputed. The legislation will be complex and will need consultation. It will take some time to get to that legislation but I accept the points the Deputy has made on judicial appointments.</p>

There are 4,000 to 5,000 people living under this system, 1,700 children growing up within it and more than 400 children already born in Ireland in the system.

            <p eId="para_192">Every effort is made on a continuous basis to provide a high level of service to persons in the direct provision system. The direct provision system comprises not just full board accommodation but a range of services including health, education and welfare supports. The principal issue identified in the McMahon report was the length of time people live in the system. Many of the applicants living in direct provision have multiple appeals under way at present which has contributed to the length of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_193"> We are committed to reforming the direct provision system, with particular focus on families and children. The previous Government established the working group chaired by Judge McMahon. Last week I held a meeting with all of the relevant stakeholders and discussed with them the implementation of that report and our progress on it. The McMahon report said we have to improve the application process and the quality of life in the accommodation through improvements in services. Of the 173 recommendations that were made, a total of 91 of them have been taken forward; 49 are partially implemented and in progress and the balance remain under consideration. When I met the various stakeholders working in this area we identified a number of areas where further improvements can be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">I am meeting a group again in September to continue that work. I meet them on a regular basis so that we can progress the reforms.</p>
            <p eId="para_195"> The International Protection Act, which was enacted last year, takes forward 29 of the recommendations because we need a speedier and more effective system that ensures applications are dealt with quickly and appropriately and that people are not in the system. Many thousands of cases have been heard in the past year and the number of people who are in direct provision over five years has decreased significantly. In fact, the vast majority have now moved to being there for under three years. There has been a substantial change, particularly in terms of the main recommendation the McMahon report highlighted.</p>

            <p eId="para_198">I point out to the Tánaiste that last year the UN Human Rights Committee described it as a severe violation of human rights. That committee is very hard on the system of children living in what has been called "state-sanctioned poverty".</p>
            <p eId="para_199"> The Tánaiste will be aware that there is an allowance of €19.10 a week for each adult in direct provision. That was set in 1999 and has not changed. According to my calculation of indexation for inflation, that allowance should be a meagre €27.50. Instead of looking after those in direct provision, the Government is paying out millions of euro to the companies which make vast profits in providing the accommodation. All of the evidence shows, as the Tánaiste must agree, that there are severe mental issues with thousands of adults and children living in an environment where they have no control, where adults are not allowed work or study and where children are not even allowed bring their classmates home to play with them. Could the Tánaiste please comment on those humane issues that are outstanding in dealing with this issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_200">As Deputy Bríd Smith will be aware, a decision was taken by the previous Government not to increase the sum paid for adults but to increase the sum paid for children. In the Department of Education and Skills, the former Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, made the decision about children moving on to third level. It is a small number, but that decision was taken to ensure that children in direct provision could access third level places as well. There were also the other changes which I have spoken about.</p>
            <p eId="para_201"> As I said at the beginning, we want to provide as high a level of service to persons who are awaiting assessment as we can. A number of centres have been closed. Every effort is being made to improve the standards of accommodation. It is a serious issue. We discussed it again with the NGOs, the representatives of which attended last week, as I stated.</p>
            <p eId="para_202"> There are child protection policies and child support policies in place. We clearly want to ensure that the centres meet international human rights standards. I certainly want to ensure that is the case. I recently agreed that the Ombudsman for Children would have a role in relation to direct provision and that has been widely welcomed. That ensures that there now is an independent person - there are also inspections - who can also make recommendations of changes he or she considers necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_203">I again ask the Tánaiste to comment on some of the reports. I refer to a confidential Government report in 2013 which stated that the system was not ideal but it saved us money, and we did not want to change it in case we attracted other asylum seekers from the United Kingdom. Would the Tánaiste agree that, in reality, we are reinforcing the fortress Europe idea that we want to keep them out as much as possible despite the fact that many of them are fleeing war, famine, dictatorships, etc., that even when they get here we treat them as less than human or second-class people, and that there is an outrageous amount of money being made by companies providing direct provision? It is not even State provision. We are handing over taxpayers' money to those making vast profits to keep people in conditions which can only be termed as inhumane and psychologically damaging, and very damaging to children who grow up in the system. We also have approximately 400 children born in this country in a complete limbo as to who and what they are because they are not entitled to citizenship and they cannot go back to where their parents came from.</p>

Our full obligation under resettlement will be met by the end of September when over 500 refugees from camps in Lebanon will have arrived in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_213"> I do not believe it was ever envisaged that the act of depositing files with the sponsoring Minister was intended to allow that Minister access to the private proceedings of a commission of investigation. That would mean that after any commission of investigation had concluded its work in any area, despite the fact that evidence was given in private, the veil of confidentiality surrounding its proceedings could be lifted by any Minister who could then go through the evidence given in private by any party to the commission proceedings. That would be wholly inappropriate and, in any case, section 11(3) of the Commission of Investigation Act 2004 specifically provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that a person, including a member of the commission, shall not disclose or publish any evidence given in private except in certain restricted circumstances. The act of depositing those documents in my Department has to be seen as consistent with that obligation and, accordingly, it would not be proper for me, as Minister, to access commission papers except in accordance with the very specific exceptions set out in the Act. It is clear too from section 11 that it would be an offence for a Minister to disclose material covered by that section except in the limited circumstances set out in that section.</p>

            <p eId="para_214">I am astounded by the Tánaiste's answer. It does not hold sway. The Tánaiste is the person to whom the Garda Commissioner is answerable. I did not ask the Tánaiste to publish or disclose the information that is in her possession and charge. I asked the Tánaiste if she had read it.</p>
            <p eId="para_215"> The Tánaiste seems to think it is sufficiently important to commission a section 102 investigation with GSOC into these matters which, the Tánaiste told us earlier, was critically important. What will GSOC find out or what will it look for? Was evidence given to the commission from two officers saying that at a meeting in Mullingar Sergeant Maurice McCabe gave evidence to indicate that his motivation was malicious? If they did say this, why was that not acted upon?</p>
            <p eId="para_216">How will GSOC get access to that information if the Minister, as the person to whom the documentation is lawfully lodged, cannot get access to it? It is not really a major investigation and either they did or they did not. The Minister is on record as saying we cannot pass comment because we have only seen part of the story. There is an onus on the Minister, as the person responsible for the Garda Commissioner, to see the full story. She does not have to make it public. If she cannot see that, to be honest we have a much bigger problem with the justice portfolio than I thought.</p>

            <p eId="para_217">I am equally astounded that the Deputy believes I should access papers belonging to a commission of investigation held in private, with people afforded confidentiality with respect to evidence. I am equally astounded the Deputy believes that should be done despite legislation and the detail of it. Mr. Justice O'Higgins was in a position to hear all the evidence presented to the commission and it was entirely a matter for the commission, having heard all the evidence, to reach its conclusions and deal with whatever matters it considered appropriate in its report.</p>
            <p eId="para_218"> With regard to how whistleblowing is dealt with inside An Garda Síochána, the Garda Commissioner has made absolutely clear her policy position on the support that the Garda should and is giving to whistleblowers. There is no question of my examining the papers given to me from the commission. As a result of the serious issues that arose and to avoid any lack of confidence or clarity with the issues identified by the O'Higgins commission, I have referred the matter to GSOC. The Deputy knows GSOC is an independent body and it will carry out an independent investigation, deciding on its methodology and how to approach the investigation. I certainly will not assume anything about the rights or wrongs of what happened because I do not have the facts. The O'Higgins commission had the facts and published its report. I have now referred the particular issue relating to Mullingar for independent investigation, which is important.</p>

            <p eId="para_219">Let us be very clear. The Minister has the facts but she has stated that she has chosen not to look at them. That is a very serious issue as there is nothing in legislation preventing the Minister from doing that. She has told the House that testimony of which the dogs on the street have seen part is okay but the Minister, who is responsible for the Garda Commissioner, cannot gain access to it. Not only that but she told us she has referred the matter to GSOC. I presume the Minister believes GSOC will be able to examine material that she cannot examine; otherwise how could we get to the truth of the matter? It is not an insignificant matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_220"> The Minister has just indicated that the Garda Commissioner has made absolutely clear her commitment to whistleblowers but I dispute that commitment. I know what the Commissioner has said in public and what she does behind closed doors are different. That is what the evidence in the public domain is telling us with regard to Maurice McCabe. I know that to be the case with current whistleblowers. Unless this is answered, there will be a critical crisis of confidence in the service. The Minister cannot hide behind legislation and legal opinion that she has not sought on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_227">I ask this question against the backdrop of the Women's Aid impact report launched last week. As the Minister is aware, there were 22,341 reports of domestic abuse against women and children made in 2015, amounting to 61 per day or almost one every 20 minutes. That is just what is being reported. What measures will the Minister bring forward to tackle domestic violence and will she make a statement on the matter?</p>

            <p eId="para_228">Like the Deputy, I attended the launch of the Women's Aid impact report last week. The statistics quoted and all the statistics are very disturbing. I stated at the launch that I thought when I began working on equality issues many years ago, as people became better informed as we dealt with issues of violence, alcohol and drugs, perhaps this scourge might even disappear. Unfortunately, the opposite has been the case and it remains a very serious social issue and a personal health issue for the people, primarily women, who are involved. We need to put all our attention on tackling this scourge of domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_229"> It is important that people report incidents and that we have better laws, with gardaí better trained to respond. It is a priority issue for An Garda Síochána. We also have the national strategy and I met all the stakeholders to discuss and develop that. It is very comprehensive for the years ahead. We also need stronger legislation and the consolidated domestic violence Bill is currently being worked on. I hope we will be able to publish that later this year, as that would be helpful. There are a number of outstanding issues and Women's Aid has highlighted elements relating to offences, suggesting some improvements. If we can, we will respond to the points made. I have stated that increased funding will be necessary in this area and the HSE is considering further support for helplines, which is important. I have been in touch with officials about that.</p>
            <p eId="para_230"> I was concerned about the points raised at the launch of the report, particularly the facilities in Dolphin House. I have arranged for a meeting between representatives of the Courts Service of Ireland and Women's Aid to see if we can do something further to accelerate an improvement in conditions. There will be extra staff and some cases are being taken to a different location. I hope we can accelerate improvements there in advance of the development of the new Hammond Lane facility, which will be state of the art, in dealing with family law cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_231">I appreciate the Minister's comments, particularly regarding stronger legislation that is required. I was going to ask when the Bill will be published and the reason for the delay but, to be fair, the Minister has answered that. She rightly spoke about encouraging women to report incidents of domestic violence. Even in the time we are having this debate, there is no doubt that at least another five or six women are reporting such incidents, so it is absolutely a major crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_232"> One aspect that the Minister is examining and which shocked me is what is happening in the courts in Dolphin House. There is a waiting period of at least four months for women reporting issues of domestic violence before it comes to a hearing. In those four months many of the women must live in the home of the perpetrator, with children stuck in an absolutely impossible position. In many cases, these people are intimidated. Does the Minister intend to act, on the suggestion of Women's Aid, to extend eligibility for safety orders to young women in dating relationships?</p>

            <p eId="para_233">The Courts Service has established a committee to drive forward the development of the family court complex. Last year I worked with the then Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Simon Harris, and we secured that site for this new family court development. It is extremely important and will make a significant difference.</p>
            <p eId="para_234">Additional staff have now been sanctioned for the Dublin District Family Law Court office and that will facilitate the transfer of child care cases from Dolphin House to the new temporary child care court facility in Chancery Street until the new family law complex is open. That will help.</p>
            <p eId="para_235"> In respect of the inclusion of dating relationships in the legislation, that is something I am examining. It raises complex issues, but I will examine it and if at all possible I will include it in the legislation. I am taking advice on that. It is certainly an issue I am considering. In the vast majority of cases where emergency orders are necessary, they are dealt with as emergencies, but I am very conscious of the delays and am concerned about it, as is the President of the District Court, and we would like to take action to ensure that situation changes.</p>

            <p eId="para_236">I thank the Minister for clarifying that. We can speak about what happens in Dublin and in respect of the court here, but this is a problem right around the country. In particular, the fact that Teach Tearmainn, with which the Minister would be familiar, is not open to full capacity to deal with women who suffer from violence and have to leave their homes is a huge shame. Women are being stripped of their dignity and their children are too, because children are often unsuspecting independent witnesses to what goes on between their parents. There is a problem in terms of women who have to leave their homes because of domestic violence. They are not considered homeless by the local housing authorities, so the refuges need to be working at full capacity and we need more of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_237"> One other question I would like to ask the Minister relates to the full resources that are needed for the national 24-7 domestic violence helpline. What assistance can the Minister give here?</p>

            <p eId="para_242">I thank Deputy Casey for his good wishes. As he will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda regions, divisions, and districts. Garda management keeps this distribution under continuing review, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities. It is very important that we do that. The inspectorate report has spoken about the need to continually monitor and review how gardaí are allocated to different areas depending on crime trends. Crime trends vary considerably around the country and we cannot just make those decisions based on precedent or history.</p>
            <p eId="para_243"> I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner, in summary, that there were 19 stations on 30 April 2011, with 350 members assigned to the Wicklow division. On 30 April 2016 there were 17 stations in the Wicklow division, with<b>
							</b>311<b>
							</b>gardaí assigned to the division.<b>
							</b>As the Deputy will understand, a significant amount of information on the area is available, down to station and sub-district level, which he has requested. For ease of reference I have provided him with a breakdown of the detailed information. That is available to him for the record. I will not go into all of that detail here.</p>
            <p eId="para_244"> I and the Government are committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence. I have shown that through my actions as Minister for Justice and Equality in reopening Templemore training college and giving a commitment to accelerate the increase in Garda numbers to 15,000. Deputy Casey's party also supported this commitment and was very keen to see it in the programme for Government. I am hoping that for the September intake we will be in a position, depending on my discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to accelerate the intake into Templemore and to see more gardaí coming through so that we can repair the damage that was done during the period of recession, when Garda numbers were reduced, Templemore was closed and investment stopped. All of that has changed thanks to the better economic situation, and we are now investing very heavily in An Garda Síochána once again, as evidenced by recent actions.</p>

            <p eId="para_245">I acknowledge the good work the Garda is doing in exceptionally difficult and constrained times. I know the Minister is talking about the distribution of gardaí. There is still only a limited number of gardaí available for the country as a whole, and Wicklow has suffered by a reduction of 40 since 2011. More worryingly, Wicklow received ten new recruits, two of whom have resigned. Hopefully that is not a worrying trend.</p>
            <p eId="para_246"> Wicklow has a very large urbanised area to the north and has a very large rural area bordering Dublin, where criminals are organised and mobile and are using both the N11 and the N81 to access rural areas. The reduction in the number of gardaí in Wicklow has resulted in a corresponding increase in recorded crime, with an increase of more than 10% in the number of serious drugs offences and sexual offences and a massive 27% increase in weapons and explosives offences.</p>

            <p eId="para_247">As the Deputy said, ten of the newly attested gardaí have been assigned to the Wicklow division. As I said in my original answer, it is extremely important that we allocate gardaí to different areas. It is the Garda Commissioner who makes that decision; I have absolutely nothing to do with decisions on the number of gardaí in particular areas or transfers. These are entirely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I want to be very clear about that. It is extremely important that those decisions are made on the basis of looking at crime trends, examining decreases or increases in respect of crime trends, and making sure decisions are taken on that basis. As I said, Wicklow got ten new gardaí as a result of the increased recruitment. I have no doubt that the situation in relation to the crime trends the Deputy describes will be monitored, because we are very conscious of the mobile gangs that move along that corridor and try to commit crime.</p>

            <p eId="para_248">The retirement of senior personnel and the knowledge that goes with them is also a concern. As an immediate response, would the Minister consider increasing the retirement age of gardaí from 60 to 63 on a voluntary basis? I think I have heard this mentioned before. That would help address the situation immediately and the force would retain that knowledge. The cost-benefit balance would be good because there would be no lump sum payment and no pension payment of 50%. As part of the programme for Government, we are trying to say we want to reinvest in the public services. Maybe that is an option the Minister could consider.</p>

            <p eId="para_249">Quite a number of people make recommendations about bringing back retired gardaí, for example. It is not possible to bring back retired gardaí to do the job of current members of An Garda Síochána, but the Commissioner is examining whether there are ways in which the skill and experience gardaí have built up over the years, as the Deputy rightly described, might be used in a range of areas. That is very important if it is feasible. Extending the retirement age would have implications across the public sector. In that context, it would be a decision for the whole Government, particularly the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to consider.</p>
            <p eId="para_250"> What we are doing now is accelerating the recruitment. That is the important issue. We also have to work on the increasing civilianisation of An Garda Síochána. That is very important as well. In that regard, advertisements were placed in the newspaper just two weeks ago for more staff so that we can continue the civilianisation in Terminal 2 in Dublin Airport. That will free up some gardaí to do other important duties.</p>

            <p eId="para_252">Last month this House debated the report of the O'Higgins commission. During the course of that debate, I referred to the fact that the central and most important message from the report was the consistent reference to management and supervision failures within An Garda Síochána. It is instructive to note that since then, the Policing Authority has expressed its views on the O'Higgins report. Does the Minister share the views expressed by myself and by the Policing Authority on the systemic performance and management failures within An Garda Síochána and does she share the dismay expressed by the authority at the familiarity and repetition of these performance failures?</p>

            <p eId="para_253">Whatever the problems that need to be addressed we should never fail to show our appreciation for the front-line work of An Garda Síochána. We see their dangerous and courageous work daily and we see it at present in the north inner city. It is extremely important that we express our full support for the work they do but that does not mean they are immune from criticism. Many reports over the years, ranging back to the Morris tribunal, have underlined the need for cultural change within An Garda Síochána. In the comments I have made on the Garda Inspectorate report No. 11 and on the O'Higgins report, I have acknowledged the change that is needed and the faults that have been there traditionally, particularly in the area of culture.</p>
            <p eId="para_254"> We established the independent Policing Authority and this is one of the most significant developments since the foundation of the State. It is a major reform to have an independent body, such as the Policing Authority, examining how An Garda Síochána functions and asking the Commissioner to report on a whole range of areas. Together with the programme of reform the Garda Commissioner is implementing, this will build up confidence but there is a range of issues that need to be addressed. Management and culture are two important issues but investment is also needed. The Deputy asked earlier about support for An Garda Síochána and through pay and other areas which need investment we can ensure it gets the necessary support.</p>
            <p eId="para_255"> The Policing Authority is marked by its independence and the calibre of those appointed to serve on the board. Josephine Feehily is at the helm and there is a range of high-standing experienced members. It has begun its work in earnest and we all welcome the focus it has put on victims of crime. The O'Higgins report referred specifically to victims of crime and the need for them to be dealt with more centrally in the criminal justice system. </p>

            <p eId="para_256">It is very important that people express support for An Garda Síochána. It is important that the political system does this and that the public has confidence in An Garda Síochána. It is also important that in order to improve An Garda Síochána and its young recruits, there is proper management and supervision within the force. It is instructive to note that the O'Higgins report and the comments on the report by the Policing Authority are consistent about supervision and management problems at senior levels in An Garda Síochána. There may need to be a change in culture in the force to recognise that when people raise questions, they are entitled to raise them and the issues have to be tackled. The only way that will change is if there is a change in attitude of senior management in An Garda Síochána. Is the Minister satisfied that senior management is truly committed to the change that she and I know is required to achieve the objectives?</p>

            <p eId="para_257">I have had a number conversations with the Commissioner and senior officers on this issue. Those issues jumped to the fore when we were discussing the O'Higgins report. I believe the Garda Commissioner and the senior force are committed to the necessary changes and this is shown in the five-year modernisation and renewal programme published by the Garda Commissioner. This change does not, however, happen overnight, although I agree that it needs to be driven from the top. People at senior level need to be motivated to bring about the change that is necessary. I believe there is a commitment to do it and I have supported the Garda Commissioner in taking every step possible to make sure that the necessary management change is brought about. Investing in IT is part of that as it will enable the work of gardaí to be managed better. We have made a very significant investment in that area but it is about a combined approach.</p>

            <p eId="para_258">One of the difficulties for An Garda Síochána is that the political system concentrates on the force and gets interested in its failings in the aftermath of specific reports. As a result of that political concentration, the Garda can move from crisis to crisis. It is important to have an appraisal and a proper assessment of An Garda Síochána away from crises, such as those dealt with by the Morris and O'Higgins reports. We need to change management and supervision to ensure that the victims of crime are not let down as they were in the case of the material dealt with in the O'Higgins report.</p>
            <p eId="para_259"> The Minister will also be aware that there were a couple of recommendations in the O'Higgins report, one of which was to change the terms and conditions of the sergeant in charge. Will the Minister urge the Commissioner to conduct an immediate review and change of the terms and conditions of sergeants in charge? It is one of the few recommendations in the O'Higgins report on which we can act promptly.</p>

            <p eId="para_260">I take the points made by Deputy O'Callaghan and he is absolutely correct in his analysis. There have been very significant changes relating to training and supervision over the past two years. Supervision is now much more carefully built in. This is particularly the case in respect of new recruits but we need to see it throughout the force. It has been difficult for An Garda Síochána with the recruitment being stopped and with the gaps that there are in a variety of areas, including specialist areas. Supervision and management have been difficult because of staff shortages. It is no excuse but we need that situation to develop and with the new recruitment and investment, the force will be in a better position to make sure that happens. There have been significant changes in training, which are also extremely important. Work has already begun on the role of sergeants.</p>

            <p eId="para_264">As I said earlier in response to a similar question on a different area, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda regions, divisions and districts. It is kept under review and now that more gardaí are being recruited, there are new people available to go to new areas. In summary, there were 31 stations on 30 April 2011 with 303 members assigned to the Longford-Roscommon division. On 30 April 2016, there were 22 stations in the Longford-Roscommon division with 298 gardaí assigned to the division, a small drop in the number of gardaí there. There is a lot of information available down to district and sub-district level and I have arranged for it to be made available to the Deputy and to be put on the record.</p>
            <p eId="para_265"> I want to see a strong and visible police presence. This is dependent on recruitment and on the increasing civilianisation of gardaí and freeing gardaí from administrative tasks, which is extremely important to give our communities reassurance and to deter crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_266">We are having success in terms of the targeted operations. I put the figures relating to Operation Thor in the public arena some time ago. I made €5 million available for overtime in that very targeted operation to deal with the spate of burglaries we have been seeing, and it had extremely good effects in many areas throughout the country. We have extra recruitment now and I hope to accelerate that process in September so that we will have more gardaí available to be assigned, at the discretion of the Commissioner, to the areas where the crime trends show the need for them.</p>

            <p eId="para_527">Given that her portfolio is an enormous one, I acknowledge that the Tánaiste, as the senior Minister in the Department, is here. It is important that she is here. I also acknowledge what the Tánaiste said about the superintendents and the Commissioner, but the Tánaiste needs to communicate this message back. In 2010, 183 gardaí were in service in County Roscommon. I understand the figure is now down to 169. This is a 7.7% drop and means there are 14 fewer gardaí. In the Galway division, which is part of the Galway region, covering Ahascragh, Ballinasloe, Ballygar, Creggs, Ballymoe, Glennamaddy, and Williamstown, in 2010 we had 54 gardaí, but it is now down to 46 gardaí. That is a 14.8% decrease. It is clear that rural Ireland is losing out.</p>
            <p eId="para_528"> I will give a few examples. In 2010, the town of Boyle had 30 gardaí. It is now down to 26 gardaí, which is a 13.3% drop. In 2010, the town of Ballinasloe had 46 gardaí. It is now down to 41 gardaí, which is a 10.9% drop. This is a crisis. Will the Tánaiste go back with a very strong message on policing in rural Ireland? It is not being addressed, the numbers are falling away and Garda stations are closing.</p>

            <p eId="para_529">We had a cycle of boom and bust and an economy that was in deep trouble. It is clear that this had an impact on recruitment. Templemore was closed. I am the Minister that reopened Templemore, restarted recruitment and started reinvesting in An Garda Síochána. We want to provide as much support as possible to rural communities. The types of initiative that have been taken, for example, in Kilkenny, where we see the Garda and businesses working together on crime issues, have been very effective. I have seen that in other counties as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_530"> The Garda Commissioner examines crime trends. In some areas, crime figures have decreased considerably. We must align our allocation of gardaí and the designation of gardaí to different stations with the needs of the areas. I take the Deputy's points and have no doubt the Commissioner will consider them carefully. However, she looks at the needs of all Garda divisions when deciding the allocation of newly attested gardaí and, in fact, five of the newly attested gardaí have been assigned to the Longford-Roscommon Garda division to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_531">I thank the Tánaiste for her reply. However, my understanding is that no new recruit came west of the River Shannon. Perhaps they came to Longford but, as far as I understand, no new recruit came west of the River Shannon.</p>
            <p eId="para_532"> I acknowledge the Tánaiste's reply. However, in the Roscommon-Galway division, seven Garda stations have been closed. Even if it were the case that just one or two of them were closed, I would not agree with it. Termonbarry is a beautiful village on the N5, a major route to the west and the River Shannon near it. Its Garda station is closed. Ballymoe is a busy part of County Galway; its Garda station is closed. I can also mentioned Knockcroghery, Ballyforan, Loughglinn, Ballintober and Cootehall. Take the closure of Cootehall Garda station, which is in the Boyle region. The number of gardaí in the Boyle Garda station, which was a 24-hour service that has now been cut back as well, has dropped by four, along with the closure of Cootehall Garda station in the same region. These are the issues and I ask the Tánaiste to bring back a strong message to the superintendents and the Commissioner. We need a change in policy and we need more gardaí in rural Ireland, particularly in Roscommon-Galway, the constituency in which I live.</p>

            <p eId="para_533">I repeat that it is important that gardaí be allocated to where there is an identified strong need. We are accelerating recruitment but it will always be a finite resource. Where communities are working together, it is obvious that they need a garda. However, a whole-of-community response is important, with, for instance, tradespeople, business people and taxi drivers all working together. I have increased the funding available and doubled it for the likes of Macra na Feirme, Crimestoppers and voluntary organisations working on text alert and various other schemes. That is important as well. I believe that what we need more than anything is a mobile and responsive police force that can respond with alacrity to calls from the public and that can prevent and interrupt crime.</p>

            <p eId="para_536">The report of the Garda Inspectorate on crime investigation gave us an analysis of An Garda Síochána's investigative processes and it is an extremely good report. If the recommendations in the report are followed, it is intended that the methods and investigative processes used by An Garda Síochána would align with best international practice. Our goal should be to have a policing service, An Garda Síochána, that meets and exceeds the best international standards. There is no reason not to have such a policing service.</p>
            <p eId="para_537"> After the report was published, An Garda Síochána established a strategic transformation office at Garda Headquarters to co-ordinate and facilitate the implementation of the reforms that arose from that inspectorate report. The recommendations in the report are an important component of the overall justice reform programme that has been put in place in recent years. The reform programme is being overseen by the Cabinet committee on justice reform, which is chaired by An Taoiseach. We invite the chair of the independent Policing Authority to the committee from time to time, as well as the Commissioner and her senior staff, to oversee the delivery of the reforms recommended by the inspectorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_538"> As I stated already, the implementation of those reforms is clearly supported by the significant investments we have made in policing resources under the framework of the capital plan, including €205 million for technology, as well as a series of investments in An Garda Síochána. We have three new headquarters and a new headquarters in Sligo. There is a significant programme of investment supporting the Garda to continue to reach the highest standards. Deputy Durkan said that this is necessary and I agree with him.</p>

            <p eId="para_540">I encourage Members to look at An Garda Síochána's strategy statement for the coming year, which outlines the priority areas in terms of the work of, investment in and direction of An Garda Síochána. Community policing is identified as a priority in that statement. We are fortunate in Ireland with regard to the relationship between An Garda Síochána and the local community. A number of people have said that they feel that is in danger of being lost at present. The new recruitment will help to deal with the issue and it is a priority area. An Garda Síochána and the Commissioner recognise, as I have emphasised repeatedly, the importance of community policing as a front line of defence against criminal activity and in supporting communities. Of course, policing is also changing in many ways in terms of the challenges of cyber-crime, terrorism and security, and gardaí need to be appropriately equipped. We need to look in particular at the interoperability of our Irish systems with international databases, which is an ongoing challenge that I intend to address.</p>

            <p eId="para_541">I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality. Perhaps she will clarify if any comparisons have been made, in the context of the effectiveness of community policing, between policing the beat on foot and policing via a motor car or other mechanically propelled vehicle. Obviously it is possible for the police officer in those circumstances to cover a much wider area and to respond more rapidly and possibly more effectively. Will the Minister indicate to what extent we should consider the armed threat posed by criminal gangs to our police force and how can we augment the Garda capability in those circumstances?</p>

            <p eId="para_542">With regard to the Deputy's last point, An Garda Síochána has shown again and again that it will stand up to the threat from criminal gangs and the Government will certainly support the force in doing that. The €50 million that was allocated two weeks ago to An Garda Síochána is evidence of that support. The threat from criminal gangs is severe. They are engaged in a cycle of revenge and retaliation which has to be interrupted. An Garda Síochána has shown over many years that it is capable of dealing with dissidents and with those who threatened our peace. The Garda was capable of dealing with the threat of violence in Limerick and in other places where 24 out of 25 murders were solved. I have no doubt they will do the same in the current investigations. There are over 20 people before the courts at present in relation to those investigations but An Garda Síochána wants to prevent such occurrences, to investigate them and to prosecute them.</p>
            <p eId="para_543"> With regard to the comparisons I do not think it is a question of either-or: we need both community policing and we need armed response units and we will have a new armed response unit in Dublin later this year. An investment has been made in that which is important. I believe we need a variety of policing methods in order to deal with modern criminality in all its guises.</p>

            <p eId="para_546">The deployment of Garda armed units is directed at highly dangerous threats, whether from organised crime or terrorism. An Garda Síochána’s primary armed special intervention capacity is in the emergency response unit, ERU which forms part of the special detective unit. At the request of the Garda Commissioner earlier this year, the Government and I moved very decisively and quickly to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area. Funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated armed support unit, ASU, for the Dublin metropolitan area in order to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the ERU. The Dublin ASU will have a strength of 55, that is five sergeants and 50 gardaí. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the unit is in the process of being set up and trained as a matter of priority. Expressions of interest were sought and there were huge numbers of members of An Garda Síochána who expressed an interest in the unit, contrary to what was said at the time and I welcome that response. Additional equipment is also being acquired to equip the unit and to upgrade the equipment available to the ERU and the special detective unit. Pending the full establishment of the new unit the Garda Commissioner has put in place arrangements so that the necessary armed support is being provided on an overtime basis currently in the Dublin area.</p>
            <p eId="para_547"> I will now turn to funding. An additional allocation of €55 million is to be provided in 2016 including €5 million previously announced in February. This is funded from €40 million extra from the Exchequer plus €15 million from projected savings in the justice and equality sector. The armed response unit for Dublin is in the process of being set up. In the meantime other gardaí are carrying out the tasks that it will carry out on a long-term basis and I have provided the Deputy with the numbers that will be in that unit. Applications are being assessed, decisions are being made as to who will be in the unit and training will be provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_548">I recognise that resources are crucial in order to meet the challenge posed by organised crime. I welcome that the Tánaiste has been apprised by the Garda Commissioner that the unit will have 55 gardaí. It is not a matter for the Tánaiste or me to get involved in operational matters with regard to whether that number is sufficient or insufficient. However, I am slightly worried that the Tánaiste states that the unit is being set up and that gardaí will be trained. There is an urgency to this matter, as I know the Tánaiste will appreciate. In those circumstances, perhaps the Tánaiste will clarify when the unit will be set up, when the training will be complete and when the people of Dublin will know that this special organised crime unit is active and is there to defend them and, more importantly, that the serious criminals involved in gangland crime will know that this House and the State is serious about meeting the threat from organised crime.</p>

            <p eId="para_549">I assure the Deputy and the people of Dublin that armed support is actually in place, but not by the dedicated unit that will be the armed support unit. The function is currently performed on an overtime basis because it is essential, given the challenges we face, particularly in the north inner city of Dublin and surrounding area. Once the Government had agreed the funding the Garda Commissioner moved as quickly as possible to advertise the positions. There was a very large response that is taking some time to process. The Garda Commissioner informs me that she hopes the Dublin armed response unit will be in place later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> In the meantime the resources and people are there to provide the armed response that is needed. As the Deputy has acknowledged, the work is ongoing, crimes have been prevented, investigations are taking place and people are being prosecuted before the courts. I thank the Garda for the work being undertaken by gardaí in the most dangerous situations where there are those who are intent on that cycle of revenge and retaliation.</p>

            <p eId="para_551">On behalf of myself and Fianna Fáil, I acknowledge and thank An Garda Síochána for the excellent work the gardaí are doing. However, it is obviously the case that senior gardaí and commissioners can be reticent when it comes to stating publicly that they need further resources. Ultimately this is a battle that will be defeated if sufficient resources are provided to An Garda Síochána. I welcome the fact that an extra €50 million has been allocated but can the Tánaiste clarify if she will be seeking more resources in Budget 2017? This is a battle that needs to be continually met and our resources need to be continually added to in order to ensure this battle is won.</p>

It is important to continue the work of Operation Thor throughout the State so that the work of criminal gangs which are intent on burglaries can be interrupted and we can prevent those crimes. With regard to security, we must be increasingly conscious from a security perspective of the threats out there and the Garda have to put resources into that area. The resources that have been brought forward by the Government are intended to ensure that this work will be supported through to the end of the year. We will have further discussions regarding next year's budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_817">The numbers can deceive. There is a major problem in the rural parts of the county, as raised by another Deputy earlier. The same pertains in Kilkenny. The amount of burglary, trespass and other crime across north and south Kilkenny is significant. We have to find a different model to deliver a better policing service so that people can feel secure and safe. In Kilkenny city, where €300,000 worth of cocaine and other drugs were confiscated in the past week, the local gardaí are to be complimented on the intelligence they had, their work with the national headquarters and their determination to track down and prevent those drugs from getting onto the streets of the city and county of Kilkenny. I acknowledge that the Minister said earlier that requires constant regular reviewing, investment, updating of information technology systems and so on. I would like to see that happen in Kilkenny.</p>

            <p eId="para_818">I take the Deputy’s points about Kilkenny. It is worth reading the Thor figures for the whole country, including the Kilkenny areas. We have seen reductions. That builds on the experience we have had before. Where there are dedicated police operations, such as Thor, where there are mobile patrols, intelligence and police working closely with the other stakeholders and the community is involved, we can get reductions. We can beat this and have in many areas. There is more work to be done. This continues; the fight against crime does not stop. The Deputy is right that it involves using a variety of methods, modern technology and increased use of closed circuit television, CCTV, particularly at strategic locations throughout the country. We are examining that and I expect to make an announcement about it later this year. It is a question of making sure all the different elements come together and we need more gardaí too.</p>

            <p eId="para_819">On the investment front, I encourage the Minister to consider providing a new Garda station in Kilkenny, and to examine the network in the county. The population of Kilkenny city, like that of many urban centres, has increased and only recently a temporary extension was added to the station. There is a need to accommodate the modern technology and all that is necessary for the gardaí and law enforcement. That is lacking in the Garda station in Kilkenny city. Will the Minister consider that in particular and the possibility of ringfencing some funding for the extension of CCTV in urban centres? It is very successful but it takes up space within a Garda station. There is a need for the investment in the system and in the accommodation. The front-line gardaí are doing an excellent job. I would like to see continued review and investment and I particularly draw the Minister’s attention to the needs of the Garda station in the city.</p>

            <p eId="para_820">One of the things I did last year was to work with the Garda Síochána and the Office of Public Works so that we could identify the priority Garda stations around the country that needed investment and refurbishment. We have a very clear plan and timetable in place for that and a very detailed capital investment programme because there are many Garda stations throughout the country where the standards are not good enough, that need to be refurbished and extended. We need the property and the stores where evidence can be stored properly until it is needed for a court case. That capital programme was due for review next year. I hope it can be done early next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_821"> I will bear in mind what the Deputy says about Kilkenny because we will review the needs of different areas in respect of capital investment. People talk about closed Garda stations but it is important to recognise that there is a significant programme of capital investment in Garda stations. There are three new headquarters being built and there is a new headquarters in Sligo.</p>

            <p eId="para_823">Many Garda stations were closed by a previous Minister and the local garda has been taken out of our communities. The Minister knows one of the most valuable things we can have in a community is a local community-based garda who knows the people living in that community, who is a friend of that community and its different organisations. There is nothing that garda does not know about his local area. That has in many cases been taken away from us. Will the Minister address this in her new term? I congratulate her on her re-appointment and her elevation to Tánaiste.</p>

            <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_824">I am very aware of the damage done to rural communities by organised gangs engaged in burglary or other criminal activity. The Central Statistics Office official records show a 26.2% decrease in burglary in the last three months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_825"> It is important to acknowledge that where we invest and have targeted operations they can make a difference. The figures are available from around the country and they do vary. It is important to continue the investment. I take the Deputy's point about the engagement of An Garda Síochána with local communities. It is vital from an intelligence point of view and very often gives security to people. </p>
            <p eId="para_826"> Equally, however, we need gardaí who are mobile and have the right equipment and vehicles. We are also investing in that area. The Garda national model of community policing is a priority and continues to play a key part in responding to crime. As we recruit more gardaí and as we free up more gardaí from other duties which civilians take over, we can ensure that in most communities we will have more community gardaí. The Irish model of policing is built on the gardaí who are in contact around a given area being community police. We do not separate out the titles too much but I take the essential point the Deputy is making about the importance of community policing and developing the community policing model is in the strategy programme for the Garda this year. It is a priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_827">During the term of the last Government, I proved that it was costing more to keep a Garda station closed than open. That is in the Official Report, in black and white. That was a very stark thing to find out at the time when it was being shoved down our throats that it was a question of saving money and better policing.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">The statistics from which the Minister is operating are inaccurate and I will give her one clear example why that is the case. The amount of unreported crime going on in our country is amazing. I know of seven people who were victims of crime. I called them to tell them I was conducting a private survey. I wanted to know which of them had reported crimes to local Garda stations. Out of the seven, three had reported the crimes. The other four told me they would not bother. People had oil stolen from their diesel tanks and other such matters. They saw no reason to report such crimes.</p>

            <p eId="para_829">I am making every effort to ensure that the statistics being used are correct. One of the things I did on receiving the report from the Garda Inspectorate was to hold a meeting with the CSO and have detailed discussions about the reliability of the statistics coming from An Garda Síochána. Quite a lot of work has been done. It is important that people have confidence in the published statistics.</p>
            <p eId="para_830"> I encourage people to report crimes. It is important that gardaí are aware of any crimes committed in an area. Intelligence about one crime leads to the prevention or prosecution of other criminal activity. The Garda needs to have accurate figures about what precisely is happening in communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_831">I want to highlight the fact that we are grateful to the Garda which is up against it in the fight against crime. In Kerry, where I am from, mobile criminals are using our motorway network to drive from large centres of population to places in Kerry, at night or by day. They are very organised and local gardaí are making a great effort with the resources they have. I want to acknowledge publicly local gardaí, such as sergeants, superintendents, inspectors and all of those who work in the force. Unfortunately, gardaí have been seriously injured or have died in the line of duty, something this House needs to acknowledge. My final plea is to ask the Minister to ensure gardaí are adequately resourced to fight not just urban but rural crime. It is a slogan that was not used a number of years ago.</p>

            <p eId="para_832">I would like to highlight a number of initiatives that have taken place regarding particular categories of crime that affect rural communities. They include the continuing work of the Garda metal theft forum, which brings key stakeholders together, including farming representatives, to address all forms of metal theft in rural and urban areas and the theft stop partnership with the IFA and Crimestoppers which aims to combat the theft of farm machinery.</p>
            <p eId="para_833"> An IFA-Crimestoppers initiative provides a reward fund of €10,000 to encourage reports about livestock theft and an awareness campaign to address the theft of electrical cables was launched through Crimestoppers, in partnership with An Garda Síochána and ESB networks. I met some of the rural representative organisations to discuss any other initiatives we can take in regard to rural crime. I am determined to give whatever support I can to rural communities that have been at the receiving end of crimes such as these.</p>

            <p eId="para_835"> Library services are the responsibility of local authorities. Several areas are being brought together and placed under single management structures. The proposal is that Cavan and Monaghan, Laois and Offaly, Longford and Westmeath, Carlow and Kilkenny and Cork city and county, which is my area, be amalgamated. Incredibly, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal will be lumped together under the responsibility of one authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_836"> Does this herald the end of local decision-making for library services? The evidence would seem to point in that direction. There are any number of things wrong with this proposal. It means that decision-making will be remote. Will a local authority which is used to making decisions for rural areas make them for urban ones or <i>vice versa</i>? From what I can see, no cost-benefit analysis of this hare-brained scheme was done. The suspicion is that it will be a cover for cuts. It is a very undemocratic decision and goes against the views of local councillors and library staff. I understand the committee that planned the change did not visit the areas concerned. It certainly did not visit Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_837"> It is a Topical Issue today because IMPACT members who work in the library services in the areas to which I referred are engaged in a ballot which will close on 1 July. The result will be known on 4 July. I congratulate library workers for taking a stand in defence of public services and library services in their areas. What is the current plan?</p>
            <p eId="para_838">First, let us scrap those hare-brained proposals and, second, let us expand the library service and reinvest in it. Let us make up for the lost decade and all the cuts implemented on the library services by the previous Fine Gael-led Government and the Fianna Fáil-led Government prior to that.</p>
            <p eId="para_839"> Last, but by no means least, we should recruit staff to the library services. For the past ten years those who have left have not been replaced, which places an extra burden of work on the remaining staff. I spoke to a librarian in the Cork city area for approximately half an hour. He doubts there is anyone in the city's library services under the age of 34 at the moment. There are many young people who would be very good at the job so let us expand the service, recruit staff and ditch this mad scheme the Minister of State is trying to implement at the moment.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_840">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and giving me an opportunity to bring some clarity to it. Yesterday, I spoke at an event in Tullamore library. I was delighted to be present for the launch of two very important initiatives involving longer opening hours and ease of access when no staff are present. The intention is that people can access the library by means of a pincode and card, which makes it available 365 days a year for much longer hours, at weekends and on Christmas Day. Libraries are adapting and changing the way they do their business and all the staff in the libraries are to be commended on all the great work they are doing in coming up with new ideas and dealing with challenges. In recent years libraries have been restored to playing a central part of the community and they are doing a great job.</p>
            <p eId="para_841"> The Government is committed to driving on the process and progressing with the changes in the services offered to the public and to make library buildings more accessible to the public in terms of longer hours and the facilitation of community events. As Deputies, we attend many such events and the focal point provided by libraries is evident to us. We wish to enhance that and build on it rather than trying to reduce services on the ground. It is not correct to say that the rationale behind the shared service model will threaten the service, as that is not the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_842"> I understand there has been concern among some IMPACT members regarding proposed changes to public library structures. Under Opportunities for All, the national public library strategy 2013 to 2017, a review of the existing organisational structures was recommended in order to establish stronger, more effective and efficient public libraries. Following on from that, a working group was established to examine the potential for shared services in the public library service. The working group determined that the current structures in terms of organisation, workforce and service delivery were in need of reform in order for the public library service to be in a position to maximise service delivery opportunities and achieve best outcomes in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and customer service, which is what I witnessed yesterday when I visited the library in Tullamore.</p>
            <p eId="para_843"> The key challenge in the current structure is the need for the creation of scale for existing library authorities. In order to achieve that, the working group determined that a new shared services structure for library authorities should be established, with a minimum population target of 100,000 as an appropriate basis for determining a libraries' shared services structure. The working group's recommendations were set out in the report, Managing the Delivery of Effective Library Services. The local authorities identified for shared services are County Cavan and County Monaghan; County Laois and County Offaly; County Longford and County Westmeath; County Carlow and County Kilkenny; and County Sligo, County Roscommon and County Leitrim. It is also recommended that Cork city and County Cork, which are currently the only affiliated city and county services operating individually, should be operated as a shared service. It would appear to be common sense that such a change would happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_844"> There will be no closures of any libraries under the initiative but rather an enhancement of the services available in the smaller local authorities. I made the point yesterday that it is very often the case that the library is the key building in smaller towns and villages and the key focal point for the community. We wish to protect and enhance the position of libraries and safeguard them for the future. The intention is to ensure that no matter where one lives, one will be able to avail of the extensive services the libraries now offer. Earlier this year, my Department announced a €22 million capital investment programme which underpins my and the Government's commitment to the library service in Ireland. The proposed model seeks to put in place planning and implementation arrangements that will deliver more effective and efficient public libraries with a view to securing the delivery of an enhanced quality and range of services. That will ensure the long-term sustainability of the library service in those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_845"> Libraries are evolving and becoming the centre for community engagement. The library service now plays a very important role in community life. In addition to what many still perceive to be the traditional preserve of the library, namely, book lending, the local library now offers so much more. It provides educational supports, community meeting facilities, business support, study spaces, and cultural and research supports, among other areas. It provides a space and a range of services that communities might not otherwise be able to access. My Department, through the new initiatives, wants to build on that and to enhance the services that already exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_846"> Under the proposed model, the city or county librarian would lead a central management team under the shared library management model with the establishment of a single library headquarters. The new enhanced management structure would provide a more efficient allocation of functions across senior management and enable strategic planning and a better focus on an increased range of services to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_847"> In recent months my Department has been engaging with the respective local authorities to explore the implementation of the shared library management model. We are open to working with the local authorities concerned and if an alternative approach that yields the same result is suggested, we will consider it and work with the parties involved to achieve the best possible outcome for all.</p>

            <p eId="para_848">Sometimes I come into this place and I wonder whether the English language has any real meaning at all in here. I listened carefully to the Minister of State's reply. He said he understands there are some concerns. The Minister of State is not talking about library workers going on their tea break and saying, on balance, they think there might be some issues with his proposals. Hundreds of workers in the library services he is in charge of are balloting for industrial action due to the proposals. For the Minister of State to say he realises there is some concern is putting the situation rather mildly.</p>
            <p eId="para_849"> The Minister of State said the libraries are adapting to change and taking on new challenges. That is more Government-speak. If I left this place and someone were to come up to me and give me a kick in the thigh while wearing a pair of studded football boots, I would have to adapt to change and start taking on new challenges. It is not necessarily a positive thing that libraries must adapt to change when the change amounts to making the decision-making structures within the libraries far more remote and less responsive to local and community needs than was the case previously. My supplementary question is whether the Minister of State is prepared to stop this crazy plan and to recognise that given the economic recovery it is time to invest in a serious way in the public library service, in particular to start recruiting young people to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_850">I will reiterate what I said in case it is not clear enough for Deputy Barry. When I said I understand, it means I understand and am aware of the concerns of the staff involved, just as Deputy Barry does. I do not say I agree with all the concerns. I reiterate that the shared library management model is not about an amalgamation of the library service; rather it is an enhancement of the senior management structure across the designated local authorities and the library authorities. The thinking behind the model is to increase the capacity of smaller local authorities to deliver library services on a comparative basis to those in larger authorities. I accept that Deputy Barry represents parts of Cork but I represent rural areas as well as urban areas and I am always being told that people can get more in urban library services and why can people not get the same service in rural areas. Local communities want their libraries to continually expand, adapt to new realities and to provide more and better services. Such services involve providing access for students to go to libraries at weekends to do research or study because they can get WiFi there and they cannot get it down the road. That is what I mean when I refer to adapting the service. Libraries are doing that very well and I compliment all the staff on doing that. Deputy Barry should not try to mix my words when I am complimenting the work library staff are doing in delivering a local service. That is what we are trying to do - put libraries in a better position to be able to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_851"> The thinking behind the model is to enhance the opportunities for access and to give a better service as well. The library service will remain the sole responsibility of the respective authority, as will the financing of those services, and each library service will be branded as it is currently. Notwithstanding that, I am aware of the concerns of IMPACT members on the proposed approach. That is the reason we are engaging with the respective authorities to explore alternative approaches that might yield the same result. We are open to other options. If Deputy Barry can make suggestions that will give the same result, we are prepared to look at them, which is a strong staffing structure with the capacity to deliver a high-quality service across the library service. That is what we are doing, and when I engage with people who work in the library service that is what they want to be part of as well. They are proud of what they do because they realise that the number of people using library services is increasing by the week and by the year. We are trying to build on that. I cannot stress sufficiently the importance of the local library. It is one of the most important assets we have in communities.</p>

          <speech by="#DavidCullinane" eId="spk_183">
            <from>Deputy David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_852">I raised this issue in response to the Central Statistics Office quarterly household survey figures on unemployment, which show the unemployment rate in the south east is at 12.5%, compared with a rate of 8.4% nationally. The Minister may be aware that in 2013, as a Senator and a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I was a rapporteur for a report called the South East Economic Development Strategy. I worked with the Minister of State, Deputy English, who has just left the Chamber and who was the Chairman of the joint committee at the time. It was an all-party report that made a number of key recommendations that must be acted upon if the south-east region is to be given the tools and ability to create the jobs it can create.</p>
            <p eId="para_853"> However, I also wish to draw the Minister's attention to a report published in June 2016 by a number of academics in Waterford Institute of Technology called the South East Economic Monitor. It states the south east has experienced improved consumer and business sentiment, which the authors welcome, but goes on to state that "when compared to national economic performance, and peer regions in Ireland, the data illustrates how the South East’s economy continues to be characterised by persistently high levels of unemployment, deprivation and ... lower job quality". It then refers to two datapoints which explain why this might be the case, namely, low educational attainment and low higher education capacity within the region, as well as the lack of new IDA-supported jobs over the past 25 years of a kind that have built greater capacity in other regions. This may be one reason they are performing better at present. The report continues by stating that in Waterford and the south east, the recession really kicked in in 2002 and was exacerbated by the national recession, which hit in 2007. The key figures in that report are similar to the type of issues I encountered when I did my work in 2012, during which time I engaged in many meetings right across the south-east region with stakeholders. These issues include 14 years of stagnation, 7,260 missing higher education places, 6,312 missing IDA-supported jobs in the south east, had it been given the same level of input from the IDA as were other regions, as well as low-quality jobs that are replacing high-quality jobs which were lost. All these pointers demonstrate real structural problems in the economy of the south east. Consequently, a number of measures are necessary, the first of which is the enterprise agencies tasked with creating jobs across the State must take a more regional approach. This does not appear to be the case in the south east. While there have been some improvements in recent years, a great deal more work must be done. Consequently, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland must step up to the plate for the south east. Figures and facts do not lie and the region simply is not getting enough of those jobs to support real economic improvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_854"> A joined-up strategy also is required and I had a meeting recently with the president of Waterford Institute of Technology, who spoke of the lack of a joined-up approach between the Government's regional job strategy and the institute's capital investment needs, such as the need for an engineering block and increased capacity in the laboratories to make sure it can meet the needs in this respect. As the Minister is aware, the university is a critical issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_855"> Finally, I received an answer to a parliamentary question to the Minister, Deputy Ross, in respect of the airport. One promise made as part of the programme for Government was an extension to the runway at the airport, which has been sold by a number of local Deputies who state they had it included in the aforementioned programme. However, in response to the parliamentary question, the Minister stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_856">Development projects at the airports which are designed to expand capacity are a commercial matter for the airports themselves. In the case of the proposed runway extension at Waterford, I understand that the airport authorities are pursuing local interests for funding in relation to that project.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">On reading that response, it does not seem to me as though millions of euro are being made available to Waterford Airport. The Minister might be able to respond to some of those issues, if possible, but the general issue is the high levels of unemployment.</p>

            <p eId="para_858">I thank the Deputy and acknowledge he has raised this matter with me a number of times. It also has been raised on the floor of this House. I am aware the economic crisis hit job numbers in the south east badly, with the loss of 37,800 jobs between 2007 and 2012. However, through the focused collaborative approach and a range of reforms delivered in the region in recent years, the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 20.1% in 2012 to approximately 12.5% in early 2016. Although it has fallen and is down at 12.6%, I am aware it remains above the national average and the Government must work on that. At present, 204,400 people are at work in the south-east region, which is an increase of 23,100 over the period from 2012 to 2016. Over the past three years, employment growth in the region has increased at a faster pace than the national rate of increase. While the current unemployment rate in the south east still is too high, these figures demonstrate the overall trend is one of steady recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_859"> I will work relentlessly with the various agencies and stakeholders in the region to ensure this trend continues and that jobs continue to be created. The regional action plans for jobs initiative for the south east and the other seven regions is a concrete example of the targeted approach the Government is undertaking boost regional employment. The core objective of the plan is to have a further 25,000 people at work in the south-east region by 2020. The plan is being monitored and driven by an implementation committee comprising representatives from the enterprise sector, the local authority, the enterprise agencies and other public bodies in the region. The south-east regional plan contains several key actions that will be delivered over the period from 2015 to 2017. These include completing the construction of the new technology and industrial buildings in Waterford and Carlow, establishing the new regional skills forum, developing the world-leading sectoral clusters and ecosystems and continuing the development of the technological university in the south east. I intend to visit the region to meet stakeholders and the Deputy, please God, to ensure plans are being implemented in the region. I expect the first progress report of the south-east plan to be published in the third quarter of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_860"> The implementation of the regional plans is being supported by a fund of €250 million to be provided to Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. On 1 June, I announced an initial allocation of €5 million in competitive funding for 48 local and regional initiatives under two competitive calls, the first being the local enterprise office, LEO, competitive fund and the second being the community enterprise initiative. In the south-east region, six projects involving LEOs were successful under the LEO competitive fund and a further four projects were successful under the community enterprise initiative. On a national level, I remain committed to growing employment through the 2016 national Action Plan for Jobs process now and in its fifth iteration. I will continue to work with the enterprise agencies to ensure targeted actions are taken to improve the employment and enterprise environment in the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_861">I welcome the Minister's response and her intention to visit the south-east region. I, of course, will take up the opportunity to meet her when she visits and I hope she will have good meetings with stakeholders across the region. I also wish to take the opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of her predecessor, Deputy Bruton, who, to be fair, shone a spotlight on the south-east region and chaired an action group that has made some difference. I acknowledge this and am not being negative in respect of the Government's approach. However, the Minister's response acknowledges we have real structural problems in the region that must be addressed. While the unemployment figures have fallen marginally ahead of the national figures, they are pretty much in line with where the national decline was and consequently, there still is a massive 4% gap between the national figure and the regional figure. The gap is huge and cannot be underestimated for real people who are out of work and for whom jobs are not there. There is an unemployment rate of less than 7% in Dublin but yet the equivalent rate in the south east is 12.5%. Moreover, it is much higher in some parts of my constituency of Waterford where there are unemployment black spots even within a region that is suffering. Consequently, I appeal to the Minister to engage with the enterprise agencies first and foremost and to work collaboratively with other Ministers. She should work with the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure the region gets the university it needs and with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on the transport issue to deal with funding for the airport and on other measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">If the Minister gets the opportunity at some point to read the south east economic development strategy, she will see many of the recommendations made which are practical, realistic, sensible, deliverable and will make a difference as they have not yet been implemented. They could form part of a revised jobs action plan for the region.</p>

I know that the Cork IDA Ireland office was managing the south east. She has assured me that the south east is definitely on IDA Ireland's radar. Waterford is being actively marketed to FDIs. I think it was about two weeks ago that I was reading the report by Dr. Ray Griffin and Dr. Cormac O'Keeffe. It was about the specific issues in Waterford.

            <p eId="para_866"> If the Deputy does not mind, I wish to mention exactly what is happening on the implementation group that is there. The implementation group is made up of people from the local authorities, an industrial ambassador, Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise offices, interested stakeholders and IDA Ireland. They are all at the table. If the Deputy is aware of empty office space, he should feed that information into that implementation group. The more information that we have on the ground from the stakeholders in the area, the better and the easier it is.</p>

            <p eId="para_868">I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, success in her new role. I look forward to working with her over the coming years in what is a very difficult area and a challenge for all of us. Today, I wish to specifically mention a very serious situation we have in University Hospital Kerry whereby we do not have an acute stroke unit. There have been great strides and progress made in many hospitals around the country. At present, 29 hospitals are serving stroke patients and 21 of those have an acute stroke unit. Unfortunately, University Hospital Kerry does not have one.</p>
            <p eId="para_869"> I wish to bring the Minister of State's attention to a report produced by the national stroke programme on the stroke services in University Hospital Kerry. The critical findings show that University Hospital Kerry does not provide an organised service for stroke or minimum mini-stroke patients. It does not have a dedicated stroke unit and it does not have a clinical lead for stroke treatment. It does not have a clinical nurse specialist in stroke treatment. It does not add to the national stroke register and it does not have access to early support discharge. Those findings are startling. It also states that these deficits would not only impact on death and disability, but would also impact on stroke standards, for example, early swallow screening, ongoing staff training, and patient and family education and support. The report adds that mortality for ischemic strokes - those essentially involved in the blockage of arteries supplying blood to the brain - are the cause of the majority of strokes and are 40% higher than that of the national average. It concludes that University Hospital Kerry is not providing an organised stroke service for its population. While national stroke services have improved significantly since the stroke audit in 2008, this is not reflected in University Hospital Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_870"> I have spoken to the doctors in Kerry hospital. Since the departure of a dedicated stroke specialist three years ago, that position has not been filled. There is still no filling of the clinical nurse specialist position. There was a post which was transferred to rheumatology due to financial constraint. That needs to be brought back. There is a lot of work that needs to be done immediately. There is a system failure here. The Irish Heart Foundation, which does fantastic work in this area, has flagged Kerry hospital as being one that it is extremely concerned about. My concern is greater than the lack of the acute stroke unit alone. Kerry hospital is supposed to provide this and if it does not, patients will start going to Limerick and Cork and there is the threat that the status of Kerry hospital will be challenged. There are wide-ranging implications around this issue and there needs to be immediate action. People's lives are at stake.</p>

            <p eId="para_871">I thank the Deputy for providing me with the opportunity to speak on the subject of strokes. I am replying to this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and I am sorry that he cannot be here.</p>
            <p eId="para_872"> The aim of the HSE national clinical programme for stroke is to improve the quality, access and cost-effectiveness of stroke services in Ireland. Since the commencement of this programme, nine new stroke units have opened, bringing the total number of stroke units to 21. This represents good progress from the single unit that was available in 2008. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the national stroke audit which was published last year and pointed to encouraging improvement in many areas of stroke care. Specifically, the audit identified that inpatient mortality has reduced and discharges directed to nursing homes have reduced, and this has been matched with an increase in patients who are discharged directly home after a stroke.</p>
            <p eId="para_873"> The second national stroke audit emphasises the role of a stroke unit in a hospital. It reported that the provision of care in a stroke unit is supported by the evidence, reducing morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is suggested that all sites managing acute patients should provide stroke unit care and all sites should develop their stroke units to provide the highest possible quality of care, including ensuring units are appropriately staffed, equipped and provide ongoing education and training for staff, patients and carers alike.</p>
            <p eId="para_874"> I am advised by the HSE that 24-7 access to safe stroke thrombolysis is available nationally. It is also worth noting that our current thrombolysis rate of 11.6% exceeds the national target of 9% and is among the best in national rates worldwide. I appreciate the Deputy's particular interest in University Hospital Kerry and the absence of a dedicated stroke unit at that hospital. I am advised by the hospital that recruitment and retention of the required staff is proving to be challenging. However, I understand that the business cases have been prepared for additional support staff, such that a stroke unit may be established.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">These business cases will be considered by the South/South West Hospitals Group in the first instance and then by the HSE acute hospital division.</p>
            <p eId="para_876"> I am also advised that the case for a further geriatrician for the hospital has been referred to the consultant applications advisory committee for consideration. While there is no dedicated stroke unit at the hospital, I have been assured procedures are in place such that stroke patients can continue to receive treatment within hospital. Solutions are being sought across the hospital group to address the current situation. In that regard, the clinical needs of a patient will always be the determining factor, so patients will be transferred to tertiary hospitals if the need arises.</p>
            <p eId="para_877"> I accept that the Deputy will be disappointed that I cannot be more definite about the timescale for the establishment of a stroke unit at the hospital. However, the roll-out of stroke units is a work in progress and I thank him for drawing the particular need in Kerry to my attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_878">To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I am aware of the difficulties; we all are. The problem is that the situation is ongoing for three years. Somebody must take responsibility to get this unit established. The Minister said that thrombolysis is available nationally at a rate of 11.6% and exceeds the national target. In Kerry it is at 4%, as opposed to the national average of 11.6%. These figures are frightening. What is required is the establishment of the unit and the recruitment of the staff. There should be active participation by the Department and the HSE to recruit the necessary staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_879"> The last acute stroke clinical lead, Dr. McManus, resigned a number of years ago. Since then, in anticipation of the appointment of a replacement, the development of the acute unit has basically been in abeyance. That is no longer acceptable. Kerry General Hospital provides this service but does not have the facilities or staff to do it properly, so people are in danger. It is endangering their lives. It is a statistical fact that when proper stroke treatment is provided, the incidence of death and disability is reduced by 7%. That is a real figure and people are suffering due to the lack of a service that is provided in a majority of hospitals but not in one as significant as Kerry General Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_880"> I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister, Deputy Harris, the serious nature of this problem. We need action, not words. The unit must be set up and the staff and consultants must be put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_881">I certainly will convey the Deputy's concerns. The figure of 4% for strokes in Kerry General Hospital is a huge concern. I emphasise again that the Minister has made it clear that the HSE is trying its best to recruit staff but it has been challenging. It is in the process of ensuring there will be a unit in place as soon as possible. I will convey the Deputy's comments to the Minister. I will also mention the report he referred to, although I did not catch its name. Perhaps he would give me the name of it.</p>

            <p eId="para_884">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue. I am delighted the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is present. I congratulate her on her appointment as Minister and I look forward to working constructively with her throughout her period of office.</p>
            <p eId="para_885"> As of 31 March 2016, there were 6,405 children in care. Of these, 93% were in foster care, with 4,162 in general foster care and 1,790 in foster care with relatives. The majority of children in care are in foster care family settings in the community. I pay tribute to all the foster parents in Ireland who do, and have done, so much over the years. I raise this matter following the public outcry over a situation where a nine year old boy was taken from the care of his grandparents due to concerns Tusla had regarding their age. Both of them are in their mid-sixties. I am 58 and I have a child aged 14 years. There are many people like me; it is not unusual. It is a strange ruling from that point of view. Incidentally, my wife, the child's mother, is the same age.</p>
            <p eId="para_886"> While I realise the Minister cannot comment on individual cases, she should know that many people were stunned and appalled to realise that the rule regarding a 40 year age gap was in existence and could be applied in that way. My office has been inundated with calls, e-mails and post on this matter since then. It has terrified grandparents and foster carers throughout the State. It is ageist and discriminatory and must be removed as a rule in fostering arrangements. Recently, I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister asking her in what circumstances she could instruct or engage Tusla, Child and Family Agency, to alter its policy on a given issue under its remit. The Minister's reply included the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_887">Under the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013 there are powers conferred on me as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, which allow for additional written policy direction and/or guidelines to be given to the Agency. This is covered by section 47 and Section 48 of the Act. My Department works very closely with Tusla and closely monitors ... The need for any additional policy guidance is kept under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_888"> I ask the Minister, on behalf of all the foster parents and, indeed, grandparents who commit themselves daily to the love and care of their grandchildren or other relatives, to use her power to instruct Tusla to abandon this cruel regulation if it exists in that type of terminology. It is ageist and very damaging. Grandparents have always been hugely involved, especially since the recession, in rearing children, as we see every day. Indeed, I have grandchildren and love bringing them to school, collecting them and bringing them to sports. There is an old saying that it takes a parish to raise a child. It certainly involves extended families and people are fortunate to have grandparents who are retired. It keeps the grandparents young and active as well. There is a huge, loving bond there. It was very damaging in the case concerned to have used that criterion. It sent shock waves throughout the community that it could be a reason. It should not be there. Grandparents play a huge role in forming the child and, indeed, in maintaining family decorum and rearing children daily throughout the State.</p>

          <speech by="#KatherineZappone" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs" eId="spk_196">
            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Katherine Zappone)<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_889">I thank the Deputy. It is great that he raised this question and I welcome the opportunity to clarify the 40 year gap guideline on the public record, so we can clarify matters in the minds of the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_890"> The age of a foster carer or relative foster carer is never the sole reason for deciding on the suitability of a placement for a child in State care. The 40 year age difference between a foster carer and foster child is a guideline, not a policy or rule, and does not determine a decision regarding suitability. The guidance for foster care committees outlines a range of areas to be taken into account by social workers when carrying out assessments of prospective carers to meet the immediate and long-term needs of a child in care. The social worker's focus is on the rights of the child to be placed in the best possible placement for them. The guidelines take into account research which supports stable and suitable placements for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">For example, where possible and in their interests, the guidelines suggest that children are placed with relatives and foster carers from the same ethnic or cultural background and that foster carers are in good physical and mental health. It is also recommended that placements are made with carers who are open to ongoing engagement with social workers and the child's family. That is the first really important point I want to make.</p>
            <p eId="para_892"> I have raised this matter with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and can confirm that there is currently a review of the overall criteria used by foster care committees in decision making. The review is taking into account the differing needs of children coming into care and ensuring it supports the best placements being made available to children who need them.</p>
            <p eId="para_893"> I completely agree that older foster carers and relative foster carers, who may be grandparents, uncles and aunts, all play an important role in our care system. It is really important for me to say that. As well as caregivers, they can be mentors, historians and vital links between the child in care and their wider family and friends. It is evident that grandparents and other relatives play a vital role in the lives of many children in care. Tusla has reported that 28% of carers are relative carers. There are numerous cases of children in care placed with their grandparents.</p>
            <p eId="para_894"> This is not simply a desk exercise, as some commentators have said. The assessment of foster carers, including relative carers, involves a lengthy period of interviews and home visits, including checking references and Garda vetting. In light of all these factors, the age of the carer alone is clearly not a determining issue but it would be a clear oversight on the part of social workers if this was not considered in context. I do not consider it necessary to direct Tusla on this operational guidance.</p>
            <p eId="para_895"> It is obvious that every decision made by the foster care committee will not be welcomed by all. It is regrettable that there can be hurt. I am not necessarily referring to age issues here. At all times, the focus is and must be on the long-term benefit for the child. It can be a very difficult decision to make. This can seem to some to be a very high standard to expect of a foster carer. It is and it should be. Most children in care have been there for more than one year and over one third will have been in care for more than five years. By and large, there is good placement stability and for some time now, over 90% of children in care are in a family foster placement in the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_896"> A professional judgement must be made. Most children in care are there following a court order under the Child Care Act 1991. Each case must be treated on its merits. The professional assessment can be tested in the courts when making an application for a care order. In light of these considerations, I cannot in good conscience direct Tusla to omit or ignore anything needed to inform the long-term care of the child.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_197">
            <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_897">Like the Minister, I and everybody else want the best care outcomes for all children, particularly those in foster care. I am not asking the Minister to direct or interfere in an intrusive manner but I ask for a degree of common sense, reflection and understanding of the greater role of grandparents. We all feel it because we are going the one way in age and ageism is such an issue. The Minister acknowledged the role grandparents play and I know Tusla acknowledges it as well but if there are other issues, it is very important that it is not left hanging out there and that age is the issue. This is where guidelines and better interaction and engagement with grandparents and foster parents on the part of social workers and Tusla officials to bring about better understanding come in. If there is no clarity or immediate understanding that there are other reasons, they obviously feel it is done on age grounds. If the children are then removed in some cases to the care of other foster families who are similar in age, it makes it more confusing. I am not here to knock Tusla but to say that I have received calls from all over the country. There needs to be some kind of robust appeals system, better engagement with people, explanation and understanding of the foster carer role. I would not for one minute condone any criticism of foster care. Like anyone, we understand how serious it is but we need more latitude and greater empathy with foster carers, particularly if they are grandparents because of the bond and family connections. As the Minister said, they pass on their heritage and ethnic status. There is no better place to do it than in the extended family, be they grandparents or great aunts or uncles.</p>

            <p eId="para_898">I again thank the Deputy and very much take on board his points. It is correct that he raised this issue because he is responding not just to his constituents but to grandparents' calls from throughout the country. I am glad that he did and that I have the opportunity to tell him on the public record that it is not the case that all grandparents are not good enough to have children placed in their care. Clearly, that is not the case. Many grandparents do this and both the State and I am grateful for their generosity, as are their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_899"> I also take the Deputy's point about better communication on this issue. Perhaps the Department and Tusla are already learning that so it is helpful to hear the Deputy's comments in that regard. Tusla is proactive on this issue. The criteria and guidelines are already being reviewed and Tusla will pay attention to the Deputy's comments here. In addition to what I have put on the record, it is important to say that the age guideline can be disregarded if it is in the professional judgment of the social worker making the assessment that it is not in the best interests of the child. It is there as part of a wide range of criteria and guidelines. At the same time, it is a good question to put to Tusla in the context of its review. It is reviewing matters and is hearing that we are asking whether it is necessarily ageist or discriminatory to have a 40 year age rule given that it is in the context of a number of other guidelines and is considered along with others. I do not think so but it is still something Tusla should consider and no doubt it will do so in light of the Deputy raising the issue here and my response.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_927">- the restoration of the arts as a distinct and clearly defined Cabinet portfolio providing leadership and State support to the sector.”</p>
          <p eId="para_928">I am sure the Minister has read the motion at this stage so I will not go through all the details of it. It is a very thorough and extensive motion. I welcome all those in the Public Gallery who have come here today and I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_929"> Fianna Fáil has tabled this motion as testament to our commitment to ensuring that arts and culture remain at the heart of Irish life and that their contribution to a well-rounded society is fully recognised and realised. This motion also comes in the wake of the Government's effective downgrading of the arts as a Cabinet portfolio. There was widespread anger at this move and we believe in the restoration of arts and heritage as a portfolio in its own right. I was honoured to be appointed as the party's Front Bench arts spokesperson by Deputy Micheál Martin. This decision underlines Fianna Fáil's commitment to the arts and heritage and I was extremely pleased by the appointment. It is an area I am very passionate about and have been actively involved in for much of my life since school, having studied in NCAD, worked as an independent curator and through my previous job as an arts education officer for Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> In the weeks since my appointment, I have had many meetings with people in the arts community to discuss their concerns, priorities and hopes for the future. This motion is being put forward on foot of that engagement. Our motion also highlights the anger, disquiet and disbelief about the effective dilution of the arts as a Cabinet portfolio. What was formerly the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has been expanded to include regional development and rural affairs and now also has responsibility for the roll out of rural broadband and, it would seem, the development of the post office network.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> Fianna Fáil understands and believes in the need for a dedicated Government Department for regional development and rural affairs. After all, we set one up in 2002. However, we are extremely concerned that these crucial issues have been added to an already extensive portfolio and we share the fears that the arts element of the Department may be left behind. Arts was a big fish in a small pond but now the pond is bigger and the concern at that change is legitimate and justified. We urge the Government to reconsider its departmental configurations to ensure that the arts sector is a priority during this term of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> A vibrant arts and cultural scene is at the heart of a good life and a strong and vibrant community. Despite being a small country, our strong tradition of literature, music, theatre, festival and dance has placed us on the global stage, copper-fastening Ireland's influence on the arts across the world. It is, therefore, essential that the arts community here at home is given the support and the recognition that it needs. The Minister feels the concerns are not justified and that there will be no change. Many want change and feel that neither this Government nor the administration in office from 2011 to 2016 had sufficient regard for the arts. If the portfolio is diluted, it is the arts that must lose out in terms of ministerial priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_933"> Since 1993, when Michael D. Higgins became the first Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht at Cabinet, it has had a lead role in Cabinet. After almost a quarter of a century, this has now changed. This may not be the Minister's decision but it is a bad one. It is particularly unfortunate that this should happen during the centenary of 1916. As the National Campaign for the Arts pointed out:</p>
          <p eId="para_934">The leaders of 1916 were poets and artists. They understood the importance of the Arts in national life. It is an irony that seems completely lost on this government that they have chosen the Centenary of the Rising to push the Arts further into a comer ... The Arts need a strong voice at the cabinet table.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">This year, as in so many other years, the arts have again made Irish people proud. It is time now for the Government to reciprocate and do the arts proud. The Government is not opposing our motion today but I hope it will go beyond that and act on the motion if it is passed by the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> In tabling this motion on the arts, I am more anxious to celebrate the arts in our country than to denigrate the Government or Minister with whom I share a constituency. Arts policy should be centred on three principles: protecting the independence of the arts community; ensuring a stable, sustainable and secure funding model for the arts; and enabling full community engagement and benefit from State arts funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> It is my hope that this motion can serve to maximise a political consensus behind the arts. Nowhere is that more important than Culture 2025. I recently called for the forthcoming Culture 2025 strategy to be considered, discussed and voted on by the Dáil before its formal adoption as the official policy of the State. Our motion today incorporates this call. We believe this is a crucial strategy, which will underpin the role of culture in our society and set out the direction of State policy for the next decade. Given the significance of this strategy, it is essential it is supported across the board. The Minister should publish the draft programme so it can be discussed with invited stakeholders in committee in the Oireachtas. Then, if necessary, it can be revised and enhanced by all parties. I want to see a strategy which has definitive targets allied with a real funding allocation. I acknowledge that it may not be possible to get the backing of the Oireachtas but we should strive to get the maximum level of cross party support. This policy should not be the exclusive property of the Government or the Department - it belongs to all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> While at this stage we do not propose setting a benchmark for arts investment related to national income, in our election manifesto we pledged year-on-year increases in funding for the arts and we remain committed to that. We certainly accept that funding is too low at this point. The response of the Arts Council to its original budget 2016 allocation was stark and unqualified. The Arts Council chair spoke of it with great disappointment and said it was "a devastating blow to artists and arts organisations already struggling to survive and present work of the highest quality to people across Ireland". She went on to say:</p>
          <p eId="para_939">The Government continues to assert that Ireland is a hub of creativity, innovation and flexible thinking, and a smart place to invest in. Credible investment in the arts and culture sector is a vital demonstration of this commitment. I feel that the announcement of our funding today undermines that commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">A subsequent additional allocation of €1 million was made in December 2015 but it is clear that the arts and the Arts Council remain underfunded. Arts Council funding is still €25 million less than what was allocated in 2008. Fianna Fáil believes that rapid progress should be made in successive budgets to increase our allocation to the arts. Increasing funding does not mean we would seek greater control. For more than 50 years, the Arts Council has been tasked with generating cultural policy. It has commissioned expert reports and made recommendations in the areas of education, local government, arts participation and audience development. I reiterate the commitment of my party to the arm's length principle which promotes the Arts Council's autonomy in disbursing State funding to artists and arts organisations. This principle allows the Arts Council and its expert arts personnel to assess grant applications and make independent, informed decisions according to agreed and clear criteria. </p>
          <p eId="para_941"> Given the Government's increasing tendency to centralise funding within the Department of the Arts, this arm's length principle is more important than ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">This leads me to Culture Ireland, which was set up in 2005 with the remit to promote Irish arts and culture internationally. Culture Ireland has ensured the continual presence of Ireland abroad. Prior to 2005, Ireland was the only country in the EU not to have a dedicated body promoting its cultural profile internationally and despite subsequent funding cuts to Culture Ireland, it attempted to keep non-commercial Irish art and culture visible on the international stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> My party opposed the previous Government's decision in 2012 to merge its functions into the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. This decision was made as part of the Government's reform plan under the guise of streamlining State bodies. We saw this move as one of several steps taken that have undermined the autonomy and independence of arts promotion and provision outside the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. We favour the reinstatement of a structure which would allow Culture Ireland to work closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland while maintaining its integrity as a body with artistic expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_944"> Expertise in any area benefits from early intervention. One of my main priorities is to enhance arts provision in the education system. In 2008, the Arts Council published a report by the Special Committee on the Arts and Education which began, "Arts provision for children and young people both in and out of school is arguably the single greatest fault line in our cultural provision". With more than 800,000 citizens of school-going age in Ireland, this must be a headline arts priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> Having been involved in the implementation of the Arts in Education Charter in setting up the local arts in education partnership in schools in Cavan and Monaghan, this is an objective I am particularly keen to progress. It is essential that we work with both the artists and the audiences of the future to create and maintain an appreciation for the arts. It is crucial that we build on the Arts in Education Charter and ensure that arts provision is enhanced across the education sector, beginning at primary level. There also needs to be greater co-operation between the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Education and Skills and the Arts Council so that funding for projects can be secured and rolled out effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_946"> However well intentioned, many of the initiatives in the arts and education area rely on the publicly-funded artists and organisations to donate time to education projects. Instead of relying on these <i>ad hoc</i> donations, Fianna Fáil sees an urgent need to increase the joined-up thinking between the Arts Council, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Education and Skills in a more strategic way. We want to see the formalising of the advisory role of the Arts Council to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. We also see a need to establish an advisory role for the national cultural institutions so that their expertise can feed into the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. There should also be a dedicated national arts in education development unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_947"> The arts are crucial to everyday life in Ireland. In tabling this motion today, I have sought to put it centre stage in political life. I hope today will be the first of many debates that we have on the arts. I commend the motion to the House and I look forward to hearing the contributions of all Deputies.</p>

          <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Heather Humphreys)<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_948">I wish to share time with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.</p>
          <p eId="para_949"> First, I thank the Deputies opposite for tabling this motion on the arts. Once again, I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Niamh Smyth, on taking over the role of spokesperson on the arts for her party. As my constituency colleague, I look forward to working closely with her in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_950"> Unfortunately, due to new Dáil speaking arrangements, I can only contribute once to today's debate. I will not be able to respond to all the issues raised but Deputy Smyth may rest assured that I will be taking note.</p>
          <p eId="para_951"> I am pleased to have the opportunity to set out the Government's commitment to arts and culture, including the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to progressively increase funding to the arts as the economy continues to improve. Indeed, the opening line of the programme's section on Arts, Culture and Heritage recalled how our arts and culture were highlighted during the successful 1916 commemorations, and how they were seen to be intrinsic to the Irish State itself. In fairness - I wanted to make sure of this - we put arts at the centre of the 1916 commemorations.</p>
          <p eId="para_952"> The contribution of the cultural institutions and all of the cultural sector to the 1916 centenary commemorations should be seen as a demonstration of what can be achieved. It is a demonstration of the value of investing in arts and culture, and it can be an inspiration for this new partnership Government, in partnership with all who are committed to our arts and culture, to deliver more for all of our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_953"> I believe that we have an unparalleled opportunity to capture the cultural collaboration we have experienced in this centenary year. The arts and our culture have been centre stage. The commemorations have not only led to increased funding for the arts, and therefore artists, but they have also reinvigorated our interest in our culture and our pride in our Irishness. I have seen how groups and organisations across the cultural sector, the public sector and, indeed, the private sector have worked together - many for the first time ever - this year. Crucially, the commemorations were not only focussed on Dublin; they were spread right across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_954"> Now we have the chance to build on that collaboration and ensure that an appreciation and understanding of the vital nature of culture and creativity remains at the heart of everything we do. For me, that means rethinking how we approach the arts. It means that we do not only state that the arts and culture are good for tourism and jobs, but rather that supporting culture and creativity is vital if we want to create both a fairer society and a thriving economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_955"> I agree wholeheartedly with much of the sentiment of the motion before the House this evening. The arts are absolutely essential to the well-being of the Irish people and there is no doubt that a thriving arts and culture sector makes a hugely positive contribution to the Irish nation and to the Irish psyche.</p>
          <p eId="para_956"> I assure Deputies, and, indeed, members of the greater arts community, that the creation of a larger Department with a greater remit will not in any way diminish the importance of arts and culture within Government. On the contrary, a larger Department with wider responsibilities will bring greater weight to bear in promoting the importance of arts and culture right across Government. In fact, it disappointing that many seem to be overlooking the mutually beneficial opportunities which exist for the arts and rural Ireland. The wider responsibility of rural and regional affairs sits well with the commitment in the Government programme to strengthen the role of arts and heritage at local level. In that respect, I will be speaking to my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about establishing cultural units within local authorities to include arts and heritage officers, librarians and museum curators to strengthen the role of arts and culture locally because there is a wealth of creativity in rural Ireland that sometimes can be overlooked or overshadowed. I hope to address this perceived disconnect and encourage creativity country-wide through my brief. As the senior Minister, I want to be clear that I retain responsibility for the arts and I can assure the arts sector that it remains a priority for me.</p>
          <p eId="para_957"> On the issue of funding, the position is improving. Funding for the Arts Council and the film board is up, and of course, there was significant additional investment in the arts this year through the centenary programme. Much of the allocation of over €18 million in current funding for Ireland 2016 went to supporting cultural events which underpinned the programme, including the enormously successful Reflecting the Rising day out on Easter Monday and the centenary television programme that night, all of which was delivered in partnership with RTE.</p>
          <p eId="para_958"> The Culture Ireland I am Ireland programme is supporting young and established artists to present their work internationally. Retaining as much of this money as possible is a priority for me as we head into the budgetary and Estimates processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_959"> Approximately €31 million in capital funding was also provided for major centenary projects, including the new and very successful commemorative and visitor centre at the GPO, Teach an Phiarsaigh, and The Tenement Museum.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">There are continuing demands for capital investment in our national cultural institutions and I will work to build on the good progress to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_961"> In terms of broader cultural policy, work is continuing on Culture 2025. My Department is continuing to consider inputs on the draft document from the steering and expert groups that I established, and I expect to forward a draft for consideration to the relevant Oireachtas committee shortly. The publication of the framework policy will be a starting point and will be followed by action and implementation. Many of the other matters in today's motion are also contained as commitments in the Government programme, including the continued implementation of the arts in education charter. The Deputy did much work locally on that and I, as Minister responsible for the arts, fully supported her in the Cavan-Monaghan Education and Training Board arts and education initiative, which was held up as an example to the rest of the country. I want to see work continuing on that arts and education charter, which is very important and worthwhile. It is important that we get the artists into the school because, when children are exposed to different forms of art, it really connects and gets them involved, giving them something they can carry for the rest of their lives. Also in the Government programme is the important role of local authorities, further encouraging strong and mutually beneficial links between the business community and arts organisations and the maximisation of the contribution of the film industry. I have taken a considerable personal interest in the film industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_962"> Fine Gael in government has significantly improved the section 481 film tax relief. Following the recent Cannes film festival, I know other European Union countries are looking at this very successful model that we rolled out. The Revenue Commissioners estimate that projects availing of the section 481 relief in 2015 supported 1,200 jobs, with total combined expenditure of almost €160 million. The Irish Film Board produces excellent results from its relatively small budget and if that budget is progressively increased, the creative potential will be great.</p>
          <p eId="para_963"> I look forward to working with all partners and across all parties of this House to develop and implement initiatives that support and encourage arts and creativity for the betterment of our society as a whole. I look forward to hearing the contributions. If we are all serious about helping the arts and cultural communities to thrive, it is incumbent on all of us to work together to ensure our cultural sector is supported and recognised.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Finian McGrath)<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_964">I warmly welcome the debate on the arts and I am delighted with the cross-party support of this motion. I encourage all Deputies to support it because the arts are important as part of our being and who we are. Only last week I met a number of artists, including Ms Garry Hynes from the Druid, Mr. Eugene Downes of the Kilkenny Arts Festival, Ms Anne Clarke from Landmark Productions and Mr. Feargal Hynes from the Druid. They made a very comprehensive and convincing case on arts funding. I strongly support their views in this evening's debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> I also welcome that our Minister has accepted this motion and the Government is not opposing it. There is unity on this issue. As well as having such unity, we must have common sense. We must face the reality that we need adequate funding for the arts sector. We also need a visionary approach to arts and culture policy into the future. We also need the Department - and Members across parties - to rally around arts and culture in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_966"> We must consider examples of good practice in other countries. In France they have a vision of culture, culture is at the heart of Canadian society, and Iceland has massive support and understanding for the arts. These are examples, but in Ireland we must focus on adequate funding for the sector. We must ensure people in the arts sector are looked after, as there is much poverty evident in it. There are low-paid artists in and out of work, for example. We must deal with such issues with strategic and sustainable funding. I urge everybody to unite around this matter. My portfolio deals with disability issues and there is a large pool of talent in that area that could be brought into the arts. We also need the arts community to go into areas of economic disadvantage, where again there is much talent that is not being tapped. I thank everybody for their support. We must all work together in the interests of the arts community.</p>

          <p eId="para_970">Ba mhaith liom cúig nóiméad a thógáil agus an chuid eile a roinnt leis na daoine eile. I also laud the Acting Chairman's generosity with the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_971"> Creideann Sinn Féin go bhfuil ról lárnach, luachmhar agus ríthábhachtach ag na healaíona, ag an gcultúr, ag an oidhreacht, ag an nGaeilge agus ag na Gaeltachtaí i ndea-fheidhmiú agus i leas ár sochaí in Éirinn. Is cuid dar bhféiniúlacht iad leis na gcianta, mar Stát agus mar dhaoine.</p>
          <p eId="para_972"> Arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht are central to who we are as people, deeply embedded in the psyche and fabric of Irish society in towns, communities and across the country. They give us a sense of place and belonging. They are also central to our birth as a State; I can think of no other country that can map its genesis so completely to a revolution so immersed in the arts, culture, heritage and language, in the form of the Irish language. When the Government members are abroad they trade on the words of our Nobel laureates, while at home the Government wheels out the sector in order to impress guests. However, there is a deceitful dichotomy in the superficial way the State deals with the arts.</p>
          <p eId="para_973"> The arts sector is populated by artists who, on average, earn less than or the same as those on social welfare. It is unbelievable that we have a Minister who typically earns ten times the average salary of artists in this State when she claims to represent them. Precarious employment in the arts is the rule rather than the exception and, in an unfortunate Irish tradition, many of our finest artists are forced to leave the country in order to survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_974"> The Government has created a Frankenstein Department without coherence, spanning a diverse range including mná tí, ballet, bogs, butterflies and broadband. The arts has no specific Minister at Cabinet and any pretence otherwise is transparent nonsense. Having no voice at the decision-making table means there is no influence, and the words "culture" and "heritage" have been drop-kicked from the Department's name. The Government in the past number of years has seen the arts sector as the first stop for cuts and budget reductions. The Arts Council has lost 27% of its budget since 2008, the Irish language has lost 51% of its budget since 2008 and the Heritage Council has lost over 60% of its funding since 2008. These are not victimless cuts. They hit at every level of the arts sector in the State and individuals at a local level working within the arts community. Funding is both a measure of Government priority and the key foundation on which this sector operates. The Irish budget for the arts is a fifth of the average European budget, which is a shocking statistic and an indictment of this Government's policy. The necessary spaces in which artists cross-pollinate cannot be created without funds. This Government is involved in bogus economics and even if one measures the arts sector based on just the greasy till and ignores the intrinsic value of the art itself, one should know that investment in the arts makes economic sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_975"> This year in Meath we will be blessed with both the Kells Hay Festival and the Guth Gafa international documentary festival. The Hay Festival's audience has grown from 1,000 people to 250,000 visitors worldwide. This generates millions of euro of revenue for its host towns. An Guth Gafa was based in Donegal but because of the threadbare budget it had, it was forced to move and is now operating elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">According to Indecon, €1 invested in the arts leads to about €3 being returned. Of the annual budget spent on the arts, nearly three quarters<i>
						</i>is directly returned to the Exchequer through taxation, either income tax or VAT, and for every €1 the Irish Film Board has invested in a film and television production €6 is returned.</p>
          <p eId="para_977"> Every song, poem, film, painting and play we produce creates a window for the rest of the world to peer through and get to know us as a people. This has enormous value, which influences positively every further engagement we have with the rest of the globe. By these measures alone, the Government's policies are damaging. However, these measures alone are far too narrow. They disregard the intrinsic value and contribution of the arts, heritage and culture sectors to society. They feed our souls, stimulate our minds and lift our spirits, something that is vitally important in these tough times. I know we have a short time on our side.</p>
          <p eId="para_978"> This year saw the organic development of the Waking the Feminists movement, which highlighted the disenfranchisement and chronic under-representation of the work of women artists. This movement has put equality at the centre stage of the arts. We need to ensure that the voices and artistic expressions of Ireland's marginalised groups, ethnic minorities, homeless people and people with disabilities have full access to the mainstream.</p>

Táim fíorbhuíoch as ucht an deis labhairt ar an rún atá os comhair na Dála ar ábhar tábhachtach atá cóngarach do mo chroí. The arts, despite their contribution to society and our national identity, have faced substantial budget cuts and a lack of commitment to their development in recent years. We see the outworkings of that in the recent decision to downgrade the arts in the reconfiguration of Departments. That is not the Minister's fault and I am sure she will do her best in all of this, but we do need a dedicated arts Minister or Minister of State to drive their development. Tá an Stát tar éis ár n-ealaíontóirí is fearr agus ár n-oidhreacht is fearr a thaispeáint mar chuid de chomóradh an chéid, sa bhliain ina bhfuil muid ag ceiliúradh Éirí Amach 1916.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> Mar a dúirt an Teachta Tóibín, the arts bring us enjoyment and calmness, they allow us to be excited, they uplift us and they should be supported. However, they are more than that intrinsic thing. They can also be a social, cultural and creative outlet and an economic driver. Those who visit Ireland come to enjoy our heritage and historical sites. They go on a night out, they go to the theatre, a book reading, a ballad session or a concert. The film industry here, even though it is from a very small catchment area, is now winning prizes internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_981"> Last Wednesday and Friday, I had the pleasure of meeting with local artists from my constituency, including Paul Hayes, Bríd McBride, Laurence McKeown, Patricia Duffy and Colette McGahon.

          <p eId="para_982">Gabhaim buíochas leo siúd a chur an rún seo faoinár gcomhair inniu. Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil muid ag déanamh plé ar na healaíona mar ró-mhinic ní dhéantar plé orthu nó ar na healaíontóirí. Sin é an príomhfháth go bhfuilimid anseo inniu. Mar mhac ealaíontóra, tuigim go maith na fadhbanna a bhíonn ag ealaíontóirí agus iad ag triail a gceard a chleachtadh, ní hamháin ó thaobh infheistíochta de ach uaireanta ó thaobh spás a bheith acu chun an ealaín sin a chleachtadh, nó an t-airgead a bheith acu chun an spás sin a bheith acu. Is gá dúinn díriú isteach ar seo i gceart. Muna dhéanaimid é, beimid thíos mar shochaí dá thairbhe sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_983"> Every cent that is spent on the arts, whether in schools, colleges or in the public realm, enhances us as a society. Everybody in this House will agree with that. We are here as policy-makers and our decisions here dictate what happens outside these Chambers. Pennypinchers should regard it as an investment in our society, not just in the artist, the art space or the works of art. Deputy Tóibín has shown that whatever we invest in the arts, we get it back in spades, in tourism, employment, goodwill, exports, digital media and our reputation. Major opportunities will exist if we are to come out of the recession that was imposed on us by Governments and by the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_984"> However, we can only benefit from those investments if we look at exactly what is needed in the arts. In many cases, it is access to artist's studios and access for those who are under the living wage and under the social welfare payments to spaces in which to live and to carry out their works. We also need to ensure the arts are a prominent part of local authority planning and any major public works. In particular, we have opportunities in terms of the National Children's Hospital. Where else but a children's hospital can we allow our imagination to run wild? I call on the Minister for Health, as he plans that hospital and the satellite units, to use the opportunity to enhance the arts in that realm.</p>

          <p eId="para_985">I welcome all the people in the Public Gallery. It is great to see such a crowd. We do not normally get so many people here.</p>
          <p eId="para_986"> The arts are part of the DNA of the Irish State. Their very uniqueness is what makes us who we are as a people. In this sense, the arts and our cultural institutions are the key producers of Irish identity. In a mature society that values expression and creativity, the arts have the potential to enrich all our lives. They make us more human and help us to think about the world and our place in it in a more imaginative, innovative and abstract way. Irish artists enhance our international reputation through movie screens, bookshelves, theatres and concert stages. This presence, in turn, drives tourism from abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_987"> At a more fundamental level, the arts and cultural institutions have a humanising effect on society by bringing softness, imagination and creativity to communities that have been forgotten in economic and infrastructural terms by those in power. In my city of Limerick we have found that one of the best ways of assisting new immigrants to integrate is through the arts. A progressive State arts policy must have inclusivity at its core. This requires us to value actively the everyday culture of ordinary people and not just "high art". In 2014 Limerick City of Culture opened up the arts to diverse groups across the whole of the city. Venues worked with a wide range of groups from across the city and the Lime Tree Theatre, in particular, hosted a performance from the residents of Moyross, which was well-received by everybody in the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> The creative sector is important for the economy but its value must be about more than profit. Neither should we deprive localities of a vibrant arts scene by concentrating supports for the arts in the capital. The heritage and culture of Ireland belong to all the people on the island of Ireland. It is the State's responsibility to ensure we have an independent and vibrant arts sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_990"> In my constituency of Laois-Offaly, there is a bridge, the Ardara Bridge, that is believed to date back to the 1500s. Two archaeologists have studied this bridge. Ten years later, that bridge is still under scaffolding. It is impacting on our potential as a county to generate more tourism. I call on the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to look at that project, which has been held up as a result of the cuts over the years.</p>

          <p eId="para_992">There are many ways in which we can renew and revitalise Ireland, but without a doubt an important pillar of renewing and revitalising our country is to refocus our support for the arts and culture. In that context, I am happy to support the motion put forward by Deputy Niamh Smyth.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">An Ireland of opportunity for all would not just deliver a good education system, good jobs and investment in essential public services. To paraphrase what Seán O’Casey said of Jim Larkin, our fight must be not just to put bread on the tables of working families, but a rose in the vase, too. The arts were not exempt from the difficult adjustments of recent years. The resilience shown by musicians, writers, actors, film makers and other artists during this period of retrenchment has been remarkable. They have, in no small way, helped our country recover from the reputational damage inflicted by the financial collapse.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> As the budgetary constraints lessen, and we have leeway for investment again, I believe it is time to plan for a new settlement of public support for the arts with a new public endowment for the arts in Ireland. Many dividends would arise from such investment. One is, of course, the pure economic gain, which is very substantial, but the importance of the arts and culture goes far beyond their monetary value. They define our character as a nation. Publicly funded art and culture display the dynamism of Ireland to the entire world. In turn, they encourage creativity and innovation in architecture, fashion, technology, product design, music and entertainment. If one believes in a more equal society, access to the arts is an essential ingredient, starting with our education system. </p>
          <p eId="para_995"> Three years ago, the trade union movement remembered the epic battle of the 1913 Lock-out. That centenary was marked by two particular events which illustrate my point. One was the remarkable Tapestry project, initiated by artists Robert Ballagh and Cathy Henderson, which brought together volunteers from a wide range of community groups, trade unions, the arts, schools and, indeed, the inmates of Limerick Prison. The final result was magnificent but no less important was the collaborative process by which it was developed and created.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> Another commemorative event, in which I had an involvement as Minister for Social Protection, was for a group called RADE, Recovery through Art, Drama and Education, whose mission is to engage drug users with the arts and therapeutic supports. This project brought participants through all the elements of staging a drama about 1913. The poet, Paula Meehan, wrote the following about the project:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_997">The project that is RADE allows the powerful processes of art to work their magic - painting, writing, acting, making in all its forms. RADE puts creativity at the service of personal transformation.</p>
          <p eId="para_998"> Ireland's economic renewal is taking shape and we need to take stock of what contribution can come from renewed investment in the arts. A couple of weeks ago, the Taoiseach had the privilege of opening Ireland 100 in the Kennedy Centre in Washington. The film director, Lenny Abrahamson, used the occasion to make the point that the arts were not just a photo opportunity for politicians, no matter how distinguished.</p>
          <p eId="para_999"> Occasionally, I bunk off from this place and go to see a film or a bit of theatre and I had the great pleasure a couple of weeks ago of going to see an adaptation of <i>Lady Susan</i>, the Jane Austen novella, called "Love and Friendship". I was delighted to see An Bord Scannán’s name on the credits because it was filmed, to a very significant extent, in the most beautiful Georgian places in Dublin. Jane Austen fans will know that at the end the heroes or heroines – usually heroines - generally got their woman or man.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000"> An unfortunately large number of responsibilities have been given to the current Minister with responsibility for the arts and culture. It is well known in politics that if one is Minister for everything, one is, by and large, Minister for nothing. If I have heard anything from this discussion from all parties this afternoon, it is that we need to focus on reinstating what Michael D. Higgins, now our President, initiated when he became the first Minister exclusively for arts, culture and heritage when serving in Government in the 1990s. It led to a significant renaissance in the arts so it is important that all parties think of having a dedicated Ministry for the arts whenever a government is formed. The Government should have a global Irish forum on the arts in Ireland, modelled on the successful economic global Irish forum. So many people are involved in the arts in Ireland that we have a good story to tell. We also have a dark past in respect of the arts. My colleague beside me is from Limerick, as was an earlier speaker, and they will know that Kate O’Brien’s great novel <i>The Land of Spices</i> was banned by an earlier censorship board because there was a glimpse of two men being intimate with each other at one point in the novel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001"> The arts tell so many different stories of what life in Ireland has been like down the ages and how it can be imagined in the future, for better or worse. For that reason, I end by calling for cross-party agreement for a suggestion. Yesterday, we received the summer economic statement and it is clear that significant additional funds will be available to the Government by the end of the year. There are many requests for those funds but when I was in government as Tánaiste and Deputy Howlin was Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, we prioritised getting more funding into the arts in this special centenary year. There is a lot of capital renewal is going on relating to important institutions such as the National Gallery and the National Library. I propose that we continue the endowment that has gone into the commemoration of 1916 by rolling it over into the arts at both capital and current levels. We have to find the money to begin to re-endow the arts in a more generous way in this country and we can do that by agreement in the forthcoming budget. We are not taking money from anywhere else but continuing a quantity of money that was put in place by the previous Government for both capital and current funding of the arts. I would like to hear a response from other parties, and particularly the Minister, who I know is a great champion of the arts, to the effect that they will support this in the forthcoming budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_1033">I thank Fianna Fáil for tabling a motion on the arts. We support the general thrust of its motion but PBP-AAA has submitted an amendment which I hope the proposers of the motion will accept. I will run through it briefly in the short period of time available to me. In addition to the measures proposed in the Fianna Fáil motion, we are proposing to increase State funding to the arts to the European average of 0.6%, starting with an additional €75 million in funding in the arts budget in 2017. We propose to remove the availability for work requirement for registered artists on jobseeker's allowance to allow artists, who want to, to do unpaid work. Further, we propose to ensure that all children have greater access to culture and art as a right both within and outside education, to establish a new fund targeted at promoting access to arts participation in disadvantaged areas for adults and children, to open up existing facilities in schools and colleges for after-school artistic activities for children and teenagers, to open up NAMA's buildings for use by local arts organisations and, finally, to establish what we are calling a "new deal" jobs programme to deliver 5,000 new jobs directly in the public sector for artists in the areas of education, special needs, disability, mental health, disadvantaged communities and the elderly. </p>
          <p eId="para_1034"> I will explain the rationale. It is very easy for people of all colours on the political spectrum to utter pious words about their commitment to arts and to stand in photographs at artistic events but then not to match rhetoric with real support and funding for the arts and artists. This has been fact, in particular under the impact of the recession of the past eight or nine years. During this time both the Fianna Fáil-Green Government and the Labour Party-Fine Gael Government slashed arts funding and supports to artists. Since 2008 to date, they have slashed arts funding progressively between them by 30%, further immiserating artists who are already low paid and hitting at the access of children and those in disadvantaged communities to the arts. We do not need pious words but real and concrete action. </p>
          <p eId="para_1035"> I will quote a few artists. The sculptor and artist, Henry Moore, said: "To be an artist is to believe in life." Picasso said: "Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up." Karl Marx said: "The writer must earn money in order to live and write but he must by no means live and write for the purpose of making money." The thing that bothers me is that even when a case is made for the arts, it often has to be justified in economic terms. I do not believe this should be the case. We need to recognise that art is what defines us as human beings. It is our ability to imagine things that are not there and then to go out and create them that is the very defining characteristic of our humanity. Therefore, to deny access to the arts to children and all sections of our society, in particular the poor, the disenfranchised, the elderly and the disabled, is to deny them the right to be human beings. We have never fully recognised or acknowledged that fact. We have never matched the pious words about support for the arts with the real resources that would make that sort of thing a reality, support the arts and infuse the whole of our culture with the influence of the arts. </p>
          <p eId="para_1036"> We need to move beyond rhetoric and come up with the money. Stop the cuts and stop the arts being the soft touch whenever things get difficult. We should recognise that art is what we are as human beings and what people are entitled to, but consistently denied access to. I commend our amendment to the House. It tries to match the rhetoric we hear to what is required to make it fact.</p>

          <p eId="para_1037">A great play begins with the following scene:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1038">GALILEO: Put the milk on the table. But don't shut any of my books.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1039">ANDREA [the housekeeper's son]: Mother says we must pay the milkman. If we don't, he'll soon be making a circle round our house [...]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1040">GALILEO: The expression is: he will be describing a circle, Andrea. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1041">ANDREA: All right. If we don't pay, he'll be describing a circle round us, Signor Galilei. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1042">GALILEO: While the bailiff, Signor Cambione, will come straight here by taking what sort of a line between two points?</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1043">ANDREA <i>grinning</i>: The shortest. </p>
          <p eId="para_1044">The great German Communist playwright, Brecht, describes all too well in that scene the conflict between creative endeavour and economic pressure, a conflict all too familiar for artists in this country and more than many others. Artists in this country know the experience of having to duck and dive and of trying to do their art while surviving on a community employment scheme or an internship. They know the experience of having to haggle with the officer down at the local dole office to try to explain that the work they are doing is genuine work and that they should not be forced to go out and do work which cuts across that which they wish to do and invest their labour in. They know the experience of trying to find a studio they can afford. </p>
          <p eId="para_1045"> This affects all artists but it affects, in particular, female artists. What is the median income of an artist in this country? For a man, it is the very low figure of €11,148. For a woman, it is way less at €5,982. This can be contrasted with the situation in France where payment is made by the state to artists who work more than 507 hours over a ten month period. It can also be contrasted with the situation of many of the workers artists work alongside in, for example, theatres or community centres. Builders or electricians are on higher rates of pay. There is a lesson there for the artistic community. It needs to be organised and unionised and it needs to fight. This is being done, but artists need full support when doing it. </p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> We often talk about the great condition in this country of our writers, poets, singers and artists. Unfortunately, there is another tradition, which is a tradition of Philistinism and it is a tradition which is particularly strong in the establishment down through the years. When Yeats wrote about the people fumbling in the greasy till in "September 1913" he wrote about the shopkeeper mentality among the aspiring ruling elite at the time. Other Deputies have mentioned the establishment censorship that was imposed on artists during the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. However, who stands in their tradition? Does not a Government which allocates 0.11% to the arts stand in that bad, Philistine tradition? I argue that it does. A figure of 0.3% is a step forward, but it is only half of the European average. In our modest demands in this amendment, we want the European average and we will continue to campaign and fight for it, irrespective of the vote, which we hope will be carried.</p>

          <p eId="para_1048">I love the line that Captain Boyle comes out with in "Juno and the Paycock" when he asks, "what is the moon?" and "what is the stars?". I think we could ask the question as well today: what are the arts? We know the traditional answer and we know that it encompasses everything from painting to sculpture, architecture, music, poetry, literature, the performing arts, dance, film, photography and crafts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> We could say that all of us have been touched, in one way or the other, by the arts. For me, the arts are not just about the big theatres, art galleries, lavish productions, blockbusters, Oscars and Booker prizes but are also about the smaller productions and the community initiatives and ventures. Dublin has been very lucky with quite a number of these. I am thinking about the smaller theatres such as Draíocht, Axis, The New Theatre, the Viking and the Seán O'Casey centre and about all the local festivals, whether it is Phizzfest or the Five Lamps. Most of these began as just a small idea from a group of people. I will move outside of Dublin to another place I love, that is, Cape Clear Island where about 20 years ago, a couple of people had the idea of a storytelling festival. It has now become an international storytelling event.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> A recent initiative in Drumcondra is linking business and the arts. It is taking over available spaces for people in the arts, whether painting, music, dance or theatre. Allied to that is space for start-up businesses. The business and arts link has been acknowledged by our colleges with their degree offerings in arts and business, such as those from NUI Maynooth and Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051"> I think all Deputies have an example of the way in which the arts have been part of their communities and constituencies. I have a particular interest in theatre and in education and I am very sad to see the demise of TEAM Theatre. It did great work in our schools around particular issues. It presented the issues in drama form and then followed up with discussions with the students. I also acknowledge the initiative by the Abbey Theatre with local schools and youth group groups in the vicinity. All of these initiatives contributed to the development and stretched the abilities and potential of young people. We know that the arts have a role in encouraging diversity and tolerance. The arts are also good for mental health, on which we could all do more, including in this establishment. </p>
          <p eId="para_1052"> It is very difficult to see how the Government is recognising the wealth of the arts when it includes the arts in a very wide portfolio. What is the reasoning apart from a very vague and woolly point about the arts being important in rural Ireland, which nobody denies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053"> I will now turn to the work of the Association of Artists Representative Organisations, AARO, which tells us about the reality of life for artists and the way in which they were extremely badly hit during the recession. We know that artists are poorly paid and that it is a very unstable career. Artists' freelance status excludes them from many of the safeguards which are normally provided for those in employment. Artists do not have collective bargaining rates of pay in respect of freelance creators. Collective bargaining would enable artists' organisations to negotiate minimum terms and better contracts. Ireland is behind the EU average for spending on arts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in this State is the person who issues the licence to net live hares for live here coursing. I do not think that is in the brief of any minister for arts and culture in any country in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> In regard to Moore Street and the High Court challenge, the potential for an historical cultural quarter there could be lost and what we could end up with is a glass box and more shops selling leprechaun hats and covers for mobile phones. That to me is not culture. We are talking about cultural policy and I hope there is real engagement on that with communities throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056"> Maidir lenár dteanga dúchais, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil go leor á dhéanamh againn chun tacú leis an teanga agus is páirt an-mhór í sin inár n-oidhreacht chomh maith.</p>

However, I believe we are missing the point when we talk and make arguments about whether there should be Minister for the arts. We should insist on is that the Government recognises economic, social and cultural rights across all of society, regardless of whether the Minister for the arts or whether the arts are included in a wideranging brief. We should insist that Government policy recognises the cultural rights of all our citizens to be able to express themselves through the arts and to make a living for themselves and their families through artistic endeavour no matter where they live in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058"> I wish to speak about my own county of Donegal where it is extremely difficult, or virtually impossible, for people in rural parts to actually make a life within the arts. Donegal would probably be one of the better counties in its support for the arts through Donegal County Council and the good work it does with the Earagail Arts Festival and the Donegal Bay and Bluestacks Festival, and the wider cultural remit of the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059"> However, the arts are always the first thing to be cut whenever difficulties arise with funding. It is the same on a national level and that is the problem of the arts experience. If we had a society that recognised the cultural rights of all our citizens, that would not be the case. We could see the value the arts provide not only for the individuals who work in the arts and who provide for a greater society but all of us. That is vitally important. We should provide a system that encourages our young people to get involved and to be able to express themselves because it does wonders for their confidence and their sense of self-worth, which feeds into the wider community. That is what we should aim to achieve. Having a Minister designated to the arts will not change that and will not deliver. What will deliver is having a Government and a society that recognises cultural rights for all citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_1060">Ag teacht ó chathair na Gaillimhe, cathair dhátheangach na tíre, ní féidir liom ach mo thacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo. Déanaim comhghairdeas le Fianna Fáil. Coming from Galway city, the bilingual capital of the State, I could not but support this motion. Coming from a Galway where we have Cúirt, the Galway Arts Festival, the film festival, the Galway Early Music Festival, Music for Galway, Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe and so on, I could not but support this rún. These events have put Galway city on the map and they have done that struggling on a shoestring budget despite the best efforts of councillors to give money every year. </p>
          <p eId="para_1061"> Prior to the last election, the arts organisations approached all of the candidates and asked us to endorse the arts. They made very simple suggestions, the first of which was to restore arts funding to at least 0.3% of the GDP. The second suggestion was to ensure that all local authorities in the country filled the vacant positions of art officers and produced arts plans by the end of 2016. The third suggestion was to actively fund creative industries and arts through the local enterprise boards and LEADER. The fourth suggestion was to reclassify spending on the arts as non-discretionary. These are four basic recommendations that could implemented very easily.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062"> In addition, the arts organisations highlighted - Galway is one example but it applies throughout the country - five key areas, including the lack of permanent accessible and affordable space for artists, the lack of space for them to show, the lack of space for them to learn and the necessity for space in which to start. Ina theannta sin, chuir siad béim ar an teanga. Tá luach €136 milliún i gceist le luach na Gaeilge do chathair agus Contae na Gaillimhe. Tá €59 milliún den mhéid sin ag baint leis an gcathair í fhéin. </p>
          <p eId="para_1063"> Dúirt Deputy Boyd Barrett that we really should not look at this as an economic issue. I understand the point he made but it is extremely important for the Government because it is very taken by numbers and economy. The figures for the Irish film industry are simply extraordinary given this is a tiny country with a tiny film industry. The audio-visual sector alone is worth €550 million, it employs 6,000 individuals and more than 560 small and medium enterprises. If one goes back to bord snip nua, chaired by Colm McCarthy, the first thing that was going to be cut was the Irish Film Board which was to be amalgamated into Enterprise Ireland. I would suggest amalgamating Enterprise Ireland with the Irish Film Board and then we would go places sa tír seo.</p>

          <p eId="para_1066"> I welcome very sincerely everyone in the Gallery from the arts sector. I compliment Deputy Smyth for tabling this motion today. I support fully her many sound proposals in the motion. "The arts" as defined under the Arts Act 2003 means: "Any creative or interpretative expression (whether traditional or contemporary) in whatever form, and includes, in particular, visual arts, theatre, literature, music, dance, opera, film, circus and architecture, and includes any medium when used for those purposes;" The arts are something that define us as a nation and give us our distinct image and are seen by everyone who looks at Ireland. They are what shape us and our young people growing up and give us our distinct personality. For example, our music and dance are completely unique to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">I support the call to enhance music and dance in our schools, especially in primary schools. I remember being taken out for music and dance lessons as a young boy and it was great, it gave us a sense of involvement along with being then able to participate as I did in many Munster and all-Ireland fleadhanna cheoil. It is a big attraction for tourists and it was great for us as young people. It is our uniqueness that makes us as a nation. That is why I believe not only should we ensure we maintain what we have but also invest and expand in communities where all of this begins. I fully support Deputy Smyth's call for the introduction of an arts capital grant scheme, similar to the existing sports capital grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068"> We are living in a golden era of Irish film in Ireland. We have received much international attention in recent years with Irish films winning in almost every major international award ceremony such as Academy Awards, the Cannes Jury Prize, the Golden Bear in Berlin and the International Confederation of Art Cinemas, CICAE, to name but a few. We have some of the most recognised and decorated actors in the world who represent our nation, including Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell, Michael Fassbender etc. Ireland is an excellent co-producing partner for European and international productions with a wide range of financial incentives for film and television, excellent facilities, stunning locations and award winning cast and crew on offer. The recent improvements to Ireland's tax incentive section 481 for film and television production has dramatically improved Ireland's competitive position as a film location.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069"> When mentioning film, I have to compliment the actions of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, in the last Government, who was the sole person to ensure that "Star Wars" came to Kerry. She will go down in the pages of history as being the person who had the gumption to sign the order. I will always compliment her and give her the full credit for that. Everybody is shouting about it now and they are all delighted but it took a Minister with gumption at the time to make sure it became a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070"> I acknowledge the great work done by Noelle Campbell Sharp at Cill Rialaig in Ballinskelligs. She had a vision and did great things to ensure that the whole project under the chairmanship of my lifelong friend, Mr. Nicholas Browne of Ballinskelligs, developed at that time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1071">I wish the Minister the very best in her new role as Minister for regional development, rural affairs, arts and the Gaeltacht. It is a huge role and she has a huge task ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072"> Arts are a fundamental part of our society, not only because of their intrinsic value but also due to the measurable impact on our physical health, mental health, social well-being, our education system, our national status and our economy. Our arts and culture are a strategic national resource that need to be cherished and invested in. The Government needs to truly take on board the enormous contribution which the arts have made and can continue to make to our economy and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073"> I call on the Minister to fight for investment in the arts and to bring the capital investment from 0.11% of GDP to at least 0.3%, bearing in mind that the EU average is 0.6% of GDP. I also call on the Minister to examine the level of arts funding provided to west Cork. The arts in west Cork are among the lowest funded in the country. When measured as Arts Council funding <i>per capita</i>, Dublin gets €51.31, Cork City gets €22.95 and County Cork gets only €3.42. West Cork is a hub for the arts with over 530,000 people visiting the area for the arts last year. An example of the success of the arts in west Cork is its three music festivals in Bantry which deliver an economic impact of just under €2.5 million and 21 local jobs. Visitor numbers exceed 5,000 with 26% of the visitors coming from abroad. For every €1 provided in funding €7.60 is delivered. I call on the Minister to improve the arts funding for west Cork and please to treat rural Ireland equally in terms of funding and therefore opportunities. I also urge the Minister to consider creating tax incentives for those who wish to support the arts in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074"> According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: “Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, [and] to enjoy the arts”. I ask the Minister please to increase funding for the arts to ensure that everyone in Ireland can experience and participate in the arts. Like Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, I congratulate the Minister on the work she did to bring "Star Wars" to Kerry. It came to my area too, which will be a huge economic boost to Brow Head, Crookhaven, Goleen and west Cork. It has left a mark that will not be forgotten and may encourage others to invest there. </p>

          <p eId="para_1075">I want to ask for financial support for rural and local festivals around the country because by means of these festivals and fair days and vintage rallies and so forth people and parishes retain their identities. This is the last bastion or way they have of showing their individual identities. Kenmare Fair Day on 15 August is the big day in Kenmare. It costs more now to stage these events because of insurance and different rules and licences and regulations. If it was not for the likes of that and the horse fair in Castleisland and the World Fiddle Day in Scartaglin those places would lose their identity. Everyone knows about Puck Fair and the value and expenditure it means for the people of Kerry. All these places are under pressure to retain and stage these events. I am asking for support for those events in whatever way possible. We have to thank the local authorities which help as well as they can but they have only so much money to give and that is limited. They have been meting it out like the loaves and fishes. It is hard to please everyone. We need to consider that so that local places can retain their identities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076"> I feel very hurt about the fact that local characters who used to come to public houses and demonstrate their storytelling, singing, playing the fiddle and accordion impromptu are no longer able to do that because they are rurally isolated in their homes. They are trapped because they cannot come to the pub and drive home after having two or three pints. The rules and drink driving regulations treat them in the same way as the vast traffic on motorways, regional roads, national primary and secondary roads. They are being treated in the same way on minor small roads where there is hardly any traffic. These people are isolated at home and the tourists are not meeting them now as they used to in the public houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_1077">I welcome this debate and I welcome the visitors in the gallery. It is highly unusual to have such a large crowd in the Visitors Gallery for such a debate. That makes a statement in its own right. We are famed the world over for our arts, culture and heritage and we never miss an opportunity to play into that fame when elected officials go abroad for a business event and so on. I am not criticising that but think it should be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078"> During the recent commemorations of 1916 we dedicated a significant amount of the occasion to artistic spectacles, highlighting the successes of our artists and their connections to the major historical events of 100 years ago, and rightly so. The outpouring of awe and pride after the airing of the superb centenary celebration which showcased our theatrical and musical talent was indicative of the importance of the arts and heritage sector in our lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079"> If we reflect on our history and see, for example, the cultural revival and the significant role that played in the birth of our Republic we can see that if we are to strive for a second republic that is just as meaningful we must similarly ground that in art, literature, theatre, culture and sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">This is a turning point. We have come from a crash and are starting a recovery, but it has to be meaningful. Our culture and art bind us together. We have to place a degree of importance on that in this debate and what we do afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081"> Those involved in the cultural revival recognised that higher principles bind us together. They demonstrated those features in the artistic endeavours of our writers, musicians, artists and many others. If we are to take a leaf out of the book of Douglas Hyde and those involved in the cultural revival, we would see the opportunities and celebrate what unites us and the shared vision for our future and that of our country. That can only happen if we accept the need to foster the arts to that degree and fund it accordingly. </p>
          <p eId="para_1082"> A significant section of our manifesto placed importance on the arts. We also highlighted in the recent election campaign that for too long Governments have ignored the arts, an attitude that is typified by the 55% cut to the arts since 2008, which predated the last Government. We are bottom of the European league for investment in culture and the arts, and data showed that in 2012 we spent less than 0.11% of GDP on arts and culture, compared to the European average of 0.6%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083"> The National Campaign for the Arts estimates that for every one euro invested by the Arts Council, more than 70 cent returns directly to the Exchequer in taxes. Every 30 cent of Arts Council investment generates €2.50 in turnover, which is more than an eightfold return on investment. It makes sense to invest in the arts. We should not disregard the fact that 21,000 people work in the sector, not including the many volunteers and enthusiasts. A report I read recently highlighted that just 11% of writers can survive on the earnings from their craft. This is a country that produced people like Yeats, Joyce and O'Casey. I wonder how many more people of that calibre we can produce if we continue to under-invest in the arts. The notion that artists like existing on fresh air or produce a better class of work by virtue of the fact that they are living in poverty, which focuses the brain, is a nonsense. The arts require significant investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084"> I refer to the film industry. There have been some very good productions recently, such as "Vikings" and "Penny Dreadful". The expansion of the industry has been hampered by the availability of studio space. My colleague Deputy Stephen Donnelly would welcome a conversation with the Minister about that. He has worked with a group in Wicklow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085"> Approximately 87% of those who visited Ireland listed arts and culture as part of the reason they came here, yet we give tax breaks such as VAT to the likes of McDonald's and Starbucks. We need to start thinking much more strategically and consider the income that could be generated and invested in the arts. We cannot just have a debate today. We have to see an outturn from this in hard cash if we are to make a difference in the future. The investment may be small, but it is worthwhile.</p>

          <p eId="para_1086">I commend Deputy Niamh Smyth on bringing this motion to the House. I and my Green Party colleague Deputy Eamon Ryan will be more than happy to support it. Without the necessary governmental support the arts cannot flourish, and we need them to flourish for the very sake of our heritage. We need the arts to be strong and independent. Yet Ireland is currently ranked at the bottom of the European league for Government investment in culture and the arts. It is essential that we consider and recognise in the House how intrinsic the arts are to our soul as a nation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1089">I compliment Deputy Niamh Smyth on this very timely motion. I speak as a person who had my first interaction with the arts as a politician in the mid-1980s when I was a member of Cork Corporation. I served as chairperson of the arts committee at that time. I had wonderful interactions with the arts community and young artists in the city, including Triskel Arts Centre, Graffiti Theatre Company, the Opera House, the Everyman Theatre, the National Sculpture Factory and many more. What struck me was the creativity of the arts community and the degree to which it brought a lot to my world as a young politician at that time. The grants we allocated to various organisations went a long way. Very small amounts of money acted as seed capital and produced extraordinary results, and leveraged far more on top of the amounts allocated by the local authority. The city council in Cork was and still is a very progressive body and was pioneering in terms of the advancement of the arts in the city. It understood the relationship and importance for the city of the promotion of the arts. It is in that context that the motion was tabled by Deputy Smyth. There is a need for the political world to address the imperative for the arts to come back to the centrality of political decision-making and the kind of society we want.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090"> I want to start by addressing the changed status of the arts portfolio at Cabinet. We all know the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is not responsible for this. The Taoiseach decides on the division of responsibility. Under the last two Governments, the Department was called, respectively, the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. In both cases the arts came first. It has now it has been relegated to third place, after regional development and rural affairs, subjects which have no obvious connection to the arts except in the most general sense. While it is flattering that the Minister has been given additional responsibilities, it remains to be seen how much clout they will carry. What sort of budgets will be involved? Are the rules more in the nature of co-ordination, or designed to convey that Fine Gael in government cares about rural Ireland? The structure of the Department is very unclear.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">Even if they get more money, is there any necessary read-across for the arts? Will the arts be given an active role in regional development?</p>
          <p eId="para_1092"> The perception in the arts community is that the arts, never high on the Government's list of priorities, has slipped further back. I acknowledge that the arts did suffer some cutbacks under Fianna Fáil after the crash in 2008, but the cuts came after many years of steady increases in resources. I also point out that the then Minister, Martin Cullen, was to the forefront in challenging the 2009 McCarthy report, which suggested that the arts were not really a priority at a time of economic difficulty, implying that they could and should be cut back disproportionately. I further make the point that a serious backlog of investment is needed in the national cultural institutions and, while a start is being made, much more needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093"> I am happy to acknowledge and praise the efforts and resources put into the 1916 commemoration, but now some of the resources that will be freed up when the major investment projects are finished need to be put into supporting and extending sustainable arts infrastructure across the regions. We must also remember that many of those who took part in the Easter Rising were important cultural figures with an engagement, interest and involvement in the arts, which, unfortunately, has only intermittently characterised Government interest in an independent Ireland. The leaders of 1916 loved, respected and valued the arts. They got the arts. Sadly, there is a real and deeply held belief that the Government does not get the arts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094"> Recently an article was published in the name of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, in <i>The Sunday Times</i>, which attempted to defend what the Government has done and offer reassurance for the future. Yet I suspect many, indeed most, who read it were unconvinced and many others were angered and bemused. The Minister wrote that "a rumbling of discontent within the arts community has steadily developed into a roar" and spoke about how the campaign for the arts had managed to "garner the support, of the Oscar-nominate[d] director Lenny Abrahamson". The tone was dismissive to say the least, but the Minister then had the gall to write, "In the wake of the centenary events we have an unprecedented opportunity to seize upon the renewed passion, connection and pride in our culture and our heritage". First, I do not accept that this was a connection in need of renewal, but even if one accepts the premise, it is remarkable that the Government should seize the opportunity by downgrading the arts. The Minister also said there was "an onus not just on the government to show its commitment to our culture, but also on the sector itself to look outwards rather than within". That is frankly ludicrous. The fact is that our artists have always looked outward - it is the Government that has turned inward. I recall the very first Global Irish Economic Forum at Farmleigh, at which several major ex-pat chief executive officers from all over the world who had made it to the highest levels of the corporate world came back and told everyone at the gathering - policy makers and decision makers - that Ireland's calling card externally was the arts, literature, and creativity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> In the newspaper article, the Minister also said "the arts community has a choice: to condemn this government, based upon an unfounded belief that it has no regard for the arts, or to work constructively together and bring forward ideas in the best interests of the sector and the wider community". The arts sector was already doing that, and has always been committed to doing that; it is the Government that is holding the sector back. She also wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1096">We are renowned around the world for our incredible cultural legacy, but it is time we focused more on the positive impact of the arts at home. Why not promote our wealth of contemporary culture as an asset when we are seeking to attract some of the world's best companies to invest here?</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">That has already happened, but the downgrading of the portfolio means that now we will have less credibility in doing so and people will be less convinced. In an ideal world the arts are not really about attracting companies or anything like that; they have their own intrinsic value and purpose. None the less, I deplore the way the arts sector has been treated. The Minister might say we are wrong in our assertions, but that is the perception across the board within the arts community and that is the view of those in the field. Why would the arts community be convinced when we consider the shambles of how, under the previous Government, Limerick was selected but then not supported as City of Culture, leaving cultural institutions and arts organisations there to pick through the political debris? We also saw the gross misuse of the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, as the life raft of choice to ferry a Fine Gael candidate into a Seanad seat. That disregard for the fundamental principle of the independence of arts organisations and the simultaneous envy, fear or disregard for independent scholars and artists is fully continued in the way critically important boards are currently filled. Of 12 people appointed by the Minister last Friday to fill a board of 16 members to take change of the National Museum, only six had skills directly relevant to the mission of the museum. Others, all of whom are highly qualified people in their sphere who should be thanked for their willingness to serve, might in fewer numbers form a valuable part of the overall skills matrix on the board. What is striking is not the good people concerned, but the continuing trend of board appointments in arts, heritage and culture, where specialists and practitioners are conspicuously under-represented. The lack of esteem and the condescending belief that artists and scholars who run remarkable organisations on a shoestring need to be minded or marketed by professionals is appalling. Artists and scholars are true professionals. They are the experts. They give their whole life to their work. For them, that work is their life. They demand respect, an end to condescension and to belittling disregard, and on their behalf I repeat that demand in Dáil Eireann today.</p>

          <p eId="para_1099">I very much welcome the debate both as a Member of this House and as a long-time supporter of and participant in the arts. I am also pleased the motion is not being opposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100"> As a Government we are cognisant of the value of the arts, and, as our programme for partnership Government notes, we promise to "work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve". The previous budget saw a 12% increase in funding for the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101"> We have a tendency to look for value for money in public spending. There is nothing wrong with that. For every €1 the Arts Council invests, more than 70 cent returns directly to the Exchequer in taxes, and when the Arts Council invests the remaining 30 cent it translates to a turnover of €2.50, which is more than an eight-fold return. However, that is only one side of the equation. The other is the intrinsic and unquantifiable value of the arts. While we might argue about the recent change of designation for the Department, what it means to those involved in the arts is that artists feel they are not being valued as they should be. That is an understandable concern. I know that the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, is fully committed to the promotion of the arts. She has reiterated that point this evening. The problem is the message. The arts are all about symbology. The change in designation was a message that was heard loud and clear by the arts community. If the ideal of the arts in this country is Mozart, then I think we introduced Salieri by mistake. As a person from Galway, a county that is putting forward its bid to become the European Capital of Culture in 2020, and given that Galway city is synonymous with events such as the Galway Arts Festival, the Macnas parade and the Cúirt festival, I would find it impossible to explain the importance of the arts to the very fabric of Galway and the west, and to the entire island of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102"> I agree that the arts needs more money, support and programmes to be put in place, but most important of all it needs to be valued. The Government will do all it can to increase funding to the arts. Likewise, I will do everything I can to ensure we deliver on that commitment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1103">I welcome today's debate. I am a music technology graduate and I completed a master's degree and graduated in September 2008. We all know what happened at that time. The outlook was bleak for anyone who came into the artistic field at the time, given the economic challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">Obviously, I pursued careers in different circles and did not think I would be standing here today speaking on the subject. However, I welcome the thrust of the motion to the effect that funding will be increased as the economy grows and develops and as it now is in a recovery, this is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105"> Another personal facet is that I take part in short films and I am a short film actor. I have worked on many projects in Limerick and note that festivals there, such as the Richard Harris International Film Festival and the Limerick Film Festival, are in their infancy. They have been held over the past three or four years. They are now growing and should be supported. Such festivals should also be supported because of the economic development they generate. To share a story, I remember how, when I travelled to Australia in the 1990s in the pre-Internet era, the likes of U2 or the Cranberries were the medium that could market this country. Every time one spoke to somebody, particularly in that age group and in popular culture, the first thing they would mention was U2 or for Limerick in particular, the Cranberries. That could be heard in every place to which I went. However, the Irish do it better than anybody else when it comes to scenes or generating music movements. Consider what was done with Riverdance 20 years ago, where they mixed popular culture with traditional culture and Riverdance was born to modernise and change the face of Irish dancing. It is a scene that continues to stand the test of time, whereas other scenes in popular culture have come and gone. Consequently, I reiterate the Irish do it better than anybody else. Deputy Hildegarde Naughton should note I will be slightly tribal by stating Limerick obviously also has a bid in for 2020. It has my full support, having worked on it as a county councillor and now as a Deputy. I again welcome the Government's move regarding the €70 million tax break for films and note Troy Studios is coming to Limerick, whereby economic adversity was turned into an artistic opportunity that now has Limerick at the forefront of film-making. Hopefully, some major projects will be welcomed into the area.</p>

          <p eId="para_1106">I thank Deputy Niamh Smyth and wish her the best of luck in her role. I thank her for bringing this important motion before Members this evening. I also acknowledge all the creative people among us and it is great to see the Gallery so full. I am approaching this issue from the perspective of somebody who is involved in a volunteer capacity in community theatre. A discordant note is creeping in regarding the Minister's capabilities, which I find a little disturbing to say the least. This is the same Minister who, since taking up office, has fought the good battle for the arts at the Cabinet table. Members should remember the horrendous recession we have come through. Moreover, she has won every battle she has fought by finding within her the characteristics she needs at the Cabinet table to fight for the arts. I reassure Members and those present in the Gallery that they have a champion for the arts here. She has set her mind to finding money to increase the budget for the arts and it has increased since she took office in 2014. The Government is well aware there is much more to be done but in the partnership for Government agreement, a commitment has been given that there will be increased investment in the arts during the coming years. The Minister herself initiated the capital funding programme that will be opened up this year and which I welcome as a person involved in community arts. I am involved in a theatre and arts centre myself in Birr and I note additional funding will be put in place for such arts venues and regional cultural centres nationwide, which will be able to get some capital funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107"> The title of the Department has been bandied about. I will read into the record the actual title, namely, "the Department of Arts, Heritage and Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Development". That is it; there is no downgrading of the arts and I am satisfied this will not be the case. The clock is against me but as a final point, the arts always has been in a Ministry with other Departments and Deputy Catherine Martin referred to this. When it was part of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, was sport prioritised over the arts because it was in there too? Was tourism prioritised? No, it was not. The relevant Minister fought the battle for the arts, for sport and for tourism in the same way as this Minister will fight the battle for the arts. I have every confidence that she will do it and reassure everybody in this regard. I also ask people to please depersonalise this issue and to focus and work together on what is important to us culturally. The arts are what we are and Members must work together to ensure they can deliver them for all the people from the cradle to the grave.</p>

          <p eId="para_1108">I welcome the opportunity to conclude the debate and wish Deputy Niamh Smyth well in her new role. As has my colleague, I also welcome the visitors in the Gallery. When one thinks of the arts, one thinks of music, song, dance and laughter but it is a serious issue. The arts are a part of our showcase to the world and are part of our culture, who we are and from where we came. It is a part of our legacy to our children and grandchildren and to our history. Many Deputies have spoken of their commitment to the arts, either professionally or in their spare time, and the Minister has taken note of the comments and the ideas as food for thought.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109"> The recent economic crisis, which thankfully we now are putting behind us, was fought and fought hard. It was a fight to keep the country on track and to keep it solvent in order that as it recovered, the Government would be able to focus on the really important things that society demanded, not just the economy, be it in health, education, housing or indeed the arts. A country's soul, as well as its pockets, must be looked after. No one would try to argue the arts were immune from the financial crisis, as all sectors were touched. However, I believe the previous Government did its best to try to insulate the sector as much as it could. It recognised the key role of the arts in their own right and as an important economic, educational and tourism driver for Ireland. In common with all Members in this Chamber, I want the new partnership Government to provide for the arts to an even greater extent than was the case in previous years. While I note there has been much talk about cuts to funding, one need only consider the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, which expects its budget for the next year to be cut by almost 6%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110"> The narrative here is different, as funding has been increased for the past two years and the Minister has given a commitment to continue that as the economy continues to recover. The Minister is experienced and while she is in a much larger Department that includes the arts, she is the senior Minister and has taken a special interest in the arts and the potential for them to be a real driver in regional development and rural renewal. As part of this newly enlarged Department, this is something with which everyone must engage and about which they must think in a positive light. Much of the debate has focused on Arts Council funding and departmental funding but it is about a lot more than that and cannot just be about the elite; it must be about everybody. I welcome the Minister's comments in the House earlier on exploring the establishment of a cultural unit within local authorities. In my native County Meath, a fantastic number of people work within the arts, often for little financial reward, and they must be at the forefront of any new establishment and there must be funding to support them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111"> To conclude, in my new role as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I look forward to engaging with service users and older persons networks about the therapeutic benefits of the arts, of which there are many. Much good work is going on in this area already and during my time in this role, I look forward to working with these groups and to developing opportunities for mental health service users and older people to express themselves while making a contribution to society.</p>

          <p eId="para_1113">I am delighted to have been afforded an opportunity to speak briefly on this important business and I thank Deputy Niamh Smyth for bringing this motion before the House. First, I acknowledge the many constituents who have contacted me and who are quite disillusioned by the effective dilution of the arts as a Cabinet portfolio, many of whom have devoted themselves throughout their lives to promoting the arts both locally and nationally. The dilution of the arts portfolio is a cheap two-fingered salute to those who have devoted so much time and effort to the arts industry. This is not a personal criticism but that said, I compliment the Minister on her role in overseeing the 1916 commemorations nationwide. For a country that once was to the forefront as the leader in the promotion of both the arts and culture internationally, the negative effects from paying insufficient attention and due care to this area can now be seen. However, I am delighted that my party has taken the initiative to improve the situation. I believe the proposals before Members get the balance just about right. The proposal protects the independence of the arts community, while allowing for and enabling full community engagement and benefit from State arts funding.</p>

          <p eId="para_1121">I thank the Minister for her news about cultural units within our local authorities. That comes as very welcome news. Culture, as we know, covers such a multitude of things and is probably the proper term when we are thinking about the arts. I would like the Minister to consider extending that. As she said herself, she saw the work on the ground of the local arts and education partnership. I compliment the Minister on the support she gave to the Cavan-Monaghan pilot project. I ask her to also consider rolling out those local arts and education partnerships nationally. We only have 16 education and training boards in the country and it would go a long way in terms of the engagement of the Department of the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Education and Skills and the Arts Council. There is much to be gained from that because it has great value. I thank the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122"> I thank all those in the Gallery and all the artists and representatives of the creative industry who have sat through this two and a half hour debate. I hope they feel it has been a fruitful debate. I thank the Members who contributed to the debate today and all who came to watch. Fianna Fáil did not put this motion before the Dáil on our own behalf or for any political purpose. It is for a broader, deeper issue at stake, namely, our country's art and culture. Support for, understanding of and empathy with the arts should be intrinsic. It should be built into a republic. The arts, and I speak of the broadest expression of our culture including our heritage and popular culture, should be accessible and available to all our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123"> The arts are not a luxury, rather they are a necessity. People who have no voice in the public conversation look to artists to express their thoughts. Art is another sense, another language and another way of thinking. Without it, there is no way to live a full life. No wedding, funeral, or other important point in life can be passed or punctuated without the conscious setting of art. So it is with the State, which time and time again looks to the artists to mark its great days, and so it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124"> This Republic was founded out of events led by patriotic people for whom culture and the practice of the arts was central to themselves and to the movement they led. One hundred years later, artists were again called upon to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising. Once again, artists did Ireland proud. What could have had the texture of blandness or a sheen of false pomp was invested with the grit of truth by artists who, in every art form, are truth seekers. That is what artists are in society. They seek new insights to say what cannot be articulated. They seek to articulate what cannot be said.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125"> Today in Dáil Éireann, many Deputies across the Chamber have conveyed what is being said by artists outside the Chamber and across the country. The increasingly intense public conversation among artists, their presence here today in such numbers, and the articulation by so many artists, arts organisations and the National Campaign for the Arts on their behalf of a profound sense of alienation from the State is striking. In a Republic that is alienated, that is an indictment. Years of cuts took their toll on a sector that at the height of State spending was only beginning to see levels of investment that had long been the norm across western Europe and elsewhere. What I find striking when talking with artists is their profound disillusionment with the disengagement of the Government from culture, from the arts, from any objective or outcome that is not a key performance indicator and from any conversation that is not a photo call. In the Government of their country, the country that beckons and calls them as required, there is no empathy, no feeling and no champion for the arts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126"> In this centenary year, during the anniversary and jubilee, as of old, the country's artists were called to its side but even before the curtain came down, the Government stepped in to switch off the lights.</p>

          <p eId="para_1128">Yet artists feel as if the show had served its purpose because it is the only show. There is no deeper feeling, no underlying purpose, no sense that art - unlike elocution lessons or jewellery - is not an accessory of status and is emphatically not an accessory of power. Art is a republic. The Republic proclaimed in 1916 is an authentic expression of people. It is a voice that cannot be scripted by government. It is an energy that cannot be contained, but it is the controlling urge to script and the political need to contain which has effectively shunted Irish artists off the political stage. This is the most diverse Dáil in the history of the State but, shamefully, in the organisation of this Government, we have had the least consideration for the arts for a generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129"> It is the truth that artists articulate themselves with anger, certainly, but also with determination. It is that determination that has brought so many artists and arts organisations to speak with Deputies from around the country over the recent weeks. It is that determination which brings us here today. Across the great majority of the House, outside of Government, there is solidarity with artists. There is a political understanding that the role of the Government in relation to the arts should be supported to champion but not to control. The agenda of control is insidious and, pointedly, it is still on the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130"> One of the worst attacks on the integrity of the role of artists and of the role of culture generally was the insistence of the last Government to bring the governance of several of the national cultural institutions under the direct control of the Department. The disrespect and the contempt of that agenda continued seamlessly through the disregard shown for the arts in the formation of this Government. This diminution of the arts and of any wider sense of what our culture has given our people is sadly underlined by the entire abolition of heritage from any role in the mission title of the responsible Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_1134">The mark of respect - the actual doing, not just the saying - that I propose on behalf of Fianna Fáil which I pledge to implement is that the cultural policy of the State will not be handed down from above. It will not arrive from a Government Department as a <i>fait accompli</i>. It will be an outcome of a democratic conversation here in the Dáil, the people's assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135"> I say to the arts organisations listening here in the Gallery and watching online around the country, that Fianna Fáil, with others across the House, will ensure that their voices are heard. Those who are expert and who have made it their lives' vocation to be artists will lead in forming Ireland's arts policy, Culture 2025.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136"> The proposal my party will make to our colleagues on the Oireachtas committee is that they as individual artists, as companies and as resource organisations, including Dance Ireland, Theatre Forum and Visual Artists Ireland as well as the National Campaign for the Arts, will be invited and will be heard. We will turn to the Arts Council, whose role includes that of giving advice. It is time we sought advice. It is time we listened to advice. It is a pity it was not done sooner, but it will be done now. That is our promise and our pledge today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">In his speech in the Kennedy Centre on 17 May last, at a gala celebration of the best of Irish arts, the Taoiseach quoted President John F. Kennedy who said, one month before he died: "I see little of more importance to the future of our country and our civilization than full recognition of the artist". I did not serve with Jack Kennedy; I did not know him. Alas, he was not a friend of mine. However, Deputy Enda Kenny is no Jack Kennedy. That night's event in the Kennedy Centre was the Taoiseach's first public engagement with our arts and culture since his re-election to office on 6 May. It was his first outing abroad since the centenary of the Rising and the reduction of the political space for culture at the Cabinet table. It was an unwitting showcase of the unimportance of the artist for the Fine Gael Government. The treatment of artists as performers who provide a backdrop but have no further function could not have been more insensitively or cruelly juxtaposed with the glamour of the occasion in Washington.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138"> Today, we are here to begin to right that wrong. We are here to put in place arrangements whereby artists will be the leaders of our cultural policy. The Thirty-second Dáil can, and I believe it will, ensure that artists are reinstated as the leaders of our cultural policy.</p>

        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_263">
          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1142">I move the following Revised Estimates for the justice Vote group:</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">ICT capital is €34 million, including the first tranche of the capital investment plan of €205 million. I thank the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform under the stewardship of the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, for the work relating to the development of that ICT infrastructure, which was so essential. In total, €330 million, including €205 million under the capital plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda Síochána to deploy the latest cutting-edge technologies in the fight against crime. Having this type of coherent ICT plan in place is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144"> In respect of building capital, €50 million is provided for the contractual costs of the construction of three new divisional headquarters as well as a refurbishment programme of stations throughout the country. This was agreed last year and a priority programme was developed in conjunction with and dictated by An Garda Síochána which identified the stations in need of refurbishment. As I have already said, we have the new builds as well. </p>
          <p eId="para_1145"> A total of €6 million was invested in the Garda fleet. This was to ensure that we had a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet. This will continue under the capital plan 2016-2021, which provides €46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that gardaí can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime. This is in addition to €34 million already invested in the fleet since 2012 with more than 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015. This must continue and accelerate because the need is out there. It has been clearly identified that we need to replace the old fleet and continually update the fleet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146"> The Government has consistently made it clear that it would fund whatever measures were needed for An Garda Síochána to best tackle the critical and unprecedented challenges they currently face. The provision of additional funding in the current year is essential in the context of the challenges that An Garda Síochána is currently facing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147"> These additional moneys are made available based on information from Garda management regarding the level of funding required to maintain the necessary policing response to the current situation on an ongoing basis. This will allow for the kind of concentrated policing targeted operations we need. It will allow for the continuation of the continued intensive and strategic targeting of burglaries and related crime through ongoing support for Operation Thor. We are getting very good results from that. It shows that a specific operation that is very clearly targeted on a particular issue, which is the way of modern policing, gets results. It will also allow for continued support for measures against international terrorism. I have just come from a meeting with the Garda Commissioner and her senior staff where we discussed the interoperability of the various databases and Ireland's situation regarding that interoperability, which is so essential to manage international crime, cyber-crime and terrorism. It is essential that we update the databases we have because we are behind in respect of this. The provision of immediate additional funding is both necessary and welcome but the Government is also committed to ensuring that An Garda Síochána is well resourced and capable of providing a strong and visible police presence throughout the country well into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148"> The programme for a partnership Government commits to continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000. In accelerating recruitment, we must ensure that we have the resources for proper training, support and supervision when gardaí leave Templemore. Mistakes were made previously when high numbers entered Templemore but we did not have the necessary supervision and training. This has been identified in both the O'Higgins report and the Garda Inspectorate reports. At the same time as these investments are continuing, the Commissioner has announced her own programme of reform, better management and change management within An Garda Síochána. This is essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149"> My Department is engaging with the Public Appointments Service as a matter of priority in respect of the preparation of a recruitment plan for the next five years that will deliver increased numbers of gardaí without any compromise in respect of the quality of those recruited or the training programme. Work is under way on increasing civilianisation and where appropriate, identifying the number of gardaí carrying out duties that could be taken on by civilians. I have been alerted by other police forces to the need to do this in a very careful way so that the right jobs are freed up and this is handled appropriately. The Garda Inspectorate identified 1,500 jobs that it felt could be freed up in this manner but An Garda Síochána does not agree with this assessment. We are having ongoing discussions to look into the numbers where we can move forward in respect of civilianisation. We are committed to increasing the recruitment of civilians to provide expertise in relevant administrative areas and free up gardaí for front-line policing duties. We will replace the gardaí working in Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport with civilians at the end of the year. Advertisements appeared in newspapers recently in respect of that ongoing process and the process has already happened at Terminal 1.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150"> Deputies will appreciate that increasing resources alone will not defeat the scourge of gang-related and associated crime that currently impacts parts of our cities and country. We need a comprehensive range of measures, including legislative measures to combat the threats from serious and organised crime. We will have a dedicated Garda armed support unit for the Dublin area, which is in the process of being set up. The Garda Commissioner has recently announced the establishment of a new Garda special crime task force under the drugs and organised crime bureau to augment the response to organised crime at a local level through concentrated policing and through a multi-agency approach to targeting the proceeds of crime. The impact of international co-operation cannot be stressed enough. At the recent EU Justice and Home Affairs Council in Luxembourg, I met bilaterally with Ministers from Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium to discuss international co-operation and how it could be pursued further to deal with organised crime groups operating in those countries that impact Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_1151"> An Garda Síochána is working closely with community representatives in the north inner city. A programme relating to that task force will developed over the coming weeks. More consultation must be carried out, as the House has been informed, but that will develop over the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152"> I have already spoken about ongoing civilianisation. Deputies will see that I have addressed this in more detail in the speech that has been circulated. I am conscious of the time. </p>
          <p eId="para_1153"> I wish to alert people to the work that is being done in the prisons in terms of the prison estate and the money that has been put into that. Further work needs to be carried out in Portlaoise and Limerick to bring the estate up to the appropriate standard. Substantial refurbishment and extension work is being carried out in seven courthouse venues in Drogheda, Letterkenny, Limerick, Wexford, Cork, Mullingar and Waterford. Deputies will be very pleased to see a new development where a site has been acquired at Hammond Lane for the development of a new family law court complex. This is urgent and work has begun on the planning for that new service there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154"> As Deputies will appreciate, there is much that is taking place in the justice and equality sector. I am grateful to my colleagues in Government, particularly the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his officials for their support for the necessary additional funding for An Garda Síochána. I look forward to support from this House and a constructive debate on these Estimates.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_25"> I welcome the opportunity to present the Revised Estimates for 2016 in respect of the justice Vote group to the Dail. That Vote group is made up of eight Votes with a combined gross expenditure allocation of just over €2.458 billion in 2016. The net expenditure allocation is €2.2 billion.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_26"> I will give the House an overview of the main expenditure areas across the Vote group but before getting to the specifics I should say I am pleased with the funding level available to the sector in 2016, an increase of over 6% on the corresponding Revised Estimates for 2015. The Government recently approved substantial additional funding to An Garda Síochána which is reflected in the Revised Estimates currently under discussion. An additional allocation of €55 million will be made available for the remainder of 2016; this includes the €5 million announced in February. This funding comprises €40 million additional Exchequer funding plus €15 million which will be funded from projected savings based on analysis of expenditure trends elsewhere in the justice and equality sector. The €15 million savings within the justice Vote group will be reassigned to the Garda Vote in a technical measure later in the financial year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_27"> The gross expenditure Estimate for the Garda Síochána, Vote 20, is €1.55 billion which amounts to 64% of the funding for the entire Vote group. The Estimate for 2016 also includes an amount of €6.644 million carried forward from 2015 under the capital carryover provisions. Before the recently announced additional funding of €55 million, the 2016 Revised Estimates Volume, REV, published last December included increased funding of over €71 million compared with the original REV for 2015 after taking account of adjustments for non-recurring costs. Thus, the total additional funding for the Garda Vote in 2016 will amount to over €126 million by year end. Even allowing for the gross Supplementary Estimate of €43 million, €35.2 million net, for 2015, there is an overall increase in the Garda Vote of €83 million in 2016.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_28"> The main expenditure items include pay at €971 million, including an overtime budget of €91.5 million by year end.</summary>
        <speech by="#JimOCallaghan" eId="spk_264">
          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1155">I welcome this opportunity, which is my first one, to speak on the justice Vote group Estimates. Each year, this State spends a considerable amount of money on those elements within the control of the Department of Justice and Equality. It is extremely important that the elected Members of Dáil Éireann have an opportunity on behalf of the citizens who elect us to consider those Estimates and ensure that this significant amount of money is spent carefully and effectively on behalf of the people of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156"> It is instructive to note that the justice Vote is the fourth largest ministerial vote in terms of budgetary allocation. Only social protection, health and education exceed it. The total gross Estimate for justice for next year is in the region of €2.4 billion. It is important that we know where that money is being spent. It is also instructive to note how it is apportioned between the different elements under the control of the Department of Justice and Equality. The significant majority of the expenditure goes on the Garda Síochána, which accounts for some 63% of the total Vote. The Department of Justice and Equality, in terms of its management, accounts for 16.73% of the Vote. The prisons account for just over 13.5% of the Vote. In many respects the Courts Service is the poor relation, accounting for 4.5% of the Vote. There are also some other elements such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Policing Authority and the Property Registration Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157"> I will start by referring to the Estimate for the Garda Síochána. As the Minister has indicated, the expenditure in respect of the Garda Síochána is in the region of €1.4 billion for 2016. There are some aspects of the expenditure I wish to highlight. I note the expenditure that has been increased in respect of the Garda Reserve. We do not emphasise enough the potential of the Garda Reserve. It is an aspect of policing and assisting policing in this country that could be increased and improved and could be relied on more by the gardaí and the State for the purpose of less important policing activity. I am pleased that there was an increase in the amount of money available to the Garda Reserve. However, I would also like to see an increase in recruitment to the Garda Reserve and greater reliance placed upon it. </p>
          <p eId="para_1158"> The document in respect of the Garda Síochána also identifies key outputs and public service activities in a number of matters concerning the Garda. One which I wish to refer to is the number of new recruits commencing at the Garda college. I welcome that the output target for 2016 is 600 new recruits, which is a considerable improvement on the output target of 2015. It is also noteworthy, as the Minister has said, that overtime allocation for Operation Thor has increased and it appears to be effective. The money appears to be well spent and we are getting a return on it in terms of the overtime, which is having an impact on burglaries and related crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159"> The Minister indicated today and previously that there has been an increase in funding for the Garda Síochána and, as I and my party have done before, I wish to welcome that additional funding. An additional allocation of €55 million is to be made available for the remainder of 2016, including €5 million that was announced in February. The funding is made up of €40 million in additional Exchequer funding plus €15 million to be funded from projected savings based on analysis of expenditure trends elsewhere in the justice and equality sector. However, it should be pointed out that until the Supplementary Estimate of €40 million was announced, the Garda budget on the current side was set to fall from €1.446 billion in 2015 to €1.421 billion, which would have been a fall of €25 million. It appears the extra €40 million announced on the current side means a net increase of around €15 million compared to the outturn in 2015. Notwithstanding that, we welcome the additional funding. We believe that further additional funding may be required in due course if we are to ensure that the policing strategy in this country is effective in terms of fighting crime in Dublin and throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160"> The Vote for the Policing Authority, as a percentage of the money we spend on the Garda Síochána, is minuscule. All that is provided for in the Vote is €2.64 million. I do not criticise the amount being spent, nor do is say it is too low, but I wish to emphasise that the Policing Authority is an authority that can be used by the State to ensure we get greater oversight of the Garda Síochána and improvements in management and supervision. I hope to see the Policing Authority driving through some of the necessary changes in the Garda Síochána that the Minister and most other Members of this House recognise are required. One of the requirements of the Policing Authority in the coming year is to publish a code of ethics for members of the Garda Síochána. I welcome that important development. The role of the Policing Authority, acting as oversight for the Garda, is something we should examine and ensure that it is carried out effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161"> The Vote for prisons in 2016 is €318 million. Some useful information is provided in the documents furnished by the Department with regard to the prison Vote, not only in respect of the prison capacity but also in respect of those who are on structured temporary release. I welcome the provision of this information. I also welcome the likely dramatic decrease in the number of prisoners without 24-hour access to in-cell sanitation in 2016. The 2015 output target was 285; the 2016 output target is 80. We have to ensure there is that level of humanity in how we treat our prisoners. I note that the qualitative statements of outputs and activities recorded in respect of the 2015 output target place stronger emphasis and focus on motivating sex offenders and violent offenders to participate in appropriate offence or behaviour-related programmes. We need to do more than motivate; as time progresses, we need to ensure that individuals who are in prison for serious offences are required and mandated to undergo such training. </p>
          <p eId="para_1162"> It is also instructive to note that we still have serious addiction issues in respect of prisoners in prison. The number of prisoners who received opiate substitution treatment such as methadone in 2013 was 1,922. In 2014 this rose to 2,305, which is approximately 12% of our prison population. It indicates the problems we have with drug abuse and the drug problems that prisoners have, which we need to tackle in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163"> I previously described the Courts Service, perhaps unfairly, as the poor relation, but all it gets is €63 million under the Vote. Notwithstanding that, the output from the courts is commendable and deserves to be recognised. With regard to the number of sittings of the Court of Appeal and the High Court as well as civil sittings, the output target was 4,700 in both 2015 and 2016. In view of the fact that we only have 45 judges in the Court of Appeal and the High Court combined, we can see that there is a considerable amount of work being done. Work is being done at a considerable rate. It is noted in the Revised Estimates that the target is based on the maximum possible number of court sitting dates and the availability of a full complement of judges. One of my concerns is that for over six months there have been vacancies in the Court of Appeal and the High Court which need to be filled in order to enable judges to deal with the entitlement of citizens to get their cases heard quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164"> Another point that should be made in respect of supporting the Judiciary is that Ireland, although not unique, is in the minority in that we do not have a judicial college in this country. That is something that is being explored and that we need to move further on. </p>
          <p eId="para_1165"> Of the €350 million allocated to the justice and equality Vote, a considerable amount of money is devoted to ensuring we have an efficient, responsive and fair immigration system. That is something we need to work on, because the delays in it are too long. We need to ensure that the system becomes more effective and user-friendly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FionaOLoughlin" eId="spk_265">
          <from>Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1166">I will try not to cover ground already covered by Deputy O'Callaghan. My party welcomes the additional funding being provided for law enforcement this year. The Ireland for all that we campaigned for this year is one in which communities are protected. A strong community is a safe community, and keeping homes and streets safe from crime is a core priority for our party, which requires increased resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">The confidence and supply arrangement that Fianna Fáil has agreed with Fine Gael provides for an increase in Garda numbers to 15,000, investment in CCTV and mandating the Policing Authority to oversee a review of the boundaries of Garda districts and the disbursement of Garda stations, all of which were key priorities for my party in the recent election. We certainly will be vigilant in monitoring the delivery of these commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168"> Regarding the need for more gardaí to work on front-line duties, building on the findings of the Garda Inspectorate report, there is a clear need to ramp up the use of civilian staff in the force to alleviate the burden of administrative duties on gardaí. New workforce planning and outsourcing of certain non-essential duties that do not require a sworn officer would certainly help free up gardaí to get them back on the beat, visible in their communities and directly tackling crime. In one station in Kildare last year, more than 5,000 passport applications were signed at 20 minutes each. This is not a good use of Garda time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169"> Strong community relations are the bedrock of an effective police force. However, the imbalance in community gardaí across the country is damaging local links to the force. We need to cover all Garda districts to ensure that a community garda is based in each area with strong links to the local community. For example, County Kildare does not have one community garda. How can resources be so misappropriated when, for example, Bray has 13 community gardaí?</p>
          <p eId="para_1170"> In relation to Garda stations, the closure of the stations in Ballitore and Ballymore Eustace in my county has been devastating and the resulting burden that has been placed on the remaining resources is far too onerous. Currently, the ratio in Kildare is one per 697 persons, while the national average is one per 335. This is wrong. There is a significant potential threat in the future following the closure of rural Garda stations. It is the wrong policy as it jeopardises the security of countless communities and homes. The decision to extinguish the blue light of the local station sent a clear message to criminals that resulted in a wave of burglaries hitting cities, towns and villages around the country, and while there was a decrease nationally of 2.2% in theft and related offences, the rate of such crimes has doubled in my county. The paltry savings from these closures, which I understand amounted to €500,000, did not justify the deeply damaging impact on the communities they served. As a party, we believe there should be a Garda Inspectorate report on the 139 station areas to gauge the impact of the closures and make recommendations on whether each station should be reopened or, in cases in which the building has been sold, a new station established.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171"> We also believe there should be a new victims' law and a victim surcharge. The victims of crime need to be fully supported. Too often, the justice system appears to be balanced in favour of criminals and repeat offenders while ordinary people who fall prey to criminality are left unrecognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172"> I have a few points on the equality aspect. I would draw the Minister's attention to the International Protection Act 2015. The Estimates provide for the commencement of this Act as an output target. Last week, of course, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission raised this issue and called on the Government to move without delay in implementing in full the recommendations of a steering group on reform of the direct provision system. I note the statement by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, that several of the recommendations would be provided for and commenced later this year. When will this happen? When will the sections be commenced? The Act was passed before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173"> When will the proposed family leave Bill be published? The Estimates provide for its enactment as a 2016 output target. We have a paternity Bill this week, but is further legislation planned for publication and enactment this year? Finally, on other strategies promised, I would appreciate if the Minister could be specific on when we will see the new LGBTI strategy and new Traveller and Roma inclusion strategies.</p>

          <from>Deputy David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1178">I will not take the full 15 minutes. First, I apologise to both the House and the Minister on behalf of an Teachta O'Brien, who was not able to make it for personal reasons. Obviously, the Deputy would have been here if he could, and he asked me to raise a number of points on his behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on these figures today. One of the issues that an Teachta O'Brien asked me to raise with the Minister was that it would have been preferable for these issues and the Estimates to be dealt with at the justice committee, as has been the case in the past. I am a member of the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, which was attended today by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, who spoke about the Estimates in his Department. That was done at committee level. As a matter of good practice, it is a better way to deal with these issues. Deputy O'Brien asked me to say that from the outset.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180"> I welcome the additional €40 million being given to An Garda Síochána. We all have been crying out for additional resources for An Garda Síochána for many years. Those of us who were in opposition for years and those who are now in opposition, along with those in government who wanted to spend more money in this area but could not at the time, can all welcome the fact that this €40 million of additional funding is being made available. I also note that a further €15 million will be reassigned to the Garda Vote from elsewhere within the justice group in a technical measure later in the year. It is essential that the Minister stipulate exactly where the additional €15 million is coming from. It would be madness - there would be no point - to rob Peter to pay Paul, if Members will pardon the pun. We need to see where else exactly within the Minister's overall budget this funding will come from.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181"> I also note that there is an allocation of €875 million in capital funding for the justice sector alongside multiple public-private partnership, PPP, projects. My party's position on PPPs is a matter of public record and we would question the wisdom of significant PPP investment in much-needed infrastructure when the record of delivery in this area has been far from ideal. The PPPs will be used to develop Garda projects, yet we have not received any real detail of what these projects are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182"> We have also called on numerous occasions for money seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau to be ring-fenced and channelled back into the communities that are most affected by crime. Indeed, this was Fine Gael policy in the early 2000s, yet it never happened. I note as well that an important meeting took place between the Taoiseach and representatives from the inner city area of Dublin to deal with the real issues of criminality in that community, but also the issues of disadvantage and underdevelopment and the need to invest in these communities. Would that not be one way of doing so, and is there any reason it has not been done in the past? As I said, it was formerly a policy of the Minister's party. It would make sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183"> Apparently, an investment of €205 million has been allocated for the new Garda Síochána technology systems, but the anecdotal evidence from gardaí on the beat is that they are still using their own mobile phones on occasion to communicate. If additional funding has been allocated for new technology systems, that should not be happening. The Minister might comment on that as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184"> Irish justice policy has been characterised in the past by waste and an illogical and unproductive emphasis on imprisonment when the State would have been far better to invest in crime prevention measures and schemes that have a demonstrable effect on reducing reoffending. We acknowledge that there have been some moves in this direction in recent years and we were supportive of those moves when they were put in place by the previous Government, but there is still scope for significant improvement in this area. There are large numbers of people who end up in the criminal justice system who would be far better off receiving assistance from the social work and health care systems. I am not talking about those who are involved in the big crimes. I am not talking about the drug lords or those at the heart of the criminality that is terrifying people on the streets of Dublin. I am talking about the lower levels of crime, where it need not always be about imprisonment. It is about adopting more creative ways of dealing with offenders, but also more productive ways and ways that benefit both the person who has offended and the State. As I said, I acknowledge the good work that has been done in this area, but we have an awful lot more to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185"> Preventative measures that work will reduce crime. Knee-jerk responses have never worked. Snappy soundbites do not work. I have seen far too much of that in the past. I am not accusing the Minister of this, but I have seen many former Ministers for justice beat their chests and talk tough when it comes to crime, yet the real action does not happen and the resources are not being put to their appropriate use.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">Politicians jump up and down and create much noise but unless it is backed up by resources and sound policy, that is all it amounts to. We need to see proper outcomes. Increased funds should be directed towards preventative measures, including investing in early intervention where there is systemic social and educational disadvantage, in conjunction with spending on supports to reintegrate former prisoners which are also key to crime reduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187"> As I stated, I will not take the full 15 minutes but I am sure Teachta Jonathan O'Brien will raise various other issues with the Minister in due course.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_271">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1188">I am sure the football lovers in the House are very grateful to Deputy Cullinane for his succinct presentation. I begin by agreeing very strongly with Deputy Cullinane on the mechanism for dealing with this issue. I am conscious that on this occasion I probably have an advantage over most people in the House in that I was involved in the construction of these subheads. The forensic process in committee is the way to go; it is the way this has happened over the past number of years and it has been very beneficial. All we can do in a debate like this is give a few general observations, without discussion back and forth. No doubt later in committee we will have the opportunity to deal more forensically with these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189"> I will deal, if I can, more thematically with some of the issues I intend to develop with the Minister, I hope, over the coming weeks, months or perhaps even years that we have in this Dáil. I begin with An Garda Síochána. It will come as no stunning shock to the Tánaiste that I have a very deep interest in the reform agenda. I warmly welcome the new Fianna Fáil spokesperson in the equality area to the debate and I paid very careful attention to her contribution. I ask people to think outside the box on all these matters. There is the notion that more is good, no matter what; it is as if I say we should have 15,000 gardaí and another Deputy argues there should be 16,000 gardaí, the latter argument is better. We really need to get objective analysis of how many gardaí we should have, what they should be doing and where they should be. I know colleagues from the Deputy's county have told us repeatedly there is no rhyme or reason for the number of gardaí in one Garda division as opposed to another. It is a matter of history and the disposition of Garda stations, as determined in the 1920s. We should have logical and modern analysis of how we deploy a force, the type of force we deploy and equipment given to that force. I classify that as smart policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190"> We need to move away from the notion that with the number of Garda stations, no matter what it is, the more, the better. Surely the way we deploy policing in 2016 must be different from the way police forces were constructed in 1928, when members were on bicycles and did not even have telephones. My constituency has endured much burglary but that was done by organised gangs moving out of Dublin on the new motorways, and I suggest that it is a big part of the impact in places like Kildare as well. Therefore, operations like Thor - instanced by the Minister - are having an impact. We should move to smart policing to provide the type of equipment and information and communications technology that is required. Over time I hope to be able to develop those ideas with the Minister and work in consort with her. That is as opposed to the knee-jerk reaction that the old way we did things must be defended, and when we go to a public meeting, we must all say "Yes, let us do it as we have always done".</p>
          <p eId="para_1191"> I am specifically interested in hearing what the €40 million is to be used for. There is €55 million but, as Deputy Cullinane noted properly, €15 million will be made in savings. Will the Minister instance where she sees those projected savings? They may or may not materialise, so there may or may not be €55 million at the end of the day. We should note that. There is community policing, smart policing and the role of the Garda authority in ensuring we are objectively making the right decisions, and not because there is local pressure in one geographical area over another. I wish I had more time but as I do not, I will move to a number of other items.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192"> I know the House has focused on the north inner city and we must know what are the justice inputs into the new task force. Will the Minister tell us? I have repeatedly asked for the information and, bluntly, I have not got it. I raised the matter with the Taoiseach and on Leaders' Questions with the Minister, Deputy Bruton. I do not know the structure of the new task force, how it is to be funded and the justice input for it, including the resources the Tánaiste expects to deploy. When will we see it up and running?</p>
          <p eId="para_1193"> I will briefly touch on the courts area, an issue that has already been raised. In the programme for Government, the parties and Independents in government promise an annual study on court efficiency and sitting times. The programme promises legislation to reduce excessive delays to trials and court proceedings. What exactly is envisaged by an annual study? Was that a sop? Who will cause the study to happen? Access to justice is an enormous issue for people, and many people feel intimidated by it. I received a letter today from a person who cannot even get legal advice; that person tried to get it but was told it would take €750 that the person does not have to get it and begin a process of getting justice. We must have a system of justice that is affordable and accessible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194"> I do not say it in trying to be discordant but the notion that our free legal aid system allows a Deputy paid triple the average industrial wage to get free legal aid means people do not have confidence in the system. We must ensure people genuinely denied access to justice can have a system working for them. I want to see the courts working in a way that is efficient, working and providing access for ordinary people. I want to hear what the annual study envisaged in the programme for Government is to be, who will carry it out and what the reform in the area will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195"> With regard to prisons, we require a proper and accountable body, independent of the Department of Justice and Equality, to run our prison system. It should be a new and independent prison agency accountable to the Oireachtas. We had this discussion when debating a very fine Bill produced by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan relating to putting the parole board on a statutory basis. There should also be a new legislative framework to give the prison system statutory independence. That would be really important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196"> I will move to the probation and welfare service. I know Deputy O'Callaghan called the courts system the lesser beings in this great debate but everybody always characterises the probation and welfare service as the Cinderella service. It is a very important service that could do an enormous amount more than it is doing, keeping people out of prison and reducing recidivism. In speaking to people who have run the prison service, they can almost identify the schools from which they will see their clients of the future. With those in the system, they can tell who will be back again and again. That is a failure so if the probation and welfare system was reconstituted and underpinned by new statute law, it would have an enormous role to play in giving a different role model in providing justice for people and ensuring there will be fewer people in the prison system and recidivists going through revolving doors in prisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197"> In the few minutes I have, I will mention direct provision. My colleague Senator Ó Ríordáin, a former Minister of State, drove the McMahon report as hard as he could. I acknowledge that very good progress has been made and the personal commitment of the Tánaiste in this regard. I have discussed the matter with her and heard her views. I know she feels strongly about it because this is the issue for which we will be held accountable in a decade for what we do in our time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">Although there were 173 recommendations from the McMahon report, and I understand about 140 of them have been implemented at least partially, we need to ensure that all of them are fully implemented and that they are fully resourced. We need to ensure that we provide a service and a support base to this vulnerable category of people living in our community, of which we should be proud, that we would expect to have ourselves in the awful event of Irish people needing that kind of support in another country and that we would expect our families to get if they were in desperate need of support. They are not getting that in the direct provision that we have collectively provided as a people over the last little while.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199"> On 15 June, I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of funding for the Women's Aid 24-hour helpline. It was on foot of the very shocking facts - I do not want to use the word "statistics" - about violence against women in particular - domestic violence in the home. That is just the domestic violence that has been reported. So much goes unreported. Women are brutalised in their homes, behind closed doors and closed curtains, and they live in fear with their children. We need to ensure this is addressed. The very basic first step would be the provision of a 24-hour helpline. In response to my raising the issue on 15 June, the Taoiseach promised to investigate. I believe he was truly sympathetic, but I want to know what has happened on that matter. Has that resource been provided? It is a very basic resource. People who are in that dreadful situation - women who are terrorised in their own homes - should at least be able to pick up the phone and know they can talk to somebody on a 24-7 basis and that there is someone there to answer that call. That is the least that is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200"> I want to mention two other brief matters before I conclude. The Garda authority is something I have sought for more than a decade. I produced legislation on that in the first years of this decade. I note that €2.5 million or €2.6 million has been allocated to the Garda authority. It is really important now that it is not only resourced but allowed to do international studies and look at best practice internationally, and that it is listened to in terms of implementation. I am very confident, because of the personnel selected to serve on the Garda authority, that it will certainly not be ignored. However, I want to hear that it will be the driver of the reform agenda that has been advocated by a number of independent groups, most emphatically the Garda Inspectorate itself, which is hugely detailed in the report it has compiled and the analysis it has done. There will be significant resistance to change. I can tell Members that as the Minister who was charged with reform for five years at the worst of times. Everybody sees the requirement for reform elsewhere, but very few see the requirement for reform in themselves. Bluntly, as the economy recovers, the <i>status quo</i> will reassert itself and the propensity to resist change will grow. We need to ensure the changes that are outlined actually happen and that all of us - this is what I said to my new Fianna Fáil colleague - approach these matters with an open mind. It is not simply a matter of doing business as we always have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201"> My very final point relates to the capital programme, because there is a need for significant capital investment on the justice side. We tried to provide that in my own time, with very scarce resources, through both PPPs and direct Exchequer funding. Deputy Cullinane, who is gone, was very critical of PPPs. He was critical of the delay. I will give one concrete example, if Members will pardon the phrase. Originally there was a programme of work last year that was envisaged to be a joint PPP for both courthouses and Garda stations. I decided to divide this into Garda stations and courthouses, to see which would be the quicker, and actually the two were almost identical in terms of delivery time. Obviously the cost would be different, but that must be aggregated over the building's lifetime of 25 years, during which all maintenance, repair and so on will be provided, as in the school system. I would be cautious about PPPs, but we need to do a proper evaluation in a situation in which we have very scarce resources and the choice is between providing a facility and not providing it. We do need the family courts, the forensic lab and all the other things about which I know the Tánaiste will be knocking on the door of my successor. She would now have my very strong support on the need for resources to do these much-needed things.</p>

          <p eId="para_1205">I will have ten minutes and Deputy Healy will have five minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206"> If one looked at it on paper, one would say an additional allocation in this budget is very welcome indeed. I want to query some of it, specifically the additional budget in relation to the Traveller initiative, where funding has been increased from €855,000 to €2.2 million. If I am not here at the end to hear the Minister's answer, I will check back on it tomorrow, but in 2015 the National Traveller Partnership budget of €1.2 million came through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. This year, that funding stream was transferred to the Minister's Department, along with the national network funding, under the scheme to support national organisations, SSNO, which is normally allocated to the Irish Traveller Movement, ITM, the National Traveller Women's Forum and Pavee Point. That was also transferred to the Department of Justice and Equality and is approximately €200,000. This would mean that the difference between what we did have for Traveller initiative funding and what we do have may be made up of a transfer of funds from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the Department of Justice and Equality rather than extra funding, because the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government would have spent the €1.2 million on the National Traveller Partnership budget and €200,000 on the National Traveller Women's Forum, the ITM and Pavee Point. Is this increase on paper, or is it a real increase and not just a transfer from one Department to the other? Does it, for example, include funding for local-based national organisations under the National Traveller Partnership, which was previously under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and has now been transferred to the Department of Justice and Equality? We know there were previous claims of great increases in spending in the area of Traveller funding. For example, it was said that the housing budget was increased to €4.2 million. The Minister could say that is not directly her responsibility, but she is the Minister responsible for equality and Travellers tick all the boxes in suffering extreme inequality in this society. That €4.2 million was lauded as a great step forward in terms of funding for Traveller accommodation, but in fact it was not acknowledged that funding for Traveller accommodation in 2008 was in the region of €40 million. That lack of acknowledgement of what the Department is coming from and going to makes things look good, but in fact they are still very dismal. They still seem to look dismal for Travellers from a spending point of view, and the cuts implemented on the Travelling community during the austerity years were indeed - practically everybody with a heart in them acknowledges this - the most vicious, the deepest and the most heartless that could possibly have been made to any aspect of society. The Travelling community took most of the hits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207"> I will give a couple of examples of the withdrawal of State funding over the past five years. Inter-agency activities were cut by 100%. I was on the Local Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, LTACC, on Dublin City Council for Traveller accommodation, and at the beginning we very much relied on the inter-agency model. Traveller education was cut by 86.6%. One may as well just tell the kids to go home and play on the site, because there is no point in educating them. Traveller accommodation lost 85%, equality lost 76.3% and the Traveller organisations were cut by 63%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">The Minister is probably saying to her officials that this is not her brief, but her brief is equality, and the most vicious, inhuman and cruel of these cuts have deeply increased inequality for Travellers <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of society. Travellers tick all the boxes for low life expectancy, low infant mortality rate, poor health and poor educational attainment. The suicide rate among Traveller men is 17 times that of the suicide rate in the rest of the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209"> There has been an extraordinary level of disinvestment by the Irish State in the Traveller community. One of the most striking cases is the fact that statutory agencies did not even spend what was allocated to them. In the years when I was on the LTACC, there was a housing underspend of several million euro in a period when Travellers, like the rest of the population, were going through a housing crisis. Many Travellers were in private accommodation and - again, like the rest of the population - lost their accommodation because of soaring rents and ended up in homeless agencies. The underspend on health in that period was 18%. On equality, it was 28% and on accommodation, it was 26%. Much of this may be from the budgets of different Departments but, ultimately, the Minister is responsible for equality and we need to look carefully at what has happened to the Irish Traveller movement, particularly in the years of austerity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210"> We also need to think about how we are going to address it. How, for example, will we restore special assistants to Traveller children in normal mainstream schools? Two special assistants were cut from a school in Bluebell. They just disappeared because there was no budget for them but the school takes on the bulk of the Traveller population from Ballyfermot and its surrounds. Many of these people end up doing very well but not because the Minister's Department or the Department of Education and Skills are any great help to them. It is because of the dedication of teachers and parents and the determination of the children themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211"> The Cabinet needs to address Traveller accommodation, given the terrible tragedy that happened last winter when five young Travellers lost their lives in a dreadful fire. The State needs to look at this on an equality basis, not on the basis of throwing a few crumbs here and there. It needs to address the deep inequality that exists. Later on in the year, we hope to pursue this by pushing for legislation that recognises Traveller ethnicity and would legally bind the State to deal with them on an equal footing to the rest of the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212"> I have a question on the integration, asylum and migration budget. As I understand it, it remains the same as last year, at €1.5 million, but we are supposed to be taking in extra refugees from Syria and war-torn and famine-stricken areas. This does not match up to any commitment we give to asylum seekers coming into the country. There is a slight increase in the immigration budget but that may be just to help the Irish immigration service, run by An Garda Síochána, to process people faster. Does it really deal with delivering a budget that will help us look after the needs of asylum seekers and their families? </p>
          <p eId="para_1213"> These are a couple of things which I find challenging in the Estimates and I would like to hear the Minister's answer to them. I may be moving slightly outside the Minister's brief but she is Minister for Justice and Equality and holistically responsible for all the issues to do with the lives and livelihoods of Travellers. The lack of equality for Travellers ends up on the Minister's lap and we need to address it to stop visiting desperate inequality and tragedy on the Traveller community.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1214">I welcome any increase in the justice budget, particularly an increase that goes to the Garda Síochána. However, there is serious discontent on a number of fronts within the force, not least within the area of pay and conditions of employment for members of the gardaí and for industrial relations generally. The swingeing cuts of the past number of years to pay and conditions of employment have undermined individual gardaí and their families and their ability to properly and fully carry out their functions in protecting the public. That has not been helped by the reductions in Garda numbers of up to 2,500 members, initiated by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government, which introduced the moratorium on recruitment and the non-filling of vacant posts. That reduction has heaped huge pressure on the gardaí as they try to fulfil their role in society. I acknowledge the commitment in the programme for Government to raise Garda numbers to 15,000, but there appears to be no timeframe for that. Perhaps this is something the Minister will address in her response to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215"> The situation I have outlined has been raised publicly by the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors. They rightly demand that the area of pay and conditions of employment be addressed urgently, particularly the two-tier pay system now in place in An Garda Síochána, which should be abolished forthwith. There is also an issue with the pay of Garda recruits and there should be an immediate reinstatement to the pre-2008 attestation salary for all new Garda recruits. The salaries were arbitrarily cut by 10% by the last Government and new recruits now have a basic wage of little more than the minimum wage. They have lost the rent allowance of €4,017, which was always recognised, by the Conroy Commission and others, as being part of core pay. The cuts to pay and conditions must be reversed to ensure there is proper support for members of the Garda Síochána and proper policing within the State. The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors has already indicated that it will not be engaging in the modernisation and reform programme 2016-2021, announced recently by Commissioner O'Sullivan, until the whole question of pay and conditions is satisfactorily concluded. It points out that there are 100 reforms within the modernisation programme and these cannot be implemented without consultation with, and the co-operation of, the various Garda bodies, the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors in particular. It is time for gardaí to have the right to be represented by a trade union and to have all the rights associated with trade union membership, including the right to take industrial action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216"> I wish to raise one further issue, to which I intend to return on another occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">I am not quite sure whether the Minister herself, her officials or senior management in An Garda Síochána understand the devastation being caused by the illegal drug trade, and not just in places such as Dublin. In every town and village and at every crossroads in this country, drugs are easily available. Families are being absolutely destroyed by the trade. There is a focus on this in the Dublin area at the moment, and rightly so, but there are equally serious problems throughout the country. For instance, parents are being forced to pay the drug debts of their children. It has also contributed to significant rates of suicide among young males. There must now also be a focus on local areas and regional and local drug task forces. There needs to be a zero-tolerance approach to the issue, not just in the bigger cities such as Dublin but in every town and village and at every crossroads where these drugs are available throughout the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1219">Yes, it is 50-50.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220"> I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute briefly on the topic of the Revised Estimates for the Tánaiste's Department. It has been widely reported that the €55 million, including the additional moneys and the money from savings in the Revised Estimates, is directly in response to the recent spate of horrendous gangland crimes and murders in the city. The Tánaiste promised on 8 June last that she was committed to funding "whatever measures were needed for An Garda Síochána to best tackle the critical and unprecedented challenges they currently face".</p>
          <p eId="para_1221"> I am a member of the committee making arrangements for the new committee on budgetary scrutiny. I hope that when the budget committee is established, it will, along with the Department of Justice and Equality and the justice committee, have a strong relationship in assessing the Estimates for this Department and getting the best performance outputs. </p>
          <p eId="para_1222"> I welcome the Tánaiste's commitment to increase the number of gardaí to 15,000. Does she intend to have another recruitment campaign this year? It is quite clear that the numbers in many areas of An Garda Síochána, such as the traffic corps, have been allowed to deteriorate severely, which has had a negative impact over the lifetime of the last Government. This has to be remedied. I welcome the resources that are being put into An Garda Síochána - or are promised to be put in - in central Dublin in the dedicated Garda armed support unit, and the other initiatives she mentioned. As stated by another speaker, I also hope the mini-CABs, which the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have previously referred to, will be able to utilise the resources seized by the State to provide necessary social infrastructure in areas such as the centre of Dublin and areas of my constituency where there has been gross under-investment in such facilities. </p>
          <p eId="para_1223"> The Tánaiste also stated that the additional funding would be used by An Garda Síochána to continue Operation Thor, which has been quite successful and reports to the Joint Policing Committee. I repeat that I welcome the committed attitude of senior gardaí to our local joint policing committees, in my own case in Dublin city and Fingal. I also welcome the additional resources being provided across programmes A to E. In programme B, there have been reports that there is a shortfall in the number of scientists necessary in the critical forensic investigation agency for it to do its important work. Has the Minister plans to remedy this shortfall? I noted also that under programme A, Leadership in and Oversight of Justice and Equality Policy and Delivery, 2015 and 2016 target outputs include the continued implementation of medium and long-term recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate in relation to the fixed charge processing system. In programme B, A Safe and Secure Ireland, there is reference to the context and impact indicator. </p>
          <p eId="para_1224"> This year, 2016, is currently shaping up to be one of the worst years for road fatalities in a number of years, with 83 lives tragically lost as of Monday, 20 June, this week. The figure has increased by 17 compared to the same time last year. Yet the Revised Estimates and the Tánaiste's contribution barely mentioned the need to address all the areas of administration in respect of creating a safer road traffic environment. I know there are many competing aspects in trying to keep our citizens safe, and certain areas have to be prioritised. However, when one looks at the resources that have been cut from An Garda Síochána's traffic corps during the austerity years, there seems to be a clear correlation between those cuts and recent spikes in the number of traffic deaths. The strength of the dedicated traffic corps was 741 in 2015. We do not yet have the figures for 2016. The number of traffic corps personnel in 2014 was 749, in 2013 it was 811 and in 2012 it was 877. There has been a significant cut. The number of vehicles allocated to the traffic corps was also reduced from 295 in 2014 to 258 in 2015. This is clearly an area that the Tánaiste must address as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225"> We also mentioned in a previous debate the unbearable criminality in the centre of our capital and the impact of the closure of stations, including significant stations in Dublin, and the reduction in Garda station strengths. These are important factors in the impact of the cuts on crime prevention. In her replies to me, the Tánaiste often stated that all members of An Garda Síochána take on traffic and road safety duties at times. However, the reverse is also true in that there are instances in which traffic corps personnel are redeployed for significant periods to other duties and cannot fulfil their primary function.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226"> The Tánaiste has reported that €205 million has been made available to An Garda Síochána for much-needed ICT. I noted with interest that in the recent O'Higgins report, issues with the PULSE system were highlighted. Improvements in this area have long been championed by the road safety group PARC, Promoting Awareness, Responsibility &amp; Care on our Roads, and its indefatigable leader Ms Susan Gray. I have tabled many parliamentary questions over the years regarding the failures of the PULSE system and its lack of interoperability with the operating systems of the courts and the RSA and other systems necessary for the safe policing of our roads and communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227"> Most recently, I requested further information on the new hand-held devices reportedly being made available to gardaí on the beat. Unfortunately, no information was available from the Tánaiste's Department, so it remains to be seen whether these devices will also be stand-alone devices or whether the Garda Síochána Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, launched by the Commissioner and mentioned by the Policing Authority - I wish An Garda Síochána well with it - will address the serious deficiencies in the Garda ICT system. I remember, as will the Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, when we contacted Garda stations and they had no e-mail facilities. That was not a long time ago; it was only three or four, perhaps five, years ago. They were not online.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228"> It was in the media last weekend that the Tánaiste brought a note to Cabinet about section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, providing for the introduction of a third payment option for the payment of fixed charge notices. I hope that is something that will proceed. Will that be dealt with under different legislation or will it be dealt with externally to the road traffic Bill that is to come forward? Given the severity of the number of deaths and casualties on the road, does the Tánaiste intend to progress the road traffic Bill before this House reaches the recess? Those were the reports and, of course, the Tánaiste is working with her ministerial colleagues, Deputies Ross and Donohoe, on the introduction of the third payment option, which I have long been calling for.</p>

          <p eId="para_1230">I understand one of the main barriers to a quick and seamless introduction of section 44 was and is the IT systems of the stakeholders. When will they be updated?</p>
          <p eId="para_1231"> I heard a Fianna Fáil Deputy speak on vacancies and so on in important courts. However, the experience of the Courts Service in respect of road traffic law has come across as incredibly inefficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">The Courts Service, especially regarding road traffic law, has come across as being incredibly inefficient and, in some instances, as with the recent disclosure about the NCT and the prosecution of people who had paid their fixed charge notice for not having an NCT certificate, it sometimes seems that the actual problem lies with the Courts Service and not with An Garda Síochána. The media sometimes does not show that clearly enough, and it is something that perhaps the Minister could address. I welcome the additional resources for the Department and for An Garda Síochána, and I hope, particularly in the area of road safety, that those resources will be deployed to very good effect.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_281">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1233">This Revised Estimate is for a very wide-ranging brief, and one could really spend an awful lot of time discussing all the ins and outs of it. However, I want to focus on the programme expenditure titled "An efficient, responsive and fair immigration, asylum and citizenship system," which - according to the Estimates presented to us in this programme - has an increased projected budget of 25% from €116 million to approximately €145 million. Of the €145 million allocated, there is an increase in expenditure for asylum accommodation by €17.2 million, yet there is no breakdown of where and how this money will be spent. I hope the Minister will provide a breakdown to the House to show exactly where this money is going.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234"> Despite this increase, there is no indication that additional staff numbers will be provided, which leads me to question the Minister’s claim that reform of the asylum system is under way. Last week the Minister confirmed that the Department of Justice and Equality has implemented 91 of the 173 recommendations from the working group report. However, the Minister has again provided very little detail in her reply to me on the recommendation, and we are still no better at understanding how in fact she has implemented those recommendations. All that the Minister provided in her PQ reply was ticks in boxes marked "implemented." The budget simply does not match the level of reform that the Minister claims has been carried out. Sufficient funding is central to any reform programme. The McMahon report stated that a failure to invest in decision-making staff will inevitably lead to significant backlogs in case processing and a consequent need to accommodate ever-greater numbers in direct provision, “with all the attendant concerns”. I do not need to go into what is meant by "attendant concerns" because it has been well documented how degrading it is for people in long-stay direct provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235"> I acknowledge that certain changes were made in terms of the provision of staff resources, including the extensive changes to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal membership, with a new panel of members appointed during late 2013 and 2014. However, it did take time to appoint and train the new members, which inevitably affected the tribunal’s case processing capacity. Additional resources were also provided for the establishment of Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, including an appointed legal panel of 20 persons to deal with the backlog of cases, with 4.8 internal staff assigned to sign off on decisions alongside an additional 16 support staff. There has been an increase in the direct provision weekly payment, the first increase since 2000, which raised child benefit by €6 per week to a rate of €15.60 per week, but it fell short of the rate of €29.80 recommended by the working group. These attempts are far from the recommended allocation of resources as set out in the report of the McMahon working group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236"> The working group undertook and costed a financial modelling exercise which included a long stayer solution effectively granting the 4,207 persons who have been five or more years in the system, leave to remain in a speedy, effective manner on a legally sound basis. The group also costed the introduction of a single procedure which is underway with the passing of the International Protection Act 2015. Despite a commitment from the Government for an additional budget allocation to deal with demands on the asylum and immigration systems including backlog cases identified in the report, there are huge concerns regarding the capacity of the various authorities charged with making decisions on protection applications. Without the extra resources the benefits of the single procedure in speeding up the processing of applications will not be achieved, especially as the number of applications may increase over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237"> Reducing time spent in the system will see a reduction in the numbers in direct provision, a reduction in the pressure put on accommodation needs and will bring large savings to the State which can then be reinvested in integration and child benefit for asylum families. Each year a person remains in the system it costs the State an average of almost €11,000 for the provision of accommodation. Today in the Estimates, the provision of an additional €17 million for asylum accommodation is an indication of the increased pressure on the existing protection system. While addressing the accommodation needs is absolutely necessary, it is a reflection of the fact that little reform has been carried out on the asylum system as a whole. Huge savings could be made if the recommendations were properly implemented. Again the working group has calculated potential savings as some €194 million over five years. That number justifies the expenditure of €135.4 million over the same period and which is required to fund the recommendations the Minister claims her Department are undertaking. The additional €135 million in costs are broken down between improvements to the protection process of costing €14 million, improvements in living conditions in direct provision accommodation centres costing €69 million and improvements in supports to applicants costing €52 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238"> A reformed system would see increased staffing to facilitate speedy processing of applications, meaning less reliance on direct provision, less pressure on the direct provision system and more scope to increase social welfare allowances etc. The financial modelling exercise demonstrates conclusively that investing in decision-making not only yields returns in reducing time spent by a person in the system, but also makes financial sense. A lack of reform in the protection system might cost the State more money in the long run, but the human cost from the failure to act will be too high. It is the asylum applicants and their families who will pay the greatest price in this system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239"> I will now turn to issues relating to crime statistics and the resourcing of the Garda which is vitally important in dealing with the upsurge in gang related crime across the State. However, we also need to talk with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Education and Skills to focus on funding diversionary projects for young people in communities that are at risk of high levels of crime. These areas have suffered successive cuts over the years and things are at a standstill now in the probation services, juvenile diversion programmes and community service orders. These creative type programmes can deliver and divert young people, especially young men, away from crime. This is vitally important in looking to the future and ensuring we can divert people away from crime. While it will not deal with the current crisis it means that we would not be looking at other crises further down the road.</p>

          <p eId="para_1241">One can never over-emphasise the importance of the partnership between An Garda Síochána and the community in continuing to prevent and detect crime and maintaining a safe environment for everyone. The role of our police force is of vital importance to us as a civilised society. The Garda Síochána Inspectorate report Policing in Ireland states that "community policing should be at the heart of policing in Ireland". Community policing is a term used to describe the process by which the police engage with the community in the prevention of crime. At its core is the recognition that by working with the community in voluntary organisations such as community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes, law enforcement agencies can find local solutions to local problems. Community policing provides people in an area with their own dedicated garda. International studies have shown that community policing has many benefits. It helps develop a positive attitude towards police, it reduces crime rates and fear of crime and it discourages anti-social behaviour. As a result of both parties working together towards shared goals, the flow of information between the police and the community is enhanced, which results in better implementation of crime prevention and crime control.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242"> The dedicated community garda provides a reduction in fear of crime, peace of mind and a feeling of safety and security for the community at large. In rural communities particularly, the local garda builds a strong and supportive relationship with young and old in the community. The role of the local garda in the community alert group, where the community and the garda join forces in being vigilant in their concern for the elderly in particular, is of huge importance. In recent times, the additional dimension of the text alert scheme has proven to be of enormous benefit in detecting and preventing crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243"> Former Garda Commissioner Fachtna Murphy has said that it is essential that the community remain at the heart of everything An Garda Síochána does. He believed the community to be the Garda's greatest ally in preventing and detecting crime and protecting the safety of the people they serve. However, the decision of the subsequent Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, to close 139 Garda stations nationwide was in direct contradiction of this belief. That was a very retrograde step for policing in Ireland, and one that will have serious repercussions in future years. These stations were closed largely as a cost-saving exercise, but we subsequently learned that it costs only €60 per week to keep a rural Garda station open and that it is costing the OPW more to have them closed than when they were operational. We know that the closure of 550 rural police stations in 13 counties in England over a ten-year period led to a rise in crime, and rural crime rose by 60% compared with 35% for the country as a whole. The rise in crime was directly linked to the closure of the police stations in those areas. In January of this year, CSO figures showed a rise in rural crime here in Ireland, yet there is still no plan to reopen the stations closed in 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">It is vital that we recognise the huge value of the dedicated garda in our small communities. It is here that the potential for much criminality can incubate in the absence of effective policing. The rural stations act as a filter for crime, nipping petty crime in the bud before it escalates to a more serious level. We must remember that the raging forest fire started with a single match.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245"> The role of the Garda needs to be considered as a matter of urgency. It is paramount that the Garda Síochána is seen as a force to protect the innocent and vulnerable against all kinds of crime, rather than a force to generate revenue in the form of summonses and fines. Using the Garda Síochána as a revenue-generating source is a very foolish and short-sighted approach to policing, which will inevitably lead to a them-and-us situation. We want at all times to ensure that the public sees the Garda Síochána as a strong and effective force, completely on the side of the law-abiding citizens whom it is their role to protect and support. Based on all the evidence to support the importance of community policing and the role of the community garda, I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to reopening all rural Garda stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246"> In respect of Garda cars, the average Garda car in larger stations clocks up approximately 50,000 km per year. When the car reaches 300,000 km it is taken off the road. These cars would be approximately five or six years old. I would suggest that when a Garda car has 250,000 km on the clock, it should be given to the smaller stations, where it would do in the region of 5,000 to 10,000 km per year and would last a number of years in the station. These cars could then be used by the gardaí in these rural stations.</p>

          <p eId="para_1247">I want to highlight what has happened in my neck of the woods, in Sneem and Lauragh. Sneem, which always had two gardaí and a sergeant, is reduced to a part-time garda who is only available for an hour now and then. At certain times of the year the population of Sneem trebles and more, with an influx of visitors from all over the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248"> Lauragh Garda station was closed down two years after €300,000 had been spent on it. Lauragh is 17 miles from Kenmare, the nearest Garda station on the eastern side, and 20 miles from Castletownbere, the next nearest Garda station. The Minister should review that and see how wrong it was to do that to the people on the southern side of Kenmare Bay. The people of Sneem are 17 miles from Kenmare Garda station, 30 miles from Killarney Garda station and 37 miles from Cahirciveen Garda station. It cannot be right that the entire area is not properly policed and gardaí are not visible on the ground. They do their best and come from the nearest Garda stations now and then, but it is not enough. In that vast expanse of Kenmare Bay, all the piers along each side of the bay are open now for the delivery and importation of drugs. There is nothing in the world to stop it because the drug runners will know that when the Garda car is parked in Kenmare, Killarney or Cahirciveen it is not in Sneem or Lauragh or along the bay. I ask the Minister to review that decision urgently and put a full complement of gardaí into Sneem Garda station and do likewise in Lauragh for the protection and safety of the people, because it takes too long for a Garda car or presence to arrive when something happens.</p>

          <p eId="para_1249">I am delighted to speak on this Estimate. I welcome the Minister and I am delighted that she was reappointed to this portfolio. She has made a vast improvement since she took it over. We have a very sanitised relationship with her, as does the Garda Síochána, unlike some of her predecessors, the one previous to her especially.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250"> We need a Garda Síochána force. We have been proud of it since the inception of the State. Gardaí cannot police without the support of the public. That has been recognised all over the world. I salute An Garda Síochána, the men and women who go out every day of the week on front-line duties and face all kinds of threats. That is not only in Dublin, as has been seen recently, although I welcome the impetus put into dealing with these marauding gangs of terrorists here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251"> The Minister met the people of mid-Tipperary last year. There are still pressures there. New recruits are coming out of Templemore and we are promised five in Clonmel in the next tranche of recruits. We need them badly. The numbers are on the floor in the Tipperary division. Under Chief Superintendent Catherine Kehoe and the superintendents in the southern half of the county we are at an all-time low, especially when members are out sick or on maternity leave or holidays. We need a visible presence. In our area there has been a community garda for the past few years, Garda Niall O’Halloran, and he is doing tremendous work. He is in the station. He is available, he is at matches and he is involved in the community alert scheme. We have text alerts set up with many groups and they know he is there. People have to know the garda. If they go in to get a form signed, a bit of information will be passed innocuously. This is not the informer. That taboo has to be banished. It is us standing up for ourselves. When people ask about the community alert scheme - I have been the chairman of my own scheme for years - I say “It is you and I looking after each other. If we do not look out for each other, nobody else can be expected to do so.” </p>
          <p eId="para_1252"> We need the numbers and we need the support. The AGSI and the GRA need to have negotiating rights and be allowed to have them and not be depending on some other group in talks to have a vote for them. They need full recognition and rights to negotiate for themselves and receive respect for their very dangerous occupation. We saw the murder of two gardaí in recent years. There are daily attacks on them. At protests here they are treated shamefully by some of the protesters, in the name of free speech and protest. I have witnessed them spitting at the gardaí and threatening them with all kinds of vile abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253"> I ask the Minister to visit the Garda station in Clonmel, the biggest inland town. It is a Dickensian station. There is a plan to relocate to the old army barracks, which we should never have lost. I ask her to visit and see for herself. There is an increased Estimate for the refurbishment and building of Garda stations. We badly need it. It is not fit for purpose and the members of the Garda Síochána deserve better, as do the public in Clonmel. Beidh fíor fáilte roimh an Aire i gCluain Meala.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254"> I also ask the Minister to look at the restorative justice project in Nenagh. It is a wonderful project. The gardaí visit the schools. Their involvement with Foróige and youth groups and the youth diversion projects is invaluable. They have been cut to the bone in recent years and volunteers are trying to carry on services where there is a limited number of staff. The Tipperary Regional Youth Service and the Waterford Diocesan Regional Youth Service are looking for projects and they are on the Minister’s desk. We want support for those because they do invaluable work in getting people involved at an early age, keeping them involved in civic society and having respect for institutions such as an Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255"> There has not been a superintendent in Cahir district for five or six years since Superintendent Duggan retired. There have been inspectors, and a very good one in Inspector Eddie Golden, but we need the superintendent level there because the stripping away of these services and officers is not acceptable. We also need a decent fleet. The purchase of the vans was a great idea because they are quite mobile and visible. They can also carry a prisoner and seized property or whatever. The fleet has improved in Tipperary, but we need more high-powered vehicles for the special units because, with the onset of the motorway, which is a great service for Tipperary, it is too easy for marauding gangs of thugs to maraud, attack and prey on families in rural communities an hour or an hour and a half from Dublin. Some years ago I asked that CCTV be put on the major junctions on and off the motorway and I was told it could not be done. We need that to monitor the kinds of people entering and leaving our county with bad intent. Visitors are all welcome to Tipperary - it should not be said they are not - but not these kinds of visitors. They are unwelcome and they must be hunted down and dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256"> We need a big shake-up in the court system and a review of free legal aid - one or two strikes and out. Ordinary people cannot be paying for these people to have free legal aid 20, 30 and 40 times.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">We must also examine sentences and the use of the Garda by sheriffs and other agencies. Homes are being seized with the aid of Garda time and resources. Homes should not be seized unless people have another to go to. Garda resources are stretched enough. I have come across a third force a few times. There is no room for that in this country. It has acted in different places, involving people with balaclavas, dogs and marauding people, while gardaí are nearby. That should not be allowed in any modern democracy. All we have are An Garda Síochána and the Army. We must not have a third force acting with balaclavas and intimidating and threatening people in the name of the law. That is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258"> I am all for supporting and resourcing An Garda Síochána. Above anything else, it has been cut too much. The traffic corps has been depleted. We need it on the roads, not as a money-raising effort but rather to watch those who are engaged in illegal activities and who want to carry out monstrosities and atrocities. </p>
          <p eId="para_1259"> As I said, we should have restorative justice. People should not be in courts and jail for non-payment of fines. Some unfortunate people incur fines because their businesses have gone into liquidation. Garda time is being used to bring to prison people who are let out a few hours later. Restorative justice and community service should be used if necessary. We want root and branch reform of the court and justice systems, alongside support for An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260"> I am glad Templemore has been reopened, but rebuilding Garda numbers to 15,000 will be slow. We should consider bringing back senior members of the force who retired over the past couple of years, particularly for special operations, because they have the knowledge, the expertise and, above all, the know-how. We need them to train new recruits who graduate from Templemore and can learn from experienced members. They have built up a significant repertoire of knowledge, expertise and know-how over service of 30 years or more. We should also re-examine the retirement age. I look forward to working constructively with the Minister, and I appeal to her to visit us in Tipperary as soon as she can.</p>

          <p eId="para_1261">I hope that by the time I have finished my speech we will have scored at least one goal. It is somewhat difficult to disconnect and be in the Chamber when one wants to be in front of a television.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262"> This is more like a Second Stage debate. It is unsatisfactory, and I am sure the Minister feels the same. We will all touch on various issues. The Estimates primarily deal with funding for the Garda, the courts, the Valuation Office, the National Property Services Regulatory Authority and so on. There is very little difference between 2015 and 2016 in the justice Estimates. In fact, on the salaries side the figure has decreased slightly. Pay rates were mentioned frequently during the general election with regard to gardaí, teachers and nurses. New entrants are being paid a different rate, something that is found by many to be very offensive, a view I share.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263"> The fact that the intake into Templemore was postponed for several years means that people who really wanted to be gardaí postponed their applications. Those recruited were not always those at the very early part of their career. Rather, an older cohort are applying to join the Garda. Sometimes they may have mortgages or other family commitments. We have to understand that not all circumstances are the same. Differences in pay rates have to be addressed. </p>
          <p eId="para_1264"> I refer to the very <i>ad hoc</i> method that appears to be in place in terms of the number of gardaí employed in any one division. I look at the policing plan every year. I constantly say that many aspects of it are a cut-and-paste job. It is refreshing that the new Policing Authority will have a real focus on that, because demographics and crime rates matter. I constantly update a document on where gardaí are deployed. Kildare is the worst, followed by Meath, Wexford, Laois and Offaly. The areas that have been subject to the greatest population growth are those that have the lowest ratio of gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265"> It does not appear that a strategic approach to policing is in place. This approach produces a reactive rather than proactive type of policing. Certain types of crime are not detected by virtue of the fact that they require proactive actions. Drugs offences, and sometimes motoring offences, would fall into that category. It is to be hoped that the initiative of the Policing Authority in terms of examining policing plans will help to deal with that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266"> I do not see a great deal of change in the budget. Perhaps we do not need change in terms of the amount of money that is spent; perhaps, instead, it should be spent differently. On the doorsteps on several occasions members of the force were quite critical of some of the equipment that was bought and said it would not provide them with the opportunity to do their job properly. There is no doubt that there will be some investment in IT systems, which is needed. We cannot have smart policing if we do not have the technology to implement it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267"> In my area there are some opportunity costs in terms of the low level of gardaí. I jokingly say that if the national average in terms of policing was as it is in Kildare, 4,800 members of An Garda Síochána could be dismissed. That is how bad the situation there is. I make that point in order to exaggerate so that the situation is understood. It is not acceptable. The opportunity cost means that, for example, there is no community policing in an area with a population of 210,000 people. The county of Kildare has quadrupled in population since 1971, something no other county has experienced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268"> I refer to the amalgamation of bodies such as Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Land Registry and the National Property Services Regulatory Authority. The latter did some very fine work. The Valuation Office could do with a little acceleration. I understand only four counties have been digitised. Revaluation has been an ongoing process since, I understand, the mid-2000s. Given that well over €1 billion was brought in in commercial rates - it is probably €1.25 billion - it is important that we accelerate the digitisation process. Some records are historical.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269"> I was intrigued to see that Land Registry fees are foregone in the case of bodies such as NAMA. If there are full recovery costs, would it not be better to build them into the process when something is being sold? We are selling assets to very large vulture funds, something of which I am very critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">The very fact that the State is forgoing land registry fees as well is perhaps not understood or factored into the cost. I am interested in hearing a response from the Minister in that regard because if we could bring in money in another way it would be useful.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_287">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1271">I spoke in the Dáil previously about how we need to look at what is working and not just at what is not working, so I will apply that to the discussion on the Revised Estimates. One must be careful with lies, damned lies and statistics, but at the same time it is an interesting body of material to go through for someone who is not directly involved. I wish to refer to the first statistic where, to my mind, things are working. When I was in government I was ashamed that at the time the prison population rose, but according to the latest statistics since 2010, we have gone from an average prison population of approximately 4,500 to 3,795. The Minister's response to my parliamentary question today indicated that the information is provided online on a daily basis. That is great news. It is something we are doing better. We do not need to go down the American route of a large incarceration system. It does not work and it does not reform people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272"> The Estimates process must examine how we can do things differently, not just keep doing the same. We must examine whether we can use some of the money we must have saved in that regard to change the prison system further and to provide for education and training and get young people out of a life of crime. That is the first thing I propose. We must endeavour to keep the number coming down. We should not stop there but try to be one of the best. It is interesting to look at the statistics. It is interesting when looking at the statistics that our prison population per head is similar to what it is in the North, so we are not out of line. It is not too low. One of the first things that jumped out at me is the good news that our prison population is falling and we should use the resources to help that continue to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273"> The Tánaiste and I probably first met in Dublin City Council in 1997 when I joined the city council. In that year 472 people died on the roads. The figures for last year show there has been a reduction to 166. Again, that is an amazing achievement for the State and it is done by thousands of small political decisions to put in a ramp here, apply a speed limit there and make a change to drink-driving legislation. We must keep going and aim to get the number of fatalities under 100. We must ask what it would take to achieve that, and to continue the example of where politics has worked. I say that on behalf of all of us. We have changed the nature of the environment to save between 200 and 300 people a year. That is just the fatalities, let alone the injuries, and the number of lives we have improved through that process. We should invest further the money the State has saved in terms of the lives saved. It is not always a case of just money; change can also be achieved by legislative means. We should be brave and willing to go for it and get down to zero fatalities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274"> The third area on which I wish to focus is an interesting one because it defies what we ordinarily hear. The journalist Vincent Browne is correct when he says the media has a tendency to paint a picture of an increasingly unsafe and insecure society. However, unless there is some major reason for a statistical change in how the CSO records the figures, as I read the statistics in the Revised Estimates report, the number of reported offences has fallen by 8% from 2012 to 2014, from 201,000 to 185,000. Again, we should seek to keep the trend going. The Minister will argue in the Estimates process for an increase in the number of gardaí. Deputy Catherine Murphy might be correct that there are certain black spots where we need to reallocate resources, but we should not be afraid to change instead of just sticking to the way things are. Where I would like to see the extra gardaí is involved in a range of community services rather than just processing a criminal-oriented, prison-based, punitive, fine-based system - creating a genuinely safer environment by bringing gardaí into the heart of the community and giving them advanced training so that we continue those positive trends. It is important to recognise that, because if we do not recognise success then what is the incentive for making more of whatever created the success in the first place?</p>
          <p eId="para_1275"> However, there are also things that we need to change. I will just pick three things at random out of the Minister's extensive Department in terms of how it interacts with our lives. First, in a response to a parliamentary question that I received today, it is stated that some 417 inmates are in prison on drug-related offences. I noted with interest a comment from the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, the former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, whom I hold in very high regard. Anybody who has been on the committee seems to think he did an excellent job in that role. He came out with a very strong statement - stronger than what I had heard previously in Government circles - that we need to move towards a decriminalisation process of the drugs system as a recognition that it is not working. It does not save us money. It costs us money and it does not reduce the amount of drugs being taken, so instead of imprisonment and the criminalisation process we should invest money in education and health supports. We must do things differently this time. We have the opportunity to be flexible and change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276"> I note the Minister has responsibility for the Data Protection Commissioner, which is a critical office in the future development of the economy. We have all the big digital industries here and we have only 50 people working with Helen Dixon, an excellent Data Protection Commissioner, following on from an excellent predecessor. In my experience of dealing with the Department, I do not think it was coming at it with the right attitude. It is coming with a very strong security protection focus in terms of getting as much data as we can and storing as much data as we can. I do not think the Department's attitude is in tune with where the digital world is going and where we need to place ourselves as a society and country. If the Minister is reallocating resources within the budget process, there is a case for further investment in the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and in making Ireland the best country in the world for citizen-centred data management and for building up trust in terms of how we share and use data, not based around excess Government control, which I sometimes feel the Department is slightly inclined towards, or corporate control, which the large corporations are inclined towards, in favour of a citizen-controlled system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277"> Finally, and where, to my mind, we must hang our heads somewhat in shame, I wish to speak about the nature of the asylum process, which, due to its extended period, is, in effect, incarceration. We do not allow people to cook for themselves or work, which has led to the creation of a system that is not serving us well and is not serving the approximately 4,000 asylum seekers in the system. It is expensive. The cost is approximately €140 million. If one looks at the accommodation and administration costs, it amounts to almost €33,000 per annum for each asylum seeker. The system is not working any which way and we must change it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278"> The other day on Leaders' Questions I argued that the choices the Minister must make should be discussed in July with the committee, because it is such an interesting and broad Department, in order to strengthen her hand in the budgetary process. I regret that I will not be able to be a member of the committee to take part in the discussions, because it seems to me that the Minister has one of the most interesting opportunities for change within the political system.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jackie Cahill<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1279">I welcome the additional funding being provided for law enforcement this year. I wish to reflect on the recent gangland shootings. There has been widespread outrage in relation to the recent gangland killings in Dublin and we need to see renewed efforts to defeat organised crime gangs before the situation escalates even further. In February, the Minister announced the provision of €5 million for a task force to tackle organised crime. Since then, unfortunately, we have seen more violent killings as the war between feuding gangs has escalated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280"> My party has consistently raised concerns about Garda numbers and resources. The force has been seriously depleted and starved of funding and resources are needed to ensure that it can effectively target criminal activity. We need a crime policy that is ahead of the criminals. We cannot allow the gangland feud to spiral further and efforts to defeat it must be intensified. It is important to show that law and order will prevail in society and that the gangs will be defeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281"> The concept of a Garda Reserve has proven to be an efficient way of getting more feet on the ground. We need to double the Garda Reserve to more than to 2,500 to complement and support the work of the main force and to encourage community engagement with policing. In addition, a special accelerated training scheme should be put in place for Garda Reserve members selected to join the main force to ensure they are put on the beat as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282"> I concur with other speakers who have called for an increase in Garda numbers to 15,000. Garda numbers have been reduced below the level of 13,000 by the Government and that, accompanied by the closure of 139 Garda stations, has reduced the effectiveness of the Garda on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">Reducing the force to such low levels jeopardises the safety and security of communities nationwide. The numbers of An Garda Síochána must be significantly increased to take the fight to criminals. The only way to keep homes safe and to protect communities is by increasing Garda numbers and to do this in as short a time possible. Rural Ireland has really felt the reduction in the numbers of gardaí and people's insecurity in their homes must be seen to be believed. More gardaí are needed to work on front-line duties and it is vital to get as many uniformed gardaí as possible working on the ground where they can be most effective. Everything must be done to relieve uniformed gardaí from administrative duties and get them back onto the street. There is a clear need to use civilian staff in the force to alleviate the burden of administrative duties on gardaí. This can be done by outsourcing certain non-essential duties that do not require a sworn officer and this would help to free up gardaí and put them back on the beat.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284"> The role of community gardaí must be increased. Strong community relations are the bedrock of an effective police force. However, the imbalance in community gardaí across the country is damaging local links with the force. All Garda districts must be covered to ensure that a community garda is based in each area with strong links to the local community. The closure of Garda stations has been the one major mistake, above all others, that has helped the criminals in their activities in rural Ireland in particular. In the past, when crime in rural Ireland was at a low level, gardaí were deployed in rural Garda stations right around the country. At present, however, while mobile criminal gangs travel the countryside in search of opportunities, it has been decided to close these Garda stations and this was a mistake. In my native county of Tipperary, one can travel from Nenagh to Tipperary town, a distance of 60 km, and find no Garda stations. This is a paradise for the criminal. The closure of 139 Garda stations and the potential threat to the future of other small stations throughout the country is the wrong policy, as it jeopardises the security of countless communities and homes. The paltry savings of €500,000 from the closures did not justify the deeply damaging impact on the communities they served. I assure the Minister that crime and the fear of crime in rural Ireland is changing the very nature of society and this cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285"> As for a new sentencing council, members of the public have doubts about the possible leniency of sentencing policy in the courts. Public faith in the justice system is an integral part of enabling the courts to do their job properly but inconsistent sentencing and a lack of information on decisions harms public trust in the justice system. The public also is frustrated that criminals are not held to account financially for their criminal activity. I believe that victims of crime must be supported. Too often, the justice system seems balanced in favour of criminals and repeat offenders, while ordinary people who fall prey to criminality are left unrecognised. I believe that criminals convicted of an offence should be expected to pay a victim's surcharge. This would be a charge to be paid by an offender after he or she had pleaded guilty or had been convicted. On the establishment of a national major crimes investigation team, I note that outside the capital, much of the Garda force suffers from a lack of expertise and resources in investigating serious crimes. It is necessary to invest in resources. If the Garda is to be given the best chance of defeating criminal activity, it then must be resourced properly. It is vital that the Garda is equipped with the resources and technology necessary to combat crime. As for the Garda fleet, a multi-annual vehicle investment programme will ensure the fleet is constantly upgraded and kept up to scratch to enable front-line officers react quickly and effectively. In short, resources are the key to fighting crime and Members must ensure that proper resources are put in place for this to happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_1287">I thank the Chair and Members from all sides of the House who have contributed to the debate on the Estimates this evening. In the first instance, a number of Deputies noted they would have preferred to have had this discussion in committee, where there would have been a more detailed opportunity to discuss the various issues and I agree. I believe the Business Committee decided that the major Estimates be taken here on the floor of the Dáil and certain other Estimates in committees but I have no doubt that we will continue the conversation and discussion that has been started here tonight in the Select Committee on Justice and Equality. I look forward to constructive engagement with colleagues on the various issues that have been raised. There has been a wide-ranging debate and that reflects the broad areas for which the Department of Justice and Equality is responsible, quite a number of which have been touched on during the course of the debate this evening. In general, it would be correct to state that the increased funding for the justice sector has been welcomed by most speakers in the Chamber. As I indicated in my opening remarks, the Estimates will be put to good use across the broad range of areas in the eight individual Vote areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288"> The reality, however, is that Members are having a discussion on these Estimates almost six months into the year to which they refer and therefore, spending is well under way across the sector within the various Votes and the spending is yielding results. A number of Deputies have reflected on this and in particular, I will mention Operation Thor as an example of the multi-strand national anti-crime and anti-burglary operation nationwide. Expenditure on Operation Thor has been reflected in the €31 million in Garda overtime spent in the year to date and in the allocation of more than €90 million for the rest of the year, which is intended to be sufficient to cover additional Garda overtime expenditure on a range of headings. Operation Thor has resulted in 24,000 crime prevention patrols, approximately 30,000 targeted checkpoints nationwide and detection of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling of stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. The financial provision is just one part of the Government's approach to dealing with criminal activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289"> In the short time available to me, I wish to address a number of points. Deputy O’Callaghan referred to a decrease in the Garda Estimate prior to the recent funding increase. That is incorrect; it already was ahead of the 2015 Revised Estimates Volume, REV, by €71 million when adjustments are made for a non-recurring additional payday cost of €26 million in 2015. I was asked for a breakdown in respect of the €55 million that has been announced and there is provision of €50 million for overtime, of €2.7 million for travel and subsistence and of €1.3 million for equipping the armed response unit. The gross budget for the courts is €110 million, less court fees of €46 million and the net Vote is €63 million. The Vote in respect of the Traveller groups does reflect the consolidated position on funding that previously was dealt with by other Departments. A number of Deputies have asked me about the savings within the justice group. The savings in question of €15 million represent approximately 0.6% of the entire Vote group allocation of €2.458 billion. While it is too early to pinpoint precisely the subheads from which this saving will come across the eight individual Votes, it is likely that the scope for such savings will be in the administration subheads, including payroll, where filling of vacancies does not arise as quickly as planned, due to the specialist nature of some posts in the Charities Regulatory Authority and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in particular, for example. Savings also will come from surplus receipts in the form of appropriations-in-aid. I reiterate there are no cutbacks in Garda spending. Expenditure across the entire Vote group will be monitored closely for the remainder of the year and the specific areas of underspending will become more apparent closer to the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290"> Quite a number of other issues were raised with regard to Garda resources. I already have made the point that I believe Garda resources must be allocated to areas of greatest need, that is, where there are increases in population or where there are crime trends of a particular type. My understanding is the allocations being made of Garda resources by the Garda Commissioner are indeed based on such criteria in respect of the new recruits who are coming out. There will be accelerated recruitment this year and as I stated, the Government has reopened Templemore and has started to invest once again in many of the areas about which Deputies spoke in the House tonight. Reinvestment in capital for the refurbishment of stations, including Clonmel, has been earmarked in the capital programme for investment in Garda stations, quite a number of which are being refurbished and extended. In addition, the Government will continue the investment in Garda vehicles. I will conclude on that point and will correspond individually with some Deputies who raised particular points I have not had an opportunity to discuss this evening.</p>

          <p eId="para_1296">I move the following Revised Estimate:</p>
          <p eId="para_1297"> Weekly personal rates of payment for all those aged 66 years and over were increased by €3 per week with proportionate increases on qualified adult and reduced rates. In addition, all of those eligible for the fuel allowance, including jobseekers and people with disabilities, gained from the increase of €2.50 per week, from €20 to €22.50 per week over the fuel season. Funding for the free travel scheme, which benefits a large number of people with disabilities, carers and pensioners, was increased by €3 million from €77 million to €80 million, to meet increased numbers eligible for the scheme, access new services and therefore fully protect entitlements under the scheme. I intend for this to continue. Families with children benefitted from a €5 increase in the monthly rate of child benefit while lower-income working families also benefitted from increases in the family income supplement thresholds. The respite care grant was renamed the carer's support grant to better reflect the usage of the grant and was fully restored to its previous maximum level by increasing it by €325 from €1,375 to €1,700 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298"> I will briefly discuss the area of fraud and control. It is essential that we maintain public confidence in the welfare system by vigorously tackling fraudulent activity. My Department implements a range of measures to prevent and detect fraud and also ensures that effective debt recovery and deterrence measures are in place. Data exchanges between the Department and other State bodies, including the Revenue Commissioners, are being enhanced on an ongoing basis. The Department is now acting on information received through these links in a timelier manner. For example, commencement of employment information from the Revenue Commissioners is now received weekly and acted on automatically and prisoner data are exchanged weekly. Predictive analytic projects on jobseeker, disability and one-parent family payment controls should result in better targeting of cases for review. Some 1.1 million reviews were carried out in 2015, achieving €463 million in savings, which was 91% of the Department's target. The target for control savings in 2016 remains unchanged at €510 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299"> Looking ahead, the programme for Government contains a number of commitments relating to social protection, such as increasing pensions and the living alone allowance, protecting free travel for pensioners and people with disabilities and supporting a rate increase for people with disabilities and for carers. We intend to reinforce the contributory principle of social insurance by strengthening the social insurance system. I intend to extend the treatments available under the treatment benefit scheme, which was significantly cut back during the austerity years. Importantly, I will extend the level of social insurance coverage available to the self-employed, in line with the agreement with Fianna Fáil as well as the programme for Government. This will form part of the Government's new deal for the self-employed which will encompass tax as well as welfare changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300"> I am delighted that the paternity leave and paternity benefit legislation is before the Dáil this week. It will be introduced by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on Friday next. I am sure Deputies from all sides of the House will welcome this innovation and, once enacted, my Department can commence the payment of paternity benefit from September to social insurance contributors, including the self-employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301"> This concludes my overview of the main areas of expenditure and associated activity for my Department for 2016. I look forward to hearing Members' views in the debate and responding to their questions in so far as possible.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_30"> That a sum not exceeding €10,872,429,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31 December 2016 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Protection, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund and for certain grants.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_31"> I am pleased to open this debate on the 2016 Revised Estimates for my Department. The Revised Estimates which are before the House provide for an allocation of €19.625 billion in 2016 for my Department. This represents 38% of all gross current expenditure. The major element of the social protection spending by far is expenditure on a wide range of schemes which are paid on a weekly basis. Each week, some 1.37 million people receive a payment from my Department. That is 2.1 million beneficiaries in total. It includes payments for pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and jobseekers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_32"> In addition, more than 625,000 families receive child benefit each month for almost 1.2 million children. The wide range of payments and services provided by my Department has an impact, either directly or indirectly, on the lives of almost everyone in the State. We also have a huge impact on the labour market. Payments or social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and are essential in providing adequate incomes to live. Social transfers freed over a fifth of the population from the risk of poverty in 2014, representing a poverty reduction effect of 56%, which is among the best poverty reduction effects in the EU.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_33"> It is not always fully appreciated in public debates as to who benefits from welfare expenditure. There is a misconception that most of the payments go to the unemployed. This is not so. Accordingly, as a starting point today, it is useful to outline the Department's expenditure on its various programmes in 2016. The biggest single block of expenditure in 2016 will be expenditure on pensions, which will amount to almost €7 billion or 36% of overall expenditure. Expenditure on working age income supports - including jobseekers, one-parent family payment, maternity and paternity benefit - accounts for some €4 billion or 20% of overall expenditure. Expenditure on working age employment supports, such as community employment, back to education and enterprise and various employment supports amount to €1.1 billion or 6% of the Department's expenditure. Expenditure provision for illness, disability and carers amounts to €3.5 billion or 18% of expenditure in 2016. Expenditure on children and families will account for nearly 13% of expenditure or €2.6 billion, of which €410 million will be spent on the family income supplement paid to low-income working families.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_34"> Expenditure on supplementary payments, agencies and miscellaneous services accounts for €867 million or 4% of expenditure. Supplementary payments have four main elements. These include rent supplement, the household benefits package, fuel allowance and free travel. It is worth highlighting that expenditure on pensions and children alone will account for almost €9.6 billion or just under 50% of the Department's overall expenditure in 2016.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_35"> Deputies might note that in order to enable an accurate year-on-year expenditure comparison to be made, account must be taken of two items in 2015. Some €135 million was needed to enable pensioners and other recipients who were due to be paid on bank holiday Friday, 1 January 2016 to have their payments brought forward to Thursday 31 December 2015 and €197 million was needed to pay out the Christmas bonus last year. I will return to the topic of the bonus in a few minutes. When these two items are excluded, the 2016 allocation is over €52 million higher than the net outturn in 2015. Indeed, the allocation in 2016 is more than €1.6 billion greater that what was spent in 2008, or more than 9%.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_36"> It is important for the House to note that, given the demand-led nature of most Department of Social Protection expenditure, the allocations for the vast majority of schemes vary from year to year based on emerging trends. The variations can result in a higher or lower requirement. The very welcome reductions in expenditure on jobseekers, due to falling unemployment, means that we have been able to meet expenditure pressures in other areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_37"> Deputies will be already familiar with increased spending on pensioners as the number of seniors rises, but there are two other areas I would like to highlight. First, payments to carers will amount to almost €912 million this year, an increase of 18% since 2012 due to a higher number of carers being supported. Similarly, expenditure on disability and invalidity payments has increased by 13% or €232 million since 2012, again due to increased numbers of people on the schemes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_38"> As already outlined, the 2015 outturn included expenditure of €197 million on the payment of a Christmas bonus. The Christmas bonus was introduced in 1980 and was abolished in 2009. The last Government re-introduced it partially in 2014 with the payment of a 25% Bonus, followed by a 75% Bonus in 2015. If one looks back historically, a 75% bonus was a relatively normal payment hitherto 2009. As happened in 2014 and 2015, when a bonus was subsequently paid, there is no provision for a bonus in the Department's allocation for 2016. In both 2014 and 2015, the Government was ultimately in a position to proceed with a bonus given the continuing improvement in the State's financial position. The State's financial position is improving again in 2016 and I will therefore be seeking approval from my Government colleagues in the coming months for the payment of a Christmas bonus once again this year. An announcement will be made on budget day in October.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_39"> The job of the last Government was to fix the economy and rescue Ireland from national bankruptcy. At one point, unemployment had reached a crisis peak of 15%. Central Statistics Office, CSO, data published recently shows that the monthly unemployment rate has fallen to 7.8%. Long-term unemployment has fallen below 5% for the first time since the crisis and youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 33% to 16.9% last month. Deputies will be aware that it is typical internationally for youth employment to be roughly double the average unemployment rate largely as a consequence of the very large numbers of young people who are in education.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_40"> At the end of May, there were approximately 38,500 fewer people on the live register than the same time last year. There continues to be a strong decrease in the live register, with an 11% decline in numbers in each of the past two years. Recent CSO data shows strong increases in employment. Employment has increased by 47,000 people in the past year and it is particularly welcome that the construction sector has experienced one of the largest increases. As I said earlier, the ongoing drop in the live register is freeing up resources to meet rising demand in other areas such as pensions, people with disabilities, carers and so on.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_41"> A growing economy generates more jobs for more people. However, some people are still struggling to break into the workforce. There is evidence of rising levels of people who have been unemployed for more than five years. This is where my Department's Pathways to Work strategy comes in, which aims to ensure as many of the new jobs as possible go to those who are on the live register, particularly those who are long-term unemployed. It also aims to gradually expand access to activation services, as resources allow, to other jobless people of working age in order to promote active inclusion, which is participation in both the economy and society. Having a job is not only good for one's financial well-being, it is also good for a person's welfare, family and community.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_42"> The Intreo integrated employment and support service marks a fundamental transformation in how the Department of Social Protection supports and assists jobseekers, representing a move away from a passive payer of benefits to actively engaging with jobseekers and employers. In 2015, the Department provided group information sessions to 189,000 jobseekers, including 47,500 people who were long-term unemployed. It also provided initial one-to-one guidance interviews with 126,000 jobseekers. Last year, the Department also commenced JobPath. JobPath is a payment-by-results contracted service whereby long-term jobseekers receive intensive individual support to help them overcome barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs. Referrals started last July. It is expected that 60,000 referrals will be made to JobPath providers in 2016. I am pleased to report that my Department is phasing in a full activation support service for people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis. To this end, Intreo will become a gateway to employment activation not just for people who are unemployed, but also for those who have disabilities who will be case managed along with the live register cohort.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_43"> Turning to additional expenditure items announced in 2016, the social protection budget for 2016 has four keys aims: to increase income for pensioners aged 66 and over, to strengthen supports for families with children, to further hasten momentum in helping jobseekers back to work and to provide targeted assistance for vulnerable groups.</summary>
        <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1302">I note the Minister's outline of the commitments in the programme for Government. There are also commitments in the document which was signed on behalf of our party and the Minister's party. Nevertheless, it must be made clear that over the past five years, there have been five regressive budgets in which the poor bore the brunt of austerity. It will take a number of budgets and quite a shift in expenditure in the Department of Social Protection to repair the damage that has been done over those years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303"> The Government's main contention, and the former Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, repeated it again this evening in an unrelated debate, is that the last Government maintained the social welfare system and maintained the level of benefits or the purchasing power of benefits. Of course, that is not true. The claim is undercut immediately by the fact that over the past five years, when there has been no increase in social welfare rates apart from the €3 per week in the old age pension in the last budget, inflation has increased by just under 5%. That is a 5% erosion of the purchasing power of social welfare benefits. Some studies have been conducted on the impact of this on the elderly. Due to the type of goods the elderly purchase, it is estimated that the inflationary impact on them is approximately 7%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304"> Leaving that aside for a moment, the Government claimed that it did not cut basic rates of social welfare in any way. It did not cut the basic rate of jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance, but it made it more difficult to qualify and it paid jobseeker's benefit for a shorter period. That is tantamount to a cut. It claims it did not cut the rate of carer's allowance, which is true, but as the Minister is aware every carer in the country is automatically entitled to the respite care grant and the reduction in that grant of €350 per year represented a cut of €7 per week for every carer. It was only restored in the shadow of a general election. That was the equivalent of a cut in the weekly payments. Most people on social welfare who did not have a large extra income were entitled to a fuel allowance but that allowance was cut. It has been restored by 45% to 50% but that is a basic cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305"> Instead of having to provide for themselves for the first three days of illness, people who claim illness benefit must now provide for themselves for the first six days. In effect, that is a cut. Maternity benefit was cut and taxed. We could also mention the household benefits package, the free telephone rental allowance and the school clothing and footwear allowances, which were designed to assist the poorest people in society. They have been slashed quite blatantly. These cuts have a particular impact on the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306"> I already mentioned the impact of inflation. In addition to that, the free telephone rental allowance was abolished, which impacted on the elderly, and there was the evisceration of the household benefits package, changes in the method of calculation of pensions to the detriment of pensioners, restrictions in the higher rates of disability allowance and invalidity pension for people over 65 years, restrictions in tax relief on medical insurance which disproportionately affects the elderly, the increase in the threshold for the drug repayment scheme, again affecting the elderly disproportionately, and changes in the qualification conditions for people over the age of 70 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307"> While this erosion of purchasing power was taking place, a raft of new charges were introduced, such as water charges and property tax. People who were trying to provide for themselves were subjected to a pension levy, whereby €2.5 billion was gouged out of their savings. Contributions to the fair deal scheme increased, as did carbon tax. The waiver for refuse collection was abolished. The increase in the VAT rate from 21% to 23% also had a disproportionate effect on the elderly. After all of that, a €3 increase per week after five years appears quite meagre.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308"> All of this has given rise to poverty levels I do not have time to discuss but they are quite considerable among the elderly, children and lone parents. We must have the worst poverty rates among lone parents in the civilised world. It has given rise to horrendous inequality. The most recent figures for disposable income show that the top 10% of people in the country had 25% of all disposable income, while the bottom 10% had just under 3%. That is just income. If one factors in access to capital and assets, which is almost exclusively confined to people in the upper echelons, inequality in this country has reached a perilous stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309"> I am not pretending, nor will I suggest, that these matters can all be dealt with in one budget. Obviously, it will take several budgets but we have a number of very specific commitments relating to these matters. We do not envisage making Ireland a perfect society as a result of the next budget but we are certainly determined to ensure that it will be a better society. We are determined to ensure that the era of regressive budgeting will be over and that there will be specific measures in the budget relating to social welfare that will halt the increase in poverty, particularly consistent poverty, and move more quickly towards the targets the Government set itself and that it failed abysmally to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310"> I wanted to ask the Minister about a number of specific items in the Estimates. He referred to the reduced expenditure on lone parents of €170.5 million. He said this was partly offset by increases in jobseeker's payments, the family income supplement and the back-to-work dividend. According to my calculations, the increases in the family income supplement and the back-to-work dividend only come to approximately €42 million between them and that is not all. That increased payment does not all go to lone parents. I would like to get a specific figure for the loss to working lone parents as a result of the changes introduced by the previous Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311"> I also note an allocation for the back-to-education allowance. The Minister will be aware of a pretty damning report about this allowance and its impact on employment. I would like to hear the Minister's views on the future of the allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312"> There is also a transfer of €24.5 million to the housing assistance payment, HAP. Could the Minister tell us what percentage of dwellings have been transferred from rent allowance to the HAP? I also notice that there is a €20 million reduction in rent allowance. This will change pretty dramatically if the programme for Government is to be fulfilled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313"> That is all that I have time to say in this very short debate. I heard the end of the previous debate. The fact that we are discussing this matter through exchanges and one-off speeches on the floor of the House is a retrograde step. The real place to debate Estimates is in committee and I strongly recommend to the business committee that we go back to that system.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnneRabbitte" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Deputy Anne Rabbitte<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T21:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1314">I thank Deputy O'Dea for sharing time. I also thank the Minister for his presentation, which I appreciated. I thank the two civil servants sitting here tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315"> I will focus on Tús, the rural social scheme, community employment schemes and Intreo offices. East Galway, where I live, is very different to Dublin because people could not have it harder when it comes to Pathways to Work. The reason for this is because someone trying to access Intreo offices faces a problem with transport before they even get off the ground. Therein lies the problem because we are short on numbers on the ground and are struggling to fill Tús and community employment schemes even though we have numbers on the live register. Why are we struggling to fill them? It is because the service is outsourced to an English company, the name of which escapes me. This company is taking people off the live register and the supervisor on the ground in charge of a Tús or community employment scheme is failing to get people employed in their own area because they must go to the Intreo office in either Loughrea or Galway city. This is where they are being serviced. They are forgetting about local communities. The idea behind Tús, the rural social scheme and community employment schemes was to support rural communities and be a part of their rejuvenation but, regrettably, the Department is forgetting about the smaller towns and villages in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316"> Approximately 4,500 people are waiting to get on the rural social scheme. In Galway, 154 people are waiting to get on the scheme. This includes the county and the west. That would mean that we would need seven schemes along with seven supervisors and seven assistant supervisors. Most of the people on farm assist or jobseeker's payments possibly already receive €188 and to increase it by a couple of euro to €233 would involve in the region of €175,000 for Galway. We talk about financial well-being, which was referred by the Minister, but it is also about mental well-being. These people want to go to work. They are farmers on farm assist, which the Minister needs to look at because the IFA spoke in detail about it yesterday. They are not farmers who do not want to work. They just do not have enough work and are making themselves available but there are no spaces on the schemes throughout the country. I ask the Minister to look at this element of it. It can give a lot back to communities. The knock-on effect is that the men on those schemes are contributing to the community and are going home in the evenings in a better state of mind because they have been out working and communicating as opposed to sitting at home thinking that they have not been providing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317"> When those responsible are assessing whether there is a vacancy on the rural social scheme, they look at the family circumstances. A single man finds it much harder to get on such a scheme than a married man because of the allowances and attempts to get them the grants. I know the Minister is looking at me but it is a choice when they are trying to see how they support the family in the community. I can only credit the supervisors and people involved in Tús, the rural social scheme and community employment schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318"> Regrettably, I think we might have got it wrong with Tús because there is no progression. People are only there for 12 months. By that time, they have done their work for 12 months and they have nothing to move on to. Can we move them to community employment schemes because they have only just learned a skill, such as stone wall building, for example, when they finish? If we could provide a pathway to progression in the community, the good people will come through and will find jobs out of it. It is very hard for someone who has taken part in a Safe Pass programme for 12 months to find anything as result of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319"> Intreo is a fabulous service but I would make one suggestion. Can we put some Intreo case officers out in the field as opposed to having everybody travelling to the main towns? Can we bring them out to rural communities where there are people on the live register? They should come out and meet and assess them where they can. This would mean that there would be a continuation. In respect of not being able to get through on the phone, some people have problems with reading and writing. They need someone to spend time with them because this is the sector we are trying to support. They do not have that capability and it is sometimes easier to stay at home than go and sit in an office. </p>
          <p eId="para_1320"> The rules for women who stayed at home to rear their children were changed in 2012 and it appeared that it would halve their entitlements or allowances. We should look at this. We spoke very clearly about Gateway and activation for people with disabilities. We should look at the mobility allowance and when we do so, we should look at the family situation. I have a huge problem with the primary medical certificate. The person driving a disabled individual could be his or her mother, father or wife but we must look at the broader family.</p>

People make sacrifices for something better, to achieve something they can benefit from, but what have people gained from the sacrifices they have made? Do they have more money, stability or recovery? Fine Gael, Labour, and Fianna Fáil before them chose who to target in their austerity agenda, including lone parents, carers, children, those with disabilities and the elderly.</p>

          <p eId="para_1344">In research carried out by Mandate, one in ten people are experiencing food poverty, which is nearly half a million citizens. We have a crisis in housing, healthcare and education. We have families struggling to feed their children and heat their homes. Poverty is rising among children and pensioners as well as among people with disabilities and carers. Lone parents are among the most vulnerable and impoverished in the country with 63% of one-parent family households experiencing enforced deprivation. Homelessness is a greater threat than ever before. At any one time, two thirds of families in emergency accommodation are lone parent families. The rationale put forward for the cuts to the lone parent allowance was to incentivise lone parents to seek more hours at work, but in the absence of affordable child care and legislation enabling workers to seek more hours, these cuts are an attack on the living standards of lone parents. We are still waiting on the Scandinavian child care model which was constantly referred to by Deputy Joan Burton. Will the Minister be able to give us an update on that child care proposal?</p>
          <p eId="para_1345"> Sinn Féin called on the Government to reverse the changes to the lone parent allowance in a Private Members' motion on the eve of the change in July 2015 and the Labour Party refused to back down. Today, Labour Party Deputies are standing up whinging about cuts as if they played no part in standing over the harshest of cuts ever seen in this country. Where is the recovery for lone parents? There is none; they are certainly not living in a utopia. </p>
          <p eId="para_1346"> A man from Baltinglass in my constituency of Wicklow contacted my office last week. He is caring for his daughter and has been told he will have to wait 19 weeks until his application for carer's allowance is even examined. Thanking him for his sacrifice in turning the economy around will not get him the carer's allowance he is entitled to more quickly. The reality is that carers right across the country have nothing left to give. Carers, who save the State over €4 billion each year, are experiencing unprecedented hardship. Is that their sacrifice? Where is the recovery for carers? There is none for carers; they do not live in the Minister's utopia.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347"> In 2015, the CSO reported that there are 755,570 people living in poverty in Ireland, which is a rise of 55,000 since the Minister's party, Fine Gael, and Labour came into office in 2011. Over 230,000 of these are children. What is the Government doing about this? Even the Minister's targets to reduce child poverty had to be revised from taking 70,000 children out of poverty to 97,000 by 2020. How can any Government stand idly by when children are going hungry in 2016? This has not happened by accident. It is the result of several successive regressive budgets started off by Fianna Fáil. It has been caused by the Government's own polices. Yet, the Government continues to sit on its hands on this issue while organisations such as St. Vincent de Paul are left to spend €7 million a year providing for people who are the most needy in this State. We see thousands queueing for food parcels at Dublin's Capuchin day centre. In Cork, the Penny Dinners feed 1,400 people per week, which is up 55% in a year. Children should never pay the price and should never suffer the severe deprivation they are suffering today thanks to the Government's policies and austerity agenda. Where is the recovery for children? There is no recovery for children. </p>
          <p eId="para_1348"> Last week, there was a real opportunity for Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to make some effort in tackling the housing crisis through Sinn Féin's Bill on rent certainty, something Fianna Fáil had their part-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1420">What ultimately is behind all these figures? We must ask why are these moneys are being made available. We are here to debate moneys for the protection of the most vulnerable in society and those at risk of poverty. In essence, when looking at past policies and figures, these moneys are about aiding those where needed. The Government needs to connect to circumstances on the ground, and to the needs of those in receipt of social protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1421"> We must remember there is a direct link between unemployment and poverty. We, as public representatives, should be about eliminating this link as much as possible but it is in the hands of the Government to pursue this end. The Minister outlined a high-level aim to attain better outcomes in tackling poverty. The most recent figures from the CSO state that 140,000 children were in consistent poverty. That is the reality. We must also be conscious of the reality on the ground for pensioners, lone parents and those on jobseeker's benefit, to name but a few, and we must be conscious, most importantly, of the realities on the ground behind these titles and the figures presented by Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422"> What does the cut to lone parents mean in reality? According to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, lone parents comprise the largest group that requests its services, and this group has the highest poverty rates of any household type. That is the reality. I understand that at the time, the so-called logic for the Government introducing the cuts was to get more people back to work, but the reality was, with the lack of child care and the lack of limited after school opportunities, it was harder for parents to enter the workforce, given the pressure arising from the cuts to their income. The cut to lone parents must also be seen in the context of previous cuts, such as the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowances, which Barnardos previously recommended should be increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_1423"> Looking past the figures, what does the €3 rise in the pension mean in reality? When reaching a certain stage in life one wants to feel comfortable and to have enough means to live. Seriously, what will €3 a week provide?</p>

          <p eId="para_1427">I like to be constructive and I do not invoke any interruptions. I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to contribute and I wish the Minister well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1428"> It is an important fact that almost €4 out of every €10 that is spent in this country is allocated to the social welfare Vote. Indeed, notwithstanding all of the comments here, the former Minister, Deputy Burton, during the period of the worst economic recession across the world, a great depression, managed to maintain funding with minimal impact and cuts. In programme countries all over the world, there have been significant reductions in expenditure on social welfare and benefits. One must face a bit of reality as well from that perspective. Indeed, some have forgotten that, while there was only a €3 per week increase for pensioners, there was also the restoration of the Christmas bonus. For a married couple, that was another €6.50 a week, which brought it up to €9.50 a week. If Deputy Denise Mitchell is going to give the story, she should give the full story and not offer a selective view.</p>
          <p eId="para_1429"> I was one who championed carers at a time when some new Members had not even been elected to the Dáil. After writing a report on this aspect, I helped to ensure carers continued to receive the 50% additional rate in relevant supports. I am unashamedly a strong advocate for carers, yet I do not hear too many mention them. The carers are the ones who put in hundreds of thousands of hours and save us many man-hours across the State, and we must continue to ensure that the caring profession in this country, those who care within their own homes, are helped to maintain and live within their own homes and look after those for whom they are caring. Often the carer is the person who suffers most and that is why we maintained the 50% additional rate. Indeed, the late Seamus Brennan introduced that and I remember him saying here on the floor of the Dáil to me that this could be one that would certainly be significant in the long term. That allowance was maintained through thick and thin, and it is an important allowance. I acknowledge such measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430"> I want to be constructive and look at areas that some do not seem to understand. I want to address the important topic of the treatment of the self-employed within the social welfare system, of which I know something. I have often heard Members here speak as if they were late converts to the cause of the self-employed and now portray themselves as almost their saviours or the only advocates left. We all are aware of the importance of having a safety net in place in the social welfare system, as previous Members have spoken about, for when one falls into personal difficulties, such as illness, or where one loses one's job unexpectedly. It is important that those who find themselves in these positions have seamless access to the welfare system and receive due payments in accordance with their contribution rates as laid down by law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431"> Both myself and the former Deputy, Senator Ray Butler, raised the important issue of the plight of the self-employed in the previous Dáil on a number of occasions. I raised it as far back as the early 2000s. I remember meeting, in 2010, 2011 and 2012, throughout my constituency of Longford-Westmeath, many hundreds of self-employed who had become unemployed unexpectedly. This occurred due to the downturn, due to illness and for other reasons, or due to a closure of business. Such persons are liable for PRSI payment under the class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits, such as the State pension - contributory - or the widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension - contributory. From the foregoing, they do not qualify for jobseeker's benefit, irrespective of how long they have been making contributions, and these people are compelled to seek recourse to the jobseeker's allowance which, as Members will be aware, is means tested. For many formerly self-employed, this turns out to be their first encounter with the social welfare system. It is an emotive, tortuous and complex process in so far as the assessment must reflect the income that the self-employed person might expect to get from his or her business in the previous 12 months. It involves a minute examination of the previous year's activities and income arising is then gone through. Most people do not have €1 left at that stage. It is rather like looking for last year's snow in the middle of summer. It is an exhaustive process that takes a long time and it taxes everyone's patience. Often these people are left in limbo. It must be remembered that there are over 300,000 self-employed. It is a significant cohort. Not too many Members here seem to want to speak up for them, but I will do so unashamedly. At the end, one goes to the community welfare officer and that involves going through a whole process. Those to whom I referred felt bruised, isolated and irritated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432"> I raised this with the previous Government and I got included in the programme for Government a commitment to examine the feasibility of providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons. The previous Minister established an advisory group on tax and social welfare to progress this issue and to establish whether cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable. I realise the current Minister, Deputy Varadkar, will focus on this, and I laud and compliment him and urge him to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1433">We should not forget that many of these people who are self-employed also provide valuable employment for others. Many were sole traders or partners and found themselves victims as money due from a main contractor or subcontractor, which may have gone out of business, did not materialise, or they were subject to part-payment, ultimately leading to the collapse of that self-employed person's business. These are relevant issues. The previous Government commenced some policy of equalisation with respect to the taxation treatment of the self-employed compared with employed people by increasing the earned income tax credit for self-employed people. That will match the PAYE tax credit by 2018. They are now on a current-year basis in terms of taxation, so this should be done in the sake of fairness. I hope this process will continue. We must confront the issue and address in a positive and constructive way the plight of the self-employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1434"> From my discussions with self-employed people, I know that, given the opportunity, they would be willing to contribute a special rate of PRSI. I accept this would likely be significant but it would enable them, on cessation of employment because of a downturn or other circumstances, to immediately qualify for benefits and have access to the full range of social welfare insurance benefits arising from making contributions at a given level or class. This may not mean a person would be entitled to the full range of social welfare benefits but it should correspond to the appropriate class. The cost might not be as much as people have indicated, as many self-employed people must register as an employer and self-employed people never received recognition for their role as tax collectors who furnished payments to the Exchequer on a monthly basis. They must employ people to do so. I hope the Minister will apply fairness in trying to achieve a just and equitable resolution for the self-employed in the application of the social welfare system for them, especially in the context of a specific PRSI scheme underpinning the equality objective. It should recognise their special position as employers as well as employees. I understand the Minister wants that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1435"> Another bugbear of mine that is becoming more evident across the country is the low take-up of pension plans. The rate is well below 50% in the private sector. I understand the former Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, put in place a universal retirement savings group to embark on the process of developing a roadmap or timeline for the introduction of a new pension scheme for all workers in Ireland. On completion of its work, the universal retirement savings group will submit its recommendations to the Minister and the Government, leaving a roadmap to plan for increasing pension coverage and a likely timescale.</p>
          <p eId="para_1436"> I recall a survey from the Irish Association of Pension Funds last year indicating that up to 70% of people would support some form of mandatory pension scheme. Has the Minister any idea when the report will be concluded and ready for publication? Does he support the introduction of a mandatory or quasi-mandatory pension scheme? When is it likely that such a scheme might see the light of day? Does he intend making provisions in the Estimates to commence the roll-out of a mandatory pension scheme, as this would obviously necessitate a State contribution, as well as employer and employee contributions?</p>
          <p eId="para_1437"> The Minister is aware that the portion of the population aged 65 or older in Ireland is projected to increase from approximately 12.4% today to 25% by 2050. This demographic change is welcome and represents longer lives for our people, although it brings significant challenges. For example, currently there are 5.3 people of working age for every such person, but this ratio is expected to decrease to 2.1 people by 2050. The State pension will remain the bedrock of the Irish pension system. However, while the State pension is expected to provide a basic retirement income for workers, many people retiring may experience significant drop in income if they do not have adequate supplementary private pension provision. That relates to a key recommendation of the OECD review of the Irish pension system, which is to improve the adequacy of pensions by increasing coverage in the funded part of the pension scheme through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment-based pension scheme. Ireland is one of only two member countries of the OECD that does not have a mandatory or quasi-mandatory earnings-related supplementary pension for workers. It is out of this that the universal retirement savings group emerged and it has entered a consultation process. I know the Small Firms Association is opposed to the idea of a mandatory pension scheme for Irish workers, probably because of its cost to business, the State and employees. It would rather pursue a voluntary approach to pension provision, but how successful that would be is open to question. I suppose one must see how far it could go.</p>
          <p eId="para_1438"> We welcome the introduction of the paternity leave scheme, with legislation being initiated before the weekend. Our own Minister and then party leader introduced the idea of two weeks of paid paternity leave in recognition that fathers should have the opportunity to bond with newborn children. It is a step forward but we are still a long way from becoming one of the more father-friendly countries in the European Union. Is this the first step of a scheme of expanded paternity leave, and if so, what is the timetable for expansion? Is there any consideration of shared parental leave, which has been successful in Norway and Sweden?</p>
          <p eId="para_1439"> The Christmas bonus was abolished in 2009 and 2010, with a 25% and 75% bonus reintroduced in recent years. There were 1.2 million people benefitting from this bonus last Christmas, and it is a very welcome assistance to people at a demanding time of the year. We are all aware that people who receive a Christmas bonus are not hoarders and they spend money within the local economy and businesses; it can be a major boost in that way. The bonus has always come from current departmental expenditure and that will be the case this year. Will the new fiscal rules demanding that any Supplementary Estimates be funded through expenditure savings in other Departments or through discretionary measures have any impact on the Minister's ability to ensure the Christmas bonus can be provided in December? As the economic recovery will continue, I hope, will the Minister give consideration to a full restoration of the bonus?</p>
          <p eId="para_1440"> I notice in the programme for Government that there is mention of a new working family payment targeted at low-income families. Anything that improves the lot of low-income families, especially those who are working for low incomes, is welcome. Every parent working at least 15 hours per week will be guaranteed that every extra hour he or she works will result in more take-home pay, which is laudable. How much has been allocated for the new payment and when will it be introduced? How many people will benefit from the payment and by how much will they benefit? How will the payment work alongside the existing family income supplement and the back-to-work family dividend? Those are important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1441"> The universality of child benefit is important and it goes to mothers in 95% of cases. It is important that this will continue, with no proposals for changing the way child benefit is paid. That must be clarified. Last year our parliamentary meetings raised the idea of increasing the funding available for school meals by €3 million. There are over 1,430 schools and community groups providing meals in schools, preschools and community groups. If we returned to government, we had hoped to increase the funding available by €5 million each year, expanding the school meals programme to at least one third of all schools and preschool settings, with particular focus on promoting breakfast clubs. That is an important way of tackling child poverty so does the Minister know how much might be provided for such programmes to tackle child poverty, such as the important school meals programme? Is there funding for minor capital works required in some schools? These are important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1442"> I am particularly concerned about carers so I will finish on that point, which I referred to when I started. Much tremendous work is done by carers who are unpaid. If one works it out, such carers might get one third of the minimum wage per hour that they devote to their work. The work put in could be valued close to €4 billion, even if the work was valued at the minimum wage, which is a large amount. Money is still tight and there are many demands. There were adjustments in many areas in the past number of years and the Minister will have to address them. I know he has priorities of his own. I urge the Minister to do whatever can be done to improve the plight of carers, who are the unsung heroes of Irish society. These people fought a battle and achieved the restoration of the respite care grant, which was welcome after a very difficult time. Anything that can be done to ameliorate their position, such as providing additional financial resources, should be done. I include in this even small elements, such as allowances for phones. This area should see the first allocations as these people have done a tremendous service. One wonders how our hospital system would cope if they did not do their work, and the cost-benefit analysis of every €1 spent on carers is phenomenally positive. They should get whatever funding can be raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1443"> They are deeply appreciative people. They have the Carers Alliance and what used to be the Carers Association. Recognition was the first step.</p>
          <p eId="para_1444">I am very glad that back in the early 2000s I, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, brought forward a report with my colleagues. We did not engage any consultants or anything else. We wrote 15 recommendations and seven of them were implemented. That is the one thing I think is important. The moral of the story is that one does not need consultants to achieve progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_1446"> Savage cuts in the one-parent family payment, which remain unaltered, were implemented by the former Minister, Deputy Burton, on the basis that so-called Scandinavian standards of affordable child care would come on stream. This still proves to be a chimera. Such cuts served to tip a number of predominantly young mothers into homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1447"> The provision for activation schemes remains unaltered. We have to square the projected spend for the remainder of the year with the utterances of Ministers about their desire to see the abolition of JobBridge. It is uncontested that this scheme has been abused by employers who blatantly used it as a substitute for real jobs. JobBridge represented an attack principally on young people. This was compounded by blatant discrimination in the form of reduced social welfare payments for those under 25. Attacks like this, combined with the horrendous situation with accommodation, amounts to the Government infantilising young adults, forcing them to be dependent on their parents or, worse, serving as a push factor in leaving the youth no alternative but to emigrate. There is no alteration in the Estimates on this score.</p>
          <p eId="para_1448"> The bereavement grant, which was a minor but important contribution towards funeral costs for the poorest in society, was scrapped almost outright by the previous Government. I know, for example, that the hardship the absence of this grant brings on the families of those who have died from heroin overdoses has become a topic of discussion at local drug task forces. Again, this situation remains unaltered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1449"> Family income supplement, FIS, is absolutely necessary for the families who receive it. That does not contradict the fact it is an indictment on employers and the prevalence of short hours and low pay. The projected increased spend this year over last year is, again, a reflection of the nature of the jobs recovery, which in large measure is being built on precariousness, with the taxpayer indirectly subsidising the profits of the private sector via income supports. The introduction and enforcement of a living wage and the abolition of short-hour, if-and-when contracts together would serve to lower expenditure on FIS on a proper basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1450"> The combination of an explosion of unemployment at the start of the crisis and a simultaneous reduction of public sector numbers, which found its own reflection in the Department of Social Protection, meant that the experience of many people in their engagement with the Department of Social Protection has been one of waiting weeks and months for the processing of applications. Again, investment in adequate staffing at this stage could eradicate these waiting times which, besides providing relief to the applicant, would also ease the volume of inevitable queries and representations made to public representatives and the Department, which in itself represents a drain on resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1451"> The former Minister, Deputy Burton, applied cuts to rent supplement when, for a brief juncture at the start of the crisis, the average cost of rents dipped. The subsequent skyrocketing of rent saw no commensurate restoration or increases. Instead, all we have had is the very partial roll-out of the housing assistance payment, which itself carries a sting in its tail as those who receive it are removed from the housing allocation list. Again, this is a cut that remains intact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1452"> We must also remember that the Revised Estimates in the Department of Social Protection, like those of every other Department, are a restatement of the succession of cuts that were imposed on public service workers, most of which remain in place even after the Lansdowne Road agreement expires. Workers in the Department experienced a pension levy, unilateral cuts to salary in 2010, the USC, increment freezes, additional enforced hours, which constitute an effective cut in the rate of pay, and lesser conditions for post-2011 entrants into the Civil Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1453"> A serious process of Revised Estimates would have reconsidered all these cuts and proposed upward revisions to spending to provide relief for hundreds of thousands of individuals and families who have been put through the ringer and for whom talk of a recovery remains a sick joke. Instead, the airwaves tomorrow will be taken up by Government promises to abolish USC within the lifetime of this Government. While this is absolutely necessary for low and middle-income workers, the lack of action on these issues demonstrates by default this Government's contempt for the section of the population who depend on welfare.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T21:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1458">I welcome this opportunity. I thank the Minister and wish him the best in his new role. I was tough on him in the brief period for which he was in speaking in the Dáil on health issues. I agree with Deputy Barry completely. If the Minister were seriously interested in reversing the inequality in society, he would have a different statement before us. I welcome the positive changes and the improvements that have been listed. However, they are done with the background of an improving economy allowing us to give a little more money back to the vulnerable, who really should not have suffered in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1459"> The Minister correctly pointed out that the Department has a huge budget, one of the biggest. He correctly said it is not going to people who are unemployed, by and large, but to a larger segment of society. The question is why and what is happening. Deputy Barry touched on it already. In fact he more than touched on the idea that it is to compensate for the inequality in wages. UNITE published a document, The Truth About Irish Wages, which revealed that the highest-paid private sector workers earn almost four times as much as the lowest-paid employees. Ireland has the second highest level of wage inequality behind Portugal out of 15 countries when it comes to the difference between the lowest and the highest paid. In case anyone thinks UNITE is too radical or too far on the left, let me quote from John FitzGerald, an economist who would not be known for his left-wing views. In <i>The Irish Times</i> on 7 June, he stated "Ireland’s market incomes are very unevenly distributed, and the tax and welfare systems, but mainly welfare, play a very important role in redistributing income". Here we have a system that has to compensate for the bad system of wages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1460"> Related to this, we see the report from the University of Limerick on zero-hour and if-and-when contracts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1461">We find that 5.3% of employees in Ireland have consistently variable hours. The highest proportion of those are employed in the wholesale, retail, accommodation, food, health and social work sectors - the most hard-working staff with the minimum protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1462"> I will turn now to the Minister's solution to unemployment. I welcome the fact that the unemployment rates have gone down as one could not but welcome that. However, we must look at how they have gone down. I have nothing to show me other than what the papers have exposed and well done to the media for revealing the abuses of JobBridge. There is the Gateway system for local authorities but I do not see any report on how successful that has been in leading local authorities to employ people. We now have the brand new JobPath, but the Minister should read some of the reports in <i>The Guardian</i> on this, which I am sure the Minister will admit is a pretty rational paper. It sets out details of the companies now employed by social welfare services in Ireland, such as Seetec. Is masla don teanga Gaeilge é "Turas Nua" a chur ar chóras mar seo. It is an insult to the Irish language to call one of these schemes Turas Nua when we are privatising the system by bringing in private, for-profit companies to remove people from the long-term waiting list. These people are suffering from bad health and disability but they are to be assessed if they are fit for work. We are paying them on the basis of-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1464">I will be the first to say "sorry" to the Minister if I am wrong. Maybe he can use his time rather than mine but this is what I read in the information I have before me. I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions on this and Deputy Catherine Murphy has also tabled a question. Very little information has been given except to say that they will provide intensive individual support. The responses do not give any idea of the money paid to these private for-profit companies, how they will be assessed or who will monitor them. I can only go on what I have read in respect of their experience in England and it is not very good. It is something the Minister should really look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_1465"> The cuts for lone parents were the most despicable ever made by a Labour Party in government. Even back in the 1980s, when social welfare was introduced for lone parents, or single mothers as they were then known, the importance of mothers and fathers having the chance to raise their children at home was recognised. The Fine Gael-Labour Party Government also changed the payment on a child reaching seven. I have a letter from a mother who has been put through the hoops in respect of a new payment. She has been told by Tusla that if she leaves her child unminded she will be in trouble. The new payment reads like something from Kafka on a bad day and I ask the Minister to look at it immediately and reverse it. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is not an organisation known for its left-wing leanings but it asks for this to be looked at. On page 2 of its document it calls for lone parents in employment, whose children are aged between seven and 14, to be allowed to receive both jobseeker's transition payment and family income supplement if they meet the qualifying criteria. It goes on to call for the transitional payment and payment of the SUSI grant. It is a document worth looking at; it is very short, very specific and to the point. How much time do I have left?</p>

When I was canvassing door to door the position of self-employed people was mentioned more than any issue other than housing and health and people were filled with despair on the matter. It should be looked at immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_1468">I will not repeat the points made so well by my colleague. I will deal with one example relating to the Revised Estimates of the Department of Social Protection. I sincerely hope the Department has enough money in the kitty to deal with a root and branch review of pension governance in this country because we are on the cusp of a serious problem in that regard. The Central Remedial Clinic is an example of what is likely to happen to the remaining defined benefit schemes in this country - a huge problem that will, sadly, end up on the Minister's doorstep. Ireland's pension industry is made up of 150,000 schemes with over 730,000 active members holding more than €80 billion in investment assets and over 226,000 individual PAS contracts with over €4.6 billion in investment assets. It is absolutely huge but absolutely not transparent and not accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1469"> The CRC has been hit by controversy, not for the first time and not for the first time in respect of its pension situation. The Minister will know that in 2014 the departure of the former CEO Paul Kiely cost the CRC €750,000 in pension payments. An attempt was made to cover this up, which led to the resignation of the board. Now we have another pension scandal at the heart of the CRC under a new board and new management. The staff have been treated abysmally and this is important because if the Department, which is responsible for governance, does not intervene I have no doubt it will be replicated by other defined benefit schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1470"> In 2013 the interim administrator wrote that he was confident that with the appointment in 2014 of a competency-based board and a CEO through open competition the CRC would be able to move forward to the next phase of what has been a largely successful organisation. This has not happened. The CRC is at an all-time low and the pension fund has been unilaterally closed. Two members are within weeks of retirement, one with over 30 years of service and one with 44 years of service. Now they have no pension and have had zero consultation. How can this happen in an area over which we are supposed to have governance? How can no new pension plan be put in place? Is our governance so poor that this can be allowed to happen? I find it quite astounding. </p>
          <p eId="para_1471"> This needs the intervention of the Minister to tell them to freeze this scheme now and prohibit them from going ahead with the decision pending a serious investigation into what has gone on. The board did not unilaterally make this decision. We have to look at the role of some of its advisers. The same company, Mercer, provided the administration, the actuarial and the consultancy services to the CRC plan and the trustee of the plan, the Irish Pension Trust, is owned by Mercer. Even more astounding, the CRC board decided to hire another Mercer person late last year to give them separate advice from that given to the pension scheme by the previous fellow from Mercer. It is even more worrying that in 2014 the administrator appointed after the board resigned made the point that they were obligated to obtain advice from an independent source that could be relied upon.</p>

          <p eId="para_1473">It is very relevant from the point of view that the obligations of this scheme, and towards the pensioners in the scheme, may one day end up on the Minister's doorstep both because they are pensioners and because he is responsible for governance in these areas and governance has been found severely wanting in this scheme. It was stated in December 2014 that the funding proposals were on track. They went slightly off track in 2015 but only to the tune of a couple of hundred thousand. Three months later, however, the scheme was unilaterally shut down without consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1474">That is a severe problem and, if not challenged in this instance, this will be replicated by others. What is the impact of that? It means that every day since then, the employer, in this instance the CRC, has been saving substantial amounts of money at the expense of pensioners. The interests of those people, who have, in my opinion, a lawful right to access alternative viewpoints as to how that funding deficit could be met, have not been met. No other proposals have been put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1475"> I know from the Minister's previous brief that he takes his responsibility and his stewardship of Departments seriously. I can honestly tell him that this is one area that deserves his further scrutiny. There are organisations giving advice on our pension schemes that are appearing and popping up on all sides of the balance sheet, as it were. They are giving advice to both sides and it is pensioners who are losing out. Why is there such a clamber and rush to shut this scheme down? There is documentation that states this was being done deliberately to deny consultation to the employees, which the Minister knows is completely against Pensions Authority rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_1476"> I appreciate what the Ceann Comhairle said, and I am trying to be respectful in dealing with the topic on hand. However, according to the Pensions Authority, pension fund trustees are supposed to be looking after the savings on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of people in the scheme. Their obligations are not just to act with minimum compliance with the law but to act in the best interests of those whose retirement savings they are managing. That obligation cannot be answered in respect of the CRC.</p>
          <p eId="para_1477"> Given the scale of the organisations involved in this matter, I urge that we dig deeper. If we do not, given our aging population and the demands on the Exchequer and the Minister's Department, they will come knocking on his door. Not only that, it is absolutely reprehensible that people who have paid into a scheme all their working lives - 44 years in the case of one person who will retire in a couple of weeks' time - would be told that there is nothing for them there and that the scheme is going to be wound up. We have a system of governance. This falls within the Minister's Department. He has a budget. I hope he ups the level of scrutiny applied because it is needed and an avalanche is coming down the hill in respect of this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1479">Great news, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1480"> I wish to raise a number of matters with our new Minister for Social Protection and to wish him well in his role as Minister of that Department. Many problems have been created in recent years which made it difficult for people who wished to get on community employment, CE, schemes as well as those in the Department trying to administer them. One problem is that a person has to be unemployed for 12 months before he or she can go on the CE scheme. Someone who finds a place on a scheme is denied going on it until he or she is 12 months unemployed. In other words, people are being denied the opportunity of staying in the workforce and that is very wrong. Will the Minister address this problem? A period of three months may be more appropriate. It would give them a chance to get rolling again and to get back into the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_1481"> Another rule is the year 2000 rule. If a person was on a scheme and accumulated six years of work on the scheme, he or she will be denied the possibility of going on the scheme after the six years has passed. A person aged 58 years or 59 years will not be able to go on the scheme any more. In other words, they will have no opportunities and will be locked inside at home. They will have no opportunity to get out and feel like they are doing good for anyone. They are waiting to get the pension and that is their only outlook. This was not the case before the year 2000. Will the Minister examine this rule and see if it can be changed?</p>
          <p eId="para_1482"> Until four or five years ago, scheme entitlements could be interchanged between husbands and wives and partners and spouses. This suited, in particular, farmers, who were in receipt of farm assist payments, in the summer time. They could swap with their wives who would be allowed to go on the scheme instead of them while there was work to be done on the farm or other work that needed attention. This was a very sensible option but the option is now denied them. Approximately four years ago, the rule was changed and they are now denied that opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1483"> Everywhere in the country - take a place like Kilgarvan - there is another stupid rule. If three people on the scheme reach the age of 62 together, only one can remain on the scheme. People operating the scheme will have to send two people home. They will have to draw their names out of a hat and, depending on how they organise it, the fellow that stays in the hat stays working and the other two have to go home. That is wrong. I am asking that that rule be changed as well and that they are all given the chance to work until the age of 66 years when they reach the pension age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1484"> The other rule is that a person has to be 25 years of age before he or she can go on one of these schemes. It is very wrong that youngsters have to stay at home and that they have to be 25 years before they can go on the scheme and go work in graveyards or GAA fields or something like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1485"> I refer to lone parents, especially young girls who get in the family way and have a child, which is a joy. However, they need assistance to get them started and until four or five years ago, they were able to get double payments. They were able to get their social welfare payment and they were allowed to go on the CE scheme and work. This has changed and they are now denied that possibility. There is no incentive for them to work now because they will get the same amount under the scheme as they would get under the lone parent scheme if they stay at home.</p>

          <p eId="para_1488">I also want to mention carer's allowance because it is very important. It takes 19 weeks before applications for carer's allowance are even assessed. I know a man who applied in February and it was only the other day, after 19 weeks had passed, that the Department wrote to him looking for additional information. The application was not looked at until then. That is very sad and very wrong. A person will have pulled out of his or her job to stay at home and mind an elderly mother or father but it is 19 weeks before the application for carer's allowance is even looked at. That is very wrong and we must do something about it. Two or three weeks would be bad enough but 19 weeks is not on at all. Domiciliary care allowance applications take six months to process, which is too long as well. Will the Minister also look at that issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_1489"> In September 2012, the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, changed the number of contributions needed to get pensions. Someone with the same number of contributions after September 2012 as someone with contributions before then is getting far less money. Will the Minister examine the issue and see how it can be addressed? It is not fair. A person who became of pension age in September 2012 gets much less in his or her pension than someone who became of pension age in August 2012. That has to be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1492">I congratulate the Minister on his new appointment. I wish him well and I look forward to working constructively with him on many issues. I hope he will bring some of his imaginative style to this portfolio. My colleague Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has covered nearly everything from the cradle to the grave but I have a couple of words left to say. I compliment my colleague for his frankness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1493"> Reference was made to the situation of carers. They are the unsung heroes, as described by Deputy Penrose, and work from morning to night 24-7. I am delighted that the respite grant was reinstated. However, if one considers the amount of hours worked by a carer in keeping hospitals going, in keeping accident and emergency units cleared and in keeping hospital beds and respite beds free and empty for other people who have nobody to care for them, carers would not be earning €3, €4 or €5 per hour. The minimum wage would be out the window never mind the living wage. Carers are a dedicated bunch of people that I cannot help but salute. I do not have my carer's badge on tonight. I always wear it but I mislaid it somewhere recently. We need to salute the carers, support them and energise them because they have a very difficult job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1494"> I also want to acknowledge the self-employed. I stand here as a self-employed person myself and speak for the self-employed on the issue of PRSI, which I know is in the programme for Government, the negotiations of which both Deputy Healy-Rae and myself are involved in. It is envisaged that there will be a benefit for the self-employed who do not mind paying PRSI as long as they get something for it. Many self-employed people have contributed so much: sole traders and their spouses who work long hard hours doing a lot of hard work. Many projects in rural and urban Ireland bear the footprints and fingerprints of self-employed people. Many self-employed people employ others with gainful employment. When the downturn comes, or God forbid if ill-health comes or an accident, a self-employed person can be left with nothing and penniless. Many of them are literally hungry because they do not have the money to support themselves or their families. That situation must be looked at. They do not mind paying PRSI at whatever class level is required if they get some return. The current situation is totally unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_1495"> Social welfare fraud must also be tackled. I had a PQ reply recently from the Minister for Social Protection and I was astonished at the amount of fraud that has been detected. These people are taking money from those who really need it and who cannot get it in many cases. Deputy Danny Healy-Rae made reference to people who are waiting 16 weeks for carer's allowance and domiciliary allowance. Social welfare fraud must be stamped out at all costs and cannot be allowed to continue. What is right is right and what is wrong is wrong. I could never condone that kind of activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1496"> With regard to community employment schemes, there should be an evaluation of the CE scheme system. This should involve an audit as to the value of those schemes to our urban and rural communities. The schemes are much needed now in cities and towns in drug projects and diversion projects, etc. The CE scheme is the backbone of many communities. I am the chairman of a scheme which has been in existence since 1998 in villages local to me in Waterford, Kilnagrange, Newcastle, Ballybacon and Ballymacarbry, all of which do great work. I salute the sponsors - I am one - of all the schemes up and down the country because it is a very onerous task which includes audits, and rightly so. Not a penny can be misused and we expect that. However, with labour employment laws, health and safety legislation, anti-bullying policies, etc, it becomes very onerous and sponsors have to deal with all of this on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1497"> I have a concern about the appointment of CE supervisors and the high level of training that is expected of them. I know the Minister is dealing with it but it might not always be the person with the FETAC Level 6 major award that can do a job that involves dealing with several different committees in communities across GAA, child care, churches, schools and all kinds of community games, covering all sorts of issues. Sometimes you cannot legislate for that. One needs a person with hands-on experience who could do the job and who is amply qualified. I salute many of the CE scheme supervisors who may not have qualifications like that because they came in to the positions during previous times. They are working with sponsors and do a great job in keeping the whole thing in motion which is very important. It is not as though one can walk in with a briefcase, collar and tie and do the job. One needs to understand the needs of the communities which can be very different and varying all around the country. I understand the Minister is looking at that situation. We need flexibility there and those who need to gain qualifications should be given time to gain the accreditation. There should be a level playing field for those who wish to enter the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1498"> I will turn to the Tús scheme which is too short year on and year off. Again, I salute the supervisors and the people who co-ordinate it. In my area, it was the South Tipperary Development Company, which is now in abeyance due to the legacy left by big Phil Hogan, the former Minister and now European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development. Tús also needs to be reviewed. With regard to the rural social scheme, I know it is also envisaged in the programme for Government and that it came up in talks. It is a huge issue. The agriculture sector has never been in a worse place with such a low income. Given the prices for milk and other commodities, the farmers are under pressure. These are people who are willing and able to work if their spouses could swap at busy times of year - it is all one family's income and it is just a matter of being more flexible, more understanding and allowing those people to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1499"> Rural land has been transformed by CE schemes and Tús. County councils have abandoned those communities and do not have the outdoor staff. Consider all the maintenance work the councils were doing in communities. The Tidy Towns committees, the sponsors, CE and Tús workers are now doing all of that highly valuable work. An audit should be kept as to the value of that work. It would cost billions of euro to do that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1500"> The schemes also offer valuable training. Schemes like the one I was involved in were very progressive and many people moved back into employment or self-employment and that is the way it should be. There was a rule on CE schemes where a scheme could retain 10% of participants who are over 55 years but now it is very hard to keep anyone. If one was to keep the over 55s off schemes many of them would not get jobs in rural or urban Ireland and they need to be kept on until at least pension age. They are doing valuable work and are only getting €20 extra on top of their benefit or jobseeker's allowance for doing the work. It is a similar situation for those between the ages of 25 and 35. The packages are too inflexible and schemes are finding it hard to get eligible applicants who want to come out and work. It is getting harder to get them or they are not there. It will also become difficult to find supervisors if the Minister insists on carrying on with the same high level of regulations and qualifications which, in my opinion, are not always necessary to do those jobs. A scheme needs to keep the books right, adhere to employment legislation and health and safety rules and the supervisor needs to be able to take instructions and develop a good working relationship with sponsors and indeed a good relationship with social welfare officers and FÁS, whom I salute and who also do a lot of hard work. I deal with officers from the Waterford office and the Tipperary office who perform dedicated work which is time-consuming because there are so few of them and they have so many audits to do. In my area I deal with Michael Ormonde and Stephen Burke who perform much dedicated work on behalf of the Department of Social Protection and on behalf of taxpayers. There is good value of money delivered by schemes like that, from carers and from the self-employed who all supported this country through the worst recession we have ever seen. If we want to have self-employed people involved in kick-starting our economy in rural and urban areas then they need our support. We need them to know that there will be some benefit for them if they fall ill or if they had a period of bad trading, if they do not get paid from big companies or inadvertently go into liquidation. They need something to thank them for their service, a cushion which they have paid into. I wish the Minister well in his ministry.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Scanlon<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T22:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1501">I congratulate the Minister on his new portfolio and I wish him well. Our social welfare system needs fundamental reform. The net effect of recent budgets has been that low-income families and persons who are dependent on social welfare have suffered more by comparison with those who are better off. The Revised Estimates, published this month, provide €19.625 billion for all Department expenditure on schemes, services and administration in 2016. This is a similar figure to that published in the Revised Estimates in 2015. I hope this figure can be increased because of the improvement in the economy and that any increase is focused.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502"> The application processes for carer’s payments needs to be changed to enable applicants to provide more information on the level of care being provided. This would give the Department a far clearer picture of the level of care being given in the absence of a face-to-face assessment and would prevent over 50% of applications being refused at the initial stage. Eligibility for disability allowance depends on capacity to work. However, decisions are made based mainly on a medical assessment. In many cases this does not, by itself, give an accurate assessment of a person’s capacity to work. People should be given an opportunity to describe how their disability impacts on their daily life. The Department should endeavour to work with the disability movement and voluntary disability providers to develop a fair and comprehensive system of assessing people’s capacity to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1503">I appeal to the Minister to speed up the application process for carer's allowance and carer's benefit. The delays are causing unnecessary hardships and stress to many families who are caring full-time for their family members and loved ones. The staff in the Department of Social Protection dealing with the backlog of payments are doing what they can but they are understaffed and under-resourced. There are delays that could and should be avoided because of the service these people provide. A nursing home bed costs between €1,000 and €1,200 a week. These people are genuinely trying to care for people at home. There are other issues concerning home help and home-care packages which are not being provided as quickly as they should be to prevent people having to get nursing home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1504"> Those applying for payments are already in a distressing situation and this is only compounded by the time it takes for a decision to be made on a person’s entitlement to a payment. This needs to be addressed urgently. The family income supplement, FIS, is a welcome attempt to make work more financially worthwhile. As currently structured, however, it contains an obvious poverty trap which should be removed. This arises from the fact that in order to qualify for FIS a person has to work at least 38 hours per fortnight. This should be replaced by a sliding scale in order to reflect the fact that many people may be working or wish to work fewer than 19 hours a week and may be in just as much need as current FIS recipients. This would also create more of an incentive to work. I know a man who has two children and whose wife is having a difficult pregnancy and is off work. He works on a community employment, CE, scheme for 19 hours per week. He also works as a caretaker in a health centre on a contract basis and is paid €103 for ten hours a week. The family's total income is €510 per week. He is working approximately 40 hours per week. If he was working only 19 hours per week, he would be entitled to €610 a week. There is an anomaly here because, although he is working hard to provide for his family and pay the mortgage, there is a difference of €100 a week. While he is paid for ten hours on a Health Service Executive, HSE, contract, he informs me he is working approximately 20 hours a week to do what has to be done. That anomaly should be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1505"> Given the changing nature of the workforce, more focus is needed in the welfare system and the system needs to be more flexible. I welcome the Minister's statement that he plans to extend social welfare benefits to the self-employed. Treating the self-employed to ensure that entrepreneurship is protected and encouraged in public policy is of the utmost importance. Furthermore, FIS should be extended to the self-employed, under a system of selective voluntary opt-ins for them as well as those who operate small businesses. Self-employed workers should get the chance to increase their pay-related social insurance, PRSI, contributions to give them sick pay and unemployment payment entitlements. People who have to work for themselves and who in many circumstances give work to others have been given a very poor deal under the current welfare regime.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_418">
          <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Leo Varadkar)<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T22:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1506">I will do my best to reply to as many Members as possible in the five minutes I have been allocated and I will correspond with those to whom I cannot reply now on the issues they have raised. I agree with Deputy O’Dea’s initial comment that Estimates would be better done in the old way through committees and that is what is intended in future. We could spend more time scrutinising the Estimates in committee format where there are questions and answers, rather than this format.</p>
          <p eId="para_1507"> Deputy O’Dea said that the budgets introduced in the past five years were regressive. I dispute that. I know that is what the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, Stimulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes, SWITCH, model and other models say but those models are based on two false assumptions. One, they assume that a tax cut is the Government giving people money. I dispute that. I am of the view that people’s money belongs to them and when a Government cuts taxes, it is allowing people to keep more of the money they earned. Most people would agree with that. Those models, such as the SWITCH model and others conducted by academics, have no regard whatsoever for services. For example, an increase of 50 cent per week in social welfare is considered to be progressive but a second week of free child care counts for nothing. General practitioner, GP, care for everyone younger than six, including families with no income, counts for nothing. I am happy to make this argument and will do so in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1508"> I do, however, agree with Deputy O’Dea when he says there have been substantial cuts to welfare payments in recent years. There was the €16 a week cut taken from everyone on social welfare, apart from pensioners, under the Fianna Fáil-Green Government. Subsequent to that, while there were not cuts in weekly payments under the last Government there were cuts in real terms as a result of inflation because welfare payments did not increase in line with inflation in the past few years and there were cuts to secondary benefits. I am not going to pretend otherwise. I do also agree with him that it will take several budgets to restore the full value of benefits to the level they were at before the crisis. I do not intend to reverse all the structural reforms brought about by my predecessor which were designed to reduce welfare dependency and to encourage people to move from welfare to work but I do intend to reverse the cuts made solely with the purpose of saving money. I intend to do that, if I can, over the next four or five years and I hope I will have the support of the House in doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1509"> In response to the question on the housing assistance payment, HAP, a total of €24 million will be transferred this year; €20 million was transferred in 2015. There were just over 10,000 people on HAP as of 13 June - 1,261 in Limerick but none in Wicklow, so there is quite a large variation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1510"> Deputy O’Dea referred to the report on the back-to-education allowance, BTEA, as damning. It is damning in that it indicates that people on the BTEA are less likely to make it into employment than those who do not go back to education, but that requires much more study because it does not distinguish between people who completed their education and those who did not. That is not good enough. We need to make a distinction between those who managed to finish their education and those who did not. That requires further study.</p>
          <p eId="para_1511"> Deputies Rabbitte and Connolly mentioned JobPath. It is outsourced to two different companies, one for-profit and one not-for-profit. JobPath tries to get people into jobs that have contracts with wages. It assists them in different ways, helping them to get a certificate they may need or a course, even to the point of helping them buy a suit for an interview. It does not carry out work capacity assessments on people with disabilities. There is a bit of a campaign to try to make out that the reforms carried out in the United Kingdom, UK, are being aped here. That is not the case. That is total misrepresentation by certain campaign groups. Neither JobPath company has the authority to stop or reduce anyone’s benefits, which is in total contrast to what was done in the UK, where private companies could make those kinds of decisions and carry out capacity to work assessments on people with disabilities. Nobody on disability allowance is even being referred to JobPath, only people on jobseeker’s allowance. </p>
          <p eId="para_1512"> In respect of CE, Tús and Gateway, the rates of progression from those schemes into employment are pretty poor. They are designed for people who are long-term unemployed or people who struggle to get into employment. It would not be a good idea for somebody who is 21 or 22 and who is only three months unemployed to go into CE. It is much better for that person to get a regular job and the same applies in other circumstances. The real value in CE is assisting people in long-term unemployment and others who would struggle to get a normal job, giving them something to do and getting them started on the road to work. The real value is in the work actually done by CE schemes and communities. It should be aimed at those who are long-term unemployed, those who struggle to hold down a job, not those who are 21 or 22 and have been unemployed for only a few months who should be getting a regular job.</p>
