            <p eId="para_5">It is great to have the Minister of State in the House. He served at the same time as Senators Boyhan, McDowell, Conway and Burke and indeed with the Cathaoirleach. It is great to see there is a pathway for all of us from this House to very high office. However, we should perhaps follow more in the spirit of Senator Hackett who was appointed directly from here to Cabinet. I am going off on a tangent. </p>
            <p eId="para_6"> I would like to pay tribute to Deputy Richmond's predecessor, the former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English. He served this country with great distinction over a number of years in various Departments and ministries and I would like to pay tribute to all the work he has put in. </p>
            <p eId="para_7"> The reason I am talking about permits, and the Minister of State will know that this has been a somewhat political issue in the last couple of years, is that it has been difficult to get key workers in the critical sectors of the Irish economy because of the length of time it takes to process work permit applications. I know a lot of work has been done in the last couple of months to streamline them and I welcome that and think that is excellent. However, I am raising this matter in the House and with the Minister of State because I would like to know what his plans are, as a new Minister of State, and in his Department to try to streamline the process and make it more efficient. This will make sure that people who want to come to this country, to work in this country, and play a part in our economy and Irish society have the ability to do that as quickly as possible and are not left in limbo because of red tape and bureaucracy.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> To bring the issue to a more localised level in my county, in Dundalk and wider County Louth there are many examples. These include foreign multinational companies, of which we have a substantial number, who are trying to bring workers in and are not able to do so because of the restrictive and long drawn-out nature of the process. When I looked at Amazon for example, it was responsible for 3.5% of all the work permit applications in 2022. That worked out at roughly 1,394 people. That was 1,394 people who came to this country to work for just one organisation. Equally when we look at agriculture, and I have discussed this quite a lot with people involved in the agricultural community in County Louth, it has become quite difficult to source staff from local economies. That is why people who come into Ireland will play such a vital role in our agricultural process. </p>
            <p eId="para_9"> When one looks at the wider aspect, for instance home carers and medical practitioners, the concept is that we want to keep people in their homes for as long as possible and home care assistants play a vital role in that. It is about making sure that people who want to come to this country are able to do so in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> I am somewhat concerned about the speed of processing applications. Particularly for local economies and especially for Border economies like County Louth, it is very important. I have raised this matter and want to hear directly from the Minister of State what his plans are and how the process will be streamlined. I acknowledge a lot of work has happened in recent months to try to speed it up but there is a lot more to do. We have a concept that we have full employment in this country and we have people from right across the world who want to come to Ireland because we are an economic success story. We absolutely are and we have people coming here who want to work and contribute to Irish society and to the Irish economy. We should make that as easy as possible for people who want to come and work here and I would be very keen to hear the Minister of State's views on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">I thank Senator McGahon. Before the Minister of State replies, I would like to be very much associated with the words of congratulations to him. We all knew his capabilities and abilities when he served in this House and he chaired the Brexit committee. His portfolio is very suited to his skill set and we wish him well.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Neale Richmond)<recordedTime time="2023-01-24T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_12">Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh Gníomhach. I hope I receive that sort of welcome every time I come back to the House going forward, be it for Commencement matters or legislative debates. It is certainly an aspiration of mine in this new role to spend considerable time engaging with Senators on key issues, one of which is work permits, which falls within my remit in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I am grateful to Senator McGahon not only for raising this issue but also for his clear illustration of how it is impacting the people on the ground in Louth whom he serves every day as a Senator and whom he served previously as a county councillor.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> As he will be aware, the employment permit system is not just an important part of our workforce but also crucial for many businesses looking to expand and to hire more staff. One of the great difficulties but also one of the great opportunities at the moment is that we are at effective full employment in our economy and, therefore, businesses, unfortunately, are faced with a position where they cannot find Irish or EEA nationals available to undertake certain roles. These shortages are genuine. The work permit system seeks to fill this gap and to help these businesses to find and hire the necessary talent they require. Any opportunity for businesses to expand, contribute to our economy and employ more staff simply has to be welcomed across the Houses.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> I acknowledge that many Senators will have heard from businesses that have experienced delays in accessing their work permits, just like the employers in Senator McGahon's constituency. We previously found ourselves in a position where large demands for permits led to long delays. In 2021, alone 27,666 applications were received. That was a 69% increase on 2020 and a 47% increase on 2019, which, of course, was a non-Covid year. This was a high that had not been seen in more than a decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> These delays had an impact on processing times, but I am glad that they have been significantly reduced. The current wait and processing time for a permit has been reduced from 21 weeks at the start of 2022 to one to two weeks at a maximum now. That is a significant change that has come through dedicated work, most importantly by my predecessor in this role, Deputy English, work to which the Senator referred, but also by a vast array of officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment working with key stakeholders, be it in the trade union movement or in the employer sectors or with industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> This was done as at the start of 2022 an action plan was introduced to reduce the backlog. Resources were increased and more efficient methods of processing employment permit applications were applied. The processing time was trebled in size and daily output more than tripled compared with 2021 levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> Work has also been under way on a sectoral level in respect of access to permits. From November 2021 my Department introduced a number of key operational improvements in the way in which doctors can access the employment permit system. These changes mean that doctors in public health settings no longer need to submit further employment permit applications but, instead, can simply advise my Department of their HSE location, thereby reducing the administrative burden on the Department, the HSE, hospitals and the doctors themselves. This has removed many hundreds of applications from the employment permits system.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> The system is currently operating very well. The number of applications awaiting processing has fallen from approximately 11,000 in January 2022 to just under 900 as of this morning. That comes alongside a growth in demand for applications. The progress in the processing and wait time for these permits is a significant achievement and has been warmly welcomed by businesses across the country, but I know that many businesses may still have issues within the system and I am always willing to engage with them, to listen to the problems they may have and to see what can be done to improve their experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> An awful lot more needs to be done in this area. An awful lot of work is under way, but the level of engagement from the likes of Senators, who are on the ground in their constituencies daily dealing with applicants and businesses alike, will ensure that this process is continuously improved.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnMcGahon" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Senator John McGahon<recordedTime time="2023-01-24T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">The last point the Minister of State made was one of the most important, that is, that in his time in the Department his door will always be open for businesses still struggling with some aspects of this. That is welcome and it will be prudent of him in his role because it provides that direct line of access to businesses experiencing this.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> I will address a couple of points in the Minister of State's response, which was quite impressive. In 2021 alone ,there were 27,000 applications, a 69% increase on 2020 and a 47% increase on 2019. That does not lend credence to what many people in the Opposition say, which is that this is some sort of a failed State. We are at full employment, we have people who are coming here to work and they are doing that because we have a society we can be proud of.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> The other point I wish to note is that wait times have gone from 21 weeks down to one to two weeks. Again, that is down to a lot of the supports that were put in place and the fact, as the Minister of State said, that the output was trebled. That was welcome from the Minister of State's predecessor, but I am very keen to see the work he will do in this area throughout the rest of his time in the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_23">It is interesting to note two other statistics.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">Last year, we saw 80,000 Irish emigrants return to Ireland and we have net inward migration in this State. This fairy tale that some people want to tell, that people are fleeing Ireland and it is a failed state, is complete nonsense. People want to come here and they want to come home and they are welcome. We all recognise and acknowledge the societal challenges in bringing people back in and that there are difficulties in certain policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> When it comes to work permits, two areas are extremely important going forward. The Department has recently appointed IT system specialists to undertake the design and implementation of a new employment permits system, which will benefit many. Also, in December the Government agreed to establish an interdepartmental working group to develop an implementation plan for a single application procedure for employment permits and, crucially, the immigration permissions that will accompany them. This is a good news story that is worth talking about. I hope to work more closely on it with Senator McGahon and other Senators going forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">I join in congratulating the Minister of State on his appointment. My question is on the EU directive on adequate minimum wages. This is one of the most ground-breaking laws on workers’ rights to come out of the EU in the past 40 years. It contains a clear recognition that we cannot allow a large number of workers to be trapped in low-paid employment and poor working conditions and, crucially, to be left with no means to fight for better conditions and a more sustainable livelihood. There must be a recognition that every single worker is entitled to dignity and respect at work. There must also be a recognition that there are imbalances in workplaces.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">I thank the Acting Chair. I think he has taken about 18 seconds off me but we will pardon him that. I was talking about the importance of the EU directive on adequate minimum wages. It is crucial to say that this is not about hiking wages but ensuring there is a framework for workers to negotiate sustainable terms and conditions within their sector and employment. The question is about the timeline and process. What is the Department's plan to transpose this legislation? When are we likely to get the heads of Bill? We know that the Taoiseach, when he was the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, stated last October that he hoped to transpose this legislation by the end of 2023. Some doubt has been cast on that by the ministerial guidance provided to the Minister of State, Deputy Richmond, this year. It is vital that we get this process started sooner rather than later.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> Much of the legwork to put in place a comprehensive framework for better collective bargaining rights in this country was undertaken by the high-level group on collective bargaining, chaired by Professor Michael Doherty, who published his report last summer. It is vital that we have an understanding of the timeline. It is important because we know that more than one in four people in this country are low-paid. They are in the sectors that we are all too familiar with, including the care sector in communities and homes, hospitality, retail, agriculture, leisure and a range of other sectors. Just because we have so-called full employment right now, with major worker shortages, I appeal to the Minister of State not to fall into the trap of believing that people can leave those low-paid sectors, up sticks and get jobs elsewhere. They are there because they love their jobs and have trained for them. It is what they know and where they want to stay. They want to improve the conditions in their own sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> The Minister of State's Department has not covered itself in glory with regard to defending workers' rights over the past year. Joint labour committees for the contract cleaning and security sectors were supposed to be the good news stories with regard to how the State supports collective bargaining.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">Yet on three separate occasions last year the Department did not even bother to turn up to court, even though the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was being injuncted to prevent him from signing into law the security sector wage agreement. We were assured by the then Minister of State, Deputy English, the then Tánaiste and now Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and officials in the Department that they were working to resolve this issue but in August and, in particular, November and December, the Department failed to turn up in court. I tuned into proceedings on 21 December. It made a laughing stock of the State when the solicitor for those taking the judicial review, when asked what engagement there had been with the other side, said contact could not be made with the State. When the judge gave a date for the hearing he said that maybe "they" would turn up the next time, "they" being the Government. This is a very sorry and poor reflection of the Department's attitude towards workers' rights. I very much hope the Department will show much more enthusiasm, or at least a willingness, to transpose the spirit and intention of the adequate minimum wages directive because it is vital for workers in this country. There are 16,000 security workers depending on the Minister of State and the Department to sign the wage agreement into law. The very least the State could do is turn up to court and defend their interests.</p>

          <speech by="#NealeRichmond" eId="spk_13" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Neale Richmond<recordedTime time="2023-01-24T15:05:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_33">I am very grateful to Senator Sherlock for raising this extremely important issue. I will deal specifically with the adequate minimum wage directive as per her remarks. It is important to give a bit of background and context to what the Department is doing on the directive and its transposition. As the Senator is aware, the directive was published on 19 October last year and it must be transposed by 15 November 2024. I welcome the directive, as I did when it was published, as someone who, like the Senator, was once elected to the labour panel of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> The Government is extremely supportive of the principles of the directive. It must be noted that at the outset it was the Irish officials negotiating this who were pushing hard to have it achieved. The Government has consistently stated its full support for the directive and the obligations that will come with it. Officials in the Department have begun to consider their options for the transposition of the directive, including through bilateral engagement with other EU member states. This will be an extremely important part of the process. It is important to note the European Commission has advised that it intends to hold transposition workshops to assist member states in transposing the directive given the wide variety of approaches to minimum wage settings and collective bargaining throughout the EU. It is very important that we await these workshops before we make any final decision on the transposition of the directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> Our initial analysis suggests our current minimum wage setting framework, the Low Pay Commission, is already largely in compliance with the minimum wage provisions of the directive. We have one of the highest minimum wages in the EU. The recent announcement that we are moving towards a living wage by January 2026 will help us meet our obligations on the directive's requirements on adequacy measures and indicative reference values for statutory minimum wages.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> Article 4 of the directive, which deals with collective bargaining, is of particular interest to many stakeholders. The Senator referenced this at length in her opening remarks. While I will not respond on these matters directly because I do not believe they are appropriate for this debate, I will take the Senator's concerns directly on board and bring them back to the Minister. Article 4 requires Ireland to develop an action plan to promote collective bargaining. The work of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, high-level working group on collective bargaining, which was established to explore mechanisms to enhance existing industrial relations framework with a view to encouraging greater collective bargaining coverage in Ireland, is of particular relevance here. The group met 11 times and had a public consultation on the issue. It has submitted its recommendations. Officials in the Department are formulating proposals on the implementation of this report and with regard to bringing a memorandum to the Government on its implementation by the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> The Government is fully committed to improving terms and conditions for workers. Our commitment to this is not just a talking point. We made real and substantial progress on it during the Taoiseach's time in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This stands the test of time notwithstanding the one or two issues the Senator has cited. From the steady increases to the minimum wage, the progression to living wage, the introduction of mandatory sick pay, which I very much hope to see extended in the coming years, the new pensions auto-enrolment scheme and the right to request remote working, our work and commitment are clear. The directive will build on this work and further enhance the terms and conditions for workers in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">I welcome the detail provided by the Minister of State. Nonetheless, while he is waiting for the transposition workshops, we hope work is being undertaken in the Department in parallel.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> There are two further issues I wish to raise. The Minister of State's officials were heavily involved in the negotiations, which is very welcome. It is important to put on record that the Department at one stage wanted this directive to be delegated to the realm of a recommendation as opposed to a directive, but thankfully it is a directive now.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> Lastly, I refer to the living wage. I do not for a moment doubt the bona fides of the Government in terms of wanting to move towards a living wage, but the increase in the minimum wage, as of January 2023, did not move the existing minimum wage one iota towards 60% of median wages in this country. In fact, it remains stuck at somewhere around 50%. Again, I urge the Minister of State, in the context of his new role, to set out a detailed timeline on how he will get it to the living wage by 2026 because, right here and now, it is not in any way apparent.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">I reiterate it is important to wait for the holding of these transposition workshops by the European Commission so we can look at best practice in other member states as well as how we can lead the discussion in that area, taking on board the points raised by Senator Sherlock. The Minister has stated he is very keen to involve the social partners in discussions on the transposition of the directive in due course. That will feed, quite clearly, into the aspiration and genuine determination to achieve that living wage by the dates set out by the Government, which is something I will be putting the weight of my full support and enthusiasm behind in my new role.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The topic I have tabled for consideration as a Commencement matter is a matter of huge importance and grave urgency. A recent report in <i>The Irish Times</i> confirmed my own impression of the private rented-dwelling market, which is that landlords are selling up. Some 40% of houses now on the market are as a result of landlords selling. The reason for this is appallingly obvious and comes down to the fact the Government has hopelessly mismanaged the relationship between private landlords and their tenants and properties. This is not a novelty. In the past, the Department in question abolished, as best it could, bedsits and caused 10,000 to 12,000 people, at the bottom end of the property ladder, to lose their home. Now we have a situation wherein if one lets a house for more than six months, one cannot recover possession of the property except for four stated reasons: first, that one wants to sell with vacant possession; second, one wants to refurbish the property, in which case, one is obliged to offer it back to the tenant; third, that one has planning permission to redevelop the property; and, fourth, that one wants it for a member of one's family. Apart from those reasons, one cannot get one's property back from a tenant at the moment.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> All of that is compounded by a Sinn Féin policy initiative which states they want to bring about the situation whereby if one wants to sell a property, one must sell it with the tenants <i>in situ</i> so that anybody who has been there for six months can stay there effectively forever. The property must be sold with the tenants in occupation. On that issue, the concept of "tenant" has been changed yet again by a colossal mistake in the Department, in the Custom House thought process, to encompass anybody. If, for example, a landlord lets a house to three people who share it, after a while they are entitled to bring in other people and disappear themselves. Thus, the landlord ends up with three people he or she did not originally have as tenants because the onus is on the landlord to establish a good reason the substitute tenants should not be able to stay there forever as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">This is crazy because it means that if you let out a house fully furnished to a high standard, and I had an executive let property that was very successful, so I know about this and I got out of the market for the reasons I am describing, the Government is now saying you will never get the property back - if Sinn Féin has its way, you will never ever get it back - and you are responsible for things like fridges, cookers and everything else, you let with the house in the beginning.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> The time has come for the Government to cop on to the fact that it has driven out landlords and tenants and is now being helped by Sinn Féin's helpful policy proposal. The Government has driven out landlords from the private rental market. Some might ask whether this really matters because if a landlord puts a property up for sale, somebody will buy it. That is not a good response because the people who buy properties are different from those who can only afford to rent. There are families who cannot afford to buy for one reason or another but who need houses that they can rent and bring up their children in.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> A big US real estate investment trust that lets out a tower block of apartments that are empty and unfurnished is entirely different from a landlord who lets out a fully furnished house. If the Minister of State wants to know why landlords have left the market, it is because of Government policies and nothing else.</p>

            <p eId="para_47">The Government is committed to supporting the continued participation of landlords and growing their investment in the rental market. Budget 2023 provides for a doubling of the cap on deductibility for a landlord's pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties to €10,000 per property. The requirement for vacancy for associated expenditure to qualify for such tax deductibility has been reduced from 12 to six months. Under action 2.8 of Housing for All, the Department of Finance reviewed the recommendations of the 2017 working group on the tax and fiscal treatment of landlords. The Government provided further assistance to landlords under the Finance Act 2022 via a Government Committee Stage amendment, passed in Dáil Éireann on 23 November 2022, to provide a new tax deduction of up to €10,000 for landlords who undertake retrofitting works while the tenant remains <i>in situ</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2022 regulate the landlord-tenant relationship in the residential rental sector and set out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants. Section 34 of the Acts provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any Part 4 tenancy notice of termination served and that the termination will not be valid unless that reason relates to one of the following: the tenant has failed to comply with the obligations - other than the obligation to pay rent - of the tenancy; the tenant has failed to comply with the obligation to pay rent under the tenancy; the dwelling is no longer suited to the needs of the occupying household; the landlord intends to sell the dwelling within the next nine months; the landlord requires the dwelling for own or family member occupation; vacant possession is required for substantial refurbishment of the dwelling; and-or the landlord intends to change the use of the dwelling. To be legally valid, the landlord must also simultaneously forward a copy of any notice of termination served to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB. Further procedures and requirements apply in the case of tenancy terminations grounded on failure to pay rent.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> According to recent RTB research, the ongoing exit of smaller landlords from the market is a consequence of multiple factors, including legacy issues from the financial and property crash of 2008 and a challenging regulatory environment. The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland recently reported that four in ten house sales in quarter four of 2022 were due to landlords exiting the market. Its report cites the regulatory environment and low net returns as reasons for divestment.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> Building upon budget 2023, the Government is continuing to examine and consider the need for any further financial measures to assist landlords.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">The Minister has commissioned a review of the rental sector which will take into account the significant regulatory changes over the past several years. The Government will continue with its recommendations. The review will make recommendations on how our housing system can provide an efficient, affordable, safe and secure framework both for landlords and tenants. This would be very welcome. The review will include a thematic review of the principal and relevant elements of the rental market, and its conclusion will be utilised to inform future policy direction for the rental market. The review will include a public consultation as well as targeted engagement with the various external stakeholders.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">I appreciate that this does not fall within the Minister of State's area of responsibility, and I take that into account. However, what she said reflects a litany of confessions of failure. The reality is that there has been a mass exodus of landlords from the market. They are not being attracted back by tax concessions of the kind that have been announced. Telling a landlord that he or she can depreciate cost of fridge over a shorter period or that pre-letting expenses will be more deductible than in the past is no consolation for somebody who is losing control over their property. The the Minister of State's comment to the effect that the Department engages with all relevant stakeholders, including the Attorney General, the RTB and landlord and tenant representative bodies, means nothing. The Government has driven private landlords out of the market. What is happening in this regard is going to continue. What the Government is proposing to do, according to the Minister of State, will not end what is going on. The result is that fewer people will be able to rent houses. Only those who can afford to buy will be able to occupy houses throughout Ireland.</p>

I agree with Senator McDowell on that and on the point he made that they are not encouraged to remain within the framework of what they can really do.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> The review of which I spoke is already under way and will be progressed as early as possible. Any change to the Residential Tenancies Act will require careful consideration, taking into account the constitutionality of protected property rights of landlords. As stated, the Department engages with all relevant stakeholders, including the Attorney General, the RTB and landlord and tenant representative bodies, to ensure that any proposed legislative changes are made in a careful, fair, measured and balanced manner. However, the Senator should rest assured that I will take his views on the matter back to the Minister. There is grave concern across Government about the number of landlords exiting the market.</p>

            <p eId="para_58">I welcome the Minister of State. This matter relates to the young adult travel card. The Minister of State might recall that on 4 September 2022, a scheme was introduced whereby all students attending colleges and universities and doing apprenticeships and training courses would received a 50% reduction in the travel fare in order to allow them to attend their courses, etc. A few months ago, I asked that the Minister extend this further to include all students.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">I was glad that scheme was introduced and I welcome it. It makes for good public transport by making it more attractive. The discount is a great idea, not just from a cost-of-living point of view but also from a climate perspective. As the Minister of State knows, the 50% reduction relates to journeys to and from college in the South. As I said, this has been very welcomed and well received by all concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> Unfortunately, there is an issue with the scheme, one which I raised with the then Minister the last time I tabled a Commencement matter, regarding students from the Republic of Ireland who are attending colleges north of the Border. I understand there are approximately 2,000 such students. They live predominantly but not exclusively in the Border counties, as they come from various parts. Unfortunately, the scheme, as currently designed, does not cater for those individuals, which is unfair. I asked the Minister to have this examined and he stated he would get on to the Department with a view to having that done. When I contacted the Department and National Transport Authority, NTA, I was told that for a student from the Republic of Ireland attending a college in the North, the 50% fare reduction would apply for the portion of the journey that takes place in the South. However, the reduction does not apply to the portion of the journey taken in Northern Ireland. This is unfair to the students in question and their families given the cost-of-living increases. As the Minister of State knows, sending a child to college is very expensive. I ask that fairness be brought into the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> There is a precedent for this in that pensioners with travel cards are able to travel north of the Border. The card is as good in the North as it is in the South, and rightly so. From a shared island perspective and with the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement approaching, it is high time that this worthwhile and welcome scheme was extended to all students.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport. I thank the Senator for raising it, as I know he has done previously. </p>
            <p eId="para_63"> I understand the Senator is asking that the young adult card scheme be extended to include 50% discounted journeys to colleges in Northern Ireland. The Department for Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. However, the Department is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services nationally. The NTA has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport service contracts and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> I reassure Senator Gallagher that the Government is strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of that goal. To support this objective, in budget 2023, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, secured €563 million of funding for public service obligation, PSO, and Local Link services this year. As Members are aware, last year, in recognition of the importance of incentivising more young people to use public transport, the Minister secured €25 million in funding for the introduction of the young adult card. Funding has again been secured under budget 2023 for the continuation of this exciting initiative, through which 19- to 23-year-olds can avail of an average discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. Mature students in full-time education are also included in the scheme, as are eligible visitors to Ireland within the young adult age cohort.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> The young adult card was initially introduced on PSO services on 9 May and this extended to participating commercial bus operators on 4 September. Everybody was thankful for that extension because PSO services were not available in many areas. </p>
            <p eId="para_66"> To get to the nub of the Senator's question on the young adult card scheme and the future growth of the scheme to include 50% discounted journeys to colleges in Northern Ireland, I am happy to clarify that third level students can avail of a 50% reduction over the normal adult fares charges on the entire route, assuming that the origin of the journey and the third level institution are both in the South. I am pleased to have been able to clarify that. This means, for example, that if 90% of the journey is through the South and the remaining 10% is through Northern Ireland, the 50% discount will then only apply to the 90% of the journey that is carried out within the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_67">There seems to be a little bit of a contradiction there from what I am hearing. On the one hand we are saying that third level students can avail of a 50% reduction over the normal adult fare charges on the entire route, assuming the origin of the journey and the third level institution are both in the South.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">I welcome you, a Chathaoirligh, to the Chair officially at the start of the season. I also welcome the new Leader and wish her well for the term ahead in the next two and half years or so.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> On numerous occasions I have raised the issue of Inland Fisheries Ireland. I thought I would not need to start the new year talking about Inland Fisheries Ireland, but unfortunately I do. Last year there were three resignations from the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland, including the chairman. Already this year there have been two resignations from the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland, including the interim chairperson. It is safe to say that when any board has five resignations in the space of eight or nine months there are questions to be asked. The Minister must ask these questions of the Department officials. Why have those who have day-to-day responsibility for the running of the fisheries section within his Department not advised him to appoint members to the board?</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> Section 19(2) of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 states: "If an appointed member resigns, dies, ceases to hold office (other than on completing a term of office), ceases to be qualified for office or is removed from office, the Minister shall as soon as practicable appoint a person to fill the casual vacancy so occasioned". The Minister is very busy and has considerable responsibilities. However, certainly his officials have day-to-day responsibility in the Department for the running and oversight of Inland Fisheries Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">All public servants and State agencies must be accountable to a board. I am calling for a debate on the matter of Inland Fisheries Ireland. I also ask the Minister to make emergency appointments to the IFI board to allow it to carry out its duties and all the requirements of oversight. The oversight provided by boards is important in respect of the higher echelons of the agency for which they are responsible. Boards also have a role to play in liaising with the Minister, policy, implementing the corporate plan and every other responsibility they have. There are issues in respect of the appointments to the board. It is important. One hears things on the grapevine in these Houses and I am concerned that the Minister may now be advised by his officials to dissolve the board and start again. That is not going to solve the issues. Those issues and problems are not with the board. The board is doing its jobs. It was investigated by Mr. Conleth Bradley, senior counsel, last year, which was reported. Mr. Bradley found nothing adverse in that regard. The board is not the problem. The Minister needs to know and accept that. The board is not the problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_79">Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an gCathaoirleach agus leis an gCeannaire. It is lovely to be back here.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> The problems we had in 2022 did not go away during the Christmas recess. I will speak about the ongoing attacks on members of An Garda Síochána. The situation is becoming very serious. We should remember that an attack on a member of the Garda not only affects the victim but also affects the community he or she serves. A garda out of action because of an assault means one fewer gardaí who can provide policing services in the local area. More important is the garda's family. I can tell the House about the traumatic effect on the partners, wives, husbands and children of gardaí who have been attacked while protecting communities. It is causing severe upset and hurt to many families. It is scaring children and other people. We must speak out and be strong on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> I welcome the fact that the interim Minister for Justice, Deputy Harris, met Garda management yesterday morning to discuss recruitment in the organisation. There are plans to recruit an extra 1,000 members in 2023. The important issue is that the funding is there to recruit those gardaí. I checked this morning. Money is also available to recruit extra staff. It is important for all of us that those 1,000 extra gardaí go to Templemore and come onstream as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> We must protect all front-line workers. We have all heard about healthcare staff and others on the front line who are being affected and I will speak about them another day. My clear focus today is on the treatment of members of the Garda by an aggressiveness that is increasing, day by day.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> I have used strong words in describing attacks on members of the Garda. We need to continuously review and look at the relevant legislation. We must ensure that the Garda has every back-up possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> The Government is committed to the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022, which I understand will be brought through the Houses this year. The maximum penalty available for the offence of assault causing harm will be increased from five years' imprisonment to ten years' imprisonment when the Bill comes onstream.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> The issue of body-worn cameras is controversial. I want to ensure that the public are happy about the situation. I believe gardaí need those cameras. We might need to make decisions in that regard. Some people may have worries about the cameras and require reassurance. Perhaps at some stage we could invite the Minister to the House. I know the Government is committed to protecting our gardaí and creating the opportunity for more gardaí to be appointed. Perhaps the Minister will come to the House to discuss the matter in the not-too-distant future.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">I congratulate the Cathaoirleach and the Leader on their appointments. The changing of the guard seems to have been seamless, which is great. I will see what I can do to disrupt that as time goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">My colleague was speaking about An Garda Síochána. It is finding it extremely difficult to recruit people, as are the Defence Forces. The problem is the 2013 pension. There is no incentive for anybody to join either An Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces, leaving aside the pay and conditions and the assaults that take place. There is no pension worth talking about at the end of their service. I would ask the Leader to organise a debate in this House on front-line workers and how they are not similar to every other public servant. We might organise that in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> Rarely do people approach my house on the issue of what goes on in this House. Rarely do people speak to me about what goes on in this House. Anyone who follows my Twitter feed, and I know everyone in here does, will know that this weekend I was particularly preoccupied about what is going on in the Dáil today with the Minister, Deputy O'Donohoe. People ask me: "Have you guys nothing better to do than to pull each other's houses down?" We have attacks on the Minister to explain his electoral expenses and on Sinn Féin to explain its €7,000 in polling or whatever. People are sick to the back teeth of it. They do not want to hear it. Give the Standards in Public Life Commission, SIPO, the power it needs to do the job it needs to do and let us stop wasting Oireachtas time.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> I am two and a half years talking about search and rescue services in this House. Recently, I got the accounts of the company that provides helicopter services. It claims that it lost €6 million over the last two years. Does anybody want to talk about that in this House? Not yet; nobody has risen to support me on that. The national children's hospital has gone way over budget. Does anybody want to talk about that? Not really, apart from the odd grand speech. We should be carrying out detailed oversight of what is going on. I know that the Cathaoirleach has supported me at the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on the need for greater oversight and things like that. We need to start doing the job we are being paid to do. I would ask that people refrain from this petty squabbling that is taking place. It is unseemly for all of us. If there is something to be done then let us get it done and get it over with. </p>
          <p eId="para_90"> My good friend and colleague, Battalion Quartermaster Sergeant John O'Brien, and Orla Kettle are with us. BQMS O'Brien is from the 27th Infantry Battalion, which is the battalion in which Private Seán Rooney, who sadly lost his life in Lebanon, served. BQMS O'Brien was on duty that night. It is my great honour to have him here today. I would ask that we remember the risk our soldiers and our police force put themselves at on a daily basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">The Cathaoirleach is very welcome to the Chair. It is lovely to see him sitting there. I congratulate Senator Chambers who I am sure will do a fantastic job as she did as Deputy Leader. I very much enjoyed working with her and I know that I will continue to work well with her. I also wanted to welcome BQMS O'Brien and Ms Kettle. I thank them for coming in. It is very important that we have that meeting between the legislators and people who are impacted by the work that goes on here. It is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> I wanted to raise the really important and shocking situation in emergency departments in our hospitals around the country. I found myself in an emergency department in recent weeks. We talk about waiting lists and people's concerns but I wanted to say that the staff are doing a job that we all feel is one of the most important jobs and they are doing it seamlessly. I spoke to staff when I was there who were working 13-hour days with two breaks. One nurse told me that she did not like to take her final break because she hated the thought of people waiting for her to come back.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Thirteen hours a day is an awful long time for her to be on her feet and surrounded by people who have been waiting hours to get in to see her.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> Something needs to be done. I have a concern that we have an ageing population and we are failing to see that forward planning in many instances. University Hospital Galway has a catchment area with a population of 1.1 million people, which is huge. We are seeing some changes there as we see a new emergency department is on the cards and it has got the approval of Cabinet, but we are still a way off that. Even to sort out that one issue is not to sort out all of the issues around staffing. That is the number one issue that doctors, nurses and all staff across the hospital are telling us about and it needs to be resolved. It would be appropriate to speak to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and that we would have him in the House to discuss forward planning across a number of areas, in particular forward planning between him and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, on how we can get that workforce and ensure that people stay in the country, given over half of our doctors are leaving the country. That is an urgent debate that we need to have in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">It is great to see Senator Buttimer in the Chair and to see the new Leader, Senator Chambers. I wish them all the best for the coming term.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> I want to raise an issue which probably will not surprise people, given it is about dog welfare. I put this down as a Commencement matter and I will appeal the decision taken because I think the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a role in this case. It is in the Cathaoirleach's own county. Cork County Council issued a closure order on a puppy farm in Doneraile over the Christmas month, having sent improvement notices and flagged a number of different issues with the millionaire heiress, Ms Broderick, who owns the puppy farm. It issued that closure notice in January. When the council vets inspected it, they came across 218 animals that were confined to undersized kennels in sub-zero temperatures, without any bedding or heat source. They were lying in their own faeces and, in some cases, the dogs were not groomed. They were displaying all of the behavioural signs one will see with dogs that are under stress, such as repetitive movements and eating their own faeces.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> We then see those behavioural issues playing out when people bring the dogs home. They are coming out of puppy farms but they are not properly socialised, they are under stress and they are reacting. We then wonder why we have an increase in dog attacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> This closure order was very welcome. As I said, there were 218 animals. Ms Broderick had a licence for 50 breeding bitches onsite but there were over 200 dogs when the vets inspected the site and they issued the closure order. A concern has been raised by a number of different animal welfare organisations that the notice for closure stated that it is now up to Ms Broderick to rehome or resell those animals that were onsite. It is very hard to get a closure order in that there has to be a direct threat to the life of the animal, so the bar is very high. If Cork County Council felt the bar was met in issuing that closure order, I cannot understand how it can leave those animals on the property of the person who is responsible for inflicting that harm on those animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> I think that is an issue for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is why I put in a Commencement matter. I will appeal the decision. There is an animal welfare issue here. Those animals are not safe and they are not on the property of somebody who cares about their welfare. A precedent was already set in regard to the Myshall puppy farm that closed in Carlow, where 340 dogs were seized. When that closure notice was issued, the dogs were taken and rehomed, so I would ask why Cork County Council has not seized these animals. The other question is whether it is because the pounds and shelters are completely at capacity. I was flagging in advance of Christmas, before the Christmas dogs are due to start arriving at the pounds and shelters, that they are already over capacity. Those dogs need to be taken out of that premises.</p>

          <p eId="para_102"> I express solidarity with all those colleagues who have been subjected to appalling acts of hate and harassment over recent weeks and, indeed, a longer period. People in both Houses, and our local authority colleagues, have been the subject of shocking acts over recent weeks. This is not new, but we have seen new lows. I am thinking of my former colleague in Dublin City Council, Councillor Vincent Jackson, who has given a lifetime of commitment to people in Ballyfermot. To be subjected to that harassment is, frankly, appalling. People in this Chamber and those in local authorities have also been subjected to awful acts. I express solidarity with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> These acts are not just confined to the political system. Many people, including those who are new arrivals in this country and who are living in refugee centres, have been subjected to intimidation and harassment. From talking to Dublin City Council officials, particularly housing officials, they say that the past six months have been some of the worst they have ever experienced in terms of the abuse and threats that have been made by people. We see members of the Garda talking about a new low. At the weekend, part of the hand of a garda was bitten off. These events are truly shocking. There are no easy answers, but conversations need to take place about how communities can either tear each other apart or how we work together to better the services that are needed. We all get that there are frustrations, especially as regards the lack of housing and other services, but we need to do something to end these awful lows we are now seeing.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> I ask that the new Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coveney, come to the House. Just over 27,000 workers work with some of the biggest employers in this country. They face huge uncertainty as to whether they will lose their jobs because their employers have said they will cut jobs across their global workforce in the coming months. At least 2,500 jobs have already gone. We know the temporary business energy support scheme is not working for quite a number of companies, with very viable restaurants having to close. I ask the Leader to request that the Minister come to the Chamber for a debate on that matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">It is great to see the Cathaoirleach in the Chair. I congratulate the Leader on her new role. I hope everybody had a very peaceful and restorative break over the Christmas period.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> I am sure that many in the Chamber will be familiar with the disturbing findings in the most recent report on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, from the Mental Health Commission. It paints an absolutely stark picture of the state of CAMHS in this country. The report describes a disorganised, patchwork system operating in a chaotic and dysfunctional manner despite the best efforts of overstretched and exhausted healthcare workers. It is a system that is desperately in need of a radical overhaul to ensure that children's rights to dignity, safety and the highest standard of medical care are vindicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> So many alarming issues are revealed in this report. I do not have time to go through them all but I will share some of them. The lack of proper case management is truly shocking. The revelation that children are being put on anti-psychotic medications without the proper medical monitoring in line with international best practices is deeply troubling. Have lessons been learned from the major scandal in south Kerry CAMHS that emerged just a few months ago? The report outlines how hundreds of children have been lost in the CAMHS system due to a failure to follow up on their cases. The lack of care taken with these children is horrifying. It should make us absolutely outraged and inspire action, a desire for change and accountability. These services are seriously and dangerously understaffed. Some of them are based in inadequate premises and an overwhelming number of them do not have access to online case-management and record-keeping software. Without adequate staffing, resources and infrastructure these services are being set up to fail.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> As previous speakers stated, our healthcare system is deeply dysfunctional. It lurches from one crisis to the next. I fear that we are getting to a stage where this kind of perpetual crisis has become normalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">That is worrying. I worry the public will become so pessimistic and cynical that they will stop expecting anything better. A roadmap is needed for the root and branch revitalisation of CAMHS. Ring-fenced funding, minimum staffing levels, further legislative regulation in the Mental Health Act and a tangible benchmark that progress can be measured against are needed. This can no longer be waved away with promises and good intentions. We have to remember the Proclamation of the Irish Republic contains a promise to cherish "all the children of our nation equally" and here we are more than a century later with families at their wits' end with worry, struggling to access help for their children's mental health issues. We are in a crisis. This is not a feature of a functioning republic. It is a sign of a failed state, to be honest. I ask that Minister of State, Deputy Butler, address the House about her plans for CAMHS and her response to this report.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">I congratulate Senator Buttimer on his appointment as Cathaoirleach and wish the new Leader, Senator Chambers, the best of luck for the coming term.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> I will raise the issue of the evolving relationship and partnership between Coillte and an English investment fund, Gresham House, their formation of the Irish strategic forestry fund and the role that is being played in this process by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF. There is a lot of concern among the farming community, landowners, rural dwellers and the public about where this is going and what its consequences will be. The €1.3 billion investment in the forestry programme before Christmas was welcomed across the House. However, that was in the belief at the time that this money would be used to incentivise farmers to develop forestry on a smaller scale and be more sporadically distributed throughout the country. Now we believe it will be investor driven and that a large proportion of the €1.3 billion will go to investors as opposed to landowners and the farming community. Investor-driven afforestation will be larger and more concentrated in specific areas. Many concerned citizens and public representatives have contacted me about this. There are many more questions than answers. I ask the Leader, and indeed plead with her, to invite the relevant Minister to the House for a debate as soon as possible. This is an evolving issue which we must have the opportunity to discuss with the Minister at his earliest convenience.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">I am delighted to see Senator Buttimer in the Chair. I congratulate him on his role and wish him the very best. I also congratulate the new Leader. I look forward to working with both of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> However, I am beginning their tenure with a complaint that the Commencement matter I tabled this morning stating the need for the Minister for Health to provide a timeline in bringing the amendments to the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022, which relates to international surrogacy, to the Select Committee on Health, was ruled out of order on the ground that the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter. If the Minister has no responsibility in the matter, who does? He was able to come out on the Plinth to make a big announcement last December, following the report of the joint committee last June, that the Cabinet had agreed the amendments on international surrogacy and to legislate for same. The Minister had the responsibility and glory of making that announcement, yet he is not responsible for the delivery of the drafted legislative amendments. I do not understand where that comes apart. This is not a victimless delay. Tomorrow a case will be heard in the High Court. It is a further adjournment of a case to tomorrow's date where a man is potentially terminally ill and the mother of the children needs a legal status regarding their children. Last week, I spoke to a woman on the phone whose ex-husband had weaponised the children to such an extent, that because she had the temerity to lodge a maintenance request with the courts, he called the An Garda to the house. He can seize her genetic child at any moment because of the lack of legislation governing international surrogacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">It is not acceptable for us to say that it is out of order because the Minister is responsible for overseeing his Department's drafting of legislation and is accountable for that. I dispute that assertion. We will have the same thing with the apartment defects. There are real people whose lives are affected by this every day. If this decision stands, I want a debate on how the Standing Orders of the House work and operate. It seems to me that if a Minister has the glory of announcing a Government decision, he must be accountable for delivery of the associated legislation.</p>

While not aiming to strike a discordant note, as I explained in my communication to the Senator, this is predominantly a matter of scheduling. The Minister is not answerable to the House in respect of his schedule. The committees and the Houses of the Oireachtas set their own work programmes. I am happy to talk to the Senator further to see how we can progress the matter she has raised rather than having a discordant debate and difference of opinion here. The Senator raises some pertinent points as to how we can progress work as the Houses of the Oireachtas. In this case, I have adjudicated on the matter. The Minister should not have to respond specifically on scheduling, which is a matter for the committee. I am happy to talk to the Senator further on that matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_122">It is good to see the Cathaoirleach in the Chair today. Having come back from our Christmas break, we should waste no time beating around the bush. We need to address the single most important issue in this country at the moment: the Government's unsustainable immigration policy and what the Government's response will be to the public's reaction to its failure. As protests continue across the country, the Government must decide what its response will be. Will it double down, insisting that the policies in question are correct and above reproach, and have the State's media dismiss dissent and denounce concerned citizens as unwitting victims of brainwashing by nefarious overseas forces, or will it listen to the concerns of the people, engage in dialogue and be willing to at least entertain the notion that something it is doing might be wrong?</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> There is an entire generation of Irish people who have never known this country not to be in a housing crisis. Every week, you see tweets from young people saying that all of their friends are emigrating, most citing a lack of housing as the primary, if not the only, reason. At the same time, more than 70,000 recipients of temporary protection have entered the country, having been invited by a Government that refuses to cap the number of applicants in denial of the country's logistical capacity to accommodate them. Some of these people ended up sleeping in tents in military camps. Those who flagged this ahead of time were decried as being uncaring, unsympathetic and even xenophobic. Over roughly the same period, from 2021 to 2023, the number of people living in international protection accommodation services, IPAS, direct provision accommodation has more than doubled from 7,000 to over 19,000. The vast majority of these applicants for international protection are from Georgia, north Africa and sub-Saharan countries that are not engaged in any international conflict. In 2021, the Government said that it would end direct provision. Last week, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, stated-----</p>

          <p eId="para_128">Like others, I welcome the Cathaoirleach and the Leader to their new roles. I echo the comments of Senator Paul Daly, who expressed some of the concerns around what has been happening at Coillte and the lack of transparency there. I support his calls for a debate. Today's announcement of Oscar nominations is welcome. A record number of nominations are Irish or related to Ireland. It is particularly positive for the Irish content creation and film industries. We have sought a debate in this House on the future of the film industry, particularly with regard to the withdrawal of the regional uplift, before. I ask that the Leader consider asking the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, to come to the House to debate that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> In recent weeks, many of us will have attended the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">It is a wonderful exhibition and I commend BT on continuing to sponsor it, and Mari Cahalane for organising it. Shane O'Connor and Liam Carew from the Abbey School in Tipperary town won with a really interesting social science project about the impact of second level education, which I think can be used to inform adolescent life. A project that grabbed my attention was by two Wexford students, Leanne Mahon and Aimee Farrell from FCJ Secondary School in Bunclody, who studied the impact of vaping on young people. I know this has come up in this House before and we are to bring forward legislation to deal with it and restrict the sale of vapes to under-18s. What stunned me about part of their project was that vapes are now being sold alongside sweets and chocolates in supermarkets and grocery stores. It is a serious problem. I know from talking recently to Tidy Towns groups and committees that vaping litter is now one of the biggest problems in our towns and communities. I welcome that the legislation to deal with this is being prioritised by the Government. I hope it will have cross-party support in this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_131">I call for a debate on social welfare offices across this country. Before Christmas, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, outlined some of the extra supports she has put in place, such as the ability to move staff from other sectors of social protection into our social welfare offices to try to process applications as quickly as possible. The reason I am raising this matter today is because in my home town of Dundalk, people are now waiting seven, eight, nine or ten weeks for basic financial and emergency assistance. That assistance comes in the form of, for example, the white appliances allowance. Everyone in this House will know that when someone gets a new council house, they can apply for kitchen appliances like a cooker or a washing machine, for flooring or for other items like bedframes. This basic stuff is needed to move into an unfurnished house. In previous times that application might take a maximum of two weeks. People who were offered brand new homes in the first week of November put these applications in at that time but they have still not been processed. It is the same for those who apply for emergency funding for a deposit. They need €1,000 or €1,200 for a deposit straight away but they are now having to wait four, five, six or seven weeks. It is not the fault of staff in social welfare offices either. They are simply being overwhelmed by the huge volume of applications coming into them. I would like to call for a debate to find out exactly what the Minister's plans are to cut down these times, as she outlined before Christmas. I had a Commencement debate earlier today about work permits and the work that was done in the Department to cut dramatically the timeframe for processing applications. There is certainly a way to resolve and fix this. I would really appreciate if we could have a debate about that and what the Minister intends to do about it. To put it bluntly, it is simply not acceptable that someone has to wait a minimum of two months for a basic emergency funding application to be processed. We need to fix it. We need to figure out how to fix it, and we need to streamline those applications to get them across the line as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">I am looking forward to the new year, working with the new Leader and the new Cathaoirleach. Hopefully I will have as good a relationship with both of them as I had with the previous two people in those roles. I know I often get up to speak about the inequalities that the Traveller community faces within Irish society. For many years we have been the subject of hatred. We have been told that people do not want Travellers living in certain locations. We have seen Travellers' houses being burnt. We have seen lots of hatred towards our community. What is happening to refugees now, and what is happening in a lot of working-class communities, is fear-mongering and hatred. I know many a person from my community and beyond who is homeless. A few of them are single mothers, and some of them are desperate and in need of human rights and equality and for their needs to be met around housing or services within society. I just want to flag that. Not all of the people taking part in these protests are bad people. We have to understand that they are driven. I know that oppressed people can sometimes become the oppressors. According to bell hooks, "being oppressed is the absence of choices". I think it is up to this Government to take responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">We are not dealing with the housing crisis in the way we should be and there is no harm in saying that. It is not people's fault and the people who are here, be it men, women or children, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. I am an Irish citizen, born and reared in Ireland, and have often walked down the street and been called a scummy knacker. I have often heard them say "you don't belong here". So who is Ireland's own? I want to put that message out there because by God it is not the Travellers. People come here and my own experience is that two of my children were delivered by Muslim doctors. We need to be very mindful even in labelling people as racist as well. I am trying to get that out there. We need to be careful with our language because a lot of people do not know what they are getting themselves into. They do not know what they are driven by and that is hatred and fear. This Government needs to take responsibility that it is the problem regarding the homeless crisis, not other refugees.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">I thank the Cathaoirleach and also the Leader, Senator Chambers, for coming today. It would be inconsistent if I did not raise the march last Saturday in Limerick of more than 11,000 people, and the concerns around the hospital. We will have the opportunity to discuss that situation during statements later in the week. However, I want to raise the issue of 140 children in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 3 in relation to the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, has done an awful lot to try to turn services around, but we need to go a lot further. My concern is that in the interim report CHO 3 was the worst area. I know the main report is not due until the end of the year but to find that 140 children's cases had not been followed up, that many of them had no appointments, that many of them were on medication for longer than they needed to be, and that some of them were left to wait in accident and emergency departments to see a psychiatrist is really not acceptable. While I know the majority of those children have been reached out to at this stage, it should not have come to this. It should not have come to the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, had to ask for the report and that this is how this situation came about. This involves 140 children, which is quite a large number of children. These children did not receive the services that their families were reliant on. I would like to have a further debate on the issue because it is not just an issue for CHO 3 but a larger issue also. Would the Leader ask the Minister of State to come to the House in the near future to debate this issue?</p>

It is a travesty and it is difficult to believe that it was in 1961 that this drug was found to have caused birth defects. I was born in May 1961. I thought when I was writing a few notes today that strangely that is the year I was born and that I was lucky that my mother was not subject to this and that I was not subject to this. The drug was withdrawn in 1961 which I thought was a particularly interesting date as I read up about it again today. The action group and the people involved in it seek a fair and equitable compensation package to ensure their medical and social provisions can be looked after. I think that is reasonable and fair. They have heard a lot of promises and have placed a lot of store in meeting the Taoiseach last year and other people. For some reason we do not get beyond this point.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">Yes, I propose that No. 18 be taken before No. 1. The Bill obliges employers with more than 50 employees to publish the salary scales of the job positions they have on offer. There will be some form of redress in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, using the current employment infrastructure. The Bill will also prohibit employers from asking potential employees about their salary histories. I am delighted to introduce the Bill. My colleague, Senator Crowe, will second the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> I also wish to mention what many Senators have stated today. Senator Seery Kearney, who has left the Chamber, and I went to the Drimnagh for All United Against Racism rally on Saturday. It might be an idea to have a debate in the House on this matter because people are conflating the issues of homelessness and the refugee crisis. A big war is happening. It is not being called the third world war but it is the biggest war on our doorstep as a member of the EU. The war is still ongoing in many parts, and people are fleeing here for refuge and a safe haven. I am delighted we are giving them those. There are people driven by fear and hate, and those driven by hate are wrongly getting the support of those who are perhaps driven by fear. Perhaps the Seanad could lead on this because it is a conversation happening in every household in the country. It is so easy to see black and white in this, but it is a lot more complicated than that. We should lead on it to try to ensure that we are a bit more peaceful and that we talk about it a little more.</p>

It is a community group that challenged the inappropriate location of a waste transfer station in Ballinasloe, in low-lying floodplains. We received news this week that Galway County Council has noted that the planning permission has lapsed for the proposed site. It was inappropriate and unsuitable. This is such a win for Ballinasloe. As a community, we said "No" to hundreds of 30-tonne trucks coming through the centre of our town, the air pollution and the impact on our environment and waterways. I wish to thank a number of people. So many have been involved, but I thank my brother Brian, who started all this. There was an objection based on the outcome of a 1999 High Court order, whereby families all around fought against this dump without proper infrastructure. In December 2017, five years ago, we came together, a committee with a chair, Vincent Parsons, Eamonn O'Donoghue, Mick O'Neill and treasurers Niall Donnellan and Darragh Dolan. Our family and friends went out knocking on doors, in snow and ice, like this time of year five years ago. We knocked on every door. More than 500 people came to our public meeting on 10 January. Among our public representatives here, Senator Eugene Murphy was very supportive. Other public representatives and councillors attended. Thousands of submissions were signed as we challenged permits over the past five years in the High Court. Our amazing volunteers who had to organise fundraisers, everyone in our community, the clubs and businesses that donated - all gave of their time. There were all our musicians and artists who helped us with fundraising nights of music in our hotels, Gullane's and the Shearwater, as well as table quizzes, raffles, floats and golf classics. We did everything to raise funds. We did everything to fight this battle. I thank our legal team of solicitors and barristers.

As Senator Ardagh outlined, the purpose of the Bill is twofold. The main aim is to significantly reduce the gender pay gap. We are all familiar with that issue, which is discussed week in and week out. The Bill seeks to have salary scales and ranges published when companies advertise jobs on a consistent basis. It is important to highlight, as Senator Ardagh outlined, that employers will not be in a position to request details of current or previous salaries of applicants. This is welcome legislation and I look forward to working on it with my colleague over the coming weeks.</p>

          <from>Senator Shane Cassells<recordedTime time="2023-01-24T16:25:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_150">This morning, the National Transport Authority, NTA, officially announced the new greater Dublin area transport strategy, which extends until 2042. This follows Cabinet approval of the document last week. One of the first projects listed by the CEO of the NTA, Anne Graham, is the Navan rail line. Having represented the town of Navan and having fought for this project for a long time, I am delighted it has eventually become part of a multibillion euro package. I pay tribute to the people of Navan, who made their voices heard in this process. Of the 4,000 submissions the NTA received on all the projects across Ireland, some 2,000 of those, or 50%, came from the people of Navan and were for this rail line. That made the NTA sit up and listen to what we had been saying for years, namely, that the fastest growing town on the eastern seaboard, Navan, was the only one without rail connectivity.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> I am glad this project is firmly part of the transport strategy but I want to ensure we have a debate with the Minister for Transport on the entirety of the plan, including on the Navan rail line. This must be kept on track from a planning point of view. I have been here before with major projects such as the M3 motorway. There were many lads and lassies up trees or down rabbit holes protesting that project. There were more lads down holes along the route in Meath than we saw in <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox</i> and they delayed the project by a significant number of years, adding €150 million to the price. They did so for naught because the objections were flawed. I want to make sure the people of Navan, who are enthused about this news, get a swift planning process to make sure this project becomes reality.</p>

          <from>Senator Gerry Horkan<recordedTime time="2023-01-24T16:25:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_152">I am delighted to congratulate and address the Cathaoirleach, whom we called the Leader in a previous Seanad. I wish him the best. This is my first chance to do so since his elevation to high office. I also congratulate Senator Chambers on her appointment as Leader and thank Senators Mark Daly and Regina Doherty who previously held leadership positions for their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> The following point may have been discussed already and, if so, I apologise for raising it again. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on which the Cathaoirleach recently worked. I ask for a discussion on where we are with the national car test, NCT, system. I will not say the NCT is beyond repair but it is out of control. For example, the earliest appointment available in Deansgrange on the NCT system is on 4 September.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">It is not exclusive to Deansgrange. It is the same all over the country. I have looked at other places. Whether it is Carrigaline, Clifden or various other parts of the country it is months and months away. I can go in at any hour of the day and look for slots and I might find one because somebody has cancelled one in April or one in May, but that is it. There are not big blocks being released at any time. We need to bring in the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to ask him what is going on. We are bringing him into the transport committee but I believe there are many more Senators than those who are members of that committee who have issues relating to the NCT. It is everyone's responsibility to be in possession of a car that is roadworthy, but it is a condition of driving that one has a valid NCT. All over the country, we have people driving who are kind of okay because while gardaí will not turn a blind eye, as long as the car looks roadworthy, they will let them off, but the reality is the system is not fit for purpose, there are enormous backlogs and we must deal with it.</p>

        <speech by="#LisaChambers" eId="spk_68">
          <from>Senator Lisa Chambers<recordedTime time="2023-01-24T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_155">I thank all Members who contributed to the Order of Business today. Senator Kyne spoke and has mentioned Inland Fisheries Ireland on a number of occasion. You will be aware, a Chathaoirligh, about the sensitivities around that issue. I will request a debate on the issue with the relevant Minister and see if we can get it scheduled, albeit that might be a challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> Senator Murphy spoke about An Garda Síochána. We all concur with his remarks about the awful attacks on members of An Garda Síochána. Senator Craughwell also raised issues relating to the Garda and the Defence Forces, including retention and attracting people to the force. I will request a debate with the Minister for Justice, Deputy Harris, on An Garda Síochána, to deal with not just the issues concerning their safety and well-being but also pensions and the retention issue that is now plaguing the force, as we have already seen with the Defence Forces for the past decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> Senator Craughwell also spoke about the ongoing debate in the other House about the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe. We will await the outcome of that debate. I do not want to get into the ins and outs of that particular issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Senator Pauline O'Reilly spoke about hospital emergency departments. A debate with the Minister for Health was also requested by Senators Mark Daly and Maria Byrne. The Minister for Health is in the Chamber on Thursday for statements on health and emergency department waiting times.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Senator Boylan spoke about dog welfare issues. It is disgraceful to hear the situation. I cannot understand it. I appeal to Cork County Council to remove those animals without delay. They should not be in a facility where it has already been adjudicated upon that they are not safe. Those animals should be removed. I can only assume they are still there because there is nowhere to move them to, but that is simply not good enough. Plans should be put in place immediately to find somewhere safe for those animals. I hope that the full rigours of the law come to bear on the individual concerned because we need to send a strong message about animal welfare and safety in this country. Those types of facility have no place in this country. Nobody wants to see animals coming out of such facilities. I thank the Senator for raising the matter and for providing such great detail on the floor of the House on what is happening in that situation. I am sure it is not an isolated incident. We can be damn sure there are other such facilities across the country. A message needs to go out that they will be closed down and that proper action will be taken. I object to the idea that the individual would be asked to sell those animals and make a profit from them. In my view, the company is not entitled to any profit from those animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> Senator Sherlock spoke about the ongoing debate in both Houses and in wider society about the abuse meted out to politicians. I concur with her remark that all of us at some stage or another have been subjected to commentary that we should not have to deal with. Unfortunately, it is becoming part of the job, which is probably something we must push back against. It is welcome to see the issue being discussed and debated beyond these Houses as well. All we can do is continue talking about it and try to stop matters escalating.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> Senator Sherlock also requested a debate with the new Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coveney, on the jobs already lost in the tech sector. I believe she was referring to the tech sector and to the challenges in that space. The Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin, has also spoken about that issue, in terms of the readjustment that is happening in that space. Many new jobs were created in it during the pandemic but they are not being sustained. We will request that debate at the earliest opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> Senator Black spoke about the CAMHS report. We all share her concerns about the report. Senator Maria Byrne raised the issue as well. A debate is scheduled with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for Wednesday, 1 February on that report, and the entire area of child mental health. We will have that debate next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Senator Paul Daly spoke about forestry and Coillte. The issue was also raised by Senator Malcolm Byrne.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">That debate has been scheduled for 14 February with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue. We will have the debate in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> Senator Seery Kearney spoke around the issue of surrogacy. I commend her and others in this House, including Senator Ardagh, who have worked tirelessly on the area of assisted human reproduction with regard to the challenges and very real families and people who are behind those issues, and on the need to advance that legislation. I know the Senator will liaise with the Cathaoirleach on that Commencement matter. It is a matter for him to deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> A number of Senators raised, in slightly different ways, the issues with regard to international protection, individuals coming into the country and Ukrainian refugees. They referred to the challenges and strain that is putting on some services and the protests. Senator Keogan raised the issue, as did Senators Flynn and Ardagh. There are many angles to the issue. We have scheduled a debate with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, for Wednesday, 15 February, to address all of those issues. It is a lot to fit in one debate. Future debates may require scheduling but, at least, it will be a start for Members to put their views on the floor of the House. I appreciate there are different views on different parts of that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> Senator Malcolm Byrne seconded the request by Senator Paul Daly for a debate on Coillte, which has been scheduled. He also requested a debate with the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, on the future of the film industry. We will request that of her. The Senator also spoke about a project from the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition by two students in Wexford on vaping. I concur with the Senator's remarks. It is a worrying trend and good to see the legislation is progressing. It is not surprising the tobacco companies are the same companies promoting vaping. They looked to move from one product to another and obviously have targeted children and young people. What would one expect really, other than that type of behaviour? Thankfully, our legislation is moving in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_168"> Senator McGahon has requested a debate on social welfare officers with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys. We will request that debate at the earliest opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> Senator Flynn spoke on the area of refugees and the conversations and language being used. We have scheduled the debate for Wednesday, 15 February.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> Senator Mark Daly asked for a debate on emergency departments, as did others. That is happening on Thursday.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> Senator Maria Byrne spoke, as she often does, about Limerick hospital. That debate is scheduled for Thursday. She has also spoken about the CAMHS report. That debate is happening on 15 February.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Senator Boyhan raised the issue of thalidomide sufferers and has asked that the few remaining survivors be accommodated with regard to the compensation package. I know the Government is working hard to resolve that issue. I do not have a further update for the Senator except what is already in the public domain, but it may be worth a Commencement matter to see where the issue is at.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> Senator Ardagh requested an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 18 be taken before No. 1, which was seconded by Senator Crowe, to introduce the Remuneration Information and Pay Transparency Bill 2023. I am happy to accept the amendment to the Order of Business and I commend both Senators for bringing the Bill to the House. It is very important legislation. Companies of a sufficient size and scale should be in a position to publish full information and not try to have a race to the bottom with regard to pitting candidates off each other, which can often happen where the salary is unknown and a candidate is asked about a previous salary. Anything we can do to empower employees and people in the jobs market is a very worthwhile endeavour. I look forward to debating that legislation at the earliest opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Senator Dolan spoke about Ballinasloe, as she very often does. I think we are all very aware of everything happening in the community of Ballinasloe; good, bad and in between. I commend the Senator and others who worked on that campaign. I know it is a very proud moment for any community, when a campaign that is backed by such passion and support is successful and the community wins out. It is important to acknowledge the work done by all the team.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> Senator Crowe spoke about the Bill and the need to progress legislation with regard to pay transparency and remuneration. </p>
          <p eId="para_176"> Senator Cassells spoke about the National Transport Authority. I commend him for many years of work on advocating for the Navan rail line. He gives those of us who are campaigning for the western rail corridor some hope that, eventually, we may get there. It is very welcome and long overdue. Navan is a huge town and commuter area. It is a very difficult place from which to commute because of the lack of public transport. It is welcome that finally, at long last, the rail line is being advanced by the Government. I commend the 2,000 citizens who took the time and made the effort to make a submission. That makes the difference and this is evidence of it. The community has won today. It is great to see that announcement coming through and I commend Senator Cassells on his long work on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> A debate on rail is scheduled for Thursday, 23 February. We will debate the Navan rail line, the western rail corridor and any other rail matters the Senators wish to raise. </p>
          <p eId="para_178"> Senator Horkan spoke about the NCT system. It might be worth a Commencement matter to see whether we can get an update. I know there are challenges throughout the country. It is affecting younger people who are trying to get on the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">I know there are challenges across the country, especially for younger people who are trying to get on the road. It is a big issue in rural parts of my area, Mayo, where people are trying to get driving. It is essential for getting to work or to college. Many students commute. It is a big issue that is not being sorted. We would welcome an update on that. If the Commencement matter does not yield the information that the Senator requires, we will look to schedule a debate on it at the earliest opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">On the day that is in it, I will take the opportunity to congratulate all our Irish Oscar nominees. I am so delighted that "An Cailín Ciúin" has made history today as the first Irish language film to be nominated. Beidh sé go hiontach ár dteanga dhúchais a bheith á cur os comhair an tsaoil mhóir oíche na nOscars. I also congratulate Paul Mescal and Colin Farrell for their best actor nominations, and, of course, Brendan Gleeson, Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon. The record number of Irish nominations is a testament to the strength of Irish culture and arts. Déanaim comhghairdeas leis na daoine go léir a ainmníodh. Gan amhras, léiríonn siad go léir cumhacht na hÉireann mar fhórsa cultúrtha.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"><b>
						</b>I will return now to another stronghold of Irish arts and culture, namely, the National Concert Hall, NCH. Is Bille tábhachtach é agus tá áthas orm é a chur faoi bhráid an Tí. The purpose of the Bill is to provide the legal framework to support the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, and choirs from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall. This legislation represents a critical step forward for the concert hall as Ireland's national cultural institution for music by making explicit the role of the orchestra within that institution and formalising the relationship that has been in place since the establishment of the concert hall.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> It also strengthens the State's indemnity for the loan of international art, ensuring that our citizens can continue to enjoy access to important international exhibitions. Since the National Symphony Orchestra performed at the inaugural concert of the National Concert Hall in 1981, the orchestra and concert hall have been inextricably entwined in the public consciousness, most notably through their Friday night concerts. The NSO was founded by RTÉ in 1948 at a time when there was intense demand for broadcast orchestral music. Since then, however, the nature of media and its consumption have been transformed. This, coupled with the acute operational challenges facing the orchestra, has raised questions as to the appropriateness of its continued location within RTÉ. There was also a growing recognition that the orchestra could no longer reach its fullest potential within the structures of a public service broadcaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> In response to these challenges, RTÉ commissioned a report from consultant, Ms Helen Boaden, which was published in April 2018. It recommended that the orchestra become a national cultural institution in its own right or be positioned within the NCH and funded directly by Government. The report also proposed that the orchestra be restored to its historical levels of staffing and activity. For my part, this recommendation is critical to achieving greater engagement with audiences, developing education programmes and expanding the reach of the orchestra.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> In July 2018, the Government agreed that the NSO should be brought within the concert hall's remit. The Department commissioned a report that estimated the full operational costs of the orchestra to be approximately €8 million per annum. To support this process, my Department established an oversight group and a working group comprising representatives from the orchestra, choirs, RTÉ, the concert hall and the unions. During this process, it was agreed that the RTÉ Philharmonic Choir, RTÉ Cór Linn and RTÉ Cór na nÓg should also transfer to the concert hall given the collaborative nature of their work. Protecting the staff and ensuring that their rights were maintained was a key consideration throughout the stakeholder engagement. The Department engaged a financial consultant to provide advice on pensions and benefits to transferring employees. Following extensive consultation, all queries relating to the employees terms and conditions and pension entitlements were fully addressed. Having completed the consultation, the Government approved the transfer of the orchestra and choirs from the RTÉ to the NCH on an administrative basis on 24 January 2022. This transfer was affected on the advice that sections 7 and 9 of the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015 were broad enough to include the transfer of the NSO as part of the broader function of the hall to promote and support the performance of music. The transfer also complied with transfer of undertakings (protection of employment) regulations, TUPE, where transferring members of the NSO and choirs were guaranteed to retain the terms and conditions the enjoyed in RTÉ.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> Although the transfer was affected on an administrative basis within the existing legislation, I believe that our objective of a strengthened orchestra requires additional legislative underpinning. To that end, the Bill specifically provides for a new function for the concert hall for the management of the orchestra. It also provides for a voice for the orchestra at the highest levels with the inclusion of a new board member with orchestral expertise. I am pleased to inform the House that today, on the one-year anniversary of the transfer, the National Symphony Orchestra is in the process of being restored to its full playing complement. My Department has since provided sanction to the hall to recruit a music librarian and six musician posts on a permanent basis as well as more than 20 fixed-term player contract positions while the orchestra reviews its long-term needs. This is in addition to a significant number of additional support positions to meet the programming and other needs of the orchestra.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> Over the year, it also came to my attention that some of the orchestra's musical instruments required replacement. My Department has since provided substantial support to the concert hall for the purchase of a range of international quality instruments. All this investment is taking place within the overall redevelopment of the National Concert Hall as part of the implementation of this Government's national development plan. The concert hall, with the Office of Public Works, OPW, has developed exciting plans for the Earlsfort Terrace site. I was delighted to announce the Government's approval in principle of the project last month. The redevelopment plans will create a fit-for purpose 21st century auditorium that will establish the concert hall as the cultural institution for music, providing for new public spaces, new learning and participation facilities and spaces to support music resource organisation that are essential to our music ecology and much more.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> The Bill includes an amendment I introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil. Section 14 amends the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 to increase the limit of the State's indemnity for the loan of cultural objects from outside the State from €190 million to €1.6 billion. The original figure is no longer fit for purpose as it does not account for the significant appreciation in the values of artworks and cultural artefacts, nor for the recent growth in opportunities for important touring exhibitions to come to Ireland. Currently, our cultural institutions must arrange commercial insurance, which is a significant additional overhead. The State indemnity enables our cultural institutions to meet the requirements of international museums and collectors, making Ireland a more attractive candidate for high-profile exhibitions.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Returning to the detail of the detail of the Bill, I acknowledge the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media and its examination of the general scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The purpose of the Bill is to bring the orchestra and choirs within the statutory framework of the concert hall, providing for appropriate reporting to me and to the Oireachtas. It also provides for the legal transfer of all undertakings related to the orchestra to the concert hall as well as amending the Broadcasting Act 2009 to reflect the transfer of the orchestra from RTÉ.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> I will now introduce the specific provisions of the Bill. The Bill is divided into four Parts. Part 1 deals with general provisions such as the Short Title and definitions of terms in the legislation. Part 2 provides for the transfer of functions, staff, property, and liabilities relating to the orchestra and choirs from RTÉ to the NCH. These provisions date from the transfer day of 24 January 2022. This Part amends the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015 by inserting a number of new sections into the principal Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> Section 4 provides for the transfer of functions, administration and business relating to the orchestra and choirs from RTÉ to the NCH on the transfer day. Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, are technical in nature and provide for the transfer of all undertakings, staff, assets and liabilities relating to the orchestra and choirs to the NCH on the transfer day.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Section 9 substitutes the name of the National Concert Hall for that of RTÉ in any legal proceedings relating to the orchestra or choirs while section 10 provides that every act done by RTÉ or the NCH in respect of the transfer prior to the commencement of this part shall be deemed valid and effectual for all purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> Part 3 sets out a number of amendments to the principal Act to reflect the integration of the orchestra and choirs into the operation of the NCH. In this regard, the critical section is section 11, which amends section 7 of the principal Act by adding a new function for the maintenance and operation of an orchestra and choir to the functions of the concert hall.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Section 12 builds on this by including the orchestra in the corporate governance structures of the concert hall. It does this by amending section 10 of the principal Act to increase the membership of the board from eight members to nine. This additional board member is required to have expertise in the development of orchestras, ensuring that the appropriate expertise is present on the board at all times. Following on from that, section 13 is a technical amendment to increase the quorum for board meetings from four to five.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> As I outlined previously, in Part 4, section 14 amends the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 to increase the limit of the State's indemnity for the loan of cultural objects from outside the State from €190 million to €1.6 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> The final Part, Part 5, amends the functions of RTÉ, as set out in section 114 of the Broadcasting Act 2009. Section 15 replaces RTÉ's previous function to manage orchestras and choirs with the function of managing a concert orchestra only.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> Although largely technical in nature, the Bill represents the culmination of the journey that the NSO, the NCH, RTÉ, myself and my Department have been on in recent years to build a stronger orchestra within a dedicated national cultural institution for music. The legislation represents the beginning of a new chapter, as we turn our minds to supporting the orchestra and the concert hall to thrive in an evolving environment and to remain at the heart of music in Ireland for generations to come. When President Hillery opened the National Concert Hall in 1981, he described it as "the realisation of a dream long cherished". This Bill brings that dream, shared by music and arts lovers nationwide, closer to reality. Mar a deireann an seanfhocal, is fearr súil romhat ná dhá shúil i do dhiaidh. Táim cinnte go bhfuilimid go léir ag cur ár súile romhainn leis an mBille seo. I am delighted to bring the Bill before the Seanad. I look forward to hearing the contributions throughout Second Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_206">I thank the Minister for her presentation and outlining the provisions of the Bill on the National Concert Hall. It is exactly one year on today from the agreement that has paved the way for the Bill and the formalisation of the relationship between the NSO and the NCH.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> The Minister mentioned the challenges the symphony orchestra was facing and the Boaden report of April 2018. It gave me cause to look back on notes from that year because we dealt with the Boaden report in the committee in October 2018. At the time, I recall that the head of RTÉ Lyric FM and the RTÉ orchestras, Mr. Aodán Ó Dubhghaill, told the committee that RTÉ had seen its total income decrease by approximately €100 million in the period 2008 to 2016. He also referred on that particular occasion to the licence fee still being unreformed. He outlined that budget cuts of some 11% had left morale in the orchestras at a low ebb, and that RTÉ had to sharply reduce commitments to touring and the educational activity of the orchestras. He stated that the review concluded that neither of the two full-time orchestras should be closed. That was the reason we were dealing with the report at the time. There had been petitions from members of the public who cared about the orchestras and the cultural history of this country and believed that an effort must be made to save them. The recommendation was that the NSO should be established as either a cultural institution in its own right or become part of the National Concert Hall. I noted in my contribution at the time the fact that both orchestras, as well as being intrinsically linked to the NCH, did have a record of touring. As a local representative, I was privileged to welcome the orchestra to the Solstice Arts Centre in Navan, which I opened. The overall aim of the decision regarding the transfer is to enable the orchestra to be established as a world-class orchestra, which with the NCH would provide a creative, imaginative programme strategy that would greatly enhance the offering of the combined organisation to the public. It is important to note that in last year’s budget the Minister alluded to the cost of running an orchestra and that approximately €8 million was transferred to enable the transfer of the symphony orchestra and the choirs to the NCH, which would largely equate to the estimated running cost of the NSO.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> The finalisation and formalisation of this process comes at the perfect time. It is in conjunction with the vision the Minister and the then Taoiseach, now Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin, announced before Christmas on the redevelopment and enhancement of the NCH. It is a superb vision for a superb space, one that is enjoyed by all of us. In the month of December alone, I attended three different performances, ranging from the “Sunday Miscellany” Christmas performance, which on that occasion used the RTÉ concert orchestra, acoustic sessions and the collaboration with the orchestra by the internationally renowned composer, Brian Byrne, who just happens to be from Navan.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> As we do, the Minister values the cultural history, resonance and significance of the symphony orchestra, concert orchestra and the choirs. The process that started on this day last year, to ensure their survival was a proud day. It was a good day for the cultural integrity and history of this country. In conjunction with that, the Government and the Minister are investing in the physical edifice, which is so intrinsically linked. When we looked at all of this following the Boaden report, most people had intrinsically linked the symphony orchestra with the building. We have a perfect collaboration and coming together as well as the securing of the future of the symphony orchestra and the enhancement of the physical edifice of the National Concert Hall, which it occupies and brings to life.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Many have spoken in the past about things that have been done wrong. This is a significant step for the enhancement of our orchestras and the cultural stamp they leave on this country. I pay tribute to the Minister. I look forward to the swift progression of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_211">The Minister is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I want to echo her comments about what has been a great day for the film industry here in Ireland when we see the nominations. I see that Paul Mescal has been nominated for a best actor award. One of his first films, “Drifting”, was filmed by two young lads from Granard in County Longford, Robert Higgins and Patrick McGivney from Harp Media. Their film, “Lakelands”, which was filmed at home in north Longford, won an award at the Galway film festival and it is featuring at the Santa Barbara film festival in the first week of February. It is based around the GAA back home in north Longford but it has gone international. It is important to put on the record the support from the various arts offices, but critically from Screen Ireland, to a lot of these productions. It is the investment that has been put in by the Government that is seeing days like this and success like this, which needs to be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> The Bill makes sense. Some of us in this Chamber can be a bit critical of RTÉ but it makes sense that RTÉ concentrates on television and radio, and that things like the orchestra and the choir would be transferred to the National Concert Hall, where the vast majority of the performances are and where the expertise is based. It is only from now on that we will be able to see both the choir and the orchestra enhanced and expanded. That is important and it is a very sensible move to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> It also ties in with the announcement that was made before Christmas by the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government to support what is a hugely ambitious project to make the National Concert Hall one of the world’s great centres for music, culture and arts. It ties in with the proposals for the national theatre. A number of the committee members met with the directors in the Abbey Theatre prior to Christmas to discuss plans there and the commitments from the Government to turn that into a national theatre that we can be proud of on an international scale. The plans that are in place to face that onto the River Liffey will set out Dublin as our capital. When both the theatre and the concert hall are finished, they will stand out worldwide. It is important that we put in that investment. It is ambitious but we are an ambitious Government and we have an ambitious Minister in place. We have the right Minister in the portfolio who is prepared to drive on these projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> As I said, it is a flagship project for the country to develop the concert hall. It is part of our national development plan so the commitment is there from the Government to enhance the arts in this country, which is important. It is a sensible decision that we are making today to move it over to the National Concert Hall on what is one of the great days for Irish arts, when we see such a significant number of our films nominated for Oscar awards. I commend the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">The best gig I was ever at in the National Concert Hall was Frances Black - I am serious about that. I welcome the Minister to the House. It was a pleasure recently to visit Robert Read and the team in the National Concert Hall and to get a tour of the site. There is so much potential there, particularly for the secondary venue in addition to the main auditorium. It is the type of size that Dublin seriously needs. Vicar Street has a 1,500 standing capacity but when we go smaller than that, there is really only the Button Factory and Whelan's. There is absolutely a need and I think the National Concert Hall is the place that could fulfil that need, particularly if, as the Minister said, it wants to be at the heart of music and if it wants to be the primary music institution in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> Obviously, we will be supporting the Bill. It is a bit of a shame that the orchestra could not reach its full potential in RTÉ, and there are reasons for that. It will cost the same amount, no doubt, but I welcome the fact it will now have a full complement of members. I know from some colleagues in the Musicians Union of Ireland of the issues over the years, and the full complement of members is certainly one issue, as well as the instruments, as the Minister has stated. I commend her on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> I welcome the capital development. I would ask if the figures identified in the national development plan and Project Ireland 2040 need to take account of inflation, and the Minister might comment on that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> I want to flag that there are concerns around some of the events like the Haunted Dancehall event that took place in the National Concert Hall under the national cultural institutions licence, as well the Pride events in Collins Barracks. I commend the National Museum of Ireland on using the cultural institutions licence for public events. There is concern that the proposals in the Department of Justice’s Sale of Alcohol Bill on the cultural amenities licence would not improve on the national cultural institutions licence, and that we would be essentially taking away some of the benefits of that licence if we were to go down the road of the cultural amenities licence. I would welcome the Minister's comments on that. We would all support more use of that national cultural institutions licence. It was great to see the concert hall use it recently but there are concerns about the changes to legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> Sin é. I thank the Minister for coming to the House. I welcome the Bill, which we will be supporting.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Senator Michael McDowell<recordedTime time="2023-01-24T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_221">I want to say a couple of things about the Bill. It does make sense for RTÉ to be divested of responsibility for the National Symphony Orchestra because I think RTÉ has to concentrate on the day job, so to speak, of getting its own finances in order and seeing its role as a broadcaster. I am strongly in favour of public sector broadcasting. I regard one of the frightening things that is happening in the United Kingdom as an agenda on the part of the Conservative Party to bring down the BBC, which is one of the great institutions of that jurisdiction, and we in this country should remember how important public service broadcasting actually is and how important it is to conserve it and improve it. If a narrowing down of the focus of the RTÉ authority enables it to concentrate on the day job of public service broadcasting, I am happy to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> There are two points I want to make in regard to this legislation. First, it will improve the financial position of RTÉ notionally and, second, it will improve its concentration on its mission statement. I want to reiterate something which I have spoken about for six years now, since becoming a Senator again, and that is the whole question of financing public service broadcasting. I really believe the Government is funking that issue. It would make far more sense to stop all this interminable advertising on television and radio, reminding us about the need to have a television licence, the cost of collecting it and the cost to RTÉ of unpaid licence fees, and so on, and if that revenue flow was realised by reference to residential property tax and, in the case of commercial properties, by using broadcasting facilities, such as hotels and places of entertainment, and their local authority rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">It is almost impossible to ethically work out, if you look at some matters on your tablet at home, whether you are breaching the requirement for a TV licence. By the same token, there is the absurdity that some families who go for a holiday for two weeks per year to Bunclody, Brittas Bay or wherever else it may be in Ireland, are theoretically obliged to apply for a second TV licence for that premises just because they bring a mobile TV set with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> It seems to me that the fairest and most rational way to finance public sector broadcasting is to give up the notion of a licence because it is impossible to license phones, laptops and tablets in any rational way. The former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Pat Rabbitte, talked about people living in a cave who do not have access to these things and was dubbed the man in charge of the cave tax project at the time. Let us be honest; it is almost impossible to say that any household is not receiving what might broadly be described as visual broadcast services through various devices in the house. It seems to me that the most rational way of recovering money to subsidise public service broadcasting would be to apply it to every home in the country, no matter what. There are very few people who have abstained completely from any connection with public service broadcasting. Even the people who get public service radio broadcasting are no longer required to pay for a radio licence but the TV licence covers it. The time has come for us to get modern and efficient and to stop the incessant advertising on the radio and television about the requirement to have a licence and the good news that this advertisement is brought to you by the Government of Ireland, which always amuses me, as if this to try to improve Government popularity. We should face up to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> On the National Concert Hall campus, I am old enough to remember going to a freshers exhibition in University College Dublin, UCD, in what is now the National Concert Hall, which was then a big empty space used for study and exams by UCD. The National Concert Hall has its limitations and I would encourage the Minister to think big on this and to use that extensive campus, which has the Iveagh Gardens at the back of it and the old medical schools of UCD to one end, to generate an even better hall than the present one. I would strongly support any way that can be done within the budgetary envelopes for capital expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> I support the purpose of the Bill, which is sensible. If RTÉ is concentrating on the day job, that calls into question whether RTÉ 2FM is necessary. There are plenty of radio stations providing that service. I do not know whether it is a financial breadwinner for RTÉ or whether it costs more than it receives in advertising revenue. There are a vast number of music stations in competition with it and unless there is a strong case for its retention, I suggest that it be disposed of in order that the core function of public service broadcasting can be concentrated on. When we look at the output of RTÉ, at its best it is very good. I am not suggesting that it should be a channel for pointy-headed intellectuals but there are huge opportunities to improve our knowledge and deepen our culture by using and subsidising public service broadcasting and giving RTÉ adequate resources with which to carry on that function. It is for this reason that I strongly support this legislation but I ask the Minister to consider whether the time has not come to grasp the nettle of the TV licence and to recover the same revenue and even more revenue through the change I have spoken about.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">I thank the Minister for coming to the House. I too want to be associated with her words of congratulations to the Oscar nominees. It is truly remarkable that we have 14 Irish nominees spanning five films. Go háirithe, tá an-chreidiúint ag dul go Cleona Ní Chrualaoi agus go Colm Bairéad agus luaim a hiarrachtaí chun dul chun cinn a dhéanamh lenár dteanga dúchais trí mheán na scannán. Huge congratulations, déanaim comhghairdeas ó chroí with them in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> I warmly welcome the Bill, particularly the enhancement of the National Concert Hall with regards to the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra and the three choirs that were previously with RTÉ. We are all aware of how important a role the National Concert Hall has played over many years in providing a platform for orchestral and choral performance and for soloist and classical music but huge credit is due to the National Concert Hall for how it has broadened the number of musical genres it has covered, particularly in the last decade. Senator Warfield touched on the Haunted Dancehall event that it held last October, which showcased up-and-coming electronic and experimental artists. That is music we would never expect to hear in the National Concert Hall but it was wonderful that it embraced such diversity. I applaud the National Concert Hall and urge it to do more of that into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> On the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra, the RTÉ Philharmonic Choir, Cór Linn agus Cór na nÓg, I am conscious that there were a lot of concerns when this was first mooted following the publication of the Boaden report. In particular, the RTÉ group of unions was concerned about their participation and with regard to the number of vacancies and funding for the orchestra in particular. There is a real sense and a greater assurance that there will be more funding, which is good to hear. It is also good to hear that the current vacancies are to be filled. I am aware, however, that there are significant management issues relating to the orchestra, which will definitely need to be ironed out if the true potential of the orchestra in the National Concert Hall is to be fully realised. It is a matter for the National Concert Hall but we cannot allow matters to escalate any further and they will have to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> I refer to the potential of the National Symphony Orchestra. There is huge opportunity to ensure the orchestra located in the National Concert Hall can reach out to diverse and previously untouched communities that would never have had an orchestra come visit them. There are a number of striking points in the Boaden report. It states that when Ireland's public service orchestra is compared with those in other countries, there is a lack of touring opportunities and fewer occasions when people outside the main urban centres ever get to attend a live orchestral event. There is also the lack of a mandate for a required number of broadcasts per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">I would love to see the National Symphony Orchestra's remit being developed with regard to broadening the appeal of orchestral work. The redevelopment plan for Earlsfort Terrace and the National Concert Hall is very welcome. In particular there is a great opportunity to broaden even further the number of musical genres that can be accommodated in the new facility.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">The Minister is very welcome to the House. I hope she and her team had a nice break over the Christmas period. I would say it was a well deserved break. I want to be associated with the congratulations to the Oscar nominees, especially "An Cailín Ciúin". It is one of the finest films I have ever seen. Even thinking about it makes me emotional. It is powerful and I recommend that anybody who has not seen it do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> On our first day back in session, it is lovely to be speaking about unmistakably good news. The Bill formalises and reinforces a process that has already been completed, namely, the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall. It is a process that has generated a great deal of optimism and goodwill and could signal a revitalisation of the orchestra's capacity and connection with the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> The Minister's commitment of funds to secure the continued existence of an important part of our collective cultural heritage sends a very positive signal that Ireland is a country that values music and the people who make it. I always say that music is so important because at its best it is a powerful emotional experience that we can share with our friends and loved ones and with total strangers. When a great show ends and the applause dies down the audience sits in a moment of silence readjusting to normal life. I have lived that experience many times. In a society that can feel increasingly automatised and so many factors drive us towards consuming vacuous media at home by ourselves, coming together to hear live music is restorative and life informing. As a performer myself, I absolutely love it and I am sure the Minister has experienced it herself.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> Supporting the arts is not just about an abstract notion of preserving culture or even the direct tangible maintenance of performance. It is about preserving public spaces that allow for the collective experience of joy and exhilaration that art and music can inspire in us. I am very hopeful that the move to the National Concert Hall and the funding provided to facilitate it will contribute to the orchestra being restored to its former glory. The orchestra was becoming a little bit run down in the latter years of its residence in RTÉ, with dwindling numbers and even several years without a principal conductor. This decline in staffing was an act of abject cultural vandalism. It is heartening to see the Government take action to reverse it. I hope this move will see the orchestra restored not only in number but also in morale and ambition.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> TU Dublin academic Dr. Adrian Smith wrote an article about this transition that was very helpful in bringing me up to speed with the recent history of the orchestra. He mentioned the demoralising effect of the reliance on freelance performers to make up most of the unfilled vacancies. This is a very important point. Music has often been a precarious and uncertain profession. If the orchestra is in receipt of public funding, it should be employing musicians on good, secure contracts. Employers paying people with State money should model the ethical and responsible practices to which we would aspire to see throughout the labour market. The recent pandemic showed just how vulnerable musicians are to losing their livelihoods. Thankfully, the Minister listened when musicians and performers banded together to ask for help in that instance. Otherwise we would have emerged from the Covid restrictions into a barren cultural landscape. The withdrawal of pandemic era supports from musicians before the sector fully recovered from the impact of Covid has been a real blow for many in the unfunded sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> I celebrate unreservedly the increased support for the orchestra and the Arts Council. The basic income for artists pilot scheme is an exciting and innovative idea. The Minister has a lot to be proud of. I have to say though that I do think about the uncertain future faced by many unfunded musicians. I worry that they do not get the support they need. Sometimes there is a reductive understanding of classical music as an elite pursuit. Steps have been taken to make it more accessible to modern audiences. Orchestral performances of iconic film scores and the presence of orchestras at popular musical festivals are innovative. Democratic methods are broadening the appeal of classical music.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> It is also important that the orchestra can travel and play in various parts of the country. This is a shared asset. The largest possible section of the population should be able to benefit from it. An open and welcoming culture of music appreciation and learning has the potential to bridge cultural divides and inspire people to pursue their passions. I warmly welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister, her staff and the team in the Department on all of their efforts in this area. I also thank my colleague Senator Warfield for his lovely compliment.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, on our first day back to discuss this national cultural institutions Bill. Today has seen the highest ever number of nominations for Irish artists and films at the Oscars. It is an incredible feat and we are very proud of it. We are proud of "An Cailín Ciúin" and "The Banshees of Inisherin". "The Banshees of Inisherin" showcases the most stunning landscapes. Coming from the west I will speak proudly about it. It features Inis Mór on the Aran Islands and Achill Island in Mayo. It looks amazing. It is a film that is comic and dark at turns but the landscape at each and every turn takes our breath away. As part of her remit, the Minister is looking at how to encourage tourism in Ireland. One of the elements she is looking at is a global invitation programme. Given that Ireland is now on the world stage at the Oscars, with our language, culture and landscape, it is time to make an impact with tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> The National Concert Hall is a place much loved by people all over the country. For years, I worked just off Baggot Street in Dublin. I used my lunch hour to try to fit it all in and see some of the lunchtime events at the National Concert Hall. For a very competitively priced ticket of €5 or €10, I could see a symphony orchestra. I was able to come out of my day of work at lunch hour and sit down and see 40 to 50 people play music just for me - and for everyone else who was there. Over the past 20 years that I have known it, the National Concert Hall has gone out of its way to make music accessible. Whether it is Debussy, Ravel or Sibelius, or whether it is discovering the joy of Tchaikovsky in full symphonic flow, this is what the National Concert Hall is for. It is an absolute jewel that we have in Ireland. I appreciate what is done to make it accessible.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> I would like to ask the Minister about apprenticeships and how people might be able to get involved. There are music partnerships, including Music Generation, in the local authorities in Galway and Roscommon. There are ways in which children get to learn about music. There is an amazing town band in Ballinasloe. Phenomenal people have come from our town, including Eímear Noone who went on to be a female composer at national and global level. Music is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> I acknowledge that the Bill will bring the RTÉ Concert Orchestra, Cór na nÓg and RTÉ Cór Linn from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall and I will appreciate seeing them come together. I want to ask about increasing the size of the board by just one member. Is this sufficient? Will board members have enough wherewithal to manage four different groups considering the amount of work they do already?</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> I thank the Minister. I am looking forward to this development. The National Concert Hall is not just about classical music. Coming up very shortly is "Radiohead, A Jazz Symphony". All I can say is that I am really looking forward to it. I thank the Minister and I look forward to discussing the other Stages of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">I thank the Senators for their contributions. I am encouraged by the engagement we have seen on the Bill and the various issues related to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">This Bill represents a crucial stage in the journey of both the National Symphony Orchestra and the National Concert Hall. The transfer of the orchestra and this Bill mark an important next step in addressing the challenges for the orchestra as highlighted by the Boaden report and in delivering the National Concert Hall's vision of being an inspiring and world-renowned music destination. The NSO, as Ireland's premier orchestra, is central to delivering on this vision which, coupled with the ambitious redevelopment plans for the concert hall announced last month, will see it transform into the pre-eminent centre for music in Ireland. I am proud to say that I have already provided the necessary sanctions to bring the orchestra back to full strength. I am putting in place the necessary funding for investment in new and much-needed instruments for the orchestra.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> In the time allotted to me, I will try to address as many issues as possible, as raised by Senators. If I do not address the issues they raised, I will get officials to contact them. I welcome Senator Cassells's intervention on touring and the opportunities that redevelopment will present. As the concert hall is currently developing plans for its relocation, which will be finalised as the project nears construction, it will inevitably require alternative spaces for performance, rehearsal and administration. While the details are still being worked out, the concert hall's plan will be worked out based on a similar level of activity to that which currently happens. It is also looking at what opportunities might emerge from this period of relocation, especially with respect to engaging new audiences around the country and new locations within Dublin. As such, I believe the Senator can expect more touring as we restore and revive this important building and institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> Senator Sherlock raised management issues. We are working closely with the National Concert Hall to ensure a smooth transition. We are supporting a change management process and I understand a dedicated consultant has been appointed to support this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> Senators Black and Sherlock raised the matter of filling the NSO vacancies. Before the transfer was effected earlier this year, there was uncertainty regarding the funding model for the orchestra. This impacted the orchestra both operationally and with regard to recruitment. As I said earlier, the NSO was below the playing complement to perform the full classical repertoire, which led to a reliance on casual musicians to supplement the orchestra for nearly every single performance. On the transfer day, 54 musicians and nine ancillary staff moved from RTÉ to the concert hall. Since then, the National Concert Hall has worked diligently to begin the process of returning the orchestra to its full playing strength. This has included much internal discussion on the development of a specialist recruitment process that will best serve the needs of the orchestra. The recruitment of musicians to a permanent position in a national orchestra is far removed from the typical process of interviews or testing that one might see in another field. It involves players auditioning both individually and on a trial basis with a larger orchestra. It can take several months to ensure that musicians of the highest calibre are recruited.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> Over the last seven months, my Department has sanctioned the filling of a number of a number of vacant positions within the orchestra and choirs. These included permanent posts such as music librarian, orchestra leader and first violin, as well as section leaders for percussion, double bass, horns and timpani, as well as a principal bass trombone. I feel I am back in the classroom teaching the four families of the orchestra. The National Concert Hall has also received sanction for 26 fixed-term guest musician contracts and contract extensions for four choral co-ordinators, along with a number of support staff to support the orchestra's important work. It is my intention that we will approve more permanent posts this quarter as we balance the immediate needs and long-term vision for a restored orchestra.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> Senator McDowell knows that the future of media commission made 50 recommendations about media in Ireland, including public service broadcasting. I recently published an implementation report in respect of that. I committed to the Government that I will get back to it on the question of reforming the licensing system. I assure the Senator that the future of public service broadcasting and a strongly functioning media sector is a key priority for me. He commented on opportunities for the site itself. We will bring back that fresher life to it. As he knows, before Christmas I was delighted to announce Government approval in principle for the vast overhaul and redevelopment of the concert hall. It is an exciting project which will deliver the expansion, refurbishment and remodelling of the main auditorium, increasing the overall space by 40% to 1,500 sq. m. It will have additional balconies and an extension to the rear which will provide access and services essential to the concert hall. It will add about 150 to 225 additional seats depending on the configuration.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> The redevelopment will renovate and open up the main entrance foyer, creating a multi-function modern space with new access to historic marble stairs, universal access, an enhanced reception, booking offices and other services. It will remodel the old medical library as a new rehearsal hall for the National Symphony Orchestra because it currently rehearses in the main auditorium, which limits the opportunities for daytime performances. Refurbishment of the 1865 block, including the John Field room and the provision of new dressing rooms, offices, a canteen, library, studio and other services, includes the refurbishment and restoration of the historic and currently vacant 1865 site to include musician facilities, performance, rehearsal and practice spaces, storage and side-stage areas. Overall, the changes will upgrade a massive 16,300 sq. m of the Earlsfort Terrace site. They will protect and restore this heritage asset and create the necessary infrastructure for the much-expanded national cultural institution for music, which I think will get global attention when it is completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> Senator Warfield asked about the costs of such a project. It is a flagship project under the national cultural institutions investment programme. It will represent the largest single investment in a national cultural institution in a generation. While the appraisal to date has provided a robust estimate of costs, the actual costs will be established when we go to market. Given that the project still has to go to tender, it would not be appropriate to make an estimate public at this stage. The budget itself will continue to be elaborated and refined as the process proceeds through the planning and detailed design stages and ultimately when it goes to tender.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> Senator Warfield raised concerns about the cultural amenity licence in the legislation which is before the Joint Committee on Justice today. I am aware of concerns about it. My officials are engaging with the relevant stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> Senator Sherlock raised the importance of reaching diverse audiences. I highlight, as she did, the incredible success of the Haunted Dancehall event. Other Senators raised that too. It was an electronic music night at the National Concert Hall, supported by my Department as a pilot event for the night-time economy. This pilot demonstrated the exciting potential of the National Concert Hall to serve as a centre for all types of music, to embrace all audiences and to reach out to all walks of life. When I visited the concert hall recently, the board members were hugely animated by what happened that weekend, its success and the opportunity to access entirely new demographics. I hope to see much more of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> Senator Dolan raised music support and outreach in general. As she mentioned, Music Generation would be key to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> As I outlined today, the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) (Amendment) Bill 2022 is a technical Bill. It provides for the transfer of functions from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall as well as an increase to the limit of the State indemnity for the loan of international artworks to nine of our cultural institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> I thank Senators for their engagement today. My officials have noted all the issues they raised. I am sure these will become part of our considerations if related to the Bill. I have heard other concerns that may be outside the scope of this Bill but are relevant to my portfolio. I request that any Senators who intend to table amendments to the Bill give departmental officials sight of their amendments at an early date so that, where possible and appropriate, they can be given due consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> As I said, this Bill represents an important step in the journey of the orchestra and the National Concert Hall. It is a critical part of the National Concert Hall's ambitious vision for the redevelopment of symphonic music in Ireland, with the restored symphony orchestra taking its place in a 21st-century concert hall. This legislation will enable the National Concert Hall to commence the process of returning the orchestra to full strength and empower it to deliver on the recommendations outlined in the Boaden report. I acknowledge the hard work of my officials in preparing the Bill, which I am pleased to introduce to the Seanad. I look forward to making steady progress and I commend it to the House.</p>
