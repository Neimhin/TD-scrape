          <p eId="para_2">The business for today shall be as set out in the second revised Report of the Business Committee dated 12 May 2020.

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T12:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_5">I raised a point at the Business Committee concerning the report by Seán Guerin SC. I do not have a problem with the court judgment regarding this report. People might recall that this judgment was a vindication of the former Deputy, Alan Shatter, and parts of the report were questioned by Mr. Justice Donal O'Donnell. What is being suggested here is a brand new procedure that has never happened before. The Business Committee has not had legal advice and there does not seem to be any justification or reason why we are being asked to take this at this specific time. The proposal is to withdraw a report, that was laid before the House and to which people had no objection at the time, from the Oireachtas Library. This procedure has never happened before. It will also require the involvement of the Seanad, which does not exist in the format that would allow it to have any say on this, so I think we are being previous on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> Second, any changes relating to privileges normally go before the Committee on Procedure, formerly the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. This did not happen in this instance and since this was first mooted, I continuously asked the Business Committee the reason for it. The only reason that was given was that the Taoiseach was anxious to have this passed. The other question was whether this had ever happened before. I am still not sure if it has but from what was mooted yesterday, I think the answer is that this has not happened before and is a brand new procedure. We should be very careful. What was indicated yesterday is that this has been in gestation since last August so why has it taken this length of time? There is a whole range of questions around this. Obviously a promise was made that the Taoiseach is trying to keep but at this juncture given the current impasse in this Chamber, this should not proceed until a new Government is formed and possibly another better way of dealing with this than withdrawing a report from the Oireachtas Library could be found as we have done before in the Committee on Procedure. We changed our Standing Orders last year to allow for notes or comments to be attached to the Dáil record. This would probably be more appropriate so that the record still stands. It is a very dangerous precedent to be doing it in this format and without any debate, which is why I have argued that we should not proceed.</p>

          <p eId="para_7">I understand that the Fianna Fáil Whip has informed the Government Whip that we would like to have this motion deferred. We feel there has not been enough discussion. There are other issues in the Guerin report that are not simply related to the matters of concern in this case and we do not believe this should be dealt with as expeditiously as is proposed; that it is unnecessary to do so. It can be done when Members have had sufficient time to consider what is before them and what we are doing. That has been communicated from Fianna Fáil to the Fine Gael Whip.</p>

          <p eId="para_8">Most of us were taken by surprise when we saw this on the Order Paper to be taken without debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">Those of us who lived through the period when this report was commissioned and so on understand how fraught an era that was. It would be useful to have a more considered period before the report is withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle could inform the House, from a procedural point of view, how a report that has been formally laid before the House can be unlaid. One lawyer has suggested that one can no more unlay a report than a hen can unlay an egg. The report is there, has been promulgated and is accessible. This probably merits some more considered debate than simply removing it. I support that proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_11">Our legal advice is that the motion before the House can unlay the laid report. I know that an egg cannot be put back after it has been laid.</p>

          <p eId="para_12">There is the specific and the general, and on the specific I do not think most of us would have an issue. It is the consequences or the unintended consequences that could follow on from doing this that is the net point about which there is concern. Until we are satisfied with that, it will be problematic and for that reason we think this motion should be deferred.</p>

          <p eId="para_14">This issue was discussed at the Business Committee and has been in gestation for a while. It is very important to point out to Members that no current parliamentary record exists to link the Guerin report with the O'Higgins commission or the Supreme Court decision. It is important that, as Members of the House, we do not deny natural justice to any former Member. In this instance, it is very clear that the only mechanism we have is to withdraw the report from the Oireachtas Library by means of a motion from the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">The points have been made. From the little bit I have read, I understand a motion by both the Seanad and the Dáil is needed. There is no Seanad, so it does not make sense to put the motion before the Dáil today in a piecemeal fashion. Even if we were to pass the motion today, the report would remain in the Oireachtas Library, as I understand it. Are we going to withdraw half of the report until the Seanad sits? I would like clarification on that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">It is important that the Ceann Comhairle, as guardian of Members' interests in this House, makes clear that what is being proposed is in order, is legal and in compliance with Standing Orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> I take exception to Deputy Catherine Murphy saying that there may be intended or unintended consequences. What we are doing today in this House is as a result of misrepresentation, innuendo and debate of some years ago which, if handled properly on that occasion, would not have given rise to the motion that is now before the House. It is unacceptable for Deputy Catherine Murphy and the Social Democrats to be making further allegations and saying that they are, in effect, unfounded.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">In response to the point that has been raised legitimately as to whether there is precedent for this, we have not been able to establish that there is such a precedent. Is there any reason we cannot do it? We have legal advice to suggest that the device being proposed is legitimate. I put the question at yesterday's meeting of the Business Committee, "Are we safe to proceed as outlined?" The answer to that, from the Oireachtas service, was "Yes, we are safe, moving forward, as proposed by the Government."</p>
          <p eId="para_25">However, at the end of the day, it is a matter for this House. There is a proposal before us for taking the business on Thursday. I note that we have no amendment, so if Members vote down the arrangements for the taking of business, then we will have no business at all on Thursday.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">There is a difficulty with that because, as the Deputy well knows, it is the business of Government to order business in Government time. The House might amend the Government arrangements, but the Government is the determiner of what is transacted in Government time so we cannot tell the Government to take this matter away. Members could move that there be a debate on the motion and that it be taken subject to debate. I am in Members' hands. The proposal is whether we are agreed on the schedule of business outlined for Thursday.</p>

          <p eId="para_87"> I look forward to the debate and the opportunity to outline the work that my Department and the education sector as a whole have continued to undertake. I know Deputies have contributions to make or questions to ask and I will do my best to provide as much information as I can today. </p>
          <p eId="para_88"> Last Friday, I made what is certainly one of the most difficult recommendations to Cabinet that a Minister for Education and Skills has ever had to make. Everyone in this House is well aware that it was my absolute preference to undertake the written and practical examinations. My preference, and the preference of the majority of those here and the majority of education stakeholders, was to hold the exams in June, as normal. When this proved impossible we developed a plan B which moved them to July and August. I also instructed officials in my Department to start evaluating all options, as I believed we needed options depending on how the fight against the virus developed. </p>
          <p eId="para_89"> Working in partnership with groups representing students, parents, teachers and management bodies through an advisory group I established, every effort was made to run the 2020 leaving certificate in a manner as close as possible to the way it was originally intended to be held and the way leaving certificate students expected. However I received compelling evidence, based on heath advice and other assessments, that the examinations could not be held in a reliable and valid manner, nor in a way that would be equitable for students.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> I want to be very clear about the options which faced me.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">I was acutely conscious of the disadvantage that some students faced and the impact a lack of time in school has had in recent weeks. This is an important issue, which many Deputies had raised with me over the past weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> As we worked with the State Examinations Commission through the practicalities of what it would mean to run exams in ways that complied with the advice of the Department of Health, including social distancing requirements to protect public health, it became evident that exams in July and August would be a very different experience to the one we think of when we picture the leaving certificate examination. It would not be the exam experience which students had prepared for and would have had an expectation of sitting before this crisis hit. The State Examinations Commission advised me that the examinations would not be comparable to the leaving certificate in any other year, potentially involving the need for students to wear masks and gloves when sitting exams, superintendents requiring PPE, and the prospect of exam papers having to be redesigned to such an extent that they would have been unrecognisable when compared to what students had spent two years preparing for. All this raised fundamental issues of fairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> In addition to issues of fairness and physical health, I also had to give regard to the mental health and well-being of our young people. I was given advice by my Department's National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, about the anxiety, stress and trauma being experienced by young people in the midst of this terrible pandemic. To help people understand the issues which lay behind this decision, my Department has published this advice from NEPS alongside information on what running the exams in a way that complied with social distancing requirements would have entailed.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> The leaving certificate is important but it is life that matters. The system which has been put in place, plan C, will allow students to progress to the next stage of their life in a timely fashion. There is no easy solution to the difficulties we face here. This new system will require a special unit to be established within the Department of Education and Skills to carry out this work, as the State Examinations Commission does not have the authority to do it, but it is the fairest, most equitable and just way to meet the challenges that we now face in the current circumstances. It is without a doubt a better way than any other option that exists. It offers all students the option of calculated grades for the 2020 leaving certificate. It is crucial that it also guarantees them the right to sit the examinations at a later stage when it is safe to hold the exams in the normal way.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> I welcome the very positive support and engagement that we have received from all education stakeholders as we work collaboratively to implement this process in the interest of all learners. I acknowledge the work of the Irish Second-Level Students Union, the National Parents Council, both teachers' unions and the management bodies in developing this solution. I look forward to working with them in tackling the next set of challenges that Covid-19 has presented to the education sector. I also thank those many students, teachers, career guidance counsellors, principals and parents with whom I have discussed this challenge, along with other experts in this area, including Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children. I also thank Margaret Rogers of Heart Children Ireland, among many others. I greatly appreciated the open engagement of some of the 16,000 students who engaged with me through the SpunOut Instagram interview. I acknowledge the leadership shown by the teachers, principals and boards of management in schools across the country in keeping the school communities together and ensuring continuation of learning for students at all levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> The roadmap to the reopening of our society and economy sets out the intention that pupils and students would return to their classrooms and lecture theatres in time for the start of the 2020-21 academic year. How this return will be managed and how the public health advice at the time will be implemented will be worked through over the coming months in consultation with the education stakeholders. My officials are working on these issues. It is important to state this is not just about social distancing in schools, numbers in classrooms or lecture theatres but also is about how we plan learning, staff our schools, utilise facilities within schools, transport pupils to and from schools and protect those who might be vulnerable to the virus.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> I am conscious that the national return to work safely protocol launched last weekend clearly and comprehensively sets out the steps and processes that employers must take to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace. It will form part of our considerations. Access to schools will be allowed from Monday, 18 May. While this is not a return to work within the meaning of the protocol, it will allow staff to access the school where needed to support continuity of teaching and learning.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">To assist with the development of contingency plans for the reopening and operation of schools in an environment that may require social distancing and other public health requirements, the Department will engage with relevant stakeholders and experts from within the education sector. A core objective of the contingency plans will be to ensure that schools and other education settings can reopen and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> We will work with all relevant stakeholders as we plan to reopen educational institutions. Earlier I met the advisory group on State examinations to discuss these issues. The Primary Education Forum also met remotely to consider the issues in the primary sector and I will discuss that meeting with my officials after this debate. I want to build on the good working relationship developed in the advisory group and on the ongoing success of the Primary Education Forum in addressing the challenges this virus has raised. In addition, the advisory group on post-primary education will meet again this coming Friday to discuss school reopening.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> We will examine practices in other countries that have reopened their schools and colleges to learn from their experiences. I will also attend the next remote meeting of education Ministers on 18 May to discuss these issues with my European counterparts.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> We have approximately 4,000 schools across the country, ranging from the smallest one and two-teacher schools to those with more than 1,000 students. We must also consider these issues in the range of diverse settings in the higher and further education and training sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> I am particularly conscious of pupils who might be starting school for the first time, those transitioning from primary to post-primary, and those with special educational needs. These are students who will need particular support or attention in how they return to school. They are students who will not have met their classmates or teachers previously and will not have the ready made bonds in place that we might take for granted. With regard to those starting primary school, my officials are engaging with officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to consider how best to support that transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> New schools are due to open in September and there are many schools building projects associated with those openings as well as extensions and new buildings across the country that were originally due to open this September. The reopening of the construction sector offers the opportunity to advance the work on these projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> These are the challenges we will work through over the coming months, guided by public health advice, the views of stakeholders and what is in the best interests of the pupils and students across the country, especially those starting for the first time in primary, post-primary or third level, as these events are major signposts in the life of any child or young person and we will be conscious of that as we plan for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> The further and higher education sectors have also been addressing the challenges presented by Covid-19. The roadmap to reopening our society also provides the framework through which these sectors can deliver education and training in the autumn. The decisions on the leaving certificate also allow the sectors to plan for new entrants with greater certainty. I know there are other issues, including funding, particularly in the university sector, and again these issues are being worked through by engagement. There are other issues which I have not touched upon, but I am sure will be addressed in the debate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T12:45:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_108">I welcome the fact that a decision has been made to provide certainty on the leaving certificate. There are still issues in that regard which my colleagues and Deputies across the House will address, but we have finally moved past the uncertainty. Members of the Minister's advisory group on State examinations have put forward their own queries, including the unions, the management bodies, parents councils and students. It would be helpful if those queries were published on the Department's website and if the responses to the queries were also published and collated in an accessible form. That would be useful because I am aware some of the bodies and their experts have put forward dozens of questions. The Minister will probably also get the same here in today.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> What is clear, as was inevitable all along, is that the cancellation of the leaving certificate was absolutely necessary. The Minister acknowledged that the public health advice necessitated the cancellation. Many of us mentioned the impact on mental well-being in the House on 23 April and that has now been confirmed by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. Other issues include broadband and technology access, which is mentioned in the WHO return-to-school plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">We are one of the few jurisdictions that did not set out a national e-learning platform; we simply gave schools a list of apps. While the Minister is right to praise teachers and students for what they have been doing with regard to remote learning, they really have not received the level of assistance from the State that was received in other countries and jurisdictions. They have been, and are, working against the odds.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> The Minister has put forward a system of calculated grades. We want the class of 2020, its rights and its progression through education to be protected to the best of the State's ability. These calculated grades differ slightly from the system I suggested but I accept the reason the Department has given for putting this system forward. The vast majority of teachers are willing to step up to the plate and to award these calculated grades in light of this year being exceptional. They are certainly worried and concerned about it but we know from their representative bodies that they will do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> It has to be said, however, that there are heartfelt concerns about how the Department proposes to adjust grades. I am concerned about this. There is no evidence in the Minister's statement to the Dáil that the Department is consulting with outside experts with regard to the models to be used for this process and I believe it is not. The Minister has set out that the State Examinations Commission is, under statute, not allowed to get involved in this. That is a major flaw that must be rectified at the earliest possible opportunity. There are expertise and people within the State Examinations Commission who would be of considerable assistance to this whole process and who could provide necessary help. There is expertise in the inspectorate and the Department but, considering the scale of the project and the legal vulnerabilities the Minister has introduced, independent expert advice to the Minister and Department is absolutely essential in the setting up of the model to ensure that no one will be advantaged or disadvantaged by it. The model must be used simply to standardise, to ensure the system is working and to ensure that teachers' predictions, which the Department has said are key, form the basis of children's calculated grades. It is imperative that independent expert advice be given.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> I worry that the entire emphasis is on the education partners. I hope the Minister will not get me wrong; the education partners are absolutely critical. They have been very co-operative and hardworking during this pandemic, as have partners in all sectors of society. The Minister does, however, need separate advice with regard to statistics, modelling and data to inform him as to how to do this particular job and to make sure that all t's are crossed and i's dotted so that there will be fewer complaints later on in the summer. The Minister should have a short independent consultation with statisticians and other experts to ensure a further level of scrutiny of the methodology used. I ask the Minister to commit to the Dáil that he will seek such expert input.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> I have spoken about protecting students and their grades but we also need to protect teachers. The Minister has spoken about guidelines with regard to canvassing and so on. That will not be a problem for most people. There will be one or two people who will feel they can benefit from such actions. I call on people not to engage with teachers with regard to exam results. The vast majority of the public will accept that call from all of us here. I do not believe, however, that guidelines will be enough for some.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> The Minister said that his plan has legal vulnerabilities. I say that teachers need protections. I have concerns about the recognition of qualifications. This is a State certificate equivalent to the leaving certificate but it is not the leaving certificate. These issues need to be addressed through legislation. The class of 2020 needs greater numbers of students to get greater numbers of college places.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> I wanted to raise a number of other issues, including the issue of special needs education. I will not get a huge amount of time. The Minister has mentioned it but it deserves a debate of its own.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> The Minister again needs outside expert advice with regard to school reopenings. The WHO has published guidelines on this. These are not as restrictive as we may have feared. The Minister needs to be clear in the message that he is doing everything possible to get our schools open at the appropriate time. We need continuity of education. We do not have e-learning set up. It simply will not work on a long-term basis. It is a giant social experiment at the moment. Our kids need to be back in class in September. We need a clear statement from the Government that this will happen. Keeping us up to date in an open and transparent way is absolutely essential. I will yield to my colleagues as I believe I have run out of time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraigOSullivan" eId="spk_38">
          <from>Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T12:55:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_118">I wish to put questions to the Minister on a number of aspects. As he knows, for 15 years I was a schoolteacher, as was Deputy Foley from Kerry. We have a number of questions specific to the leaving certificate. In the context of where we are at with Covid-19, we fully understand this was a difficult decision for the Minister and it did not come lightly. He is moving with the public health advice as it comes. We understand the move was meant to bring greater certainty, particularly to the students sitting the leaving certificate this year. Obviously a number of questions remain outstanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> Deputy Byrne alluded to issues with the standardisation of results. The document the Minister circulated last week essentially suggested there would be profiling of schools. Students and teachers are concerned that schools in disadvantaged areas could struggle based on the model that might be employed. I ask the Minister to clarify issues around that kind of modelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> I seek clarification on the people who will actually sit the exams whenever that may be. We are phasing in the times when people may go for a cup of coffee, a haircut or whatever it might be. At the same time we cannot give our students an indication of when they may be able to sit an exam. The majority of phone calls I have received over the last week have been from parents whose children are particularly concerned that they would like to sit the exam as quickly as possible. I know that is the Minister's intention pending public health advice. At the same time, we need to look at alternative facilities, such as a remote online exam in front of a webcam, to provide certainty for students. We cannot let this roll on until the new year or until March of next year. People's lives are at stake. There is potential for students to lose an entire year in their academic life. I would like the Minister to address that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> The issue of children who are home-schooled comes up quite a bit. They do not have the same experience as other students of being in a conventional learning environment and sitting the same types of exams on a regular basis. What accommodation will be made for those students?</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> The late change of levels is a feature of the lives of all leaving certificate students. A teacher will always recommend a student to stay with higher level for as long as possible, right up to after the mock exams or maybe later in the year after Easter. Ultimately they make the determination to drop or change a level at the last minute. How will those students be accommodated? As I read it, they cannot or will not be accommodated. I ask the Minister to clarify that also.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> On the grading of non-curricular subjects, such as Polish, Romanian and other minority languages, many students will sit those exams with little or no guidance from a teacher in the entire two-year period. How will those students be accommodated in the leaving certificate?</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> On the rescinding of the results for the oral examinations, when the Minister first made the declaration that students would get 100%, as an Irish teacher, I felt very uncomfortable with that. Certain people who worked very hard would have deserved that result, but other students who might not have worked quite as hard would have attained the same result. What has changed? What advice has the Minister been given in the meantime to lead him to change tack on that front?</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> Deputy Byrne also mentioned the lobbying of teachers and principals on results. We know the vast majority of people and parents will abide by the result that is given. I believe that if teachers are pressured or schools come under some kind of interference from external sources, some kind of regime of sanctions is needed. I am not sure guidelines are sufficient. It would be a very rare occasion that this would happen, but there needs to be a deterrent for people engaging in such practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> The big bone of contention I have is with fifth year students going into sixth year. They need to be given clarity. They have already lost ten to 12 weeks of teaching and time with their teachers in their schools. In September, they could potentially be operating on a reduced timetable. We do not know what will happen then. I would like the Minister to clarify the plans for fifth year students going into their leaving certificate year. Will they be facing a reduced exam schedule or a more refined syllabus?</p>

          <p eId="para_127">Deputies Thomas Byrne and Pádraig O'Sullivan have asked several intelligent and pertinent questions. However, there are two more speakers for Fianna Fáil and 3.4 minutes remaining. The time allocated is for the Minister to take questions and answer them. How do the Fianna Fáil Deputies propose we proceed? Are we to take the questions as rhetorical? The Deputies have indicated they wish for answers to be provided in writing.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">Is aoibhinn beatha an scoláire, a deir an dán. Is é sin mar a bhí, b'fhéidir, ach ní mar sin atá anois, in aon chor. "Aoibhinn Beatha an Scoláire", an often-quoted 17th century poem, suggests that the life of a student is beautiful and idyllic. It has now changed irrevocably. The suite of changes recently announced by the Department is seismic in nature and unquantifiable in its magnitude and future impact on the education system. I profoundly regret that the plan B option of hosting the traditional leaving certificate did not come to pass. Although it is flawed in a few respects, there is an essential fairness and equity at the core of the leaving certificate that is unmatched in any other type of exam. It is independent and anonymous. Chief among its many advantages is that it is immune to perceived manipulation. It is of enormous disappointment to me that until the clarification provided by the Minister today, there had been no quantifiable and verifiable evidence of a concerted effort by the Department to implement plan B.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> The proposal to hand is a leaving certificate adjudicated on the basis of calculated grades. I acknowledge the co-operation of all stakeholders who are working with the Minister to make this a reality. I refer in particular to teachers, many of whom have principled objections to assessment on the basis of calculated grades but who, in recognition of these extraordinary times, have agreed to implement this extraordinary measure. I hope the Minister and the Department will be mindful and demonstrably appreciative of that co-operation in the months and years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> There are myriad questions I wish to pose but time does not allow. I have submitted many of them as parliamentary questions. I ask the Minister to confirm his commitment to indemnify all teachers as they embark on the calculated grades process. I ask that he commit to reinstating the 100% grade he previously offered for aspects of the Irish, foreign language and music exams and extend that to practicals, projects and course work. How does he propose to accommodate students who take a subject outside of school, as referred to by Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan? What is the status of students who plan to sit the written exams, possibly in 2021? Will they have to engage with schools in that regard? I ask the Minister to give details on the newly commissioned special unit of the Department which will have oversight of the calculated grades. On the reopening of schools, will he commit to additional staff allocation and increased accommodation for all schools?</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> To be parochial, I will conclude on an issue in my constituency. I ask the Minister to commit to the provision of transport for 19 students in Annascaul, County Kerry, who require transport to their preferred local school. I have written to the Minister and the Minister of State on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> Is aoibhinn beatha an scoláire. Is é sin mar a bhí, ach ní mar sin atá anois. B'fhéidir go mbeidh arís, má éiríonn linn go léir an dúshlán nua a shárú. Gabhaim buíochas.</p>

It was some time ago but this is my first opportunity to speak in the Thirty-third Dáil. I wish to acknowledge their support and thank my campaign team.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> Students who appeal the decision on their exam results, and then go on to sit the written exam and get the minimum requirements, will wish to begin college that year. What level of engagement has the Minister had with colleges to ensure students who achieve the minimum requirements in the exam will be able to take up a place in college in the coming academic year, possibly after Christmas?</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> The Minister briefly touched on the issue of the patronage of new schools. The patronage procedure for a new second-level school in Ballincollig, in my own area, was expected to be well under way at this stage. The school was due to open in 2021. Parents who will be enrolling their children for first year in the autumn need to know what options will be available to them. They will be able to enrol them in Ballincollig Community School or Coláiste Choilm.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">What will the situation be? Will the process for the new patronships and new schools be back up and running quickly and when will they know who the patrons for the new schools will be?</p>

          <p eId="para_137">I will break my contribution into two parts: leaving certificate and other issues and I have allowed about a minute and half after each for the Minister to respond, if that is alright. Some of what I say will be critical so I want to preface it by saying that I understand the Minister and the Department are in a very difficult situation, that all the options were difficult and the decisions were taken in good faith but that does not mean that we should not interrogate them.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> Leaving certificate students have endured uncertainty and incredible anxiety. It has been quite an ordeal for many of them. I have said on many occasions that the exam should not go ahead if it was not in the interests of the health and welfare of students to do so. It was right in that context to cancel the written exams. I am not convinced, however, that the right alternative was chosen. Predicted or calculated grades are far from reliable, even where they have long been built into the system and have a basis and track record in standardised classwork, recent State exam and predictions being part of university applications. Here we have none of those things. Teachers are working with students who had no expectation that their pre-exams, mock exams or Christmas tests could potentially carry the weight they now do. There are plenty of students who know they can turn the gas on late in the year. There are also many students who are repeating a subject, including, for example, people who want to train as teachers, and are doing the leaving certificate subject outside traditional school settings, including native speakers of minority languages who may not have had any formal tuition at all. This is a major issue. How will those students get their grades and in general, across schools, what is the guidance going to be on what material can be used to devise a calculated grade? I recognise the determination of teachers to be fair and do right by their students. I know they will do all they can to make this work and they are absolutely right. It would be far worse for this cohort not to proceed. There are, however, better ways. I asked the Minister, by e-mail, before he made the decision, to explore expanding third level education as a partial solution, with students getting their first choice and being assessed by universities only where a course was entirely oversubscribed, separate from a leaving certificate award. Many of the 14,000 students who come here annually from abroad will likely not be coming here next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> Tá costas leis sin ach ós rud é go mbeidh na hollscoileanna amháin thíos €374 milliún an bhliain seo, is cinnte go mbeidh cúnamh airgeadúil ag teastúil uathu. Mar chuid de sin cén fáth nach bhféadfaí a thuilleadh spásanna á gcur ar fáil, ina measc le tacaíocht bhreise do SUSI thiar agus thoir chun an fhadhb seo a réiteach? I have written to the Minister about Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, and I am still waiting for a reply. It needs to be expanded because in respect of income thresholds many parents are in an uncertain position not knowing whether or when the bar or shop they work in will reopen.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> I have raised my concerns about school profiling with the Minister. It needs to be dropped. It would be one thing if all else among schools was equal, apart from results, but schools in fact magnify the disadvantage felt by communities. Students who deserve the chance to do a life-changing course will miss out and students who should not fail a subject or the leaving certificate will fail and that is totally wrong. Tackling the disadvantages that have worsened in recent weeks involves opening up access, not closing it down. I will give the Minister a minute and a half to respond to this part of the question.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">There were a lot of questions there and I will try to rattle through them as best I can. In respect of the challenges of tutors outside school, I do not want to put out information before it is decided because we will be in a position next week to give guidance to schools. That information is critical but we have identified students who, for example, are taking music and have a music tutor outside school, and that tutor will be involved in the assessment process. That is important. We have also identified an issue for students at home who do not have a tutor and we will consider them on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> We will be in a position next week to answer the Deputy's second question on guidance. The patron bodies, management bodies and the unions have been given two clear messages: this has to be done very quickly but it has to be done right to ensure that teachers cannot be compromised and to ensure fairness at the heart of these decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">There is very positive engagement with the third level sector and there is flexibility. Yes, there will be a natural availability of courses because there may be fewer international students. I thank the different leaders in third level for their flexibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> Bhí an Teachta ag labhairt faoi na hollscoileanna fosta agus i dtaobh na faidhbe maidir le SUSI.

          <p eId="para_146">Finally, as it is important, may I make this point on the disadvantaged schools and the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS scheme? DEIS status exists for a reason, which is to support those schools. Whenever I have visited a DEIS school in my 18 months in this job, and I have been in many, I speak individually to the teachers, the principals and students and they talk about the progress they are making. They are making progress on a year-to-year basis, and it is good progress. There might be, for example, an honours maths class in the school that was not there a year before. I assure Deputies these schools will not be disadvantaged by the progress they are making and I will keep that conversation very alive.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> I wish to say something to the Deputy. This has been a very difficult time for many people, particularly the students and parents, and this has been a difficult decision. What helped the decision was individual contact by some Deputies in this House. I have spoken to the Deputy on the phone several times.

          <p eId="para_148">I thank the Minister and appreciate his making himself and his officials available for engagement on an ongoing basis. I am running tight on time but wish to flag something to which the Minister can respond in writing, rather than eating into Deputies Tully and Clarke's time. The pressure the parents of special needs children are under cannot be understated. The children's lives and routines have been turned upside down and they cannot understand it. They are frustrated and sad and often are falling further behind. Education is fundamentally about learning, stimulation and socialisation and lack of those is having a great impact on these children. How will the Minister resolve confusion regarding the redeployment of special needs assistants, SNAs? The issue has, unfortunately, been miscommunicated from the start. SNAs have had very little guidance and have had to work off their own initiative. There is now an issue in respect of vetting that is stopping people from being redeployed. They are frustrated by that and it needs to be resolved and clarified. There is also the matter of July provision, or something like it, being delivered remotely in a safe manner. I have also raised the lack of school spaces and unit spaces. That is an issue everywhere, including in my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> Many parents with children who are finishing primary school and are going on to secondary school have contacted me, and the Minister addressed it in his opening remarks. They are worried because the children's primary education suddenly came to an end and their preparation for that transition did not happen. Now they do not know when that is going to start. It might not seem like the most urgent issue to some but to those parents and families, it is huge and is something that must be addressed. </p>

          <from>Deputy Pauline Tully<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_150">As this is my maiden speech, I wish to take the opportunity to thank the people of Cavan, Monaghan and north Meath for their tremendous support for me and my party colleague, Deputy Carthy, at the general election on 8 February. After everything that has happened, it seems like a lifetime ago now. I never envisaged it would be more than three months before I would get to make my maiden speech but we live in unprecedented times.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> I will comment on the alternative to the leaving certificate and I have some questions. As I do not think time will allow an oral response, I request a written response. I believe replacing the standard leaving certificate with calculated grades was the most viable option in the circumstances. The leaving certificate exam had been compromised once the school year was curtailed in mid-March, with too many inconsistencies for students. In some schools, courses were not completed, oral and practical exams could not proceed and course work could not be submitted. Many teachers attempted to engage with students online but the technology divide made this unfair. Expecting students to continue studying for more than two months on their own was unrealistic but then to extend that by an additional two months was unjust.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">I believe that teachers will be fair to their students when calculating grades but I am relieved that teachers will do so in conjunction with their colleagues in their subject departments and with school management, which I see as both a support and a safeguard for students and teachers. However, it is imperative that the message that lobbying will disqualify goes out loud and clear, and I support the Teachers Union of Ireland, which called for that. It is not enough to simply give a guideline.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> I categorically disagree with school profiling. I agree with my party colleague, Deputy Ó Laoghaire, on that issue. I seriously question the need for it and urge the Minister to reconsider that proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> Where a situation arises where a student is not happy with his or her calculated grade and wishes to sit the examination whenever that may be, how will the practical element of that subject be assessed? There are approximately ten subjects with practical examinations or course work attached, and languages which have an oral element. It would be very unfair to allocate a result based only on the written part of the examination, especially for the more practically-minded student.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> Regarding students who cannot be given a predicted grade, such as external students, those who have been home schooled, some students who may be repeating in a different school from the one they originally attended or students who take additional subjects outside of school such as music, Russian, Polish or whatever it might, what is the option open to them? Is it to sit the actual examination whenever that is deemed safe to do so? However, if that is their only option, it is not fair to expect them to put off entering third level for a whole year if that is their intention. Can the timetable for the allocation of results be brought forward so that if there is only a relatively small number of students wishing to sit the examination, that could possibly happen safely in August?</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> An alternative course of action is to offer those students who wish to enter a third level course the option of sitting an aptitude test for the course they desire. That is an option that could be offered in respect of over-subscribed courses. It is used for mature students entering third level. Could that be considered for students in these times also?</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> I do not believe the leaving certificate applied course has been mentioned. The students taking that leaving certificate have already been allocated up to two thirds of their result, with the end-of-year examinations making up the final one third. Are teachers being asked to predict their grade also? I believe they should be as it might possibly be the difference between a distinction and a merit or a merit and a pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Finally, I want to commiserate with leaving certificate students countrywide. They have been robbed of the chance to sit an examination for which they were preparing for up to two years. Most of them would have liked to sit the examination - a few might be happier with the turn of events - but they have been robbed of the final few years in school, their graduation and possibly their debs. I hope those events can take place later. I am coming from the perspective of a teacher. I believe I, too, will be predicting grades for students I taught up to the middle of January.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">Perfect.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Regarding the July provision programme, this programme is vital for ensuring that children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, continue with some level of structured learning during the summer. All children will experience a level of difficulty settling back into the school when they reopen but for children on the spectrum, and children with severe to profound learning difficulties, that challenge will be multiple-fold and will cause unimaginable distress for the students and their families without supports being put in place. The longer these children remain out of school, the more difficult it will be to re-establish routine. These children will have to rebuild those vital skills necessary in terms of learning, social interaction and communication that they had before the pandemic. That is the reason the July provision is so important for these children. The loss of predictability, routine and structure is hard on anyone but for those on the spectrum and with additional needs, it is especially difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> Parents are doing their best but in terms of the contact I have had with them, one of them described the feeling as hanging on by their fingernails, and we are not even at the end of the school term. They feel ignored, that their children's needs are again at the lowest rung of priority for being addressed and that it is more of the same old, same old. They believe they will be going back to constantly having to battle for every single additional support their children need, whether it is psychological assessments or the right of their children to access appropriate education and supports. Will they have to go back to fighting for everything their children need? Will their children be pushed into reduced hours or forced to take a place in a dedicated unit having done so well in mainstream school previously because they have lost those key skills?</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Is this where we are? Is this what we are looking at? The Minister should be honest. I ask him to amend the July provision programme for this year, to bring it in later in the year and let it run in the weeks before schools reopen. That is what parents need. They know their children better than anyone else. The same can be said of their teachers. It is grossly unfair for anybody, whether a teacher or a parent, to expect a child with additional needs to land back in school having been six months out of school and to pick up where they were. In short, these children are looking not to be robbed of their potential for the coming school year.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> I also raise the issue of the State Examinations Commission and the seasonal employees it employed in habitual contracts over the years. No contact has been made with those employees, which is not good enough. Common manners would dictate that contact should have been made with them. I will be in contact with the Minister about that issue again.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">I am sharing with Deputy Higgins. I also welcome the Minister to the House. It has been an extraordinary and difficult time for students, parents, teachers and all other stakeholders. I have a few questions to which I would like a reply. There has been much talk from the post-primary advisory group that has been established. How has that worked? Will the Minister be using such advisory groups to address the problems of reopening schools? It has been a very stressful time for students and there is huge anxiety and stress among them. I worry about the health and welfare of the students. I want to come at this from a different angle. I understand that we are all at home, and the one thing I have been saying to my wife and kids is that when this is all over, we are going to go for a break. The tourism and hospitality sectors are under a lot of stress as well. They are due to open in mid-July. I do not know whether this would be helpful for the advisory group, but maybe it is time to look at bringing the schools back a little later, perhaps into September. That might give a window of opportunity of six or seven weeks in which everyone could avail of that break. If schools are coming back in mid-August, there will not be enough capacity for all families to take that break in Ireland. There will be no tourists coming in from outside the country. We are all going to be taking a break on the island of Ireland and I would encourage anyone from the Thirty-two Counties to go around and see our country. If the schools are coming back that little-----</p>

          <p eId="para_172">It is indeed. There are moments that are watersheds in all our lives, and completing primary school and secondary school are two of those moments. I still remember the days I left St. Martin's national school and Rathcoole community college. Many people cherish those moments. One of the most important aspects of education is the social one, and that is why. Students learn to make deep and meaningful friendships while spending years in the company of their classmates. It is always difficult to leave those bonds behind when classes disband at the end of sixth class and sixth year. It is even more difficult now.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> The class of 2020 is deprived of the usual rites of passage. They will have no final day at school, no debs and no graduation. Sixth class students have spent eight of the 12 years of their lives - two-thirds of their lives - with their classmates. Sixth year students have spent six of the 17 years of their lives - over a third of their lives - with their current classmates. We already know that the lockdown is hurting our children and teenagers.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Anxiety levels and depression have gone through the roof. Right now, their support structure and social network are being pulled from under them. This is especially so for sixth class and sixth year students. Graduation is an occasion that deserves to be marked. It is an occasion that children in Lucan, Clondalkin, Palmerstown, Newcastle, Rathcoole and other places across the country want marked. It is an occasions their parents want marked. Will the Minister ensure that a graduation ceremony takes place for every sixth year and sixth class student when this crisis has passed?</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> I am also mindful of the pressures that families of children with special needs are under. Many parents are struggling to create new routines amid this crisis. Is the Minister planning any support for children with special needs between now and their return to school? It would be of significant benefit to these children and their families.</p>

          <p eId="para_176">I thank the Deputies for their questions. Deputy Feighan raised the issue around the advisory group. The advisory group is a collection of management bodies, parent representative groups, student representative voices and the two main unions for the post-primary sector - the TUI and ASTI. The group has been working through a lot of issues and has met seven times. Each time it has met, it has discussed issues such as getting consensus on the junior cycle, mental health issues, and how the practicals and research projects would look in a leaving certificate setting. It also walked through the process of seeing what a leaving certificate would look like under current public health guidelines. It has been a very important unit because this has not been an easy period in terms of trying to find a way through these very difficult decisions, but the unit has been really helpful. I met with it again today and we had a discussion around protections for teachers and fairness for students regarding calculated grades. The group will meet again on Friday to have a discussion about school reopenings. That will be a very important mechanism as we work our way through the summer. I thank the group members in particular for all their efforts and hard work during this emergency and crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Deputy Feighan also asked where we are with school reopenings. The advice from NPHET is that schools will reopen in September, so we are working on that basis. We are working under current health advice. Obviously, health advice is subject to change, but we will work on the basis of current health advice. Whether that is social distancing or issues involving bus or other transportation requirements, we will work through that together. I know Deputies will continue to keep their voices heard with regard to where they see it going.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> I will not get into a discussion as to when summer holidays should be or how they should happen, but I acknowledge one thing, which is that it has been such a disruption for society and families. We do not know where we are going to be in a month's time, never mind two months' time, as a society with regard to this pandemic, but we will work through it and continue to do so collectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> I thank Deputy Higgins for raising two important issues regarding the completion of primary school and the rite of passage, as she calls it, from primary to secondary education as well as finishing the leaving certificate. Yes, there are traditions and rites of passage such as meeting for meals. Some schools have masses while others have other ways of celebrating that. I am getting a lot of contact from parents of students in primary school and primary school teachers regarding the rite of passage from sixth class to post-primary education. It is a big transition and step. Many sixth class students get a chance to go into post-primary schools for a few days to see what it is like, so it is a big transition. It is something which we are looking at to see how we could facilitate that transition to secondary school. I know the Deputy asked what my advice would be regarding graduations. Most schools do their own thing when it comes to graduations, but this will be an item of discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">It was an item of discussion with my officials when I met them this morning before the advisory group meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> A couple of Deputies raised the issue of July provision. We also had a meeting this morning about July provision and I am open to the idea of expanding the initiative. It is limited in its construction at the moment and a difficulty arises when different groups are excluded. We are looking at potential expansion and I will keep Deputies informed as to how we will move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Turning to special needs in general, we are fortunate that so many special needs assistants have stayed in contact with their students. We want to ensure that we offer whatever extra support or facilitation we can. One of the discussions that I had with the Taoiseach, followed by discussions with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, was about the fact that an all-of-Government response is needed, including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, the Department of Health and my Department. Meetings have taken place and I will keep the House updated on any developments in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_183">This has been an extremely difficult time for children of all ages. Many primary school students across the country are missing out on their final months at school, missing rites of passage such as the final sports day in primary school, where those students are finally the senior members of the school and leading the school teams. They are missing out on taking the last school tour together as a sixth class group, something to which they all look forward. They are also missing out on an official graduation ceremony with their school communities and families and are being deprived of the basics of saying goodbye to the classmates, beside whom they have sat for eight years, before they move on to their various secondary schools. It is truly a distressing time for those students. Is am an-chorrach é seo do pháistí scoile de gach aois.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> Many children find themselves in the bizarre situation of looking forward to putting on their uniforms again and going back to school. They never imagined that would happen. Usually in May, students look forward to casting their uniforms aside for three months but are now looking forward to putting them on again. They also look forward to the days when they can have birthday parties and play dates with friends in real life, not through Zoom or WhatsApp, and that is if they have the broadband to use those applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> The past few months will, no doubt, have lasting and traumatising impacts on many young people. It is important that they are supported and protected as we move forward from this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> It has been an unbelievably stressful time for leaving certificate students. There has been much uncertainty and a lack of clarity in recent months which has caused unnecessary confusion and stress. While many students were relieved last week when the Minister announced the cancellation of the examinations, others were disappointed and worried that the calculated grade system would not result in a fair reflection of all the work they have done this year and in previous years. I am deeply concerned that the proposed school standardisation alignment process that will use a school's past exam results to alter the results of current leaving certificate students will adversely affect students in disadvantaged schools who would otherwise have done well. There is now a perceived risk of such a student receiving a lower grade due to his or her school's previous results. How will the Minister ensure that this system is fair and recognises one of the most positive aspects of leaving certificate examinations, that is, that any student can excel no matter what school he or she attends? I doubt that the Minister would suggest that a student's score should be altered based on geography or socioeconomic background. However, with this system, what will effectively happen will be an almost stereotyping and pigeon-holing of schools in order to adhere to the results of previous years. </p>
          <p eId="para_187"> Has a decision been made about how far the data set used in these alignments will go back? How will the Minister offer a rock solid guarantee that the grading process will be carried out in a fair manner that does not inadvertently lead to further disadvantage for these students?</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> Objectivity is another essential component of the calculated grade system. What steps have been taken to ensure that teachers and school principals are protected against being lobbied by parents and students as they work through this process?</p>
          <p eId="para_189">It is also incredibly important that in this new exam process, students who do not fit into the standard mould of the leaving certificate are not forgotten about or excluded. How much consideration was given to home schoolers and students who have taught themselves subjects and, therefore, do not have teachers to give them a grade? In the case of repeat students who only have this year's in-class results to use as reference, will their previous leaving certificate results be taken into account? Was any consideration given to the leaving certificate applied exams going ahead? Given the way those students' courses and assessment are set up, they were only due to sit a small number of exams at the end of sixth year. Furthermore, how does the Minister intend to guarantee that all grading and appeal processes will be completed ahead of the UCAS and EUNiCAS August deadline for students applying to universities abroad?</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> In his announcement last week, he stated that the original date of 29 July for the leaving certificate exams was now considered to be an unsafe return time based on updated information. If 29 July is not suitable for students to return to school, how will it be safe enough for schools to open just one month later in September? In fact, some secondary schools opened as early as 18 August last year. What consideration has been given to how students will safely return to school as currently planned, with schools to operate as normal? How can schools plan for the 2020-21 academic year given such uncertainty? How can they do their timetables and plan their induction days, training days, recruitment processes and interviews? Schools were only at the stage when the lockdown happened where retirements and career breaks had been flagged with principals. Surely those interviews have not even been held. How is it now proposed that they will be held? How will we have enough staff in our schools when they return?</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> I have received correspondence from parents of children with special needs expressing their concern over the lack of information being shared regarding their children's return to school and the loss of the July provision. It must remain a priority to get these children back in school as quickly as possible. What consideration has been given to the families in question and is there a roadmap in place for children with special needs to return to school? In addition, it is vital that we do not forget the invaluable work of our special needs assistants, SNAs. What engagement has the Minister had with them and how has he continued to keep them informed of where and how they fit into the Department's ever-changing plans?</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> I would be grateful if he might raise a matter with the Minister for Health. Regarding the human papillomavirus, HPV, school vaccine programme, many first year students across the country received their first dose of that vaccine last September and were due to receive the second dose from February onwards. What are the plans for schools whose students did not receive their second vaccine dose before the lockdown and has there been any communication with principals, teachers or parents on this matter? As it stands, my understanding is that parents are not allowed to take their child to a GP to receive the vaccine if the child is in the school programme. What are the implications for students who missed their second dose?</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> The impacts of the changes made in our education system in the next few months will echo for years to come. It is vitally important for all students, parents, teachers, educators and entire school communities that they receive clear, comprehensive and detailed information about these changes as quickly, effectively and fully as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">I will try to answer as many of the Deputy's questions as I can in the short time available to me. I will ensure she gets a formal response to any that are unanswered. I agree with her regarding the impact in terms of the primary school transition. I re-emphasise that we had a meeting this morning with our officials on that issue. We are getting a lot of correspondence from both parents and teachers and I will keep the House updated if there is any development in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> The Deputy is correct about the stress on leaving certificate students. There was a lot of anxiety, confusion and speculation because of the environment in which we had a lot of students preparing for a June exam. Within a short period of time following the lockdown, on 10 April, we announced that we would be postponing the exams.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">There was a period of preparation as to what those exams would look like. A lot of students had their minds made up. Some Deputies in this House had their minds made up in that regard at a very early stage. However, there was also a preference among education stakeholders, myself included, and the majority of Deputies in the House that we should still try to find a way to hold written exams. When that became impossible, obviously there was still uncertainty. There has been a lot of uncertainty and speculation. I hope that we will work very thoroughly on the calculated grade model to ensure that certainty is provided that this is the right model.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> The Deputy referred to standardisation. It is good to raise such issues because we want fairness and completeness, but as far as I am concerned from the meetings I have attended and the knowledge I have at this stage, it is quite clear that students in private schools, for example, will not be advantaged and community, DEIS and disadvantaged schools, to which the Deputy referred in particular, will not be disadvantaged. I remember meeting a teacher in Larkin community college in inner city Dublin last year who was doing a pathways in technology, P-TECH, programme and she talked about visible progression year to year, not in three-year or five-year bundles or ten-year timeframes. If there is progression year to year we have to record that and use the mathematical modelling to ensure that if any student is disadvantaged, which I do not think will happen, protection is in place. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue, but as far as I am concerned, school profiling will not be done in the way some have said.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_198">I thank the Minister for his responses to others. He has already responded to many of the issues I wished to raise. I want him to publish the public health advice he has received in respect of cancelling the leaving certificate. I appreciate it was a difficult decision and I know it was not taken lightly. The Minister stated in his he got advice from NPHET which he has published, but I want to know if NPHET or Dr. Tony Holohan gave him advice to cancel the exams and if that was the basis on which he decided to cancel the exams. If that was the basis, if we cannot have 18 or 19 year old adults doing written exams in August, how can we expect infants to go to overcrowded primary schools in September? I again ask the Minister to publish the advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> On the appeals process and the timeline of what will happen after this process has been completed, the ASTI has told its members that the marking itself cannot be appealed. Will the Minister, through his Department, please communicate directly with principals and set out exactly the timeline and appeals process? Apparently, students who are not happy with the assessed grades they receive have two options. First is to submit an appeal, which will not take into account the grade he or she got, and second is to sit the written exam whenever that might take place. Will the Minister confirm to the House that this is the case? If it is the case, will he please communicate directly with principals so that they know the exact timeline and process involved?</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> On school profiling, the Department's website states, "estimated marks from each school will be adjusted to bring them into line with the expected distribution for the school". I sometimes wonder if enough people in the House or society have any comprehension of what it is like to attend a DEIS school and the number of barriers between the pupils and their ability to maximise their potential in this Republic. I sometimes wonder if people really know what it is like. This is probably the only opportunity in many instances for students to break out of poverty and disadvantage. The one opportunity they have is a written exam or an exam where the person marking the exam does not know who they are, where they are from or the school they attend.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The Minister has school league tables within his Department and it is not even possible to make a freedom of information, FOI, request for them because the Department knows they are unfair and give an unfair representation of the education system. Those tables are published in newspapers and every year, education spokespeople and Ministers come out and criticise them and they cannot be requested from the Department by FOI. Yet, this is the very profiling information that will be used to assess an individual's leaving certificate. How devastating must it be for students to grind through situations where they teach themselves honours mathematics, honours Irish or another higher level subject because it is not available in their schools? That is the determination some young people in this country have to break out of disadvantage and poverty. They knew that when the script was being marked, it would be anonymous. That is gone now, however, because the very profiling the Minister will not allow to be requested by FOI from his Department will be used to assess somebody's expected distribution from the school. </p>
          <p eId="para_202"> With the greatest of respect, I cannot accept the answer the Minister gave to other Deputies regarding school profiling. The Labour Party will accept the assessed grades system as proposed by the Minister. We appreciate there is no other option at this stage but we will not accept the school profiling. We cannot do that because it is fundamentally unfair. The simplest thing for the Minister to do now is to delete that from the process and to let each script and assessed grade stand on its own merits. I state that because I do not agree with the Minister when he states that an average student from a fee-paying school will not be advantaged by this system. If I was an average student from a fee-paying school, I would be much happier today than were I an exceptional student from a disadvantaged school. That is because students will be assessed by the history of their schools and, inevitably, someone from a fee-paying background or who has access to tutoring outside the school system will benefit from that. I ask the Minister to please just get rid of the school profiling aspect and then we can all move on together.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> Regarding additional needs, and the issue of July provision has been raised by other Deputies, the Minister has said he is open to expanding it and I accept his statement. Turning to SNAs, however, there is still a level of confusion concerning them. I also refer to the level of disrespect they have received through this process, as has been mentioned elsewhere. The goodwill the SNAs have shown has not been replicated by the Department. It has been said to me many times that the Department understands dealing with school buildings and teachers but it does not know how to deal with things that are not school buildings or teachers. A direct communication from the Minister to SNAs, not via a trade union or the HSE, would be greatly appreciated. </p>
          <p eId="para_204"> My last point, and I will appreciate the Minister's response, is that leaving certificate applied students feel as if they are not involved in this conversation. When the Minister refers to the leaving certificate, will he please put it on record that he also refers to the leaving certificate applied? Otherwise, students taking that option feel they are being relegated in this conversation. For those students we hope and expect will be sitting a written exam in 2021, namely, fifth year students watching this entire situation with great uncertainty and upset, I ask the Minister to speak to them, their experience and what they can expect in 2021. They have missed out on a great deal of class time. What sort of mitigation will the Minister make for their school experience? </p>

          <p eId="para_205">I want to try to stick to the issues raised by the Deputy. He raised the issue of whether I will publish the public health advice. To be clear, the public health advice meant that we could model what the leaving certificate would look like. Using the public health advice, therefore, we modelled the leaving certificate with one exam per day, papers taking one and half hours, staggered entry to exam halls on a day-to-day basis and exams going from 29 July into September. Using that advice and data, we modelled the leaving certificate and we brought that information to the partners around the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Obviously, it was brought to me as well. We decided, after getting advice from the State Examinations Commission, that it could not stand over the legality and validity of a leaving certificate that is not comparable to one of any other year. That is what informed us. The next step was to find out from public health advice whether, when we would announce the timetable the first week in June, there would be any change to the social distancing measures in July and August, and the answer was "No". We have that. That is the discussion we had.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> Deputy Ó Ríordáin also asked who gave the advice. We, in the Department of Education and Skills, including me, as Minister, made the decision based on the information we had that it would not be safe, it would not be right and, ultimately, it would not be fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> The Deputy also tried to make the comparison between sitting an examination in August and bringing schools back in September. This was a decision about bringing post-primary school students, which I wanted and insisted on, in for two weeks prior to the examinations. We were talking about having students in the class for two weeks from mid-July.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> The Deputy talked about appeals and guidelines. I stated earlier that in a week's time we will have that proper information to answer a range of possibly 200 questions that were raised today at our advisory meeting.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">I am conscious of the Minister's statement that exceptional students in disadvantaged schools will not be disadvantaged. Whereas students performing normally in fee-paying schools or other schools will be grand, it is only the exceptional students in disadvantaged schools who will not be put out. That seems like an inherent disadvantage to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> Something you learn when you grow up in a working-class house is that somehow poverty is your fault. You work hard in school. You work hard helping with your siblings and supporting family members who might be ill. You have to go off and get a second job while you are 16 so you can support the family income. No matter how hard you work, it will not be enough to shake off the limitations forced on you because of your family's wealth, or lack thereof. I am someone who grew up in the inner city, which the Minister referenced. I am somebody who has had the opportunity to go to university through an access programme and I have also been privileged to work in education for many years. I know full well that points are not a measurement of hard work, ability or potential. I know that in DEIS schools, not only the one the Minister referenced but those all over the country, a student getting 300 points is just as admirable as a student in another school who manages to get 600 points, taking circumstances into account. In DEIS schools and inner city schools, students who are smart, for example, children from the north inner city, are as clever as any privately educated students who make up the vast majority of those in the third-level schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> The leaving certificate is a game that many students cannot win. If you are a student from a low-income background, a student with a disability or a student from a migrant background, the odds are stacked against you. There are access routes into universities that are college-based initiatives available only to a small exceptional few, who will become myths to success to the many others who will fail.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> The decision last week to award predictive grades or calculated grades codifies that in black and white. I am not sure what the difference between prediction and calculation is. I do not know of any calculation that has ever been made without an inherent prediction. These are based on the past performances of a school. It has been met with outrage among many equality activists. It has also been met with some degree relief on the part of students, who are just looking for clarity on the decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> The perception of the leaving certificate as a great meritocracy persists. Every year that is enforced through feeder schools, which decide who gets the opportunity to go to which college and from what schools. That highlights the massive disadvantages inherent in our leaving certificate. There is one thing someone can do to increase his or her chances of going to university in this country. It is not to work hard, study or apply oneself; it is to go to a private school. Regardless of how hard someone studies, it will not make that vital difference if he or she is from a certain background. School progression rates in the same postcode can vary dramatically. Let us take Dublin 1 as an example, where there is a private school and several schools in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme. In the private school, 117% of students go on to third level each year, accounting for those who take a gap year. In the DEIS schools, one which I have referenced, only 34% of students do so. That is not a reflection of the students. Talking about that honestly and clearly is not discrimination. It is not an insult to those students. It just highlights the fact that there is an ingrained disadvantage in there. Failing to talk about it is actually an insult to those students.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> The leaving certificate debacle has failed so many students this year, in what is widely acknowledged as one of the most worrying times in a young adult's life. The delays in making decisions, and indeed the decision that was ultimately made, have contributed to what is already an anxious time. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that this year's decision has merely ensured that an embedded economic inequality remains embedded. Our education system has failed students for decades. Every year, students doing the leaving certificate are failed because of an illness, because they are experiencing grief or because of the pressure. This year it is simply failing everybody. It will continue to do so unless we systematically dismantle the inequalities enshrined within it.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> Like everywhere else, diversity in our third level institutions is crucial. We need more working-class third level students, more Traveller students, more students from Roma backgrounds, more ethnic students and more students with disabilities. As things stand, the State has totally abdicated its responsibility to ensure equal access to universities. Universities themselves have attempted to diversify their entrant intake through schemes such as college access programmes. These access students are success stories. Study after study shows that when the barriers are removed, the playing field is more equal. These students' grades in college are remarkably similar to those of students who have entered through more traditional routes. These programmes are vital to diversifying our third level institutions and ensuring greater progression rates in marginalised communities. However, the fact that the diversification of third level falls to universities and colleges alone is unacceptable. It is not acceptable that in some universities only 10% of places or fewer are reserved for those from marginalised backgrounds, those whom our State has failed. It is not acceptable that these access programmes, which perform an essential function in diversifying our universities, are reliant on fundraising and donations from private individuals. The State is utterly failing students from disadvantaged areas and schools in areas of economic deprivation, while simultaneously cruelly maintaining that this is a system based on merit or that the exceptional student will progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> Let us not forget that an industry has been built up to profit off this unequal system. Every year, grind schools, private tuition and fee-paying schools transform education into an arms race. The more money a student's parents have, the more likely he or she is to go to university. The more parents invest in their sons, the more opportunity they have in comparison with somebody else in a disadvantaged community.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">More than half of the top 20 schools sending the highest proportion of students to third level were fee-paying schools, according to the feeder list of 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> The outrage that a student's grade will be decided as much based on past performance of his or her school as much as on his or her own ability is one that we must keep with us, grow and build upon. We have failed decades of students through this system of educational apartheid. In the Thirty-third Dáil, we need to be able to say, "No more". Our education system is crying out for reform, with mass support from educators, parents and, critically, from students themselves. It must be our priority. The State must step up and ensure that a postcode is no longer the most reliable predictor of third level access.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> The leaving certificate subjects all students to sitting through unnecessary stress and pressure and, perhaps most dangerously, teaches the winners and losers of this system that their individual outcomes are due to their hard work or lack thereof rather than myriad complex inequalities exacerbated by a system that has run since 1925 without much innovation or change. The system thrives on the fact that each year, a couple of exceptional students will break through the barriers that we have constructed. We use these exceptional kids to lie to ourselves and say that the system works, and that if only all other kids were like these exceptional few kids, they too would be able to progress. It allows us to pretend that the system is not broken and that somehow the kids who are not exceptional are. Let us think of what that does to the student who succeeds in what is, in reality, a lottery, what it does to the students who came close but always feel that they let themselves and their families down, and what it does to the couple of students every year who understand this in their bones, the 11 and 12 year olds who know that is an unfair system, but know that there is no point in trying, because while they are good, they may not be what we consider to be acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> I have one question for the Minister. We have an opportunity this year to be more collective in our response. The leaving certificate is constructed in such a way that when one unravels one string, the whole thing falls apart. We need a cross-party committee to decide on not just the next stages of education and what it looks like in September, October and November. The Minister has referred several times to the experts who are leading this process. Why can these stakeholders not be in that room? Why can we not have a committee that looks at education for fifth year pupils going into sixth year and sixth class pupils going into first year in September, and let us all be involved in that process, because we all have to carry the news?</p>

          <p eId="para_247">I am sharing time with Deputy Mick Barry.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> I have two questions. The vast majority of teachers and parents welcome the clarification on the leaving certificate. When the Minister spoke here two weeks ago, it was clear that it was not logistically possible to do the leaving certificate. The big issue for teachers is that they will now judge their own pupils for State exams. They want to be advocates for their students rather than stand in judgment. There is obviously unease about predictive grading in the teaching profession. There is also the dynamic regarding lobbying by students, which is quite unethical. The predictive grades model is discriminatory and will compound educational disadvantage in Ireland. Will the Minister consider having the State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education and Skills assess and do the grading rather than teachers?</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_249">I hope I understood the question correctly. To be clear, the State Examinations Commission will have nothing to do with this process. Our legal advice states it cannot have anything to do with it, so that is the reason we are setting up the new group.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> There are two major stages; the first of which is the school-based stage involving teachers and their teaching colleagues. For example, there may be two or three geography teachers in a school. If there is one art teacher, for example, that teacher must link in with the deputy principal and the principal then has a role. There is an all-school evaluation in determining the calculated grades and then that goes to the Department of Education and Skills. They are the steps and that is the way the process will work. I think that answers the Deputy's question.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> I thank Deputy Gino Kenny. He and a few of his colleagues were very clear in the previous debate here that they wanted the exam cancelled. I will come to Deputy Barry in a moment as he had ten points.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">My second question is about students with special educational needs in DEIS schools. They have more than likely been experiencing difficulties, especially engaging in remote learning in the past two months. Does the Department have plans to ameliorate the loss of teaching time for these students and to increase the number of special education teachers and SNAs in September or October of the next academic year?</p>

          <p eId="para_253">The answer is "Yes". We have a continuity-of-learning section set up in the Department and we have been working on those issues for a number of weeks. We are looking now at continuity not just for this term but as some Members stated, for the transition for fifth-year students, and seeing where there are gaps for young people with disadvantage as well. We have a specific section working on that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MickBarry" eId="spk_92">
          <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_254">I want to make some points about the position facing the leaving certificate students of 2021, the current fifth-year students, but first I want to look at the reason the leaving certificate exams were cancelled. No doubt the official record will show that they were cancelled due to logistical problems related to organising State exams in a pandemic, the need for PPE in the exam halls, the need for social distancing in the exam halls, and the need to recruit a greater number of volunteers, etc. I do not doubt for one moment that these and other logistical problems were very significant factors in the decision. However, I do wish to challenge the idea that they were the only or overwhelming factors that contributed to the cancellation. Many people, including parents, teachers and students alike, felt it was wrong to proceed with State exams when the pandemic and the loss of school time arising from it placed such a heavy strain on the mental health of so many young people. Those people exerted pressure on the Department in many different ways, but special mention must go to the students themselves. They spoke out online. They organised a poll of nearly 25,000 students, showing 80% support for cancellation, and they attended online protest meetings in their thousands, a number that was only going to grow without a change in the Government position. For this reason I want to read into the record of the Dáil that the leaving certificate class of 2020 played an important role in securing the cancellation of exams that threatened the mental health of their peers. I, for one, would like to congratulate them on having taken this stand and for having achieved this end.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> The new arrangements the Minister has put in place are not satisfactory. Students who were preparing to sit leaving certificate papers outside of a school setting have been left high and dry and that is an issue the Minister must address. I ask him to comment on that in his reply to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> In particular, I wish to raise an issue that in some way is within the theme of this debate, namely, discrimination against working-class students who go to school in working-class communities, which it seems to me is built into this alternative plan. The plan is very similar to the predictive grade system that pertains in the UK under a Tory Government. The biggest research study in the world on this system, conducted by Dr. Gill Wyness - I hope I pronounced the name correctly - of University College London, shows that applicants from low-income homes are more likely to have their grades underpredicted.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">School profiling, which would see a student's grade being marked up or down in line with the past exam history of his or her school or the collective grades in that school, would discriminate in particular against students in schools based in working-class communities. School profiling of this kind should not, and must not, be part of the 2020 leaving certificate. I ask the Minister for further comment on that in his reply. Students should not be pitted against each other in a battle for scarce third level places in this pandemic year. Instead, the Government should open up third level by increasing investment in courses and apprenticeships and offering places for all who want one. In fact, I would argue that third level entry should operate in this way from here on in. This would allow for the abolition of the stressful and outdated leaving certificate exams, which should be deleted from the education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> As I indicated earlier, I want to talk about the other leaving certificate students: the fifth years who make up the class of 2021. The leaving certificate is a two-year cycle which normally runs over 18 months of classroom time in our schools. The class of 2021, however, will lose the best part of three of those 18 months. Even if the schools open in September, this will represent a very significant portion of the course, especially given that the majority of the course is covered in fifth year. Students who are due to take oral exams next year have already been away from a school setting in which they could practice their oral skills for two months. It is little wonder that stress levels seem to be rising among fifth years. The Minister's Department now needs to consider making changes which would make due allowance for the handicaps under which these students have been placed. I intend to return to this subject in the weeks ahead. Will the Minister comment on whether he is considering making allowances-----</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_261">The Deputy asked why the exams were cancelled. They were not cancelled; they were postponed to a date on which it will be safe to do them. We are pursuing the calculated grades system. The Deputy is correct in saying that it was not only public health advice that informed what the leaving certificate would look like. The student voice was quite instrumental and very significant. I engaged with 16,000 to 17,000 students on Instagram one evening. This very loud voice was certainly a big factor. Mental health was a big issue. I had written advice from our National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, about the anxiety and pressure this was causing for young people and we considered disadvantage and digital inequity. There were a number of cumulative reasons we arrived at this decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> I say again that in a week's time, we will have guidelines on how the calculated grades model will work. The emphasis in those guidelines will be on ensuring students' performance over two years, irrespective of their school environment, is taken into account. With regard to those taking classes outside the school, we will have to have tutors assess their performance over two years. These grades will involve the professional judgment of the teacher and the whole school community. The principal and teaching colleagues will be involved and the vice-principal may be involved. I do not have all the answers. We have operated this system for 94 years and we are going into the 95th year. We are introducing a new system in a matter of weeks. We are all going to need help and guidance. From day one, I have insisted on nobody being disadvantaged as a result of where he or she is from or the school he or she attends. This system involves a performance indicator decided by the school and the all-school grade over a period of two years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_265">I start by paying tribute to and thanking teachers around the country. Covid-19 has been an eye-opener for many families with regard to the work, skill, dedication and patience involved in educating young children.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The gratitude that has been displayed by the political class should not be forgotten about when this crisis subsides. I mention that in the context of equal pay for teachers and contracts of indefinite duration, CID, for teachers that need to be addressed, and I hope he will address them.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> I say to students that the leaving certificate is an important exam that has an effect on their next step in their education and career. However, it is by no means the be-all and end-all with regard to their progress through life, education and work. There are many hundreds of different avenues to success in their lives, through education and their careers, ahead of them that can still be taken no matter what happens in these particular exams.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> Obviously, the Minister has not had an easy time and it has been difficult for the Government. The speed of this virus going through the planet and the unknown nature of the virus have made decisions very difficult. He has only had a few months to get to grips with this. However, one of my major problems is that the display by the Government so far with regard to the leaving certificate has been a masterclass in indecision. It is a stressful time anyway and that indecision, speculation, and chopping and changing of positions and decisions have only heaped the pressure and stress on students over the last two months.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> The plan outlined by the Government so far has many problems. It is significant that the exams will not now be held until November meaning that the results will not be available until the new year. Consequently, it is unlikely that those who choose to sit the exams will be able to make it into university this year. Those who sit the exam will, therefore, have to take a year out of education. They may have to try to get a job or if not have a year without income. They will have to watch their classmates and their friends move on with the rest of their lives. That is a major cost to many young men and women in the country. It is a cost that people will not be willing to risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> Originally the Minister said he had planned for the exams to be scheduled in late July and early August. I am asking for a definitive timeline for the leaving certificate. When will the results of the predicted marks be announced? When will the appeals process happen? When will the CAO offers be made? What effect, if any, will it have on the start of the new university year? Given the small numbers involved and the massive number of classes around the country, will the Minister commit to scheduling the exams to enable students to make it to their college courses later this year?</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> There is also significant concern over the pressures being brought to bear on teachers. Since the Minister's announcement of the predictive marks, anecdotally I have heard there has been an increase in communication by students and parents with teachers, many of them rich with compliments at the moment. I know of one teacher who received half a dozen emails from one family just before lunchtime and another parent who contacted a teacher telling the teacher exactly what points the student needed for their desired college course. Another student with low outputs since 7 May has become the most prolific in the class in their level of output.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> A balance needs to be brought to bear to protect teachers from undue pressure and influence. We also need to ensure that students are not isolated from supports and communications from those teachers in their time of need.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> I would like the Minister to address this key question today. Will teachers, principals and schools be indemnified against legal action? Can we at least give them the confidence that no matter what pressures they experience, they will not have to deal with that issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> If we are to protect teachers and help students, we need to ensure the system is as fair and transparent as possible. Some students have completed project work and others have not. Woodwork and engineering work are at varying stages of completion.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Some students have gone on field trips and started projects while others have not. Will students be allowed to work on such projects in the coming weeks? Teachers will be marking complete projects, partly completed projects and even non-existent projects. They do not have a marking scheme to help them to do so. How will they undertake the marking? Will teachers be responsible for it or will independent markers be brought in? Some sections of the home economics course have already been corrected by the State Examinations Commission but it is proposed that the work will be returned to class teachers who will have to remark it. Why is that the case? It does not make sense that work which has already been corrected will be returned to teachers for re-correction.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> In order to simplify the process, I suggest that teachers be allowed to take an average of three of students' results in fifth-year Christmas exams, fifth-year summer exams, sixth-year Christmas exams and the mock leaving certificate. Those data are already in schools' systems. It is fair and transparent and, as such, will also protect teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> I wish to add my voice on the issue of school profiling. To what extent will the profile of a school impact on marking? Will it correct or change the result by 10% or 15%? What is the element of a school's history that will form part of students' results? Profiling places people into boxes; that is what it is for. Education should be about students breaking out of their boxes. It is clear that in many aspects of life, profiling is a form of discrimination. What steps will the Minister take to ensure that we do not have such discrimination in this area?</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_278">As the Deputy is aware, the issue of equal pay for teachers was the subject of significant conversations prior to the election and the pandemic. Anything relating to the issue will form part of the next pay talks.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> The Deputy referred to indecision. To explain, once we postponed the exams to 29 July, I instructed my officials to look at the calculated grades model. I had reservations about the model and went public in that regard. However, once I started informing myself through that process and seeing how the checks and balances come into the system, I became convinced that it would be fairer for students - and safer for them from a public health point of view - to go for that model rather than holding a poorly run leaving certificate examination. That process took a certain amount of time for two reasons. The first is that we had to get legal advice. If we had not done, the State Examinations Commission would be running that calculated grades model but it does not have the authority to do so. Although the Education Act 1998 delegates it the power to run and correct exams, it no longer has that power. Legislative change would be required to give it that power. All Deputies are aware why that cannot be done. That is why I had to get Cabinet approval to get executive authority to set up a new group within the Department. The second factor was consultation. We needed to reach out to teachers. I did not want teachers to be bounced into a decision announced on radio, television or Twitter that we would be going for the calculated grades model. They were part of that process and that engagement was very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> On the definitive timeline, we will continue to work with stakeholders. We will have strict, specific and clear advice and guidelines for teachers regarding marking and professional boundaries between parents, students and teachers. That work has begun already and we will be in a position to publish it next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> As to when the exam results will come out, I am on record as stating that I wish for them to come out as close to the traditional date as possible. However, we must bear in mind that teachers have not begun to assess grades because they are awaiting the guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">We need to continue to work through this. A few Deputies have raised it. Each school - not the Department of Education and Skills - will be determining the result for each class and each individual student. </p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T14:25:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_283">I appreciate that the Minister has a very difficult job. If I was a betting man he might be praying that he would get some other post in the present transactions on the programme for Government. So many of the children wanted the calculated grades assessment that I am glad they have got it but there are other pupils and students who felt they would do better if they sat the leaving certificate. I would have thought that as the numbers sitting it would then be reduced the Department would be able to cater for them to sit the exam. The Minister is saying that may happen some time later in the year but a year is then gone out of their lives and we have lost something there.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> How does the Minister propose to cater for mature students who were hoping to sit the exams or students who want to increase their marks in a subject that they needed for a specific course they were hoping to take? In line with many other Deputies, I have serious concerns about the July provision for children with Down's syndrome and the inclusion of other children in that category because the parents of these children are really suffering and going through a lot at present. I am hoping that project will be offered and available to those children and parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> Every year parents' income for the previous year, or the year before that, is assessed for the SUSI grant. Surely this year's income will be assessed when students and parents apply now for the grant. I hope that is the way they will be assessed this year, not on last year's income or that of the year before because incomes are way down.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> That is another problem caused by holding the exam later in the year. The students will be applying next year for college and the points will be raised. The 2021 class will be affected by more pupils presenting next year. We need to talk about starting back to school in September and to consider how children with underlying conditions such as asthma and respiratory problems and teachers will be facilitated. We have to engage with Bus Éireann for bringing children to school in the new year because if social distancing is still the order of the day there will have to be more buses and much more thought put into this. There is a lot of work to be done. I know the Minister has less than a minute to reply but if he does not answer everything I have said he may send on the reply please.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">I have five minutes and I want to share that with the Minister so that he can answer my questions properly. I thank the Minister for providing much clarity around the leaving certificate of 2020 last Friday.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">Many students are pleased with the plan while many others are not but clarification is still needed around some aspects of the announcement. This includes where a student is taking a subject outside school. My office has been contacted by many students who say their principals believe it is not possible to engage with outside people as they would not be able to verify the data. What will be done in these cases? For example, many students take music outside school. The person taking them for music may not be a teacher. How will these students be facilitated?</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> Is it fair that students who wish to take exams will have to wait until 2021 to attend their first year of college, or is that correct?</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> What contact has the Minister had with his EU counterparts on international students? It is expected that the numbers of international students will be low, which will result in additional places in our colleges being available to domestic students.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> I refer to students who are going into their leaving certificate year in the forthcoming academic year. There has been little reference to the time they have lost in the run-up to their final year. Much of the work for leaving certificate takes place in fifth year, including project work. What plans are being put in place to assist these students? Will they be given additional time around deadlines next year?</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> The July provision for children with special needs will have to be dealt with sensitively and carefully by the Minister and his officials. Regardless of whether the incoming Minister for Education and Skills is Deputy McHugh or someone else, this matter will have to be given the thought, kindness, care and consideration needed to help children with special needs, their parents and the people who work with them. They must be considered at this difficult time.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_102" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_293">I thank both Deputies. Deputy Danny Healy-Rae asked about mature students. They will be treated in the same manner as every other student in terms of data, regardless of whether they are outside school. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae gave the example of music tuition. If someone is getting tuition outside the school setting, data and information from the tutor will be critical in assessing that student. There will be other more difficult examples where students at home do not have access to tutors or are not using tutors. We will look at those on a case-by-case basis. It is an issue which has arisen. The Deputy gave the specific example of music. If a student is studying music in a music school or with a music tutor, the tutor will have access to the performance of the student over two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> Both Deputies raised children with Down's syndrome and July provision. I completely agree that it is a very important service for many young people and parents. We are working on that and if we can expand on it in any way, I am keen that we do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> The matter of SUSI grant assessment being made on 2019 income was raised. The change of circumstances in 2020 would have to be brought into consideration as well. The matter of points for next year and points changing was raised. If a student who decides to take the exam at the earliest opportunity - I have spoken ambitiously about the Hallowe'en break at the end of the first term, but it could be November or December - gets a place in his or her second or third preference area in September and then repeats the year, I have insisted that this will not result in their losing out on the SUSI grant or free fees. We do not know when the exam will take place. It could be January.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> The Deputy is correct in saying that we face massive work in going back to school. We are engaging with Bus Éireann and private operators to make that happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> International students may not be here in September and we will have extra capacity in the system. The third level institutions and their leaders are very flexible and they will work with us to see if we can have more capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The Deputy also asked about the fifth-year students. It is a critical area because they are doing their leaving certificate. Since 12 March they have lost out in terms of time so we are looking at contingency to see how we can support those fifth-year students. That is very important.</p>

I would have been of a different view. I believe the leaving certificate should have been abandoned this year - I agree with that part - but opened up for third level and apprenticeships but that is my personal view. I say "well done" to the Minister. At least we have certainty now.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> Regarding the July provision, is it going ahead or is it not? I welcome the fact that the Minister is trying to expand it. Is it going ahead? If the Minister does not know now, when will he know?</p>

Tied in with that, I want to ask about special needs, which I have mentioned repeatedly in the past two weeks and will repeat again now. We have all received the letters. I have raised them with the Taoiseach. They have written to the Taoiseach directly. I agree with them. For approximately four or five months there has been a setting aside of education for people with special needs in particular, without any rationale. That is my concern. I understand the position on public health is changing on a daily basis but in the case of children with special needs who are attending special schools, was consideration ever given, and can it be given, to opening up the special schools prior to any other schools?</p>

I do not even like the word "vulnerable". We should treat them with equality, dignity and respect. That group requires routine, structure and so on. I do not have the time to read out all of that; the Minister is fully familiar with it, and I respect him on that. What voice is there for those children to look at their needs based, of course, on public health? Who is doing that? It seems to me that nobody is doing that and that they just have been forgotten.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">I do not agree with that assessment because there are many advocacy groups that work on behalf of these students. They have been very active and engaged with our Department. In fact, last week, when I met the children's ombudsman, he raised the issues of disadvantage, digital inequity and special needs. A lot of work is going on in that regard and we have a group in the Department looking at that specific area. We have guidelines out now as to how we can assist in that regard. The schools first closed for two weeks and that continued after Easter and we were working within a two to three-week period but with schools closed now until September, we have started the work around how we can further support people with special needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">I am sharing time with Deputy Harkin.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> I commend the Minister on his work with UL. Would he recommend that the rent regime in other private institutions that are refusing to return rent be changed prospectively? Obviously we cannot change things retrospectively but we can make sure that this does not happen again and that students are not taken advantage of in the way they have been.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> I wish to return to the issue raised by Deputies Gannon and Ó Ríordáin. I accept that the Minister is in a very difficult situation and that class rankings will be done as fairly as possible. However, the guidance published on the Government's website simply states: "The teachers’ estimated marks from each school will be adjusted to bring them into line with the expected distribution for the school." State schools in my constituency, no more than those in the Minister's, do not routinely end up in the top ten schools feeding universities. Those schools are predominantly fee-paying ones. I appreciate that he is in a difficult position but how will this not continue to perpetrate an inequality? Equality is the cornerstone and foundation of this Republic. I ask him to look at this matter and abandon official advice if necessary. Bright students in every school have to be given their chance, notwithstanding where we find ourselves as a country.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> I welcome the clarification on July provision for children with special needs, to the extent that the Minister has been able to give it up to now.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">I would like to respond to Deputy McNamara first, as this is important. I appreciate his intervention. The reason we need standardisation is that we cannot have a school in Bantry on a different platform from a school in Letterkenny. That is why we have it. There is an assumption that once this standardised model comes into place, maths scores, for example, within a school will be brought down. However, it is possible that maths could be brought up instead. It is not a question of teachers' marks for subjects being brought down by this standardisation. The standardisation is necessary because we have to look at all the other CAO applicants on last year's leaving certificate. That is why there has to be standardisation and a level playing field. We cannot have a case where a score in Bantry is different from a score in Letterkenny. I understand the concern around ensuring that everybody is treated fairly, and that was the subject of today's advisory group meeting with the students' union representative voice. I will certainly continue to feed in the concerns expressed in this House today, but I reiterate that this is based on the school-based assessment and the track records of students over a period of two years. Students will be marked by the teaching group and the all-school group once they provide the evidence. They will have the data and exam scripts, whether from Christmas exams, different exams or from speaking to teachers who do an exam after every module. There is a track record and a safety net for students who may have moved to that school. The junior cycle result will also be built into the mathematical model.</p>

          <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport ( Shane Ross)<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T15:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_332">I did not expect to be back in the Chamber quite so soon but it is nice to be here.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> I welcome the opportunity to address the House today to speak about the impact of Covid-19 on our transport system and our plans to support the sector in recovering from this crisis. I have spoken to the House on a number of previous occasions on the transport portfolio, but the circumstances in which the sector now finds itself are, it is fair to say, unprecedented. Of course, the primary focus of the Government must be the response to the public health crisis. Nevertheless, we must also do our utmost to help our economy to recover from what is the worst short-term economic shock in the history of the State. </p>
          <p eId="para_334"> Transport, along with other sectors under the remit of my Department, has been impacted severely as a result of the current crisis. The importance of the transport sector to Ireland’s economy cannot be overstated. We are situated on the western periphery of Europe and the sector connects us with the rest of the world. </p>
          <p eId="para_335"> The key message I want to deliver to Members and the Irish people at this time is that our transport network and services continue to operate safely and effectively, providing vital connectivity for essential workers and essential trade. Transport and travel up to now have been means of physically connecting us to family and loved ones. While many of these longed-for trips cannot be made at present, one of my primary goals is ensuring that people can make these essential visits safely and easily when restrictions are eased. In the meantime, it is heartening to see increased numbers of people walking and cycling, and I hope this uptick in active travel is maintained, even as restrictions ease.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> The public transport system is a critical part of the plan for the reopening of the economy. It is inconceivable that public transport should not function properly during the present crisis. I can, therefore, confirm to the House that the Government will provide the necessary additional funding to continue those services despite the drop in fare income. My Department is working closely with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to assess and quantify this additional funding requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> A priority of the Government is to maintain Ireland's international transport connectivity, supporting the movement of essential goods into, around and out of the country. It has been more important than ever to maintain strong links with our European partners and our neighbours in the UK. I have worked with European member states and the Commission over the past few difficult months, seeking to minimise the impact of disruption to transport, and the movement of international transport workers, at borders.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">A dialogue has been initiated between the governments of Ireland, the UK and France to strengthen our partnerships, share best practices and support the movement of essential goods during this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> My Department is also working with partners inside and outside government to maintain continuity of supply chains. We have had ongoing and frequent engagement with airlines, airports, shipping companies, ports and hauliers. I acknowledge and recognise the vital role they all play in bringing essential supplies to Ireland. The Road Safety Authority has implemented a number of measures to support the continued functioning of the road haulage sector, including a temporary derogation from EU driving and rest hour rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> Port and shipping services, albeit with some reductions in capacity, continue the vital movement of goods. The maritime sector is essential to the continued supply of goods in and out of the country, accounting for 90% of Ireland's international trade in volume terms. In response to a near collapse in ferry passenger numbers, my Department temporarily designated five strategic maritime routes as public service obligation, PSO, routes for a period of three months. I allocated an emergency provision of up to €15 million towards the costs involved in the continued operation of services on these routes. My Department developed tailored guidance setting out risk mitigation measures for essential workers in the maritime supply chain, and introduced measures to ensure seafarer and vessel certification remains valid throughout the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> Owing to its location, Ireland is highly dependent on air connectivity, more so than most EU member states. It is the lifeblood of our tourism sector and it is critical for our economy overall. In recent months, passenger numbers have fallen by up to 99% and forward bookings have collapsed. The Government is working hard to protect air connectivity for the future. Many of our airports have taken difficult decisions to temporarily lay off staff to help constrain escalating losses. These staff can, and are, availing of the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment. Both the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and Shannon Group are availing of support under the Government's Covid-19 temporary wage subsidy scheme. Our State airports continue to facilitate airline services for passengers, cargo operators and aviation business based at the airports. Notwithstanding the challenges facing the aviation sector, I acknowledge the support it has provided during the pandemic, particularly the important role that Aer Lingus, the Irish aircraft leasing sector and other airlines are playing in securing personal protective equipment, PPE, and essential medical supplies. I know the country as a whole is appreciative of their vital work to assist our health sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> Since the beginning of the crisis, domestic travel has significantly reduced. Notwithstanding this, road deaths remain slightly above the numbers for the same period last year. In particular, there has been a worrying increase in the number of pedestrian deaths. Figures for drink-driving are as high as last year and the incidence of drug-driving is significantly up. At this time, when we are all concerned about the impact of Covid-19, I appeal to all road users to act responsibly and with care.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> The Government has been clear that continued operation of the public transport sector is vitally important, and it has been designated among the essential services that are to carry on. I thank operators and staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times. A number of measures have been introduced throughout the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures across the network. Current capacity is significantly ahead of demand, which ensures social distancing can be easily maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> The roadmap published last week clearly sets out a plan for returning to business as usual over the coming months. My Department and the NTA are engaging with public transport operators to determine the practical implications for public transport provision as Covid-19 restrictions are eased in Ireland, and a public transport plan in response to the Government's roadmap for the easing of restrictions will be published shortly. The NTA advises that current levels of service will facilitate the expected increase in passenger numbers, principally in the construction sector, from the start of phase one. The operators are in a position to provide additional capacity, including a return to the normal Monday to Friday schedule and mobilisation of additional vehicles at any particular pinch points in the network, should more capacity be required in phase two.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> In the short term, more people will wish to walk and cycle to shops, to work or just to get some exercise. I am glad to say that my Department, through the NTA, is helping to rethink how best our cities can support people switching to active travel modes and facilitate social distancing in urban centres. The NTA is working with local authorities to develop Covid mobility frameworks which will set out specific plans to improve walking and cycling infrastructure. The first framework is being developed with Dublin City Council. I understand that the initial draft will be available in the coming days. It will set out measures to be put in place in the coming weeks and months to facilitate the safe resumption of social and business activity. I intend that similar plans will be developed for Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. </p>
          <p eId="para_346"> This emphasis on active travel is not just a short-term measure; it has been a feature of the submissions we received during our consultation on our sustainable mobility policy in the last few months. Along with these much-needed temporary measures, we are continuing to fund the longer-term projects like the Royal Canal greenway in Dublin, the Parnell Street improvements in Limerick and the extension of the Waterford greenway into the city centre. </p>
          <p eId="para_347"> On 1 May the Government published the roadmap for easing of restrictions, phase 1 of which begins next Monday. The challenge for the transport sector is to deliver services safely as restrictions are eased. The sector has continuously engaged with public health advice and we will work to provide safe transport services for our economy, for our people and for our country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Marc MacSharry<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T15:15:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_348">I wish to share time with Deputies Niall Collins, Cathal Crowe and Cormac Devlin. I will take six minutes and each of the other Deputies will take three minutes. As is the case with other contributions, I will use my six minutes to pool a number of questions and the Minister may decide to answer in writing on another day so that we are not wasting speaking time in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> I welcome the Minister back to the House. Cocooning in the Wicklow hills did not do him any harm. I fear that when it comes to transport, tourism and sport, however, a lot of the Department may have been cocooning with him. The various sectors are at pains to point out that they are urgently awaiting sector-specific measures to assist them. We are discussing transport today, but we had an engagement on tourism and the hospitality sector last week. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, who was here on behalf of the Minister, briefed him on that debate. A week later nothing further has happened and we are no further on. There is a basic denial or, perhaps, a lack of understanding of the sorts of measures that the sector will require to get off the ground. If we do not take them, we will have up to 260,000 people on the dole. We are as well to have them working and that will require imaginative and sectoral support.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> On the transport side, in his opening statement the Minister clearly indicated that he intends to support those agencies of the State that are in difficulty financially. Expressway, in particular, is on the path to insolvency, and that has serious implications for the directors of that company in terms of their fiduciary duties. I hope that the work the Minister, his Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are doing comes to a conclusion very quickly so that we can have the appropriate cash injection, not just for Expressway but also for other aspects of our public transport system which will need it to stand still, not to mention our ambitions for public transportation going forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> In addition, private operators within the public transport system will require our support. Rural link and taxi drivers have been affected. We need an all-encompassing strategic plan to keep the network functioning and to facilitate the recovery in the post-Covid period once we are in a position to begin. I ask that those figures be announced as quickly as possible and that there is a strategic plan for the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> The Minister mentioned the safety of our public transport network. There have been a number of pedestrian deaths in the past couple of months, which is a cause for concern considering that there has been less traffic. There have been more deaths than during the same period last year and, sadly, nine pedestrians have lost their lives. I ask the Minister to raise that matter with the Road Safety Authority and determine what is needed, such as enforcement measures for gardaí to deal with people speeding in urban areas where there is no traffic.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> The Minister referred to micro mobility. This is key, given that we have all been semi-conditioned to staying at and working from home. There must be an all-of-Government approach to the incentivisation of working from home, car pooling and walking and cycling where possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">France has displayed particularly good ambition in announcing that it intends to establish 650 km of pop-up Covid cycleways. That is something we should do now in the larger cities, where cycling is a genuine option for those healthy, capable and willing enough to do so. That could help with congestion. Other cities around the world, such as Oakland, San Francisco and New York, have also introduced new powers, as has the UK, to make certain thoroughfares available only to cyclists, joggers or pedestrians. That is also something we should look at now we have the opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> We must work hard on consumer sentiment and confidence to try to get people to re-engage with public transport. I refer to additional capacity. We had a serious problem with capacity before the current crisis and addressing that issue will involve engaging with the private sector to see if it can help in supplementing public transport capacity, particularly with buses. Regarding aviation, legislation will be required urgently. We heard about the form-filling debacles of last week, where some people in airports were filling out forms but others were not. Post Covid-19, in the period after the lifting of the lockdown, we will have to focus heavily on ensuring we have contact tracing and on knowing who is coming into the country and where they are going to be so we can prevent spikes happening again.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> I was glad to hear the Minister saying how vital the aviation sector in general is to our recovery as an island nation with an outward-looking economy. We need a package, perhaps Europe-wide, to support aviation. We are lucky in Ireland with the relative health of the balance sheets of Aer Lingus and Ryanair. They will not last, however, unless we are in a position to assist them in some way.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> I have two closing points before I hand over to my friends. Driver testing, particularly for learner drivers, has a backlog of approximately 20,000 building up. We need a plan to deal with that, because young people have been asked to deal with enough and sacrifice enough. They cannot be faced with losing their vehicles, having them seized or being prosecuted for driving. We need to be imaginative on that topic. I have also been asked to raise the issue of car tax. Many elderly people have been cocooning. Can they be refunded a portion of their car tax for the year? Can that be looked at?</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, has approximately €300 million in its accounts. It needs €90 million. I know this is more a matter for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, and his Department, but there is also a transport-related levy of 2c per litre of fuel. Given NORA has €300 million in its accounts but needs only €90 million, I suggest there needs to be urgent legislation to provide for it to make a one-off payment to the Exchequer of €210 million, because those much-needed resources could be put to work on some of these measures.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">I note the Minister stated he is going to step in and help to fund the public transport system so that it can get through the crisis. That is very welcome, and particularly so for the workers and their families who rely on it for their livelihoods and for users. We must note the strain Bus Éireann, Irish Rail and Dublin Bus are under because of the cash shortages being experienced.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> I also wish to comment on air connectivity. I welcome Ryanair's announcement yesterday that from 1 July, it will seek to get back to 90% capacity on its routes. That is good and the public has broadly welcomed that announcement, subject to the existing guidelines. I ask the airlines, including Aer Lingus, to try to step up to the mark a little better regarding refunds. I had communication from the CEO's office in Ryanair recently following a representation I made which stated the airline has 5 million refunds to get through before getting to those for April. A bit of urgency is required there by the airlines.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> Regarding the region I come from, what is the Minister going to do to help Shannon Airport? The mid-west region, which comprises Limerick, Clare, Tipperary and north Kerry, relies on Shannon Airport as a key factor in our regional competitiveness and as a driver for the region. Difficulties are being experienced and I would like to hear what the Minister is going to do in that regard. We know Shannon Airport has been experiencing a fall-off in passenger market share since separation, sadly.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">I also want to make special mention of the Aer Lingus crew members who are based out of Shannon. There are almost 100 ground crew and pilots based out of Shannon. Has the Minister had engagement with Aer Lingus to ensure that both Ryanair and Aer Lingus keep their bases in Shannon for the foreseeable future?</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> I will remark briefly on tourism and the hospitality sector. Basically, what the Government has offered to date is not good enough. If we have no employers, we will not have jobs for people to go back to. The suite of measures which have been offered is simply not good enough. These businesses need cash grants and liquidity to get back into operation as soon as possible. They also need cheaper finance. Financing through AIB and Bank of Ireland at a margin of 5% simply is not good enough. We need to see the zero percent liquidity and funding which is available from Europe coming through at zero cost to these businesses to allow them to reopen.</p>

          <from>Deputy Cathal Crowe<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T15:25:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_364">I welcome back the Minister, Mr. Ross. There are a number of topical issues I wish to bring to the Minister's attention today.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> In my constituency, we have Clare Bus, a not-for-profit company operating a fantastic rural transport service since 2002. For the past 18 years, it has provided transport links to the most rural parts of Clare. We are not a leafy suburb with DARTs and Luas trams going down through it. We rely very much on rural transport. It is essential in our county.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> At the time of its founding, Clare Bus's overarching principle was that it would be fully inclusive. Insofar as that is concerned, it has operated a fully-accessible fleet of buses. As I am sure the Minister will understand, they have carried some of the most vulnerable people throughout County Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> The National Transport Authority has for a number of months been waging a most unfair war against Clare Bus. It has left Clare Bus out of pocket to the tune of €96,000. There is agreement that €22,000 of that will be paid but there is an outright impasse and dispute relating to €74,000 of that. It is utterly shambolic that a vital rural transport service provider would be left short-changed by a Government body. There are many losers here - the hundreds of people who depend on Clare Bus day in, day out and, of course, the Clare Bus workers. Right now, all 25 Clare Bus workers are in receipt of Covid-19 social welfare payments. They are the only group of workers I can think of in the State at present who have been made redundant, not by the Covid crisis but by a Government body hard-balling. It would be cheaper for the State to stop these Covid payments and immediately let these men and women get back to their jobs. One worker recently told me he feels like he and his colleagues have been subject to a constructive dismissal on the part of the National Transport Authority. To pay redundancy to its workers right now, Clare Bus would need to sell some of its bus fleet. The National Transport Authority will tell one that it offered fresh contracts, but how could any company engage in contract talks when so much money is outstanding to it?</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Shannon Airport is the driving force in Clare and the mid-west region. At this time of crisis, it has been deemed essential and has accepted many cargo flights of personal protection equipment, PPE. When the crisis is over, there will be an acute need for the Department to provide the airport with a capital expenditure fund. For too long, the airport has had to self-finance all major projects, including a recent €15 million upgrade of the runway. All such outlays seriously eat into the airport's financial resources meaning that it has very little funding left over for marketing the airport, attracting new routes and retaining existing routes. There is urgent action needed in that regard. The funding needs to be ring-fenced for the airport to safeguard it in the future. When the State seeks to reboot its economy, the Minister will be reliant on Shannon Airport in the west and mid-west.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> Finally, on tourism in general, tourism is worth over €400 million per annum in a good year to the Clare economy. That sector needs an adrenaline shot at present and groups, such as Quilty cottages, have asked that the Minister might move the reopening date from Monday, 20 July, to Saturday, 18 July in order that they could get a full week's booking as opposed to <i>ad hoc</i> days.</p>

          <p eId="para_370">I welcome the Minister to the House today. I will leave time at the end of my questions for him to answer them.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> At the outset, I pay tribute to the front-line transport workers who have kept Ireland moving throughout this pandemic and I ask the Minister to pass on our praise and thanks to them through his offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> In relation to the taxsaver scheme, I acknowledge the National Transport Authority, NTA's role in ensuring that over 60,000 commuters will be compensated. This is only fair. I thank the NTA for the speed in which it dealt with that query.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> I also acknowledge the role and innovation of many local authorities right across the country, including my own of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which have responded to the needs of cyclists and pedestrians during this period.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> Businesses across the country are taking steps to ensure employees and indeed their customers are physically distanced when they reopen on Monday next. Supermarkets have made great strides in providing gloves and hand sanitisers at the point of entry into their premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Some are even washing down shopping trolleys between use by one customer and the next. </p>
          <p eId="para_376"> What contingencies has the Government put in place to protect the public and limit the spread and transmission of Covid-19 as businesses reopen and the public starts using public transport, mainly the DART, Luas and Dublin Bus services, during the first stage of the lifting of restrictions next week? Will masks and hand sanitisers be provided to commuters? Will bus carriages and the buses themselves be sanitised between uses and between journeys, as is the case in many other countries across the world? If we expect members of the public to use public transport, they have to know it is safe to do so. That assurance needs to come from the Department. </p>
          <p eId="para_377"> Finally, I ask the Minister to make a statement about those over the age of 70 whose driver licences require renewal and about the national car test, NCT, which was not addressed in his speech.</p>

          <p eId="para_379">That is going to be difficult. I do not know whether to start at the bottom. I will start with Deputy MacSharry's questions as he was first. He addressed the issue of tourism. As the Deputy knows, I hope to have the tourism recovery task force named, set up and running by the end of the week. It is very important. As the Deputy said, it is one of the worst-affected industries in the country, if not the worst. It is very important that we get the right task force ready. We are almost there and I would be surprised if we do not make an announcement before the end of this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> The Deputy is right that the situation concerning Expressway is very grim. The National Transport Authority, NTA, is working on this with CIÉ on a daily basis. We hope to be able to make an announcement on that very shortly. It is inconceivable that any public service body which is currently subvented should be allowed to go bust.</p>

          <p eId="para_382">I am sharing time with Deputies Cronin and Wynne. We will respectively take seven minutes, four minutes and four minutes. If the Minister does not mind, I will ask some questions and request a response, and we might go back and forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> My first question concerns the Covid-19 checks and the controls at our ports and airports, particularly the latter. We know that our airports have never been quieter. Passenger numbers at Dublin Airport were down by 57% in March, and possibly by as much as 90% in all Irish airports last month. Despite these low passenger numbers, the current system of Covid-19 checks and controls, including the public health passenger locator form, has proven entirely inadequate. It is reported that approximately one third of passengers do not fill out the form and a further one third do not answer follow-up calls. We know that Ryanair wants to resume 40% of flights from 1 January. This could lead to significantly increased passenger numbers at our airports at a time when the citizens of Ireland are supposed to be staying within 20 km of our homes. We also know that the European Commission is today publishing a strategy paper on resuming leisure travel in a safe and co-ordinated manner. Will the Minister acknowledge that the current system of checks and controls at our ports and airports is not fit for purpose? Will he assure people that public health advice, and not the commercial interests of airlines, the European Commission or anybody else, will determine transport policy at ports and airports at this time? Will he outline the measures that will be introduced to ensure the very highest standards of Covid-19 checks and controls at our ports and airports as we progress through the different phases of relaxation? Are protocols being developed? Are temperature checks being considered? What about additional powers for the Garda? What are the plans for the 14-day period of isolation? Is the Minister working with colleagues in the North to ensure that these protocols apply to all ports and airports on the island of Ireland?</p>

          <p eId="para_386">I am happy to do that. I thank the Deputy for his remarks. I share his concerns but I do not share his conclusions. What happens at airports and ports is absolutely vital to keeping coronavirus out. The Deputy has put his finger on a point which has caused some concern and difficulty, namely, the locator forms.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">There were reports in the press that about a third were not being filled in by people who were coming in to the country and ought to be. First, do not exaggerate the problem. The airports are virtually closed. To say there are masses of hundreds of thousands of people coming in unnoticed is not true.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">Do not exaggerate the problem. The Deputy is right that it is a problem. It was acknowledged and identified as a problem last week. I met with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Health. If I am wrong, it could have been with officials. There have been so many meetings. The three Departments certainly got together to address the problem that some locator forms were being missed and the reasons for it were being investigated. They wanted to look at whether this should be voluntary or mandatory, because it was not mandatory beforehand. People were for some reason not filling in forms or not handing them in. It might have been because some of them were being handed to them by the airlines and airports at the point of departure, not the point of arrival. It might be because some of them were not handing the forms out. I am not suggesting that but it is possible. Proposals are due shortly about the possibility of making it mandatory for people to fill these forms in, so that the gardaí can follow-up, make telephone calls and do spot checks, so that it can be absolutely certain that this is being enforced. I am not sure that there is a bad reason. If they are not getting the forms, they will obviously not fill them in. The Deputy is quite right that some were not filling them in but it is being addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_390">I thank the Minister. I am satisfied with that answer. I want to raise the issue of traffic guarantees and how they might be affected at this time during the Covid-19 crisis. Has the Minister any information about the liability that the taxpayer is now coming under as a result of traffic guarantees on public private partnership projects, given the fact that traffic volumes have nose dived? What are taxpayers' liabilities for March and April, for example? Have the Minister or his Department investigated whether there is a <i>force majeure</i> or business interruption clause in any of these contracts? I think the taxpayer would be justifiably disgusted at the idea of private operators being given cast iron guarantees on income at this time when insurance companies are, as the Minister is aware, running a mile from their liabilities for pubs and other businesses. Will the Minister tell us what the additional liabilities relating to traffic guarantees are, as applied to the Covid-19 crisis?</p>

          <p eId="para_391">The Deputy is right that there will be a loss to Transport Infrastructure Ireland in various functions that it carries out. There will be a loss from toll takings. It estimates that there will be a loss of between €57 million and €92 million, which is substantial. There will also be losses due to traffic guarantees but I do not think it will be as high as that. I do not have the figure but can check it for the Deputy. I think it is significantly smaller. It is certainly something that we have to take into account when looking at the finances of such a semi-State body. The loss in income will be twofold. I think we are talking about a substantial loss in income to TII this year, from the matter that the Deputy mentioned and from tolls.</p>

I thank the voters of Kildare North who expressed their faith in Sinn Féin to lead a Government of real change, returning me to the Dáil as their first female Sinn Féin Deputy. Politics is all-consuming and I want to thank my mam, brother, sisters and my children for their unwavering love and support. I also thank my republican family, the Ruth Hackett Cumann, and Sinn Féin activists across Kildare North for keeping the faith in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, ratified by An Chéad Dáil. I hold this same faith and I promise to work hard for workers and families in Kildare North to deliver the change they voted for.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">This is my maiden speech and it is all the more emotional to be delivering it at a time of national and international crisis. I take this opportunity to pay my respects to every one of the almost 2,000 Irish people who have lost their lives to Covid-19. Many of us have experienced the grief of losing a family member, and I remember my daddy today. I cannot imagine the distress those families endured, not being able to kiss their loved ones goodbye. Ar dheis Dé go raibh siad.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> I had anticipated that my first address on transport would be about exploring the possibility of extending the light rail system to Kilcock and Sallins and the Luas line to Naas; about improvements to the Dublin Bus service for Leixlip, Celbridge and my home town of Maynooth and returning Dublin Bus to Kilcock; about improving the Bus Éireann service for Prosperous and Clane, as well as the bus scoile for Rathcoffey and the other places in the hinterland of Kildare; and, critically, about ensuring all public transport is accessible to citizens with disabilities. Those are the issues I would have addressed if these were ordinary times, but these are not ordinary times.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> We have people going back to work next week, before we have built an effective testing and timely tracing and containment infrastructure for the virus. The most immediate concern for families in north Kildare right now regarding transport is how they are going to travel to work safely from next week. I read the Return to Work Safely protocol at the weekend and public transport barely got a mention. I welcome the Minister's statement that he has been engaging with public transport operators but when will he publish a comprehensive plan for transport during the Covid-19 outbreak? This protocol must include, among those issues already mentioned, plans to carry workers to their place of work without bringing a return of traffic chaos to the streets; managing social distancing at bus stops, train stations and on board; and whether face coverings will be mandatory.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> I welcome the Minister's statement that public transport will be disinfected. How regularly will that be carried out? Will hand sanitiser be available at entry and egress points on public service vehicles? Those are vital concerns for workers and families in north Kildare and for workers delivering this essential service.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> It is our duty, in accordance with the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil, to take all necessary measures to safeguard the health of our people. That is what we must do. The Minister must communicate a comprehensive transport protocol now. It is a critical part of the reopening plan. We cannot look back and say that this was another weak link in suppressing the virus.</p>

          <p eId="para_399">It is a huge honour for me to deliver my maiden speech in the Chamber today. I sincerely thank all of the Clare people who entrusted me with their votes in the recent general election. I am so proud to say I am now one of only three women ever elected to represent the people of Clare, and the first ever female Sinn Féin Deputy in the county. I take great pride in representing the Clare people and will do so to the best of my ability. I will work hard to deliver the change that people voted for. That means delivering solutions on housing, health, climate change, pensions, giving workers and families a break and advancing Irish unity.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> We are in the midst of an unprecedented public health emergency and I send my condolences to the many families who have lost loved ones. As we now prepare to rebuild the economy and society, it is imperative that we prioritise a fair recovery. That will mean rebuilding the economy and investing our way out of recession; investing in universal healthcare; delivering the biggest public housing programme in the State's history, while creating thousands of jobs; and investing in our forgotten regions that will suffer most as a result of the neglect of successive Governments. That must be the bottom line.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> Clare is one of those areas that has suffered at the hands of successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments, not least in the area of transport. The loss of the Clare Bus service contract while arrears are outstanding, only to be given to a private operator at a higher cost to the taxpayer, beggars belief. The board of Clare Bus feels its members have been discarded and cast aside. It is not acceptable that such a vital service would be treated in this manner. I welcome the planned meeting by video conference between Ms Anne Graham, CEO of the National Transport Authority, and Deputies from Clare, which I requested. However, I am disappointed that Clare Bus will not be represented at the meeting. I will seek a clear commitment on the future of Clare Bus, due to the loss of its service contract. Will the Minister clarify whether there has been a policy shift against the unique position of Clare Bus due to its being both a transport co-ordination unit and a bus company?</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Will the Minister also step up and engage an independent mediator to resolve contractual issues between the NTA and Clare Bus, thereby enabling the release of funds owed to the company? Will he ensure this is done in a timely fashion to safeguard the future of Clare Bus and to allow it to potentially resume operating at some level? Some 72% of services currently provided by the private operator are not accessible and therefore exclude wheelchair users and those with reduced mobility. This is a distressing state in which to leave persons of need. Will the Minister confirm his commitment to this measure?</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> I also highlight the needs of Shannon Airport which, as we all know, is a vital asset to County Clare and the mid-west region. The Sinn Féin team in the mid-west recently met the CEO of Shannon Airport to convey our party's support in bringing forward solutions to help Shannon as we emerge from the Covid-19 shutdown. Unsurprisingly, given the total shutdown of international and tourism as a whole on this island, the challenges the airport faces are significant both financially and logistically. There is much concern about the future of Shannon Airport in light of its known struggles, which predate the Covid-19 pandemic. We need to protect it and to grow passenger numbers to ensure it can continue to operate successfully in a post-Covid world. What financial supports will be put in place to ensure the doors remain open, that flights continue and that, ultimately, jobs are protected?</p>

          <p eId="para_405"> Deputy Cronin said she does not have much confidence with regard to safety on public transport. Dr. Tony Holohan addressed the issue of masks, which the Deputy raised, yesterday. He said he will make a recommendation by the end of the week. It looks like people will be asked to use coverings on public transport. They do not like to say "masks" as this word is rather clinical. It may be recommended that coverings be allowed and encouraged in places such as on public transport and in supermarkets. There would be positives and negatives to such a recommendation but guidance is needed. There will continue to be social distancing. That particular issue must be monitored very carefully because we do not know what demand will be like next week. It is very difficult to know whether people will be reluctant to go on buses or whether they will move to their private cars. It is being monitored very closely. We are very confident about phase one. Phase two is coming a few weeks later and adjustments will be made accordingly.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">I will share time with Deputies Feighan, Higgins and Heydon. I welcome the Minister back to the Dáil and wish him every success. My first point relates to MetroLink and BusConnects. It is essential that these projects proceed. There must be no go-slow on them. The statement today from the very eminent representative of the National Bus and Rail Union, Mr. Dermot O'Leary, who makes very significant contributions to transport policy, does not make sense. We must not abandon these hugely important public transport policies in the face of the Covid-19 threat. At some stage we will find a medical solution or vaccine for this evil virus. It would not make sense not to proceed with these major public transport projects, particularly in light of the tens of thousands of extra people they will be able to carry in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> My second point relates to the statistics on roadworthiness testing for commercial vehicles. The failure rate for vans and jeeps is 40%, for trucks it is 38%, and for buses it is 31%. The rate of test failures due to dangerous results is 4.9% for jeeps and vans, 4.7% for trucks and 3.1% for buses. More than 168,000 commercial vehicles had to be retested in 2019. This is a very serious issue. I appreciate that this testing has stopped as a result of Covid-19 but it is essential we take whatever steps are necessary to protect workers and so on by testing these commercial vehicles, which are currently on the road doing a very important and strategic job for our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Perhaps somebody else might be able to tell me if they are legally entitled to travel on the Continent without this certificate of vehicle roadworthiness in real time. It is a very important issue that needs to be urgently addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> The Minister is well aware of the situation regarding bypass roads. In my constituency the Ardee bypass has been designed and money has been provided for it. That bypass is on hold for the moment while Louth County Council undertakes a reassessment. It is essential that the Ardee bypass is commenced this year. Excellent work has been done by Meath County Council and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on the proposed Julianstown bypass. That is the 16th busiest road in the country carrying more than 20,000 vehicles and the bypass needs to be urgently prioritised. Whatever compromises are reached in the Government or elsewhere, if rural people travelling to working in Dublin or travelling around the towns of Ardee and Drogheda, etc., are not able to do that efficiently owing to being held up in stagnant traffic for hours, that is not a price my constituents will pay. They would be extremely angry if these road projects do not proceed.</p>

          <p eId="para_411">In the limited time I have I would like to get a progress report on the N4 Castlebaldwin roads project. When will it be completed? Has Covid affected the completion date?</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> Members of Leitrim County Council have contacted me. The cathaoirleach of Leitrim County Council advised that the local improvement scheme in County Leitrim is substantially reduced from what was hoped for in 2020 to €250,000. The council had been hoping for closer to €400,000. Could additional funding be made available? I welcome the announcement of a tourism recovery task force and I look forward to that meeting being held as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">The public's response to this crisis has been impressive and because of that we are making progress. However, that progress is fragile, and a very real threat is posed at our ports. As the Minister said, one in three Dublin Airport passengers refused to fill out an optional form telling us where they planned to self-isolate. Passengers can waltz through our airports, claim they are travelling to Northern Ireland and not have to comply with any restrictions regardless of the threat they pose to the island. It is worth remembering that it is less than three months since the first passenger with Covid-19 travelled through Dublin Airport. A small number of passengers like this brought this virus to our shores. Less than three months later we now have more than 23,000 confirmed cases and, tragically, 1,500 deaths. Our way of life has come to a standstill.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> Passengers coming into Ireland are at a trickle, but change is coming. Ryanair is gearing up to service nine out of ten of its routes and passenger numbers will soon soar again. Allowing an optional form govern people's responsibilities to self-isolate on arrival in Ireland is an insult. It is an insult to everyone who has spent weeks trapped in their homes, to our front-line workers who have been risking their health to protect and help others and to the families of the 1,488 people who have died from coronavirus. Is making a form obligatory, as the Minister has suggested, really enough? Do we not need emergency legislation to force passengers to provide the address where they will self-isolate and put a system in place to police that?</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Heydon<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_415">It is good to have the Minister back here. I welcome today's announcement by Horse Sport Ireland that the following engagement with Sport Ireland outdoor equestrian sport will be included in phase one of the reopening on 18 May, or at least that is the interpretation they have of it. While responsibility for horse racing and breeding rightly comes under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and not the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, I believe the precedent set in respect of outdoor equestrian activity makes a very strong case for the early resumption of horse racing activity in Ireland also.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Horses are already being exercised by jockeys every day on gallops all over the country. Ten meetings were held behind closed doors before the closure of tier 2 activities and Horse Racing Ireland has since further strengthened the protocols around the resumption of racing behind closed doors.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> Horse racing is an industry, not just a sport. It employs 30,000 people in the racing and breeding sectors. The current restrictions on racing have very significant knock-on implications for breeze-up and other sales as well as the breeding sector more broadly, trainers, jockeys, racecourses and the future viability of those racecourses. Horse racing can return in a safe manner. With racing having already resumed in jurisdictions such as France, where it resumed this week, it is crucial that Ireland is not left behind. It can be done in a safe way.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> Horse racing is a source of much-needed enjoyment for many people at home, many of them cocooning, who are looking for activity. When one knocks on doors in County Kildare, one meets plenty of people of that age bracket who have a racing paper on their lap and keenly follow racing throughout the day. Many racing supporters at home would dearly love to have Irish horse racing back on television.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> I ask that due consideration be given by NPHET and the Cabinet and in any discussions being had by the Minister to the resumption of racing in Ireland earlier than originally anticipated. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and his Department are also pushing this issue.</p>

I wish to take this opportunity to thank the members of the NBRU for the fantastic job they have done on the front line of transport in recent weeks. It should be acknowledged that the unions have behaved very responsibly up to now and will continue to do so. The members of the workforce have done a great service to the nation at some risk to themselves and I wish to thank them for that. Deputies should be aware that BusConnects is seeking to do exactly what Mr. O'Leary is looking for. MetroLink will open a new high-capacity public transport corridor through the city and into Fingal. I have read that in responding to our new circumstances the answers lie in projects which have already been considered. Most interestingly and incredibly, I have read that this huge multi-billion euro programme can be delivered in five years. All Deputies will agree that we need to expand and improve the capacity of our public transport system, whether to deal with the climate action challenge that will be with us for many years to come or the Covid-19 problems of today.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe O'Brien<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T15:55:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_424">I will leave time for the Minister to answer my questions. The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted travel patterns across the world in a profound way. In a variety of ways, transport will never be the same again. The 2 km and 5 km restrictions coupled with economic shutdown and the requirement to socially distance have pushed us to walk and cycle more. We need to do all we can to retain as much as possible of the resultant mental and physical health benefits of this increased activity, the cleaner air and the lower greenhouse gas emissions. We also need to do what we can to ensure people do not return to traffic gridlock and see more of their precious time slip away while waiting in a car.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> It is crucial that we do all we can to ease the pressure on our public transport services, where social distancing will be required for some time to come. I disagree with the Minister's statement that capacity is significantly ahead of demand on public transport. I am unsure of his sources for that inaccurate claim. I have received reports of buses on which social distancing is required passing people waiting at bus stops because more passengers could not be safely accommodated.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> I am asking the Minister to take quick, cheap and easy measures to encourage and support walking and cycling.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">It is not just because these are good things to do but because we have to do them if we are to beat Covid-19. It is indeed a strange situation for me to recommend that the Minister follows measures adopted by the UK in response to the pandemic. On Saturday last, the UK Secretary of State for Transport issued detailed guidance to local authorities on what they could and should do in reallocating road space for pedestrians and cyclists. He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_428">Active travel is affordable, delivers significant health benefits, has been shown to improve wellbeing, mitigates congestion, improves air quality and has no carbon emissions at the point of use. Towns and cities based around active travel will have happier and healthier citizens as well as [long] lasting local economic benefits. The UK Government, therefore, expects local authorities to make significant change to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I note and welcome the measures the Minister has cited that the NTA is taking. They are limited measures and every local authority should be asked directly by the Minister to reallocate road space for walkers and cyclists. They should also be asked to assess spaces around the entrances to schools and, indeed, the routes to schools. Where possible, space should be reallocated so that, come September, when we hope our children will return to school, that will be a safer and healthier place and better facilitate social distancing, walking and cycling. Bus stops in the areas immediate to businesses also need to be considered, as we will soon be increasingly familiar with queues outside every business and service. This could be especially useful for cafés and restaurants and indeed the tourism sector. </p>
          <p eId="para_430"> The Minister also mentioned the issue of increased road deaths. Will he consider using his own power to reduce speed limits by ministerial order, and I support the Love 30 campaign to do so, particularly in the current context? </p>
          <p eId="para_431"> I have four questions. Will the Minister consider issuing guidance to local authorities regarding the use of the large budget allocation the Department provides for roads, as per the UK Department of Transport, which urged local authorities to reallocate road space, to better protect walkers and cyclists and embed altered behaviours and the positive effects of active travel? Second, Will the Department drive a clear, comprehensive national communications campaign on the health and safety measures the public needs to follow on public transport, including the use of face masks? I understand there will be some guidance soon but things are going to get busy on Monday and increasingly so on 8 June in particular. I fear that we are playing catch-up. There is an urgent and pressing need for a strong, clear message from Government on how people on public transport should behave, especially in respect of the use of face masks. The providers are doing their best but they need to be backed up with a clear message from Government on actions that public transport users can follow and expect of others. It is also crucial that providers are funded to provide the additional capacity. I am getting reports of buses that are not in a position to carry the required passengers in a safe way. Third, can the Minister provide written assurances to the large public transport companies such as Irish Rail, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus that the financial losses they are incurring at the moment will be covered? I understand verbal assurances are being given but for good corporate governance those assurances need to be in writing.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> Finally, I refer to rural bus services and the great work they have been doing, particularly over the past few months. Local Link services all over the country have been responsive and adaptable in moving with the changing transport needs of recent times. They can do this because they are embedded in the communities they serve. The Local Link service in counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim has adapted not just to transporting essential workers but also Covid-19 test packs and essential equipment and animal feed for farmers. This co-use of public transport is something that happens in a large scale organised way in other EU countries and is another lesson from our pandemic response that we need to build on. It is, again, greener and more efficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> My colleagues and I have mentioned the rural bus services, especially the Clare Bus Company, also known as Clare accessible transport. After 18 years operating rural transport programme services in Clare with 100% accessibility, universal design and cost-effective services, supported by €1 million worth of community fundraising, the organisation is now in jeopardy. It is being replaced by operators that do not have the community connection, are more expensive and do not have the crucial accessible buses.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I understand the Minister met representatives from Clare Bus last year. It won the tender to continue providing the service in the county but in March, as the Covid-19 crisis was taking off the NTA refused to sign the new contract with Clare Bus. Will he intervene to ensure this vital high-value, high-performing service is maintained?</p>

          <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Shane Ross)<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T16:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_435">I thank the Deputy for giving me some time to answer the questions, it is the first time that this has happened. Across Dublin, public authorities are taking the opportunity to rethink how their urban centres are set out and how they allocate limited space to the different demands. Similarly, at a national level, we must rethink how we allocate road space and ensure we place the pedestrian and cyclist in the centre of our thinking. The reallocation of space will support the Government's overall roadmap to reopening society and business. It will provide additional commuting capacity to those who still need to physically get into their workplace as well as improving social distancing generally in our urban centres and supporting the gradual reopening of retail. My Department is funding the NTA to work with local authorities in developing Covid-19 mobility frameworks that will set out specific plans to deliver things like widening footpaths, temporary protected cycle facilities, including new contraflow routes, revised bus routing and bus priority measures and enhanced pedestrian priority zones. The first of these frameworks is being developed with Dublin City Council. It is intended that similar plans will be implemented in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and works identified will be funded through my Department's sustainable mobility investment programme. I understand the initial draft of the Dublin city plan will be available in the coming days and it will set out the measures that will be put in place in the coming weeks and months to facilitate the reopening of society and business generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> On road safety, the Deputy is absolutely right about speeding; I am with him entirely on this. There was a Bill, which we are handing over to the next Government, on graduated penalties for speeding. It was approved by the Cabinet in November and is with the Attorney General. It is ready to go and waiting for the Deputy to take on board or the next Minister for transport. The Bill also addresses speed limits throughout the country. We hope for a report on speed limits so we get some uniformity and common sense on them. </p>
          <p eId="para_437"> I will return to the matter of a national communications campaign. I will not get through all the questions but Clare Bus was one the Deputy was particularly keen that I answer. It is a procurement issue which is a matter for the NTA, which manages Local Link. The NTA has advised that the direct award arrangements with Clare Bus for the provision of bus services expired on 1 July 2019 and that negotiations with Clare Bus on a new direct award contract were ongoing between July 2019 and October 2019 while maintaining bus services. The NTA considered that the price proposals submitted by Clare Bus did not represent the best possible value compared with other direct award contracts for similar routes and took the decision to undertake a competitive tendering process to secure the delivery of the relevant bus services. Arising from the tender process, Clare Bus emerged as the preferred bidder with the signing of contracts due to take place in January 2020. The series of correspondence issued from the NTA to Clare Bus between January and March 2020 in an effort to enter into a contractual relationship with the company. Clare Bus did not sign contracts by the deadline set by the NTA. The NTA considered that in the interest of customers across the county, it was left with no option but to put alternative measures in place. As of Monday, 23 March 2020, two local transport operators have been contracted by the NTA to deliver Local Link services in County Clare. </p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T16:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_438">I welcome the Minister. This unprecedented pandemic has stood much of our thinking on transport on its head. Three months ago, a single occupied vehicle in this city would have been frowned upon and, in fact, actively discouraged. Our investment in transport was to be concentrated on mass transport systems, transporting as many people as possible, as closely and densely packed as possible. How permanent this new attitude will be remains to be seen, but I do not think, and the Minister has said so himself, that things will not revert to pre-Covid 19 norms in their totality.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Fewer people will travel, more people will work from home and residual fears of close contact will probably exist for some considerable time to come, so our transport investment must be rethought but it also must be multifaceted. We should not have a knee-jerk reaction and think that all our mass transport systems can be simply scrapped, as some have suggested. We need to invest in walking, as others have said, in cycling, electric vehicles - again, bus, trains and trams. We need to invest in all of those areas but, right now, we need to address the task of moving our people back to work, our students back to school and our goods to and from our markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> I want to pose four groups of questions and the Minister might respond quickly to each of them. The first is on our plan for getting people back to work and I have listened to him again on that. I have talked to operators and they do not know if there will be a significant return to work starting next week or how we will have that with the stock, the crews and capacities we have and applying social distancing.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> The Minister spoke about masks. Who will bear the cost? I refer to a Wexford company, Wexford Bus. Very few passengers can be allowed now on its systems. It is losing money on each route it is now operating. In terms of my first question, in concrete and real terms, will the Minister underwrite the loss currently for private operators providing essential transport systems getting people back to work? How much, in real terms, will he provide for the CIÉ companies? He mentioned providing money in his contribution. How much will he provide and when will he give real written guarantees to them? The Minister might take a minute to answer that first question.</p>

We are in the dark here but we can say that for next week, which is what the Deputy referred to, and phase 1, we are confident. I have talked to the NTA, and who better to talk to than the NTA about this? I have talked to the bus companies about this also. Despite the obstacles and the difficulties of social distancing and everything else, we will be able to provide the necessary buses and other public transport. That will be looked at. As the Deputy rightly said, we do not know the number of people who will stay at home. We do not know exactly the number of people who will move to their private cars because they are frightened of going on buses. That will be a moving target which we will have to follow. That is why it is being done in phases.</p>

          <p eId="para_451">He might skip the preamble when responding to my next question. I refer to the plan for getting students to school. A number of parents and community groups have contacted me about rural transport, including the operators of school transport. The Department of Education and Skills will provide 50% of contract costs to the private operators from 29 March. In terms of ensuring that schools can reopen in September, will there be a comprehensive school transport system because within weeks, the normal allocation of tickets would be given? Has the Minister or the Department of Education and Skills had any discussions with the rural transport systems to ensure that there will be, operating the rules of social distancing, a rural school transport system in operation in time for our schools to resume in September?</p>

          <p eId="para_452">I have not had those discussions. That would be something the NTA would have and not me. It would be its duty to do that, and it will certainly do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The whole point of the 50% is to keep the show on the road in order that they are up and ready to go at that time. Those who have the contracts will be getting 50%, and the condition attached to that is that they would be ready to go and that the transport system would work when it is necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_454">The problem is that capacity will be vastly diminished if there is social distancing in the rural transport system. Who is going to provide the extra vehicles? Who is going to cover the cost of running larger vehicles with reduced capacity? That is going to be much more expensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> My third question relates to getting goods and services to market. Will there be a quarantine on people coming into our ports once we open? Has the Minister discussed that with Cabinet colleagues? Many countries are going to operate a quarantine. Is there any thought of that and where will it happen? For example, will there be provision for accommodation in places like Rosslare Europort? Do we have the capacity for getting goods moved? Who is going to check the people driving the goods arriving in our ports? Is that going to happen? Will they be isolated if they have temperature issues? Will health and safety checks be done on the goods arriving in our ports? The maintenance of standards is very important. Some of the trade unions involved are already telling me that they are fearful that some of the maritime companies will use Covid as an excuse to undo the hard-won terms and conditions of workers. Will the Minister keep an eye to ensure that does not happen?</p>

          <p eId="para_456">It would be absolutely reprehensible if that were to be used as a cover. I give the Deputy a guarantee that I will keep an eye on that because anybody who exploits this situation for commercial or other advantage should be tackled immediately. That is not something that could be tolerated. As long as I am Minister - I do not know how long that will be - I will keep an eye on that, because it is unthinkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> On the issue of quarantine for people coming in, as the Deputy knows, at the moment we recommend self-isolation for everybody coming in and that is continuing. The Deputy should not ask me about issues like this as though I am some sort of an expert. He knows that measures are taken based on recommendations from the Department of Health, and those recommendations will be adhered to. If we are talking about isolation, quarantines or anything of that sort, while we have had difficulties so far, we have behaved correctly in terms of quarantines, and we will continue to take the advice of Dr. Holohan and others. That is not something on which I could make a statement today.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Regarding people coming in, the Deputy will know that hauliers are in the category of people who do not have to go into quarantine. That is for a good reason because they are doing a job for the nation, which would not work if they had to go into quarantine every time.</p>

          <p eId="para_463">I will cover a number of points and leave some time at the end for a response. Public transport has largely continued to function from the time of the lockdown and has largely been empty, though not exclusively. It is not easy to judge what it will be like once we start opening things up.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">This roadmap and its five phases will hopefully commence next week and there are very good signs that this will be the case. Essentially, it presents problems. Just as one can have general guidance, there are areas where a bespoke solution is required and public transport is one of them from the perspective of the commuter and drivers. Will there be highly specific proposals and is the Minister liaising with the various stakeholders, including the unions, in this regard? Are commuters being consulted? There will be a restoration of full bus and rail schedules. If this is not done properly, buses and trains could become incubators. I take the Minister's point about the guidance that will come from NPHET regarding face coverings so I am not asking him to deal with that. Will there be consideration of congestion, for example? What arrangements will be in place for spaces like buses, where drivers are present for a greater period of time than commuters, were a driver to become ill? Is there a public communications strategy regarding what the National Transport Authority is doing with regard to managing this system, because it is difficult to get one's head around it? Let us hope it works well because if phase one does not work well, phase two will not work because one is dependent on the other. The first phase will be really important. Obviously, there has been significant loss of income for public and private transport providers. Has there been an assessment of the requirements to the end of the year? If so, could the Minister outline what that is and the plan to deal with it? </p>
          <p eId="para_465"> It is very obvious to all of us that people are cycling and walking more. This will be necessary to ensure we conserve space on public transport to allow for social distancing when people go back to work. Has the amount of money that is available to local authorities been enhanced for cycling and if so, could the Minister tell us what it is? On the reallocation of road space, has guidance been given to local authorities in this regard? There are many issues involving obvious things, such as reallocating road space, but there are areas where small pieces of a network that could be brought into play very quickly are missing. I am talking about the Royal Canal and Grand Canal from Kildare to Dublin. In some places, there are relatively small pieces that are missing. Can this be fast-forwarded? </p>
          <p eId="para_466"> Obviously there is a problem with the airlines. We want to keep our ports and airports open but it must be done safely. The idea that it involves guidance and people not having to adhere is highly problematic for those who are adhering to social distancing and possibly limiting their movement. I do not believe arrangements pertaining to airports can be voluntary. To a certain degree, they must be mandatory because if we are going to contain this, we must do so with some degree of certainty and it is not obvious that this will happen or that there will be co-operation in that regard. Can the Minister deal with this point? Will it be the Department of Justice and Equality or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that will deal with it? Can the Minister briefly deal with the issue of refunds and airlines? Is he in favour of the voucher system being used on a temporary basis? What is the guidance on that? I ask the Minister to try to give a succinct response to as many of those points as he can.</p>

          <p eId="para_469">It is a problem that was addressed today by the European Commission, as the Deputy probably realises. The Commission has said that it is imperative that people who are entitled to a cash refund get one. That is not negotiable. Ryanair and other airlines are offering vouchers but that must be done on a voluntary basis. In other words, there is no way that the European Commission will allow airlines to force vouchers on people instead of cash. Those customers have an absolute right to cash.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> There is also a problem with travel agents. Many people whose tickets have been cancelled are looking for cash refunds but have been offered vouchers. That is a system I have favoured. I do not favour a compulsion on customers accepting vouchers but I favour it on a voluntary basis. We favour allowing travel agents to offer vouchers to customers whose holidays have been cancelled. The customer can refuse. Customers will be guaranteed the cash, one way or the other, but the travel agents will be allowed to make the offer of vouchers. The reason is that travel agents are suffering badly. There is a real danger that travel agents will go bust and, if we allow that to happen, there will be no choice for consumers. The affected consumers will get their money, whatever happens, and that is guaranteed by the Government. I hope that answers the Deputy's question, albeit in a slightly roundabout way.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> On the locator forms, I do not know the answer because it is being looked at at the moment. I think there are multiple reasons these forms are not being sent in. That is what I think is happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">The plan is not out yet, but it is coming. A public transport plan will come out shortly. It is not out yet, as I said in my initial speech, but it will be coming out shortly. At the moment, phase one is all-important and we are confident about all the phases. Let us not say that everything is written in stone forever because, as I said in reply to another Deputy, this thing is moving fast and in many different directions. I am confident that, on Monday mornings for the next three weeks and thereafter, the National Transport Authority, NTA, will manage things properly. We have spelled out what will happen in phase one and I am confident that it will. Public transport will run efficiently and effectively while adhering to social distancing guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> The Deputy knows that the programme for public transport was reduced to a Saturday-plus service some weeks ago. It is open for that to be changed back so there is flexibility there, which is important. If there is a high amount of demand for public services, we can change back to the old timetables.</p>

All I can say is that I have had absolutely no negative reaction from any stakeholders saying they are not being engaged with. It is quite obvious that the unions are being engaged with because I have already paid tribute to the fact that they have been highly co-operative in what they have been doing. They have been making sacrifices and pulling in the same direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> I have not engaged personally with Dermot O'Leary, if that is what the Deputy is asking, but I would be perfectly happy to do so if he wants.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">I will be sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy, with five minutes each.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> Bus Éireann is flouting the Government's protocols for the return to work, published on 9 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">They require that if bus workers cannot social distance on Bus Éireann buses, there should be screens. There are no screens, however and bus workers are very concerned about the return to work that will see passenger numbers on the Bus Éireann fleet rise on Monday. Frankly, I think they would be right to walk off the job. There are no screens on 90% of the fleet and staff are having to handle cash without anywhere to put it. They are putting it in their pockets. The company will not allow passengers to get on buses through the middle doors where they would be away from the drivers. That is not acceptable and it flies in the face of the commitments the Minister gave just a moment ago. The social distancing protocols and the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol from 9 May need to be implemented immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> Second, taxi drivers, who are also front-line essential transport workers, are facing the absolute devastation of their livelihoods, not just in the short term, as many tens of thousands are at the moment, but in the medium to long term. For the foreseeable future, tourism into this country is a dead duck. Mass gatherings, the live entertainment industry and large sports gatherings, upon which taxi drivers depend to make their livelihoods viable, are not coming back in the foreseeable future. Therefore, there needs to be a package of financial supports for taxi drivers, who have insurance, car loans and mortgages to pay. They need certainty about income supports as long as their industry remains devastated. They need the NTA to provide and pay for partitioned screens in taxis so that drivers are safe, and sanitisers and other cleansing and disinfecting equipment must be made available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> I have two further brief points to make. A lot of people have, for obvious reasons, turned to cycling during this pandemic. That is good for public health and the environment, but we need to significantly expand the bike to work scheme, get rid of the five-year requirement to purchase a new bicycle and extend the scheme to people on social welfare and pensioners. If the Minister wanted to take the opportunity to be really radical in this area, he would give people free bicycles. That would be a radical and progressive move.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> My final point relates to the tax saving scheme which allows workers to pay for their monthly or annual travel pass. They are paying for it out of their salaries and wages but are not able to make use of it at the moment. They should be given a break by offering them a refund of the money paid for their travel pass, or by enabling them to opt out and then opt back into the scheme so that they are not paying when they cannot use it.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> I know the Minister will not be able to respond to all my points but I am making a particular shout-out for the bus workers. Another issue in this regard is that the cleansing and disinfecting teams who are supposed to be cleaning the buses are not working properly and are not cleansing and disinfecting the vehicles or many of the bus depots.</p>

          <p eId="para_485">I thank the Deputy for the points he raised. Bus Éireann continues to explore options for protective screens in the driver's cab area in those vehicles that do not already have them. The company has begun trialling portable screens on coaches. According to guidance provided by the health authorities, the risk of contracting Covid-19 from handling cash is negligible, but this measure was introduced to provide further protection to bus drivers by reducing their level of interaction with members of the public. The measure is in line with steps taken in other jurisdictions, including London, Barcelona, Denmark, Australia and New Zealand. The company is tackling the problem and the Deputy is absolutely right that it is something it should do.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> He is right that taxi drivers are in a really bad situation, with some 97% of them no longer operating. They have contracts which are null and void in effect because they are not working.</p>

          <p eId="para_489">I want to focus on the question of airline vouchers, which was mentioned previously. Tens of thousands of people are legally entitled to a cash refund within seven days for flights that have been cancelled. They are being obstructed by airlines, including Ryanair, which are trying everything to avoid people availing of their legal rights. Even the vouchers that are being offered to them are less than their legal rights in terms of vouchers. They have an expiry date of one year when people are entitled to at least a five-year expiry date. People are entitled to cash refunds.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> The Minister said that if people are entitled to cash they should get cash. Is it not the case that the Minister, along with a series of other member states, co-signed a statement calling for that right to be rescinded? The joint statement on airline vouchers calls for that right to be rescinded, for airlines to be able to give vouchers, and for people not to be able to avail of their legal right to cash refunds. In other words, the Minister took the side of the airlines against the customers, effectively enforcing the idea of a bailout for airlines being forced on consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> I asked the Taoiseach about this a couple of weeks ago. He said he knew nothing about it and the Government had made no decision. As I understand it, this statement emerged from a meeting of transport ministers which the Minister attended. Will the Minister explain whether that was his position at the time and if it is no longer his position?</p>

          <p eId="para_492">I am delighted to answer that question. On the issue of airline vouchers, I am not an apologist for Ryanair, so the Deputy should not ask me to answer for its behaviour. It is not up to me to do that; it is an independent company. The Deputy is correct in saying, however, and I heard the chief executive of Ryanair speaking on the radio yesterday, that Ryanair is offering vouchers. The airline has suggested that because so many millions of people are looking for cash, it cannot administer the claims in time. I understand the figures involved are extraordinary - approximately 20 million people - and because it does not have the administration to deal with that, it was offering vouchers as a quick way out. It will produce the cash in the end. I do not know. I am not a spokesperson for it. That is what the chief executive said. Anybody who has a complaint about the behaviour of Ryanair or who is not getting the cash to which they are entitled should note that the European Commission issued a statement today. It is turning its back on the letter that was sent, to which the Deputy referred, and which is a rejection of that letter, in effect. It has stated that cash must be paid. That is a definitive response to the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> There is a procedure in place for consumers who wish to make a complaint. The Deputy will be aware of that, and it does not involve coming to the House. Rather, people should contact the Commission for Aviation Regulation and advise it that they are entitled to this cash and they want it now. It is not for me to administer the procedure.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">What the Minister is clearly responsible for is the joint statement with other European states. That is the simple question I am asking. Is it the case that the statement, which called for consumer rights to be suspended in favour of the airlines, emerged from a meeting and that the Minister signed up to it? The Taoiseach said to me in the House that the Government had made no decision about that. Was it a solo run by the Minister or was it agreed by the Government?

          <from>Deputy Verona Murphy<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_496">I concur with several issues raised by Deputy Howlin. I do not wish to repeat them, but I have sent correspondence to the Department and I would be happy if the Minister replies in writing.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> I will now talk about Government formation talks taking place between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party. The incoming Government will face major challenges as a result of Covid-19 and its consequences. Whatever sensible short-term funding is needed to address resulting issues should be provided. Post Covid-19, the Government will also have to deal with Brexit, housing and carbon emissions. The role of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is central to creating viable long-term solutions to all these issues. The Department that will provide the infrastructure to facilitate the long-term development of our economy. In my previous role as president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, I observed regularly the consequences of the second-line effects of Government policy. All too often, Ministers pursue policies for perfectly legitimate objectives, sometimes inadvertently and sometimes without any regard to the disastrous consequences of those primary policies. </p>
          <p eId="para_498"> We have had experience of this in recent years, such as with the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, collapsing the housing and building industry, an increase in heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, on the roads due to a reduction in load-carrying capacity and high-density guidelines to justify viable rail lines. All too often, Ministers are not in command of their portfolios and weak Ministers lead to bad Government. An idealistic Secretary General or official can become the master of his or her Minister and shape policy to meet his or her agenda. In formulating policy, Governments need to be conscious of their objectives and effects. Accurate data are essential to make informed decisions. </p>
          <p eId="para_499"> Transport faces three major challenges: providing an efficient infrastructure to deal with Brexit; providing a green rail network to accommodate meaningful reductions in carbon emissions and to facilitate efficient housing; and the moving of major infrastructure, such as Dublin Port, to meet all these challenges. While there is much talk and confusion coming from politicians regarding how to achieve targets set for a green agenda, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Transport is one area where change can be achieved faster and with lasting positive green results. </p>
          <p eId="para_500"> Now is the time to take a serious look at the nitrogen oxide, NOx, emissions polluting the air in Dublin and face the fact that Dublin Port, and all it entails, is the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in this urban setting. Nitrogen oxide is linked strongly with traffic emissions and high levels affect our lung health. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has found that two areas in Dublin have reached or exceed the EU limit on NOx emissions. Those are the M50 and the entrance to, and exit from, the Dublin Port Tunnel, areas that experience significant traffic congestion. We must remove traffic congestion from our capital city if we are serious about carbon emissions. This can be done by moving Dublin Port out of the city environs. All over the world, governments are initiating greener urban environments and all over Europe docklands are now home to parks, pleasure marinas and thousands of tourists, as well as architecturally exciting residential developments and offices. Cities such as Copenhagen, Oslo and Barcelona have created new areas with low-rent artistic spaces, clubs, bars and cafes. Dublin Port is the greatest waste of prime land imaginable. The main port on the north side of the river comprises 510 acres, while the port on the south side of the river, although much smaller, still constitutes 130 acres of prime development land with waterfront aspects within about a mile of the city centre. </p>
          <p eId="para_501"> One wonders why on earth such a green policy has not been mentioned in Government talks. There has been no mention by any political representative, not even from the Green Party, of following such European and world trends. Such a proposal can, however, deliver cleaner air and provide much needed land for an overcrowded and growing city. The relocation of the port is a golden opportunity to ensure a permanent reduction in NOx emissions and to create a modern, high-density area within the city. The port lands offer an opportunity for the Land Development Agency, LDA, to deliver housing at scale. By 2040, Dublin Port will have reached full capacity. In three years, we will begin to build new and additional port facilities elsewhere on the east coast, informed by our masterplan for 2040 and the national planning framework 2040. </p>
          <p eId="para_502">The moving of Dublin Port can be carried out with relative ease. Rosslare Europort is currently only at 40% capacity and is Ireland's most strategically placed port for roll-on, roll-off traffic while 60% of Dublin Port's traffic is roll-on, roll-off. Rosslare Europort has the potential and should be developed as a tier 1 port. It should endure little or no combustion congestion, and thereby NOx emissions are not an issue in the same realm as at Dublin Port. Rosslare Europort has the only other border inspection post after Dublin and, because of Brexit, has seen significant investments in facilities for regulatory inspections. It is a natural fit for Dublin Port's traffic. The one vital element that has been agreed for Rosslare Europort but not yet started is a separate port access road, and works should begin without further delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> The high dependency being placed on Dublin Port is not sustainable, particularly because of the growth limitations. Further growth of Dublin Port will exacerbate the greenhouse gas emission level which, we all agree, must be reduced. The money that can be raised by selling the land contained in Dublin Port and the surrounding docklands can be used to upgrade Rosslare Europort and any movement of the lift-on, lift-off operations. A big bonus would be the vast reduction in NOx emissions having alleviated the congestion. If we are to take the greening of transport in Ireland seriously, we must take a good look at how we develop policy in relation to it. The truth is that Dublin-based politicians do not want this commercial activity moved out of the city. They are prepared to suffer and inflict the most dangerous emissions on their populations to keep their beloved port. I will watch with interest the position of the Green Party on NOx emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> We need to fund rail lines, not ghettos. Transport-oriented development, TOD, is a form of urban development that seeks to maximise the provisions of housing, employment, public services and leisure space near frequent high-quality train services. It is a form of development that is friendlier to public transport users, cyclists and pedestrians and it seeks to convert car trips to public and active transport trips. This, in turn, improves mobility and environmental conditions and delivers more efficient and sustainable urban development. Dublin Port and the docklands is exactly what one would imagine a strategy like TOD would look like, but transport-oriented development is a model that does not work practically for the regions. It is a cost-recovery model and for it to work, houses must be built to the density within the national framework to ensure passenger capacity for the rail service. However, the builders will not build at this density because they cannot sell the houses unless the rail infrastructure is there. If the housing is not built, Irish Rail will not provide a service unless it is viable, and unless subvention is continued, there is no hope. To say it is putting the cart before the horse is an understatement. The future of solving the housing problem is the greening of transport and providing high-speed electric trains with continued subvention on the basis that one must speculate to accumulate to assure people that they can get to work and to ensure they are not car-dependent. If we do not have strong leadership in transport, including a Minister who can join the dots beating the drum to the Department of Finance to safeguard the funding and who will ensure the greening of transport actually happens, we will be building the ghettos of the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> Intrinsically linked to replacing dependence on car commutes is a high-speed train with capacity and a frequent timetable. People will use cars only at the weekend, thereby being far more likely to purchase an electric green alternative. Such a rail network is required in all regions. The EU provides significant funding for such projects, thereby enabling a future Government to provide subvention until the population drives the requirement independently. Our roads will be less congested, with usage primarily for heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, and essential journeys only. The development and building of houses will evolve if such infrastructures are in place. However, the densities of such developments should be left to the local authorities, which are best placed to ensure requirements in their areas are met, rather than urbanised plans being forced on them with no regard for the social issues that will ensue. Ballymun is an example of this. If we provide a high-speed rail network to ensure the greening of transport, we will ensure the targets set down in the current climate action plan have the potential to be achieved. Without this turnaround we will still be paying fines in the hundreds of millions for missed targets long into the future.</p>

        <speech by="#DannyHealyRae" eId="spk_194">
          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_506">I am glad to get the opportunity to raise several issues with the Minister today. I will start with the problem of the youngest person who approached me. I refer to youngsters above the age of 16 who could legitimately get a provisional driver licence. We are told they will be able to apply for these licences online on 20 May. That is great, but they need to have personal services cards to do so and there is nowhere currently open where they can get these cards. Can that matter be addressed? </p>
          <p eId="para_507"> I refer also to provisional licence holders who have done their theory test, have everything in order and have been waiting for months to do the test. Can anything be done to speed up the driver test for these youngsters who have been waiting so long? They need their cars to go to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> Taxis and how they can be supported has not been mentioned during this pandemic. Can the Minister and the Government do something about taxis? These operators provide a wonderful service and they jump through a lot of hoops to do so. They are in serious trouble and some of them may not start up again when the lockdown is over. </p>
          <p eId="para_509"> Hotels, pubs and guest houses around our county are in an awful state. They are supposed to open on certain dates, but many are afraid to so because there is no certainty around business or when tourists will be allowed to visit our country again. </p>
          <p eId="para_510"> This brings me to the testing of lorries, buses, vans and jeeps. No testing is going on at present. We are told that operators' certificates will cover them until some time in October. Will the Minister ensure an extra grace period when testing resumes? They will not all be tested in one day or in one week. We were under pressure to keep vehicles tested as it was. There is one anomaly that will certainly have to be addressed. We were looking for a solution to this before the lockdown. If a vehicle has been off the road for three or four months and it is tested, a 12-month certificate will not be issued. Only a six-month certificate is issued. On behalf of the haulage industry and bus operators, I ask the Minister to ensure that when vehicle testing resumes, 12-month certificates can be issued, for the first time at least. That is vital. Otherwise the system will be clogged again. This has been bad enough for long enough, and now testing is not proceeding at all. When the lockdown is over and the country starts moving again, I appeal to the Minister not to stop operators again by only issuing six-month certificates. I refer also to elderly people who have been cocooning in their homes for the past two months with their cars parked in their yards. Is there any possibility of refunding motor tax?</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> As I have said to previous Ministers, seasonal workers were not provided for in the pandemic supports that were given to many people. The same is true for people above the age of 66 who were employing people, because they were over 66 and possibly receiving a pension. Will the Minister bring them up to equivalence with the €350 payment others are getting?</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The Killarney bypass has been proposed for the last 16 or 17 years. I ask the Minister to give funding again this year for the preparatory work that is needed to get it going.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelHealyRae" eId="spk_195">
          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T16:55:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_513">I appreciate that the Minister is here today and if he does not get time to answer my questions, I would be grateful for a written reply. I remind the Minister of the people who were trapped abroad when the close-down came and found themselves calling Aer Lingus call centres, which happened to be in India. I have nothing against the good people in India, but I have examples here of the phone only being answered after two hours. Could the Minister imagine being on holiday, ringing a call centre and waiting for two hours and 55 minutes, three hours and ten minutes or two hours and 15 minutes to talk to somebody in a call centre in India instead of Fexco in Cahersiveen where the call centre was previously? When these people answer the phone, the first thing they say is that they cannot hear or understand the caller, and then they put down the phone. That happened to our people when they were abroad and trying to deal with Aer Lingus. I am calling out Aer Lingus because what it did to people was a scandal. It was horrible to do that to people who were on their holidays and trying to get home. I ask the Minister to highlight that and do something with Aer Lingus and its bloody call centre. I have nothing against India but this was wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> When will young people who have learner permits be allowed to sit their driving tests? When will the tests start again? Many of these people are front-line workers and need their vehicles to carry out their duties. When will NCT and commercial vehicle roadworthiness test, CVRT, centres reopen? Many people, specifically owners of commercial vehicles, cannot tax their vehicles without having a test.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> As the Minister knows, County Kerry is the tourism capital of the world. Kerry County Council, which is the best local authority in the country, stated at a recent briefing of its elected members that tourism in County Kerry is worth more than €600 million. Due to Covid-19, initial projected losses are now close to €500 million. The hospitality sector in Kerry especially and throughout Ireland has been decimated. This sector needs a number of measures implemented to help it, namely, business interruption grants to help businesses to reopen and interest-free capital grants that are repayable over time. Businesses cannot afford to take out any more loans. They need grants. Local authority rates and water charges need to be waived for the duration of the business interruption and initial recovery period due to Covid-19 and not just for three months as announced previously. The hospitality VAT rates and employer PRSI contributions need to be reduced to nothing until the industry has recovered.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> I commend the Taoiseach suggesting the idea of a 0% VAT rate in this House last week. The VAT rate should never have been raised in the first instance. I need the Minister to ensure that it is lowered to help save what is left of the industry. Insurance grants to cover business, public liability and property insurance are needed for the duration of the crisis. The Government needs to require the insurance industry to be more flexible with charges for businesses that are closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> Many seasonal workers in the hospitality trade, along with people over 66 who may be running bed and breakfast accommodation or pubs, for example, have been barred from the pandemic unemployment payment simply because the majority would not have been back in work or open until the St. Patrick's Day weekend or 1 April. What can the Minister do to try to correct these wrongs? Will his Department actively engage with local authorities to support a new strategy for domestic tourism when it is safe to do so?</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> Can the Minister commit that the sports capital programme will go ahead as usual at the end of this year? Will the Minister make a statement on the Macroom to Ballingeary bypass, which is very important for people coming from County Cork into County Kerry and <i>vice versa</i>? It is to begin and everything is in line but I want to ensure that the Minister will guarantee to the House that no financial constraints will stop that major project from going ahead.</p>

        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport" eId="spk_196">
          <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport ( Shane Ross)<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T16:55:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_519">I have just enough time to say that I will make sure that we communicate with the Deputies in writing about all those issues. I counted 23 and I do not think I can deal with them all now. With regard to driving tests, since both Deputies asked, it would be reasonable to speculate that they will happen fairly late in the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">That would be very difficult to introduce under social distancing because the distance between people when they are in a car together is so close and anything that comes into that category would make it hard. Similarly with NCT tests, it would be difficult to conduct them because of the health requirements but we will be guided once again by NPHET on that. The Deputy should not hold out too much hope about driving tests resuming early because that is a situation where the closeness of people to each other is threatening. Given the lack of time, I will arrange for the Deputies to get written replies.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_197">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_521">I have two questions for the Minister. At the beginning of his contribution, he referred to the fact that there have been 54 deaths on the roads so far this year. That is shocking when one considers the reduction in traffic on the roads. That should be said an awful lot more.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> The Minister also stated that tests for drink-driving and drug-driving have increased significantly and the number of people being caught has also increased significantly. Is it the case that there is more enforcement following the increase in checkpoints rather than more drink-driving taking place? I am very interested in hearing his views on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> The other question I wish to ask him about is rural transport and the companies providing it. As he will be aware, the NTA has maintained the funding for rural transport companies at 100%. That is very welcome and it is very encouraging of the authority to do that. As we move into the new phases, given the social distancing requirements, the existing rural transport buses will only have a significantly reduced capacity of 23%. Do the Minister's plans include increasing capacity on them?</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> The Minister referred to masks and hand washing on flights and on buses. Will that also apply to rural transport? Will funding be provided so that rural transport companies can provide masks and hand sanitisers for people travelling on their buses?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport ( Shane Ross)<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_525">I agree with the Deputy regarding deaths on the roads. It is disappointing. I am not sure whether I am going to answer his question because I agree with everything he said, so it is a bit difficult to respond. It is disappointing that in circumstances where there is so little traffic on the roads the road deaths have gone up. The explanations are difficult to understand. The statistics, sadly, show that a significant number of pedestrians have been killed. It is difficult to connect that with the fact that there are fewer cars on the roads. The evidence is that drink-driving is still going on, as is drug-driving. It may well be that more people are being caught and convicted because of there being more gardaí on the road. The RSA is looking into the matter and it is due to report to me shortly on why it thinks this is happening. It is almost inexplicable that deaths are going up given that traffic is down by approximately 70%. That is something we should find out about. The early indications are that a lot more people are out walking and a few more of them are, very sadly, getting killed, but that does not explain bad driver behaviour. I do not know at the moment, but we will get an answer to that shortly. We would expect the figures to be lower.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> The Deputy is correct that social distancing is going to be as challenging for rural transport as it is on buses in Dublin. The maximum number a single decker bus can take is 12 and 17 can travel on a double-decker bus. We are talking about a situation where there are challenges, but the determination is there in all cases to meet the capacity wherever that is possible. Transport providers are aware of the situation and they are making the necessary arrangements. It is a difficult question to answer because we do not know what exactly the demand will be in any area of public transport, including rural transport, in the coming weeks and months because we do not know how many people will be afraid of getting on a bus and will travel in their cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">We do not know how many people are going to be working from home. This is being monitored very closely. There is great confidence that the first phase will be all right. This will be monitored to see how it goes and adjustments may be made accordingly.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McNamara<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T17:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_528">Towards the end of the last Dáil, the Minister met with Clare Bus and the National Transport Authority about an ongoing dispute between them over moneys owed. Some 50 days ago, I wrote to him to outline the situation. The contract had been pulled at the last minute and Clare Bus effectively lost the tender that it had won. During those 50 days in which I have not received a reply from the Minister, those workers have effectively been laid off and somebody else has operated the route. In my letter I asked that a mediator be appointed between Clare Bus and the National Transport Authority. That has not happened yet. I ask the Minister to respond to the proposal of a mediator. If he does not accept that proposal, how does he propose to ensure justice is done for the staff of Clare Bus, particularly the drivers, who provide an excellent service right across rural County Clare and for the passengers who rely on its fleet which, unlike most others, is accessible?</p>

          <p eId="para_536">The Minister has not, to my knowledge, answered as to whether a mediator will be appointed, as I proposed to him in writing 50 days ago. Since then, other Deputies from Clare have also written to propose a mediator so this should not come as news. If it comes as news and if all of these letters and all of this correspondence has been lost, there really is a problem in the Minister's Department. I expect there is not. Will the Minister appoint a mediator between Clare Bus and the National Transport Authority with regard to moneys owed such that Clare Bus can take up a contract for a tender which it won?</p>

          <p eId="para_538">In that instance, I will ask a follow-up question. Does the Minister think it is acceptable for a company to essentially be blackballed by a State authority as a lockdown looms? In this Chamber, his colleagues criticised Debenhams for using lockdown as cover to treat workers very badly. The National Transport Authority, under the aegis of the Minister's Department, is effectively withdrawing the offer of a contract to a company to which money is owed - a fact which the National Transport Authority accepts - because that company does not have the cash flow to keep going. Those workers did not have the opportunity to protest here or anywhere else because of the lockdown. They were essentially silenced by the National Transport Authority. Is the Minister saying that he intends to do nothing whatsoever about this?</p>

          <p eId="para_539">I have answered the Deputy's question already. The contract has been awarded. The Deputy asked about the NTA. The NTA has advised that the direct award arrangements with Clare Bus for the provision of bus services expired on 1 July 2019. I am sure the Deputy is aware of this. It has further advised that negotiations with Clare Bus on a new direct award contract were ongoing between July 2019 and October 2019, while bus services were maintained.

          <p eId="para_560">I thank the Ceann Comhairle. I have asked my question for the day; I will not be asking any more.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> I express my deepest condolences to all who have lost loved ones in this horrific pandemic and wish a safe recovery to all those fighting the virus. I pay particular tribute to front-line workers throughout the sector, including gardaí and Garda staff, prison staff, courts officers and staff and immigration officers. In managing our response, my Department has a cross-functional team in place and is part of the series of cross-Government structures. In particular, we work closely with the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> The 14,700 members of An Garda Síochána, including 300 student gardaí who attested early in March, play a key role in protecting public health. They have been given exceptional new and temporary powers for that purpose and, therefore, we have taken care to ensure effective oversight and close attention to our tradition of policing by consent and adhering to human rights obligations. These temporary powers are necessary and provided for by law. They are explicitly in the interests of protection of public health and applied in a proportionate way as part of a carefully graduated response. This ensures gardaí engage, explain and encourage the public to comply. They only make use of these enforcement powers as a last resort. I requested the Garda Commissioner to compile and publish a record of the use of these powers, which he is doing on a weekly basis. I requested the Policing Authority to independently assess and report regularly on the use of the powers. I have made this information publicly available on my Department’s website. Beyond this critical role supporting public health restrictions, ordinary policing operations continue, with a particular focus on cybercrime.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> I acknowledge and thank gardaí for their tireless work in community engagement and outreach. This pandemic has reinforced the community role of our front-line gardaí. I am sure Deputies have seen countless examples in their community and local media of Garda members checking in on those cocooning and providing practical assistance on a 24-7 basis. The deep connection to the community has always been a defining feature of An Garda Síochána and never has this ethos been more acutely needed. I thank the Commissioner for his leadership and all gardaí for their dedication and commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> The women, men and children who perhaps feel most vulnerable and afraid at this time are victims of domestic abuse, those whose homes are, tragically, anything but safe in these uncertain times. </p>
          <p eId="para_565">We recognised at an early stage that being asked to stay at home must bring added risk and a real sense of fear for victims of domestic abuse, and we came together with key partners to devise a new plan. This has included the setting up by the Garda of a special Operation Faoiseamh on domestic abuse; and special measures by the Courts Service and Legal Aid Board to give priority to domestic abuse and childcare cases. While not directly within my remit, I understand Tusla has put a range of practical supports in place in respect of refuge accommodation. We have also launched a public awareness campaign which has delivered a hard-hitting campaign across TV, radio, social and traditional media. I strongly urge anyone suffering domestic abuse to reach out for help. The State and front-line services in the community are standing together to support you. More information on where to find support is available at a specially designed website, <i>www.stillhere.ie.</i></p>
          <p eId="para_566"> I wish to draw particular attention to the work being undertaken by the Irish Prison Service, IPS, which faces an exceptional challenge. A significant range of measures have been taken by the IPS to safeguard the well-being of prisoners. These measures have been guided by advice from NPHET and have also been consistent with prison-specific guidance issued by WHO and the Council of Europe. These measures include a reduction in prisoner numbers; cocooning vulnerable prisoners; a quarantining arrangement; isolation and testing of prisoners with symptoms; specially trained contact tracing teams; basic health checks on all entrants, including staff; and restrictions on access to prisons, including suspension for the moment of family visits. I want to say publicly how proud I am of the men and women of the Prison Service and pay tribute to the ongoing work of the director general, Caron McCaffrey, her senior management team and approximately 3,500 prison service staff, including the medical team. </p>
          <p eId="para_567"> Since the start of the crisis, the Judiciary and the Courts Service have shown considerable capacity to adapt and respond to ensure that the administration of justice continues in an effective and safe manner. Critical business has continued and new measures have been introduced, including video-link appearances from prisons for persons currently in custody; judgments issued online and some pilot remote court hearings. Last Friday, the Chief Justice, court president and Courts Service outlined the next steps being undertaken to extend court services in a gradual and responsible way, creating a pathway to opening some courts in line with the Government's roadmap. </p>
          <p eId="para_568"> Turning to the more than 7,700 people we provide accommodation and supports to under direct provision, I acknowledge the support provided to my Department by the HSE, in particular the National Social Inclusion Office and the NPHET subgroup on vulnerable persons. Working collaboratively has enabled us to quickly develop policy responses for the benefit of everybody here. I also acknowledge the leadership and dedicated role of the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, who is here to assist in responding. HSE advice has evolved over time and we have evolved our responses with it. We have been assured by both it and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach to these issues is appropriate. From the outset, we recognised the need for offsite self-isolation facilities for individuals and identified four suitable premises in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Dundalk with capacity for 299 people. These self-isolation facilities have non-profit, section 39 organisations onsite providing psychosocial supports to residents and residents are being supported by HSE healthcare professionals. Since the start of the year, more than 1,550 permanent and temporary new beds have been procured in new centres. More than 600 residents have relocated to support social and physical distancing and cocooning measures in centres. We have reduced the number of people sharing a room to a maximum of three and such shared spaces constitute households in line with HSE guidance on congregated settings. We moved quickly to cocoon all residents over the age of 65 and those advised as having a serious medical illness. More generally, residents have been made aware of the need to practice social and physical distancing and good hand hygiene and coughing and sneezing etiquette. Managers have been given detailed HSE guidance on the standard and frequency of cleaning required. Personal Protective Equipment, PPE, is distributed as required and in line with Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, guidelines on appropriate use in residential settings. </p>
          <p eId="para_569">In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, my Department has put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre management and staff. </p>
          <p eId="para_570"> I am very conscious of the concerns of Deputies in respect of services provided to international protection applicants and, indeed, I have my own concerns. However, as Minister, I have worked closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, to drive a programme of improvements across the State. At this time, approximately 20% of all residents are in own-door accommodation and more than half of residents have access to cooking facilities and that programme of upgrades was steadily rolling out when this pandemic hit and continues daily. The Minister of State and I were also anxious to take a longer term view and that it why we asked Dr. Catherine Day to convene an independent expert group to establish international best practice in the provision of services to international protection applicants and advise on long-term planning. That report is due later this year. </p>
          <p eId="para_571"> As the Chief Medical Officer has made clear many times, people should only travel where essential. The numbers arriving into Ireland are very small, the majority of whom are Irish citizens returning home. The border management unit at Dublin Airport together with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, are collecting the Irish public health passenger locator form and the system of spot checks is being rolled out on an administrative basis on behalf of health authorities, including follow-up phone calls where appropriate. The operation of this process is currently being analysed and reviewed by officials in the Department of Health, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, in the context of potential new regulations. There remains work to be done in developing these complex regulations and further consultations are required. </p>
          <p eId="para_572"> I can confirm today that the two-month automatic extension I announced in March for immigration permissions will be further extended for an additional two months, that is, immigration permissions due to expire between 20 May and 20 July will be extended subject to the same conditions being met. For students, this means they will be able to continue work if they so wish, but they must also re-enrol in a course of study. We can return to this matter in the course of the engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> Finally, myself and the Minister of State wish to sincerely thank our front-line healthcare workers, for all the work that has and which continues to be done. </p>

        <speech by="#JimOCallaghan" eId="spk_231">
          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_574">I will share time equally with Deputies Murnane O'Connor and Brendan Smith. I do not intend to ask the Minister questions and expect an answer, I would prefer if he would listen to the points I make. Much of the time, when questions are asked it is hard to get the answer. If answers are required they can be provided subsequently in writing.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> I also express my condolences to all the families of those who have died through this horrific pandemic. I also commend members of An Garda Síochána, the Prison Service and other civil servants working in the justice sphere on the strenuous efforts they have made to steer us through this very difficult time. Last week, I spoke of the highly negative impact the ongoing lockdown was having on the lives of our children and young people. This afternoon, I make a similar point, conscious that while Deputy Flanagan is the Minister for justice, he is also the Minister for equality. There are important issues in respect of intergenerational equality that need to be addressed in this debate. </p>
          <p eId="para_576"> Last week, I made the point that everyone recognised in March that it was absolutely essential that we have the lockdown to protect our intensive care units, hospitals and citizens from the surges we saw occurring in Italy and subsequently in Spain. Now, however, we are in the fortunate position where the number of cases, of deaths and people in intensive care are in decline. Up to now, all our decisions have been made on the exclusive basis of public health requirements. Public health should still predominate but I ask the Minister to bring back to the Cabinet other factors which must also be taken into consideration when deciding how we progress out of the lockdown. It is important to note that NPHET has placed great, indeed sole, emphasis on health issues but it is the Cabinet which is responsible for providing a direction for this country to lead us out of the lockdown. We cannot have a situation where executive governmental responsibility is subcontracted out to NPHET.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> I am pleased that, last week, a number of other individuals spoke about the very negative social, personal, educational and economic consequences the lockdown is having on children and young people. We need to recognise the responsibility we have to ensure the impact on them is not long-term and irreversible. All our decisions must take account of the fact that children and young people have very special requirements that need to be given attention by this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> I was very pleased to hear today that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has produced a report stating that children are not substantially contributing to the spread of the virus in schools or homes. Let us work off that to ensure we can reinstate greater normality into their lives in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> I note what the Minister has stated in respect of direct provision. There are very many children in direct provision and the difficulties they are going through in the absence of being able to socialise with their friends or go to their school very much accentuates the issues of equality that can be damaged by this ongoing lockdown.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> I note what the Minister has stated in respect of the direct provision centres. I have specific concerns about the one in Cahersiveen. I have asked questions by way of parliamentary questions and answers will be forthcoming to me in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> I want to raise another area that I believe the Minister needs to look into and expedite, that is, the area of trying to ensure that people who are involved in providing legal services to the public can do so remotely and with the benefit of modern technology. The Statutory Declarations Act is still in force. It dates from 1938. It requires, we believe, physical presence for a deponent to sign or swear an affidavit in the presence of a solicitor or a commissioner for oaths. We need to move away from that and expedite legislation to ensure that commercial documents and court documents can be sworn and signed remotely. The Minister may say we need legislation for that. I ask him to see if there is any other way around that, perhaps through practice directions of the courts and, if so, will he have discussions with the presidents of the court in respect of that?</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> I also believe we need to protect our gardaí. The gardaí have done a commendable job. It has been very difficult for them. Sometimes people give out about the gardaí exercising too much powers. They exercise the powers we ask them to exercise. They exercise the powers that we, as legislators, give them and, to date, they have done that in a commendable way and they need our continued support. I ask the Minister to give them the protection they need in terms of personal protection equipment, PPE.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> I will conclude by stating that we need to keep a very close eye on the equality consequences of this lockdown. My concern is that the lockdown, if it continues for a long period of time, will accentuate and increase inequality that already exists in our society.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JenniferMurnaneOConnor" eId="spk_232">
          <from>Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T17:45:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_584">I too want to give my condolences to the families that have lost loved ones to this coronavirus. When we tell people to stay at home, we must now realise and accept that not every home is safe. We might all be in the same storm but one thing is certain - we are not all in the same boat. Women's Aid has reported an increase in the number of domestic abuse calls made to the charity since the Covid-19 outbreak. Childline has also reported an increase in communications from children and young people, and charities. Gardaí have reported a 20% increase in calls related to domestic abuse. It is important that we listen to those on the front line on these issues now more than ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> The conditions recommended for public health have put lives at risk from domestic violence, and I do not say that lightly. Admittedly, we cannot know of the damage that has been done as those living in unsafe homes lost access in terms of not going to schools or attending sports activities, whether that is through community involvement, family or work.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> During the Covid-19 pandemic we have placed the necessary focus on domestic violence and the many difficulties that victims and survivors experience. One measure that was most welcome was the news that anyone fleeing an unsafe situation was not forced to abide by the distance restrictions, but we need more. We need to commit to grant allocations necessary to cover not just the cost of the Covid-19 emergency but also to take account of the loss of fundraising income and the expected surge in demand due to an increase in cases and the backlog in face-to-face and court support work once the Covid-19 emergency abates. There is always a surge in calls following holiday periods or in situations where access is not easy.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> Deficiencies in investment in this area over decades have left victims completely exposed during this crisis. While we are still in restrictions, we need to support developments for the Courts Service to facilitate applications remotely for <i>ex parte</i> domestic violence orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I would appreciate a reply on whether this is something we can look at in the short term, with a view to long-term implications. Just because we have been dealing with the coronavirus does not mean other societal issues have gone away. Right here, right now, we need to acknowledge domestic violence as a major driver of homelessness and address the local housing authority requirements that prevent survivors of domestic violence accessing social housing and the inconsistency of response among different local authorities. This is all about communication. While I welcome the recent focus on domestic violence during this pandemic, we have not focused on measures to properly support those left without homes while fleeing violent situations and support any victim or survivor, male or female, in rebuilding a post-violence life. In my home area in County Carlow we have to fundraise to support our Women's Aid service. Thankfully, we sourced two-family emergency accommodation provision just before the coronavirus shut so much down. While we might spend money on advertising campaigns, we do not offer a cohesive strategy to support those leaving a violent home after we encourage them to get out. As restrictions gradually lift, we must ensure that support services remain open and that they are resourced properly and listened to when they ask for those resources. It is more important than ever that domestic violence support services and places of refuge are easily accessible and available. We, as public representatives, trying to assist constituents in these matters must be able to access help in supporting victims and survivors, from whatever Department we need. I do not mean just the Department of Justice and Equality or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, but the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Health and Employment Affairs and Social Protection. That is where we fall down. There is no communication between the different Departments and unless we all communicate and work together, this cannot be solved.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> My second point relates to family law. While court orders regarding access remain in place, non-court ordered arrangements have been difficult too, because separated families trying to allow children access to both parents have received conflicting advice and have not been afforded the same guidance as those fleeing unsafe situations. The Garda is doing a terrific job under these public health restrictions, but what is the rule in this regard? We need proper guidance. Our children have sacrificed so much. Where there is a will on the part of one parent to facilitate access to another parent, perhaps in another county hundreds of miles away, we should be clear that we support them. We need to tell the children of Ireland that they matter, whether they live in a two-parent, one-parent, or separated-parent family. We must do this for them, and take whatever steps are necessary to ensure they are living their best lockdown lives.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_590">Like my colleagues, Deputies O'Callaghan and Murnane O'Connor, I appreciate the work of the personnel in the Department of Justice and Equality, including its agencies such as the Prison Service and An Garda Síochána. I commend the work of An Garda Síochána during these difficult times. Garda personnel have been a reassuring presence in our communities, and this work demonstrates clearly the value of community policing. Visiting older or vulnerable people has been very reassuring for many individuals and families. Their work, alongside other voluntary and statutory groups, is important in ensuring that families are not left isolated or without groceries or medical supplies. I raised directly with both the Tánaiste and the Minister for Health the lacuna in the law whereby gardaí are empowered, if necessary, to restrict the movements of persons in our State, but cannot apply that power to persons resident outside our jurisdiction. This law should be amended. Similarly, there should be no tolerance at our airports and ports for people refusing to fill out passenger locator forms.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> The Minister and the Minister of State may recall that I raised the absence of a refuge centre in Cavan-Monaghan with them during recent debates on justice. I also raised the matter with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. We are all well aware that the number of women's refuge spaces in our State is well below our obligations under the Istanbul Convention. In a vast region such as Cavan-Monaghan, made up of two large rural counties, we have no refuge to support women leaving situations of domestic abuse. I know of women who have had to travel to neighbouring counties such as Sligo, Meath and Louth to seek emergency accommodation. This is a tragic situation. We should be able to support these people in our own counties at a time they are very vulnerable. Towards the end of 2019, I received correspondence from Tusla, which indicated that funding would not be available for significant service developments in 2020. However, it also stated that it would continue to plan towards future developments. That followed a debate on legislation in this House in December. I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to have the needs of Cavan and Monaghan prioritised and I sincerely hope he will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">We must support women through their most harrowing experience. We must ensure that adequate services are provided and that people who are suffering through domestic violence have accommodation and support services when they need them. I commend the work of local groups such as Tearmann domestic violence service in Cavan-Monaghan and Safe Ireland at national level along with other groups on their ongoing support for victims of domestic abuse. In many instances, they are providing much-needed services and accommodation on very limited budgets, services that should be provided by the State. Safe Ireland was in touch with the Department at the end of April seeking the Minister's support for a proposal it put directly to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. This proposal requests access to emergency rent supplement for women and children in need of immediate relocation as a result of domestic violence for a period of three months and-or the duration of the Covid-19 national emergency. As the Minister is taking the lead on behalf of the Government on tackling domestic violence during these troubled times, I appeal to him to pursue this proposal directly with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> I understand that centres providing services are experiencing a significant increase in demand for those services due to the rise in domestic violence, which we know of through reports from An Garda Síochána and which is also evidenced internationally. I appeal to the Minister to have the provision of a refuge centre for Cavan-Monaghan given priority attention in the service plans for 2020. I previously noted how people seeking such accommodation services must travel to Louth, Meath or Sligo from parts of Cavan and Monaghan. This is not acceptable because in some instances, children are attending school in normal times and cannot go back to their normal school if they are so distant from their home, where they should be living but which they have had to leave because of violence. I again mention Tearmann domestic violence service in Cavan-Monaghan, which is very dependent on fund-raising, as are other services throughout the country. It does great work and shows great commitment and its personnel provide welcome and much-needed support for people who are very vulnerable. We need to ensure that our obligations laid out in the second national strategy and obligations under the Istanbul Convention are honoured. </p>
          <p eId="para_594"> Regarding problems facing residents in direct provision centres, I had detailed correspondence with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and appreciate his detailed reply to me. I would like him to ensure the commitments he made in that correspondence to follow up and to ensure that much better accommodation services are provided for people in direct provision are as much as possible during these very troubled times. </p>

We are conscious that we are in an emergency. This is really what we are dealing with here. I propose to ask a number of questions but I do not expect the Minister to respond to them now.

          <p eId="para_600">Will everything else be as easy? I know it has been acknowledged in the past couple of weeks that people coming into the country, particularly through our airports, are in some cases not even filling in forms on where they are going, never mind the issue of making sure they are self-isolating. This is something that troubles many people. The vast majority of people in our communities are abiding by the regulations and doing everything they can to ensure they minimise the spread of Covid-19. However, they feel somehow cheated because people who come into the country can move around and are not receiving the same level of scrutiny as others. It has been mooted in recent days that there may be a role for An Garda Síochána in checking on people. This would be a positive step but it has not yet been formally set out how it will happen. Perhaps the Minister will explain that and set out what is planned in that regard because it worries and concerns many people, particularly the case of people who come into the country with caravans and mobile homes, travel around the country and seem to be able to do this without any regulation or guidance.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Another important issue is the good work that is being done by An Garda Síochána in policing this and making sure there is close monitoring of the restrictions. However, the absence of personal protective equipment, PPE, is concerning. Every evening on the "Six One" news, we see examples from other countries and states around Europe. The police in Italy, Spain and other countries are all wearing protective equipment, masks and gloves. We then see a clip of gardaí talking to somebody at a checkpoint in Ireland. They walk up to the window and speak to someone in a car while wearing no protective equipment. The next car comes along and the gardaí do it again. The mind boggles as to how we are telling the public to be careful and socially distant when the same rule does not seem to apply to An Garda Síochána. There have been many cases of members of the Garda who have gone into self-isolation with Covid-19 or suspected Covid-19. There are also issues around the speed at which tests for Covid-19 are coming back. There are a lot of issues around that which need to be worked out.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> I know there was a recommendation that members of the Garda would not use protective equipment. Was that because it was not available? A lot of people have an issue with that. Many rank-and-file gardaí have told me of their concern that the equipment simply was not there and that is why a recommendation was made not to use it. It would be worthwhile for the Minister to clear that up.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> There is also an issue about what happens and how all of this works in Garda stations. People who enter Garda stations at present are taken into a small room for an interview and there are no precautions and nothing is set out as to how they can socially distance. They may be a number of hours in the room and may have to be accompanied by a solicitor. Nothing has been done in respect of that. The procedures in that regard are the treatment of persons in custody regulations. That issue of how that can that be worked out and improved upon must be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> There is also the issue of the Courts Service. The Minister mentioned in his statement what is happening with the Courts Service. Last Friday, there was a statement that there would be an improvement in that respect. It is clear that significant issues exist there. There is a considerable backlog of people waiting to have fairly minor situations sorted out and repeatedly being put off. It is causing great distress to people and modern technology should be used where possible. It clearly is possible in many cases, because we know that modern technology is used between the Prison Service and the Courts Service. It can be deployed to resolve many of these issues and that needs to be done with the utmost speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> Everyone in this House recognises that the direct provision model for asylum seekers we traditionally have had in Ireland for the past number of years has had huge problems that we must deal with. I believe there is a process to try to deal with them. We all recognise there are issues and that some people in direct provision are facing serious problems. Cahirsiveen has been mentioned and is one example. Approximately a quarter of the people in that direct provision centre have tested positive for Covid-19. It is a real issue that needs to be dealt with. </p>
          <p eId="para_606"> There are other issues in other places around the country that need to be dealt with. It can be done. I use the example of Cahirsiveen. There have been offers made to use holiday cottages which are not being used at all at the moment. They are empty and no one is going to the villages in which those holiday cottages are. There is also empty student accommodation that could be used in some cases. Taking such an approach could thin out the numbers and ensure that the correct levels of social distancing can be employed, particularly in direct provision settings.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> I acknowledge that direct provision is a very difficult area and that many people in the Department are doing their best. However, there are gaps in some places that need to be filled. I also acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, to whom I have spoken on many occasions in recent weeks on many of these issues and I am aware that work is being done. In some cases, however, a little more imagination could be used and some of the existing guidelines and rules need to be stretched a little more to ensure we can resolve these issues. Many of the people in those situations feel imprisoned and that is the problem. It sometimes is a communication problem. Those people are being told that, because of Covid-19, they must self-isolate and must be controlled. That is what they are trying to get away from and those are the very reasons they came to this country in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> There are issues that need to be dealt with. There is an opportunity for the Minister to do that, to stretch the guidelines a little bit and use other forms of accommodation, outside the existing models of direct provision. I acknowledge that many such people, approximately 20% or 25%, are in own-door accommodation at present but to go further down that road in this emergency situation would resolve a lot of the existing issues and I implore the Minister to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> The issues that we raise about justice, as has been said by others, come into the area of equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">This is particularly so in the case of domestic violence, and the problems relating to it have to be worked upon. Important voluntary work is being done by many of the domestic violence agencies but they are under major stress at the moment and do not have the ability to raise funds. The Minister and his Department, or some section of the Government, need to come in and assist them with funding to ensure they can continue to do their good work.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">With due respect to the Ceann Comhairle, and I take his point on board, I spoke to Shane's mother today and on several other occasions, and one of the commitments I made was that at the very first opportunity I had to put questions to the Minister for Justice and Equality, regardless of who he or she might be, I would raise her son's case. As many Members know only too well, Shane was killed in 2011, at just 23 years of age, by a man who was a known criminal, who had breached several bail conditions at the time and who had 42 previous convictions across three different states.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> Since his death, Shane's family have sought justice. Through their efforts, whole-scale failures in the handling of this case by numerous statutory agencies, including An Garda, the prosecution team, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts Service, have been exposed. The questions that have been raised are so numerous and of such significance that many people, including myself, believe they can only be properly dealt with through a public inquiry. That public inquiry has yet to be delivered, but a scoping exercise is currently being undertaken by the respected former judge, Gerard Haughton. Will the Minister give an indication as to when he expects that exercise to be completed and whether he foresees a public inquiry taking place thereafter?</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> I have another question on a different issue. Will the Minister comment in respect of the apparent failure of his Department to heed the request in 2008 by the Attorney General, a senior counsel and the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to publish a report that was compiled by the Courts Service for his Department? The family concerned had to fight for more than two years to receive that report, in February of this year, despite having gone through freedom of information procedures and all the rest. The Minister will understand that it is things like this that create the view among people in my town that there is a resistance within his Department to the type of public inquiry that is warranted in the case I mentioned. I ask, with the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence, for a short response, if possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">Before I start, I welcome Gerry Adams's just result in court in relation to the sorry story of the British policy of internment in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> We will live with the Covid-19 virus for a long time, but the viruses that many of us have been living with for far longer are drugs and organised crime. Last Saturday, I saw for myself the horrific results of this pandemic when I received a call to say that in Muirhevnamore in Dundalk, approximately 1 km from my home, a young man was lying dead at the back of two houses that have been synonymous with drug use and dealing.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">At the scene, people in the community wanted to know who had died. They were saddened, but not shocked. They were angry. No one was in any doubt about who was responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> I spoke to gardaí. The view in the community was that the death could be linked to one of the most prolific drug dealers in the area, someone many would hold responsible for a number of deaths in the past year in this part of Dundalk. The following day, gardaí found €2,000 worth of cocaine in the same estate following the search of a man. Follow-up searches yielded another €30,000. Three people are being questioned after gardaí intercepted three cars in Drogheda and seized over €1.1 million worth of cocaine and prescription drugs as well as more than €500,000 in cash.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> I welcome the vigilance of gardaí but it has been clear for a long time that they are operating on the back foot and within a failing system. They constantly speak of being under-resourced. Drug dealing, addiction and drug debt extortion and violence are everywhere. Every village and town is affected, but working-class areas like Muirhevnamore, which is a great community with great people, pay the biggest price.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> It now looks like a Government will be formed. Many are committed to not having Sinn Féin be a part of it, but this point is too important to ignore. Whoever is in government needs to ensure the drug pandemic is taken seriously and the issue needs to be brought to the Cabinet table. This crosses not only the Department of Justice and Equality, but also the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs and Housing, Planning and Local Government. We need multi-agency plans and operations at every local authority level. We cannot have a continued systemic failure of communities because that is what we have been dealing with.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> I accept that Covid-19 creates logistical difficulties. We need a plan for now and a plan for afterwards. We are also dealing with the fact that there are insufficient supports. The family addiction support network is still working, but is operating solely via volunteerism and just €7,500 in funding from an under-resourced drugs task force. This is never going to work. We welcome the natural justice of the Criminal Assets Bureau, but we have yet to see its impact on the El Chapos and narcos in Dundalk. I want to know whether there are any plans to remedy this.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> Many Garda operations lead to serious drug dealing charges, but there are often delays, bail is opposed and the community watches as these guys are back in action. We need to make sure we have processing and resourcing in place to ensure people get to court and a conclusion is reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> We have a youth justice system which is not fit for purpose. Dealers are recruiting children and many players or capos are now 14 or 15 years of age. It takes too long to get them into the system, and no differentiation is made between milder anti-social behaviour and others who are cogs in organised crime machines. What solution does the Minister have for this? We can continue with the way we are operating and never fix the problem or we can make a real attempt to deal with it. I ask the Minister to reply to me in writing.</p>

          <p eId="para_631">I want to take this opportunity to highlight the issue of domestic violence and ask three simple questions of the Minister. I will give some background. I refer to the expansion of the safe intervention units by gardaí, such as the one in Dún Laoghaire, for intervening safely in case of domestic abuse and coercive control; access to the courts for victims of domestic abuse; and the question of abuse and coercive control playing out through family law proceedings more generally, including the manipulation of court processes such as access to play therapy and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> As a Parliament we all recognise, as Deputy Murnane O'Connor has done today, the importance of domestic abuse supports for victims at this time. Many people are in their least safe place when they are at home. Children, women and men around our country are stuck in very difficult situations. Some have become more financially dependent on their abusers because of the loss of work. Some are simply unable to physically leave in a way they may have been able to do. Some have become more isolated from friends and family, and their abusers are using that isolation to further remove them from their friends and family and make their situation much more difficult. Some depended on the release of work, education, friends and simply getting outside to escape abuse at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">As a Parliament, we cannot highlight enough the unacceptability of abuse in the home. I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the success, I think, of the video and TV campaign to highlight the impact and that shows how difficult it can be for some people in our community. It highlighted the significance of neighbours, friends and family being vigilant, that they step in and raise concerns and not be afraid or leave it to other people.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> I will refer to three specific issues. We have an excellent unit in Dún Laoghaire concerned with safe intervention for people suffering abuse. Is that something the Minister might consider discussing with the Garda regarding a more general roll out? The issue of access to courts given the impact of Covid-19 restrictions was raised earlier. How can access be facilitated on an <i>ex parte</i> basis? A more general issue has come up repeatedly which is relevant today and also of continued relevance in future, namely, how people in abusive situations can have their situations made much worse through family law proceedings where abusers have the opportunity to consent, not consent, or to withdraw consent to constructive interventions such as play therapy for children. It is incredibly important that we do not allow an abusive relationship and an abusive domestic situation be perpetuated through our court processes and let that abuse be facilitated any longer.</p>

          <p eId="para_636">I am raising the issue of insolvency. Amendments will be needed to the personal insolvency legislation to deal with the issues that will arise as the result of the impact of Covid-19. The response to this unprecedented pandemic has seen significant changes to national policies in the areas of health and business. It will also be necessary for us to take significant action being mindful of what is going to be significant economic and financial fallout for people from the inevitable recession that will unfortunately be caused by this pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> In particular, I would like the Minister to give details on changes that are being considered or that may be covered by amendments to the relevant Act in the coming months. I am mindful that a new Government may be in place, but I am sure work is ongoing in the Minister's Department. Specifically, what steps are being taken concerning the removal of barriers to insolvency and the appeals process to the courts of a rejected personal insolvency agreement? Is consideration being given to those two areas?</p>

I assure him and the House that my Department is engaged in work for two sets of legislative change regarding personal insolvency. We are considering specific formal or procedural statutory requirements which are often difficult or impracticable in the context of compliance with Covid-19 restrictions. There are a small number of requirements under the personal insolvency Acts, subject to Government formation. I am conscious in this regard of this House, but also of the Upper House. The intention, in any event, is to bring forward these changes for urgent Government approval very shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> The House will also be aware that my officials are already working to complete the major statutory review of the personal insolvency Acts. There was a period of public consultation and that has now been completed. It is important now that such a review also include the latest developments, with particular reference to the significant economic adverse impact of Covid-19. We are in May and I expect the report will be available by September. We are also engaged in consultations with the Department of Finance, but I am happy to keep Deputy Heydon informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> Regarding the queries from Deputy Carroll MacNeill, I acknowledge the work she has done and continues to do to assist the regulatory framework concerning domestic violence in the context of the impact of Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I want to acknowledge what Deputy Murnane-O'Connor has also stated in that regard. I spoke to gardaí on this issue yesterday. It seems from feedback that I have received that this is one issue where there has been an increase in criminal activity. It should be a concern to all of us. It certainly is a priority to me. That is why I acknowledge what the Garda has done in respect of Operation Faoiseamh in order to ensure that those victims of domestic abuse, including coercive control, will continue to receive high priority on the part of the State. In this regard, I acknowledge pro-activity and training on the part of the Garda. Parallel to the activities under the Covid regime, we also have the ongoing roll-out of the divisional protective services units throughout the country. The aim and objective, certainly on the previous occasions we had Justice questions, was to have these units up and running throughout the State by the end of the spring of this year and I understand that the Garda is actively engaging. Even in the small number of districts where there is not a formal divisional protective unit, gardaí are trained. Gardaí are responding in a most robust way. In this regard, let me assure Deputy Murnane O'Connor that the courts are open.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> I listened to what Deputy Carroll MacNeill stated in respect of a Dún Laoghaire project. I would be happy to convey the views of the Deputy to the Garda Commissioner in that regard but I am anxious to assure the House and indeed the public that the courts are available to deal with these issues and also issues of a more general family law nature that have been raised earlier in respect of emergency orders, protective orders, barring orders and indeed the issues that arise on a daily basis, sadly, within the District Court regime. There was, it was said, an element of confusion in respect of standing court orders and access, particularly outside of the travel area. I want to assure the Deputies that the court orders still very much stand, the restrictive travel regime does not apply in respect of court orders and in the event of there being a dispute between the parties, as well as the Court Services being available and the family legal services networks being available, court offices are open.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> As well as the courts, I want also to advise of the importance of the family mediation services in this area. I will reply to Deputy Murnane O'Connor and Deputy Carroll MacNeill in detail on the points raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> I would be anxious to meet Deputy Martin Kenny on some of the important points raised by him. I cannot respond to the Deputy now. They may come up in later questions. I am concerned about what the Deputy said about gardaí and PPE.</p>

          <from>Deputy Patrick Costello<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_645">I am sharing time with Deputy O'Gorman. I am happy to take any answers that might be in correspondence afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Like others, I want to raise the issue of direct provision. We have been talking about the importance of equality in this session and something we will be judged on is how more vulnerable groups were treated during this pandemic. I look at the infection rates among those living in direct provision and they are significantly higher than those among the general population. That is quite worrying. The scenes in Cahersiveen show exactly the problems there are for many of the people living in direct provision. The reality is that direct provision has been with us for quite a long time, these problems that we are seeing were predictable and the slow pace of reform or the lack of any movement to reform has made these problems inevitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">We have to accept that we are where we are, but the Chief Medical Officer stated clearly that sharing bedrooms with non-family members does not allow for social distancing. It seems the HSE has a new definition of household, which allows us to sidestep some of these public health concerns within direct provision centres. The significantly higher infection rate for those living in direct provision compared to the general population is the inevitable result of that kind of sidestepping. It is important that we look at those in direct provision and do what we can as quickly as possible. Creative solutions were suggested earlier today by other Deputies. We need to embrace those. </p>
          <p eId="para_648"> I also want to look at the issue of anti-social and criminal behaviour. I appreciate that the Garda now has new responsibilities in enforcing the Covid-19 legislation but as the Minister has said, ordinary policing work goes on. A balance must be struck. I am particularly thinking of places within my own constituency. The issue of anti-social behaviour, violence and criminal behaviour was raised on numerous doorsteps in and around Bluebell while I was canvassing during the election. Some constituents have commented that this has become significantly worse during the lockdown. This is now the only kind of activity taking place out on the streets. It is not just a perception caused by quiet streets. There has been an escalation in violence and criminality. There have been gunshots fired in the area in recent weeks. This has left residents very concerned and worried.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> Some good stuff is being done on the ground. Constituents have spoken to me about the good work being done by youth services in the area, which is helping to divert children and young people. Unfortunately, as we have spoken about before, many of these services are under strain due to restrictions. A lot of good work is also being done on a cross-party basis by local councillors. I thank my colleague, Councillor Sophie Nicoullaud, who is doing great work with the other local councillors, policing forums and community groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> There is a lack of policing in this area and we need a stronger police response. Moreover, it must be a creative police response. A lot of issues arise along the bike path by the canal. Providing bikes to members of the Garda would enable much more effective policing of that stretch and would be a lot cheaper than the high-tech resources the Garda gets in other areas. There have also been calls for increased use of motorbike patrols to help patrol some of the estates in the area. This does not seem to be happening. It would be very beneficial to adopt some of these creative responses to help address the rising criminality and violence within this community, which is leaving many residents quite scared. </p>
          <p eId="para_651"> I also want to briefly touch on another issue which is quite important, given that many of us are working from home and given the roll-out of the Covid-19 tracing application as part of easing the lockdown. Later this month, we will mark the two-year anniversary of the general data protection regulation, GDPR. Part of that regulation requires us to provide our Data Protection Commission with all the resources it needs to investigate and prosecute any breaches of the GDPR. Earlier this month a report in <i>The New York Times </i>discussed the weakness of our regulator and its importance arising from its dealings with the big tech companies here in Ireland. Our Data Protection Commission regulator is the single most important data protection commissioner in the European Union. The report in the <i>The New York Times </i>quoted a report by Brave, a privacy-focused browser company, which examined the situation. This report found that there are 21 tech specialists working in the Data Protection Commission. That is not nearly enough to hold big tech to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">It is important the State shows we are serious about tackling these issues and supporting the rights of citizens regarding privacy and GDPR, and that we give the full resources the Data Protection Commissioner needs to prosecute her specialist role.</p>

        <speech by="#RodericOGorman" eId="spk_253">
          <from>Deputy Roderic O'Gorman<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_653">I thank the Minister for his statement. Does the Minister agree the Covid-19 crisis has further illustrated the fundamental problems that arise from the communal residential nature of direct provision as it is implemented in Ireland? In light of the potential of future waves of Covid-19 or variants of the virus, we need to move to accommodation centres that are based on own-door accommodation. With regard to Cahersiveen, as far as I am aware, there is currently public health guidance about the Skellig Accommodation Centre. This requires that residents self-isolate for at least 14 days after the last diagnosis of Covid-19. Does the Minister believe that once the public health guidance is lifted the Department should cease to use the Skellig Accommodation Centre as emergency accommodation in light of the unsuitability of the building, the wider site and of the breakdown in trust between management and residents?</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> Similar to Deputy Murnane O'Connor and other Deputies who spoke earlier, I am concerned about the capacity of our domestic violence services to cope with the expected surge in demand for their services. Having spoken with Safe Ireland and Sonas, I am aware that that surge has already begun. In light of the somewhat fragmented nature of responsibility for domestic violence services across a number of Departments and agencies, can the Minister reassure the front-line service providers in the domestic violence sector that they will have the extra resources necessary to offer help to women and children who are fleeing abuse? Like the Minister, I recognise the work of the staff of the Irish Prison Service in ensuring that there have been no outbreaks of Covid-19 in prisons or places of detention. Is the Minister satisfied that people who are classified as vulnerable due to their age or an underlying condition who have been cocooning within our prisons have had access to at least one hour of exercise every day and at least two hours of meaningful human contact?</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> I am aware of situations where undocumented workers were afraid to seek medical advice despite the fact that they were suffering from Covid-like symptoms, because they were afraid that their status would be shared with immigration officials. I know the Minister for Health provided some clarifications in that area. Does the Minister agree that a scheme for the wider recognition of undocumented workers in this country would not only have the benefit of taking these workers out of the black economy but, perhaps as importantly, would lessen an ongoing public health risk created if sick people are afraid to seek medical advice?</p>

          <p eId="para_657">I regret that I do not have much time to deal with the issues raised. I would be happy to prepare a note for Deputy Costello regarding the Data Protection Commissioner and demonstrate in real terms the increase in budget, staff, and other resources such as the headquarters, having regard to the point which the Deputy rightly makes about the importance of our Data Protection Commissioner. I would be happy to engage further about anti-social behaviour. I take issue with Deputy O'Gorman's statement that there is a fundamental breach of trust between management and residents in any direct provision centre but I acknowledge there is an issue. I assure the Deputy and the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and I are engaged in this daily as a priority. I would be pleased to give a further update to Deputy O'Gorman, following from at least two updates we have given in the past two weeks. It is an important and challenging issue that the Government is proceeding to address in a progressive way.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_256">
          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_658">I propose to make a few points and to ask a few questions. If the Minister can answer them in the time allocated, I would be grateful. If not, I would be happy to receive a written reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I wish to raise four issues: the status of undocumented workers, the enforcement of regulations by An Garda Síochána, direct provision and the status of the Garda task force.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> Regarding undocumented workers, the Minister will be in receipt of a letter issued by the CEOs of the civil society organisations calling for the regularisation of undocumented children, young people and workers. I will quote from a letter I received, and which the Minister himself will have received. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_661">Undocumented workers have stepped up and continue to work providing essential services in this crisis. They are working in sectors where Ireland needs workers right now – in elder care, healthcare, retail, cleaning, food processing, agriculture and fishing.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_662">There is broad based support for the regularisation of undocumented people – from the public, business, civil society, and across all major political parties in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Could the Minister confirm whether the Government will commit to regularising the legal status of those undocumented persons currently carrying out essential front-line services, as care workers in particular?</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> The second issue concerns the operational status of An Garda Síochána. I acknowledge the reference the Minister made in his statement to the Policing Authority report, but it is worth quoting from the report, which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_665">In the previous set of figures released by An Garda Síochána, for the period 8 to 25 April, there were 760 such incidents. This means an additional 412 incidents have been recorded or confirmed in the past week (a 54% increase). It is noted that some of these incidents may have occurred prior to the 26th April but were not included in previous totals due to not being validated</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The report set out the issues in respect of the policing of Covid. It further states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_667">Approximately 22% of the offences relate to public order, while a further 16% relate to simple drug possession. General road offences was the third most frequent offence classification, accounting for approximately 10%. However, when all types of road offences are combined, they account for almost 32%.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> In tandem with that, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties submitted a detailed letter to the Garda Commissioner setting out issues and queries regarding the implementation by the Garda of the regulations introduced on 7 April. Those regulations amend the 1947 regulations. The 1947 regulations, for instance, have powers of enforcement that can be invoked that include the power of entry onto private premises where the regulations are being breached. For instance, the holding of a party on a private property is an offence under the regulations on the part of the guests because they have left their homes without a reasonable excuse, and on the part of the host because he or she is hosting the unauthorised event.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> Is the Minister satisfied that the statistics put forward by the Garda Commissioner show there is a low level of use of those enforcement powers and that there is a need then to ensure that we return to normal policing as quickly as possible? Inherent within that, as we move to the next phase on 18 May, in terms of the normalisation of society, as it were, and as we move through the phases beyond that, we must have regard to the regulations in the 1947 Act. Is it the Minister's intention to relax or lift those regulations or what does he propose to do in respect of them? We are fast approaching 18 May but at this point, we do not have sight of his intentions in respect of the powers of the Garda. It would be very useful for us to have some perspective from him.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> Similar to other Deputies, I also seek assurances from the Minister that the Garda has access to the requisite PPE now and will have as we move through those phases. Further, has consideration been given by the Government or by him to priority testing and results for An Garda Síochána in respect of Covid-19?</p>
          <p eId="para_671">My third point relates to direct provision. I share the concerns of other Deputies with regard to Cahersiveen. It is important that the Minister speak to the Cahersiveen issue specifically. It would be worthwhile. The Minister made no specific reference to it in his speech but I would like to hear from him in that respect. In his speech, the Minister said that 7,700 people are being supported under direct provision at present. On social and physical distancing supports and cocooning measures, he said "More than 600 residents have relocated to support social and physical distancing and cocooning measures in centres." There are 7,700 people in direct provision and, according to the Minister's speech, 600 people have been moved into safer accommodation. Will the Minister give us his perspective on the next phase? How far along are the Minister and his Department with regard to ensuring the safety of those who reside in direct provision centres?</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> Will a Garda task force be set up for County Louth and for Drogheda in particular? Points regarding policing in this specific region have been raised by other speakers. Following on from that, what is the status of the Garda task force for Dublin's north inner city?</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> If I have time to come back in, I would be grateful for the opportunity, but I doubt I will.</p>

          <p eId="para_674">In respect of the task force, as a long-standing Member of the House, Deputy Sherlock will be aware that these are operational issues for An Garda Síochána. I assure the Deputy and the House that, from my personal knowledge and my discussions and meetings with the Commissioner and his Garda team, every effort is being made on the part of An Garda Síochána to deal with the serious criminal issue in Drogheda. That will continue until such time as the small number responsible are brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> With regard to Deputy Sherlock's earlier point in respect of undocumented persons, my message is clear: anybody who regards himself or herself as undocumented need have no fear in seeking medical attention during the current Covid emergency. It is important that everybody in the State benefit from appropriate medical treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> Deputy Sherlock mentioned the role of the Policing Authority and other human rights-based organisations with regard to the Garda restrictions. Again I stress that the Government considers these restrictions necessary having regard to the public health emergency. They are provided for by law passed in this House. I assure Deputy Sherlock that the operational guidelines with which An Garda Síochána is engaging are grounded in human rights obligations and a strict code of ethics. I am very pleased that the Garda Commissioner reports to my Department weekly and that the Policing Authority, in response to a request from me, is engaging with the Garda Inspectorate, GSOC, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and NGOs including those mentioned by Deputy Sherlock. I have asked that the authority report on these issues and that there be a clear focus on the application of the emergency powers by An Garda Síochána and on any particular impact that may be felt by groups in society that might regard themselves as being in some way vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">I wish to assure the Deputy of clear accountability and transparency in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> The duration of the regulations is subject to ongoing consideration by the Government in line with the advice of the public health experts. I want to be clear that the Government makes the decisions; NPHET and other public health groups give advice. Of course, I would be happy to keep the Deputy and the House fully informed of any changes under consideration. As of now, the regulations are firmly in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_679">I wish to ask a series of questions on one topic and would like those to be responded to. I will leave some time. I would be happy to take replies to two other subsequent questions in writing.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> The Travelodge hotel in Swords is one of a number in that hotel chain that houses asylum seekers as well as other guests, including airline staff. On 7 March, a guest returned from Bergamo in Italy, which at the time was the European epicentre of the pandemic. That person was hospitalised and diagnosed with Covid-19. The remaining members of the guest's travel party remained in the hotel with instructions to self-isolate and stayed until 22 March. However, on 18 and 19 March, a group of 70 asylum seekers who had been resident in that hotel for the entire time where there was a confirmed infection was at short notice split up into two separate groups and moved to two centres. No testing was done, but I know the test criteria were different then. One of those centres was the Skellig Star in Cahersiveen in Kerry, which went on to have a cluster. People felt very scared about that, as has been well articulated since.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> On 6 April, I wrote to the Minister's office seeking clarity as to why such a wholesale moving of people had happened at a time when the public health advice was for people to stay at home and urging people not to go to holiday homes. Despite this, these people were moved from one side of the country to the other, particularly those who went to Kerry. The Department's reply was that the decision to move people had been taken for their own health and safety, yet subsequent information which came into the public domain suggests that either the Department was not informed about the confirmed case in the Swords hotel from which the 70 asylum seekers were moved or the Department was informed and decided to move them anyway. I ask the Minister to address that particular point. On what date was the Department informed? Was it before 18 March?</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> With confirmed cases in Cahersiveen now, there is limited scope to self-isolate. What are the plans for that facility now? Obviously, moving to an own hall door is the preferred option. In the immediate aftermath of the 70 asylum seekers being moved from the Travelodge hotel in Swords, can the Minister confirm that another 30 to 40 asylum seekers were moved into that hotel in Swords? If so, what sanitation arrangements were put in place in advance of that? I have been told that within a week of their being moved, a number of staff in that hotel tested positive for Covid-19. Is the Swords hotel still being used for direct provision? Have there been more confirmed cases?</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> I ask the Minister about different advice from the HSE. In his earlier statement, he said that three people sharing a room was in line with HSE guidance. We heard a briefing from the Chief Medical Officer a few days ago and when asked that particular question he said that he would not have viewed three non-family members sharing a room as recommended. Is there a difference of opinion with that advice? I ask the Minister to address these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> I would be happy to receive a written reply to my remaining questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">A human rights impact assessment has been sought. Is the Minister open to putting that in place? On the Courts Service, the Bar Council suggested that some ordinary crimes could be tried by non-jury courts on consent. Has that been discussed with the Department? Is the Minister involved in discussions on putting mandatory arrangements in place at airports to ensure compliance by passengers in terms of providing notification of the location at which they will be staying? If so, I ask the Minister to outline those details.</p>

          <p eId="para_686">On direct provision, I am conscious that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is present and I am anxious to facilitate his contribution in respect of Cahersiveen. The premises there was offered to my Department last September and assessed by senior officials at the time. In early March, during the early stages of the pandemic, it was deemed appropriate to move residents there from several Dublin hotels, all of which were being used on a temporary basis, including the hotel mentioned by Deputy Catherine Murphy. Those premises were not being used exclusively by the Department and it was our considered opinion that there was a potential public health risk. As such, it was decided to move the residents to Cahersiveen. I wish to be clear that no resident was awaiting a test or test results at the time of the transfer. Neither I nor anybody else in the Department of Justice and Equality was aware of any guest at any of the source hotels having or being suspected of having the virus at the time the move was planned or implemented. I am happy to provide further detail in writing for the Deputy. She has raised the issue on several occasions and we have been in correspondence with her. I am happy to engage on any specific issue on which she seeks a reply.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">The issue of direct provision has taken up a significant amount of my time, that of the Minister and that of the Department in recent years. Many improvements have been made. A significant number of people are now in own-door or self-catering accommodation. We have been moving in that direction but it is very difficult, as colleagues are aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> There are 69 residents, including nine children, in the premises in Cahersiveen. The accommodation has 56 bedrooms and capacity for 150 residents. The residents are a mix of single people and small-sized families. All single residents have been offered their own bedroom. All bedrooms in the centre are en suite. Some of the residents have declined this offer and indicated they wish to self-isolate with their room-mate as a family unit. We continue to encourage those residents to accept the offer of their own room. No one is being detained at the centre. The centre management has confirmed that the main entrance door is on a thumb lock and residents may leave freely if they so wish. However, the current guidance from the HSE is that residents should self-isolate. The centre staff remind the residents of that public health advice. The whole issue of isolation and staying in our homes and within a certain distance is very difficult for us all.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">I have no doubt that a significant amount of effort has been put into resolving the issue. The key issue is that the Minister just told me the Department of Justice and Equality did not know that somebody in the hotel had tested positive, but the HSE must have known that. Did it not tell the Department? Is that what happened?</p>

          <p eId="para_694">There have been calls for many years to close direct provision but many improvements have been made. What happens now is that when people arrive in the country and look for international protection, as a State we are obliged to offer them accommodation, heat, food, a bed, education and so on. That is what people get. Many people move through each centre. There are over 1,000 people now in centres who have status to remain and we are struggling to find accommodation for them. It is a very challenging area for everybody. We have been working extremely hard, with the assistance of lots of colleagues here. Many colleagues came under pressure when direct provision centres were opened in their areas. Some of these newer centres have a very high standard, with own-door self-catering accommodation and that is what we want to move towards, more and more. When many people arrived at one time last year, there was a huge spike in numbers, which put a lot of pressure on the accommodation. We were very anxious that people would not be homeless on the streets. That did not happen. There was one instance where a few people were not accommodated but we worked might and main to ensure everybody had a bed, food, shelter, heat, education and so on. We worked to process their applications quickly and move them out of the system, so that if they are allowed to stay here they can get on with their lives. That is what we all want.</p>

          <p eId="para_695">I extend my condolences to the families and friends who have lost loved ones to Covid-19 during the past week. I offer my support to those who are battling illnesses and I wish them well during this period. I also thank all front-line workers for their continuing heroic efforts in the battle against Covid-19. I particularly thank the gardaí for their efforts during the crisis. In my constituency of Louth and east Meath, and my home town of Dundalk, the presence of the gardaí has been welcomed. The manner in which they are dealing with this crisis also needs to be praised. They have taken an appropriate approach which has been welcomed by many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> As the Minister knows, the Dealgan House Nursing Home in Dundalk has one of the highest fatality rates in the country due to Covid-19.

          <p eId="para_700">I hope he will give me an extra minute for that please. If over 20 people were killed on a building site, the Health and Safety Authority would be involved. It is likely that the Garda and various other State agencies would also be involved. The point I am making is that in those situations there is a clear protocol in place, but in the situation of the Dealgan House Nursing Home there was no such protocol for families. That is what is most stressful for these families. This is not a blame game. The families simply want answers so that this does not happen to anyone else in the future. Several family members have contacted me and have asked me to ask the Minister these questions directly. It is quite clear that we need a public inquiry into why this happened in Dealgan House. Will the Minister bring this to the Cabinet and impress on his colleagues the need for a public inquiry? What happened in Dealgan House must not be allowed to happen anywhere again. The older generation must be protected every bit as much as other citizens. They have a right to be treated much better than they have been in the past few months. I repeat that I am asking the Minister to urge his Cabinet colleagues to accept that a public inquiry is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> We have heard in recent months about the difficulty front-line workers have had in obtaining PPE. Can the Minister update this House on the PPE for gardaí working on the front line? Is there sufficient PPE gear for vital front-line staff?</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> During recent months, several posts in An Garda Síochána have been filled by serving members of the PSNI. The most notable of these appointments is the appointment of Paula Hilman as assistant commissioner and Stephen McCauley to the rank of superintendent. Paula Hilman was previously a detective chief superintendent in the PSNI while Stephen McCauley was a detective chief inspector in the PSNI. Can the Minister state whether the appointments were made through an open selection competition and whether serving officers from other jurisdictions applied and were considered for these roles?</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Will he indicate if serving members of An Garda Síochána applied for the roles?</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> I note that the appointments were made possible by an agreement between the Government and its UK counterpart. Is the Minister aware of any member of An Garda Síochána who has applied for a senior role in the PSNI? Can he confirm that this agreement will still stand in the event of a no-deal Brexit? </p>
          <p eId="para_705"> Over the past year or so, members of the armed response unit have been deployed in the north east, mainly as a response to the gang feud in Drogheda. I welcome and support the deployment but I wish to raise the concerns felt by those living close to the Border in towns such as Dundalk. I am particularly concerned that the armed response unit only appears to have been deployed in Drogheda to deal with the gang feud. There is no doubt that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, dangerous criminals will try to take advantage of the situation, particularly with smuggling and serious crime. Will the resources of the armed response unit be deployed in the same manner as they are being deployed to deal with the gang feud in Drogheda? I fear that Dundalk and surrounding areas will be vulnerable to cross-Border crime if we do not get our share of resources. </p>
          <p eId="para_706"> I have raised the Dromad Garda station with the Minister on many occasions. Will he indicate when the station will reopen? I had hoped it would have happened by now. Is there any particular reason the station has not yet reopened? I understand there are currently seven vacancies for Garda sergeants in the Dundalk area. Is this correct and, if so, why? I am disappointed the positions remain unfilled and am interested to hear why.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> During the lockdown, I have received a greater than normal number of requests from fathers who are experiencing difficulties seeing their children who are cared for by their mothers. In one case, a father whose son lives with his mother has been unable to see his son for over seven weeks. He completely understands the reasons for the lockdown and supports it but he is missing valuable time with his son and worries about the long-term effect it might have on their relationship. Will the Minister indicate when such fathers will be in a position to see their children once more given the current restrictions? </p>
          <p eId="para_708"> Since the lockdown was introduced, domestic violence has increased, as have calls to women's refuges. What measures are being put in place by the Department of Justice and Equality to address this very important issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_710">I will and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the guidance. Deputy Fitzpatrick raised a number of non-Covid-19 related matters, on which I am happy to give him an early reply, with particular reference to the armed support unit and Garda stations and resources in the Louth area.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> On Covid, Deputy Kenny raised the matter of PPE being deployed to Garda members. This is a matter of importance. I reject Deputy Kenny's remarks about the lack of PPE for Garda members. I will give the House a sense of the volume. Approximately 2 million pairs of disposable gloves, more than 200,000 face masks and 50,000 l of hand sanitiser in refillable plastic bottles have been distributed. The types of PPE supplies are administered by gardaí on a regular basis. Garda divisions and specialist units are provided with PPE weekly from central stores. These are distributed to each Garda station to ensure that the Garda has adequate supplies to meet operational requirements. That is of great importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> On the matter that Deputy Fitzpatrick has raised in respect of recent senior appointments in An Garda Síochána, the competition for the appointments was conducted by the Policing Authority in accordance with legislation. I welcome the appointments. The Government had a role in the ultimate appointments in accordance with the Garda legislation. As Minister for Justice and Equality, I would not be privy to the personalities involved in the interview process or those who applied or did not apply but I would say to Deputy Fitzpatrick that the process was entirely in accordance with the legislation as passed by this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> On the matter of domestic violence and domestic abuse, I want to acknowledge what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said. I agree with him. This is a matter of concern and I repeat what I said earlier in respect of observations made by Deputy Murnane O'Connor that the Garda is very much treating this issue as a priority. The courts are available and open. Access to family law centres-----</p>

          <p eId="para_719">I am sharing time with Deputy Barry and I will make a statement within which there will be a few questions the answers to which I am happy to take in writing.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> We have been raising the question of the treatment of residents in direct provision for a month now and I want to repeat that I believe this Government has failed miserably to protect the rights of our most vulnerable during this Covid-19 crisis. I believe that any examination post Covid will show this to be true. We have gone from 62 cases in nine clusters to 149 in ten clusters. Those figures may have increased. I note in his contribution the Minister did not update us on the figures in direct provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> The inactions in the case of direct provision are abuses of the human rights of people who are seeking protection from war, famine and persecution. We have gone over this previously. Direct provision has been here for 20 years and it has been used almost as a way of deterring people from coming here because of the isolation, humiliation and abuse that they suffer. The Minister said in his contribution that Dr. Catherine Day will produce a report later this year. That will be welcome but I am afraid it will not deal with the urgency of how we deal with Covid-19 in the meantime. We have had multiple warnings, as well as reports and studies that have documented the inadequacy of the direct provision system and although the Minister said that 20% of residents are now in own-door accommodation, that still leaves approximately 6,000 residents living in the direct provision system. What was abusive and inhumane in ordinary times may be shown to be dangerous and possibly even lethal in these pandemic times.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> I was struck by a number of things while reading all the replies to various Deputies who put questions about direct provision. First, the Minister has a constant refrain that this is a health issue, it is the responsibility of the HSE, the social inclusion unit or the management of the centres. It is always somebody else but not the Minister for Justice and Equality. It is a bit like the way we deal with the nursing homes. We contracted out the provision of the care of our most vulnerable to private for-profit companies and then when it goes wrong we say, "It is not our responsibility, nothing to do with us".</p>

        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_279" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T19:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_723">That is not true at all. That is not right. We did not say that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BridSmith" eId="spk_280">
          <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T19:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_724">Somebody in the Minister's Department decided to send applicants from overcrowded conditions to remote hotels, some of them still overcrowded, where they could not socially isolate and where they share bathrooms and shower facilities, communal kitchen and shared meals. Somebody thought it was okay to pack a bus with 120 residents and send them down to Kerry from a centre in Dublin when the centre in Dublin had Covid-19 cases. Testing began on 14 April for residents in Cahersiveen. Four tested positive but it was not until 28 April that a dedicated medically qualified person was appointed to the Skellig centre. During all this time, the Minister and his Department were content to issue statements that everything was being done to ensure the health and safety of residents at all stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">There is a huge disconnect between that reassurance and the reality on the ground. The Government is happy to contract out the responsibility to a private for-profit company called Remcoll Capital - a company with no medical experience, no expertise in public health, and which up until this week had one cleaner with no public health experience cleaning 15 rooms in which Covid-19 infected people were living. Remcoll is not unique, because this system of direct provision is costing the State more than €70 million a year, a significant part of which goes to boost the profits of private companies. We are constantly getting information about the lack of proper condition and poor treatment and nutrition available in direct provision centres. Guidance in an email or on a website is not enough. There has to be enforcement of the conditions in these centres. Where is the enforcement in Cahersiveen and other centres? The Minister is not absolved of the responsibility for the conditions in these centres unless he enforces their proper adherence.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> First, where did the letter given to the residents in Cahersiveen this week emanate from? Second, will the Minister be forcing another lockdown on those residents if they are told they are not doing enough to socially isolate? Third, will he allow them to move out into centres where they will feel safe? At the end of the day, the only way to deal with this inhumane system is to grant asylum to all the direct provision residents. He should grant it to them immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> I will later post a series of photographs on Twitter. I am sure the Minister has heard of "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"; wait until he sees the seven billboards outside Cahersiveen that will condemn him and his Department. I hope he will feel ashamed about it. The social solidarity of the people of Cahersiveen is next to none.</p>

          <p eId="para_728">I too want to ask the Minister questions about the Skellig Star hotel in Cahersiveen. First, I wish to make some brief points about the direct provision system in this Covid-19 crisis in general. There are 7,700 residents in direct provision. As of last Friday - the latest information we have is five days old - 149 of those people had the disease, while there were ten clusters, ten people had been hospitalised, and only 1,600 had been tested. Some 1,700 asylum seekers were sharing rooms with non-family members. In one example in Meath, there were 23 men in seven rooms. The norm is to share washing, food and laundry space. There is talk of congregated settings. What can one do in a hospital or a nursing home? There are alternatives, however, in this situation. The caretaker Government could amend the housing assistance payment legislation to include asylum seekers. God knows there are enough vacant properties available now with the downturn in tourism and the slump in Airbnb bookings. Instead, the Government made a different choice and took a different road. Dr. Eamonn Faller, an infectious disease expert in Cork University Hospital, described it well when writing this week. He nailed it. He said that the Government "maintained the status quo in the knowledge that the current situation of outbreaks and public health endangerment was inevitable". In other words, the Minister and his Government chose to maintain the inhumane direct provision system, and put the maintenance of that system above the health, safety and even the lives of the residents who are forced to live within it. Fiona Finn, chief executive of the migrant group Nasc, nailed it as well when she commented on the material distributed to the Skellig Star hotel by the HSE public health office the other day. She said: "To suggest that the residents are in any way responsible for the continued spread of the virus of the centre is reprehensible and the worst form of victim blaming". I echo that sentiment.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> I want to ask the Minister briefly about two issues. He and the Minister of State when replying to the Irish Refugee Council CEO yesterday denied that residents in that centre are being barred from leaving and stated that the door was effectively left on the latch.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">The door is on the latch. It is also true that gates that were previously locked are now unlocked but is the Minister aware that there is a "Stop" sign on every door out of that centre along with the words "Do not leave - not an exit" and that people, including women, who attempt to go out the doors are told that if they do, action may be taken against them, which the residents interpret as a threat of an increased chance of deportation? I am asking the Minister to comment on that situation, which was reported to me by a resident of the place just before I came in here. Those residents are to be held to a far higher standard than the rest of the population when it comes to quarantine conditions. </p>
          <p eId="para_731"> As for the cleaning regime in the hotel, Deputy Bríd Smith said that up until very recently, there was one cleaner for 15 rooms. The correspondence from the Minister yesterday talked of vacuuming, cleaning, detergent sprays and bleach yet why is it that in a hotel where 25 people have had this disease, there is no deep-clean disinfecting of that building up to the highest possible medical standard? Is it because that would involve closing the place? Why does the Minister not do that or make sure that is done? </p>

          <p eId="para_732">I acknowledge the serious challenge that is direct provision in particular in the context of the current public health situation but I assure all Deputies that improvements are being carried out on a daily basis to ensure the comforts of all of those involved. There are actually 69 residents in Cahersiveen. There is capacity for 150. Anybody who has tested positive was given the opportunity to move to one of the specially designated centres of which there are four, particulars of which I mentioned earlier. Deputy Bríd Smith's comments were repeated by Deputy Barry. We are being accused in the first instance of contracting out or in some way blaming health for guidance yet on the other hand, we are told that we have do not have health expertise. I make no apologies in this House or anywhere else for saying we follow the advice of public health and the HSE. That is what we are doing because we acknowledge they are the ones who provide the expertise but we will continue to provide improved facilities in Cahersiveen and all of the centres. I would be happy to include Deputy Barry in the ongoing process of information of which both Deputies Michael and Danny Healy-Rae are apprised</p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T19:15:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_733">I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about Cahersiveen to the Minister and Minister of State because the first I knew of this, like all the other elected representatives, was on the Monday before the asylum seekers came to Cahersiveen. The Government did open this direct provision centre in Cahersiveen. When it was proved wrong in many other parts of the country last year, it admitted it was wrong and that there should be proper consultation before that happened in any other part of the country. It did this without proper consultation. We have come to know that the HSE, which is responsible for health, did not approve of bringing the refugees to Cahersiveen but nevertheless the Government brought these unfortunate people from a hotel in Dublin where there had been cases of coronavirus. People were not tested before they came to Cahersiveen. It is now believed that at least 24 people, between refugees and people working at the centre, have presented with the virus. Some of the workers have also contracted the virus. For many days when people presented with the virus in the centre, more were in and out of the centre and around the town.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">At that stage, locals started to worry about their own health and avoided the town of Cahersiveen. Many of them are still doing so because they want to protect their own health. They know that the virus has been, or still is, in the hotel. They are not sure if it is still there or not. We have seen the refugees hanging out of windows so they can be seen through a locked gate.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">It is clear that the refugees want to leave Cahersiveen. It is clear that the people of Cahersiveen, the locals of the Iveragh Peninsula, want the centre closed down now. It is now evident that the Skellig Star Hotel is not suitable. The asylum seekers were packed in on top of each other in the first place, with three or so to a room. That is not acceptable. They were told to self-isolate but there is no compulsion on the residents to stay in the hotel and they are out around the town. It is not suitable. The back or side of the premises is not enough for men, women and children for 24 hours a day and seven days a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> I am asking both the Minister and the Minister of State, on behalf of the refugees and the people of Cahersiveen, to close down the centre now. We have seen, in every other instance, that one has to get change-of-use planning permission. The hotel was built as a hotel in the first place but is now being used much differently. Why was change-of-use planning permission not sought? The Government did not seek that permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> I want to give the Minister and the Minister of State the chance to answer. Will they close the centre now or not? They have a minute to answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_743"> The HSE has confirmed to us that there should be no movement into or out of the centre at this time unless directed by public health.

          <p eId="para_746">There are things that I want to ask. The Kerry Dáil representatives had a two hour and 35 minute meeting this week and were told by the management and owners of the premises in question that they were given six days' notice that they were to make a direct provision centre available to the Department. Is that good practice? Is it proper that a direct provision centre would open in Cahersiveen, or anywhere else, without consultation with the people and with local representatives, be they county councillors or Dáil representatives? Is that right? Does the Minister think that is good practice? I do not think it is. There should have been consultation. The people should have been made aware that this was happening. I, as a public representative, was told on a Monday morning that the asylum seekers were coming on the Wednesday. When they came to Kenmare, I was told on a Tuesday that they were coming on the Wednesday. I do not think that is right.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> I am seeking confirmation on the record of the Dáil today. Is it true that people were brought from a Travelodge hotel in Dublin, where there was infection, down the country in a bus, stopping at service stations along the way, all the way to Kerry? These are people who had been exposed to the virus in Dublin. Is that true or is it false? If it is true, it is an awful indictment of the Department of Justice and Equality and it is very wrong. The people in Cahersiveen who I have represented since I went into Kerry County Council in 1999, who I have stood with and who have stood with me, are extremely upset over what has happened. They genuinely are. They have nothing in the world against people seeking asylum in this country but they do not agree with the whole idea of people living in a hotel setting. If these people were to be put into houses in different areas, integrated properly and allowed to live in our communities, we would warmly welcome that. However, if a place is not right, one cannot make it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> I have one very important request to make of the Minister, and I do so on behalf of the people in Kerry. Will he please go on Radio Kerry for a question and answer session? I was on Radio Kerry yesterday and the presenter, Jerry O'Sullivan, said to me that the station has repeatedly asked the Minister to come onto the programme but he has not been available. I am not saying the Minister did or did not say he would go on, because I am not entitled to say that, but I am respectfully asking him to do so now. He owes it to the people in Kerry, and the people in Cahersiveen and the Iveragh Peninsula, to allow them to hear the presenter ask him questions on the record so that he can give clear answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> I want him to answer several questions here today and I will allow him plenty of time to do so. Did he know about the Travelodge Hotel infection, if that is, in fact, true? Does he think it is right that people should be given six days' notice to open a centre? Does he think it right that public representatives are not consulted and that there is no consultation in the greater area to let people know that a premises is going to be changed from an active hotel to a direct provision centre? If the people are not happy in the centre, will the Minister confirm today that he will close it down? I am asking him that question straight. I have asked it of him before and we all know he said "No" to me. I am asking him on the record of the Dáil if he will confirm today that he is going to close down the centre, either very soon or in the very short term, because it is simply not working?</p>

          <p eId="para_750">I am going to continue to deal with this issue, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, officials in my Department and local stakeholders. Indeed, I have spoken to local residents in the area and I am very happy - in fact, I regard it as my duty and obligation - to keep in regular contact with Deputies from the area. I commit towards doing that. I will not comment in any great detail about the level of consultation. We are dealing with a public health emergency. What I will say to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae is exactly what I said to Deputy Catherine Murphy earlier. We did not have any knowledge of the health condition in respect of Covid of anybody being transferred to Cahersiveen or any other area. It was only after their arrival that this news came to light.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> There have been ongoing discussions between my Department and the ownership of the hotel in Cahersiveen as to the suitability or otherwise of the premises. My priority, and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is to make sure every effort is made to ensure those persons who are in residence in Cahersiveen have every support in this time of difficulty. Everybody who tested positive in Cahersiveen was removed within a very short time. There is no one in the Skellig Star Hotel now who is positive. There are 69 residents, including some children, and special efforts are being made to improve matters for the children, with particular reference to recreation, education, toys and other essentials in this time of difficulty.</p>

          <p eId="para_760">Could the Minister respond to my questions within the five minutes allocated to me? Deputy Connolly also has five minutes. As the Minister knows, on 27 March the House gave extraordinary powers to the Minister for Health to introduce regulations. For almost two weeks, people adhered to the medical recommendations without any regulations. They were introduced on 7 April. The Minister was reported in the media as being one of those in favour of them. I am not asking him to comment on that, as it would be inappropriate for him to comment on what happened at Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> The regulations required people to stay in their homes unless they had a reasonable excuse to be out of them. One of the excuses was to carry out essential services or go to an essential retail outlet. That gives a huge amount of power to individual members of An Garda Síochána and is a very difficult position to put those individual members in. It is a power I would not feel comfortable having. I would not want to determine whether it is reasonable that somebody I meet should be out of his or her home. How long does the Minister think it is feasible to continue with these penal provisions? There are penal provisions in the regulations which are quite unusual, but which may be necessary or were necessary at a certain time.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> As a matter of the rule of law, people have to know what the law is so that they can organise and regulate their behaviour in accordance with the law. The law very clearly stated that hardware stores could open. I heard numerous Ministers, who are the highest Government officials in the land, say that hardware stores would be allowed to open from a certain date when the law already stated that hardware stores were allowed to open. That begs questions about the rule of law. If we do not know what the law is, how can we adhere to it? If Ministers are saying that hardware stores can open from a certain date and the law is stating that they are allowed to open as we speak, that creates confusion. Confusion about what is and is not lawful can never be good in a democracy. </p>
          <p eId="para_763"> Broadcasters are saying, with regard to people aged over 70, that they must stay in their homes or may now leave their homes, when there was nothing whatsoever in the law about that. There were medical recommendations from the Chief Medical Officer and NPHET, and I encourage everybody to adhere to them, but I would not tell people that they must do something because people then think they are doing something unlawful. By leaving their homes, people aged over 70 may have been doing something unwise or unhealthy, but they were not doing anything unlawful. For the sake of the rule of law in this democracy, we need clarity. Does the Minister agree with me or does he think it is okay to have such confusion about what is and is not lawful?</p>

        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_303" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">

          <p eId="para_764">I agree with the Deputy that these are exceptional powers in emergency circumstances. Having said that, the regulations are clear in that they require people to remain in their residences unless they have a reasonable excuse to leave them. A reasonable excuse, as the Deputy will be aware, includes going to work in an essential service, going to the shops for essential goods, going to the doctor and taking exercise. People were allowed to exercise within 2 km of their homes, which recently increased to 5 km. There is a strict prohibition on the gathering of persons for any purposes other than a purpose related to reasons for leaving a residence.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> Of course I acknowledge the serious situation and the extensive powers that have been given under the emergency legislation. That is why I was very keen to ensure that there was transparency and balance. There are reports on a weekly basis from the Garda Commissioner and the Policing Authority is publishing reports on a regular basis and is engaging with human rights organisations. </p>
          <p eId="para_766">The Garda at all times is mindful to ensure that it continues to deploy human rights at the core of its operations and its code of ethics. The arrangements are temporary. I am not in a position to say when they will be limited, but it will be on the advice of the public health experts given to the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_768">I thank the Minister for his work regarding direct provision. I have, however, to place on record that it has been reactive. I know it has been difficult because the situation before Covid-19 was inhumane in the first place. I was at the meeting in Oughterard and I know the complexity the Department was facing. It was an inhumane situation, however, and Covid-19 has now brought that into acute focus. We simply have to find a new way.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> Is the Minister aware that direct provision was never once mentioned in any of the NPHET meetings? I went through all of the meeting minutes available for February, March and April and not once was direct provision mentioned. Is the Minister aware of that?</p>

          <p eId="para_770">I am certainly aware that direct provision has been very much the focus of attention at, for example, the vulnerable persons sub-group of NPHET.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2020-05-13T19:35:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_771">I take it from that that the Minister is aware that direct provision did not feature once in the minutes of the NPHET committee, not even once. The Minister can tell me if I am wrong and I will be corrected, but that tells me then that it was not given priority at all by NPHET. Everything has been reactionary, every single step. I thank the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, for their efforts, but it has all been reactive through pressure and through the suffering of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> I welcome the clarification that the Policing Authority is monitoring the legislation. That is absolutely essential. I also welcome that the Minister is getting regular reports from the Garda Commissioner. Is the Minister satisfied that the recording of incidents on PULSE and CAD are up to speed and appropriate? I say that in the context of looking at the two interim reports from the Policing Authority and those reports remind us that the human rights in question are "being willingly...sacrificed by members of the public in order to protect life and human safety but they [human rights] remain the foundation of contemporary society and its legal framework". I was one of those Teachtaí who most reluctantly gave my support to the legislation on the basis that we would have absolutely frank disclosure regarding all aspects of that legislation. I am afraid that has not happened concerning nursing homes, etc. That is not for discussion here, however, so I welcome what the Minister said regarding the Policing Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> I also want to quote where the Policing Authority report stated that it must be ensured that there is a "constant readiness to return to previous policing [activity]". In other words, this legislation is so draconian and unusual that it has to go and we must be ready to let it go as soon as possible. In that context, I am going to ask a question about direct provision centres. When I said they were ignored, I wrote to the HSE and I did not go public. I went through a series of emails and shared my concerns about direct provision. Can the Minister believe that after numerous emails I was told it was a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality, when I was sharing my concerns in respect of health? I thank the Minister for answering me.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> We then got a briefing document on 2 April where we were told that community healthcare organisations, CHOs, were assessing all centres where people were living in congregated settings. Were those assessments carried out for the nine CHOs? When were the assessments carried out and what were the results?</p>

          <p eId="para_775">I will have to get that information for the Deputy. Regarding the emergency powers conferred on the Garda Síochána by this House, however, as far as the Garda is concerned, the operational engagement on its part is to engage with members of the public, to inform members of the public, to encourage members of the public and, as a last resort, to rely on the Covid-19-related regulations made by the Minister for Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> It is clear from the reports published by the Garda Commissioner and the Policing Authority that it is only in a small number of cases that, despite being in receipt of a number of warnings, some individuals have not been in a position to comply.</p>

          <p eId="para_778">My question is specifically in relation to the community health organisations on 2 April. It is now 13 May. Were those assessments carried out, as we were told on 2 April? If so, what was the result and what were the issues? I am particularly conscious I have read an opinion by senior counsel and junior counsel for the Irish Refugee Council and they point out the positive obligations on the State to take appropriate action to protect people's health in many settings but particularly in this. From reading that, we are utterly failing to do that and we discriminated against that vulnerable sector. In that context, I am trying to get some information. Were the assessments carried out?
