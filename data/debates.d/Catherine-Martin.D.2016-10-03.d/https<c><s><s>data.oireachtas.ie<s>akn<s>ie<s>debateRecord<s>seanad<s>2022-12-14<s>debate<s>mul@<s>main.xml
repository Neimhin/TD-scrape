          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from the following Senators that they propose to raise the following matters:</p>
          <p eId="para_2">Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile - The need for the Minister of State with responsibility for sport to provide an update on his engagement with World Athletics to obtain a derogation for the island of Ireland from the World Athletics 1934 boundary rule, which prevents Irish athletes from representing the island of Ireland at European and World Athletics Championships.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">Senator Jerry Buttimer - The need for the Minister for Transport to make a statement on the review of the national aviation policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">Senator Seán Kyne - The need for the Minister for Justice to make a statement on the funding of the Galway Rape Crisis Centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">Senators Lynn Ruane and Alice-Mary Higgins - The need for the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to make a statement on the measures being taken to address the concerns of relatives and relevant persons in respect of the planning application on the former Bessborough mother and baby home estate in County Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">Senator Emer Currie - The need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the registration of Ukrainian doctors so as to make them eligible to practise in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">Senator Robbie Gallagher - The need for the Minister of State with responsibility for disability to provide an update on the removal of transport charges for HSE service users in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 1 area.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">Senator Martin Conway - The need for the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to make a statement on the payment of employer grants under the apprentice grant system when administrative errors have occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">Senator Tim Lombard - The need for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make a statement on his plans for an independent review to assess the effectiveness of the revision of the local government boundary arrangements in Cork, which came into effect in 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Senator Aisling Dolan - The need for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make a statement on the potential roll-out of an online social housing application process, including for Galway County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> Of the matters raised by the Senators suitable for discussion, I have selected Senators Ó Donnghaile, Buttimer, Kyne, Ruane and Higgins, who will share time, Currie and Gallagher and they will be taken now. I regret that I had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Dolan on the ground that the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter. The other Senators may give notice next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_12">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jack Chambers, to the House and thank him for taking the first Commencement matter. I also thank Ilinca Popa in the Seanad Office for all her work in putting Commencement matters together and the Senators who showed great patience in understanding that while we had limited numbers each day, we hopefully managed to help everyone along the way.</p>

          <speech by="#NiallODonnghaile" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T10:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers. He will know from previous engagement that I tend not to read out a whole lot of stuff at Commencement matters, but because of the complexity of this issue, there are some things I want to put on the record and I will, no doubt, use all my time.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> For most of the people of this country, the Good Friday Agreement changed their lives for the better, but there is a group of people who have yet to fully benefit from the agreement in letter and spirit, even though, in a quite specific manner, it relates directly to their circumstances and interests. The group to whom I refer are athletes who live in Ireland and dedicate themselves to their sporting endeavours. The clause of the agreement that specifically relates to this group is the provision that states the Irish and British Governments will exercise their power "with rigorous impartiality on behalf of all of the people in the diversity of their identities and traditions and shall be founded on the principles in full respect for, and equality of, civil, political, [economic,] social and cultural rights, of freedom from discrimination for all citizens and of parity of esteem and of just and equal treatment for the identity, ethos and aspirations of both communities." These are noble and, indeed, worthy aspirations and they form a pillar of the agreement, as does the national identity provision, which recognises the people of the North to identify themselves and be accepted as British or Irish, or both, as they may choose, and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both Irish and British citizenship is accepted by both Governments. The application of these provisions to the athletes of this country would be of immense help in ending almost 90 years of inequality and discrimination practised against them. I refer to the World Athletics 1934 political boundary rule, which actively discriminates against the athletes of this country, North and South, irrespective of their aspirations or background.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> The political boundary rule, which is administered by World Athletics, divides athletics in Ireland. As a result, when Irish athletes go to European and World Championships, they can only represent the Republic of Ireland. A team from Ireland - the nation - is not permitted to compete because of the political boundary rule. It could be said, therefore, that World Athletics is discriminating against the Irish people. It is in breach of the Good Friday Agreement. It deprives Irish athletes of the honour of representing the whole of Ireland at European and World Championships and has done so for 88 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> Let us contrast the impact of this rule on the athletes of this country with the rules governing the Olympic Games. When athletes compete in the Olympic Games, they fall under the authority of the Olympic Federation of Ireland, which represents Ireland the nation. Athletes from all of Ireland's 32 counties participate and are known as "team Ireland". For Olympians, national identity is respected whether it be nationalist or unionist. It is not a barrier or impediment to participation. At the Olympic Games in 2021, there were 31 athletes from the North across 12 sports, seven of whom competed for team GB and 24 for team Ireland. This was possible because there is no political boundary rule in place at the Olympic Games and athletes have a choice in who they represent.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> Choice is crucial to athletes and nobody has the right to deprive them of this fundamental right. World Athletics is depriving athletes of the right to choose to represent Ireland or Britain. It is in breach of the Good Friday Agreement declaration in relation to respecting a person's birthright to be accepted as Irish or British, or both. Friends of Irish Athletics secured cross-party support when it made a presentation to the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport in July 2019. It also secured the support of both the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, representing the Government, and the former Minister for Communities, Ms Deirdre Hargey, MLA, representing the North's Executive. Both are on public record as supporting a derogation of the political boundary rule to allow athletes the opportunity to choose which country they want to represent - Ireland or Britain.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> This problem can be solved by World Athletics granting a derogation for the island of Ireland for the 1934 political boundary rule. A derogation for Ireland does not mean World Athletics has to change its rules. The boundary rule will still exist, but it would simply not apply to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">On 2 June 2022 and 8 December 2020, the Minister of State indicated in the Dáil that he and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, were in support of attaining a derogation for the island of Ireland from the political boundary rule of World Athletics. The Minister of State has worked with the Minister for Communities, Ms Hargey, on this issue before.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> I am seeking an update from the Minister of State on the derogation. I am sure the Seanad supports and would be willing to assist him in any further work that is required.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JackChambers" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Jack Chambers)<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_21">I thank Senator Ó Donnghaile for raising this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> I have met with representatives of the Friends of Irish Athletics, which is the group that has campaigned for a change in World Athletics policy in this area for some time. I have repeatedly indicated my view that athletes and sportspersons from all parts of Ireland should have the choice to represent Ireland at all major international competitions. This position has been conveyed in official discussions with our counterparts in Northern Ireland. It is a shared position between both jurisdictions. Regrettably, the application by World Athletics of this almost 90-year rule continues to split the athletics world in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> Unfortunately, it is also the case that this ongoing issue is affecting the pursuit and development of broader sports policy objectives for the benefit of all sports, including the great sport of athletics that has provided us all with some wonderful sporting memories over the years. However, it must be accepted that responsibility for the rule in question, including the possibility of its potential abolition, rests solely with the international federation concerned, World Athletics, which is an independent autonomous organisation. A derogation from the rule concerned would confer additional flexibility of representation on the athletes concerned. I have made my position in this regard known to World Athletics.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> As a consequence of my inquiries, World Athletics has provided a number of important and notable clarifications that affirm the key roles of Athletics Ireland and their counterpart, UK Athletics, in all such membership issues. World Athletics has confirmed that, from a governance standpoint, any membership change or amendment on the territorial jurisdiction for the sport of athletics is ultimately a matter for determination by the world athletic authorities. World Athletics has in particular emphasised the relevance of its transfer-of-allegiance regulations, which govern the ability of all athletes from anywhere in the world to change their allegiance to represent a country internationally. I am arranging to forward a copy of these regulations to the Senator.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> Although neither l nor my Department have any role in the establishment or application of the regulations, there are a number of important aspects that may offer scope for progress. First, the regulations set out that where an athlete has never represented a member at the international level, they are free to choose their chosen country without an application or other procedure to be followed. This provision also applies for athletes that have dual nationality. Second, where an athlete has represented a member and wishes to change their allegiance, it is the case that such athletes do need to apply for approval. Each application is assessed by a panel from the athletic authorities, which has scope to waive requirements of the rules if the facts and merits of an individual application merit such a waiver.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> As the Senator is no doubt aware, this matter has been ongoing for a considerable period. The path to a resolution continues to remain elusive. The State's capacity to intervene in the matter is limited. The focus of further efforts must lie in fostering a dialogue between the parties concerned. In the interests of fostering such a dialogue, I have asked officials from Sport Ireland to liaise with Athletics Ireland. I have also asked Sport Ireland to consider the options available in the context of taking the matter further. I would be interested in hearing the Senator's perspective, specifically any new arguments he might put forward that could be marshalled in support of this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> I share the Senator's objectives. I would like to see progress on this matter. I have reflected that directly to Seb Coe, the head of World Athletics. I want to see this matter advanced. Obviously, a direct change is out of our hands. However, we are happy to engage and work with the Senator on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_29"> I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has reasserted his support for resolving this issue. That is really important. If Irish sport teaches us anything, it is that Ireland works best when we work together and the country works as one whether that is in terms of our boxers, Gaelic football teams, Olympians and sportspeople right across the board. What we need to continue to do, particularly as we head into the Christmas and new year period, and the change in roles within the Government, is ensure that this matter does not go off the boil. Therefore, we need to marshal the sporting organisations, the friends of Irish athletics and build upon the political unanimity that there is across these Houses in support of ensuring that this matter is resolved. At the heart of this matter is the Good Friday Agreement. It is the issue of fundamental respect for people's identities and aspirations and in so doing ultimately achieving better outcomes for Irish athletes and Irish sports going forward. We should all work diligently and hard to ensure that that is the outcome.</p>

We will continue to engage at our level to reflect both our position and the broad cross-party consensus across the Houses on this matter to which the Senator referred. I will keep at it. We will continue to engage in order to get the governing bodies from Athletics Ireland and UK Athletics to work together to see whether there is a possibility of resolving this matter at an international level.

            <p eId="para_33">I thank the Minister of State for being here. This matter is redundant because neither the Minister for Transport nor his Minister of State is present. I appreciate that they have schedules and business to attend to but I tabled a Commencement matter on the review of the national aviation strategy. I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, in his previous capacity as a Minister of State at the then Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, would have a knowledge of tourism. However, he never held a transport brief within that Department. That is a matter for another day, however.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> The review of the aviation strategy is important because ours is an island nation. I appreciate that the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, which is chaired by Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, has started a process in this regard. The review is about regional airports. It is about the need for Cork Airport and Shannon Airport to continue to qualify for funding from the regional airports programme. The review is about ensuring that the connectivity in the short-haul fleet is enhanced in order that we can continue to have an open economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> I had hoped to have a dialogue with the Ministers from the Department of Transport, particularly because I am of the view that regional airports must be at the heart of the aviation strategy. Everything cannot go through from Dublin Airport. It will come as no surprise that I will take this opportunity promulgate the importance of Cork Airport. Because Cork Airport is Ireland's second busiest airport, it is important that it is at the heart of the national aviation strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> Ireland is an island nation on the western edge of Europe. We need the aviation sector. It is critical to us. We are very lucky to have Ryanair. We also have Aer Lingus, which, on foot of an admission made to me this morning at a meeting of the joint committee, has reduced its short-haul fleet due to Covid. However, as we all know, we have emerged from Covid and are in a recovery phase in aviation. With that comes the matter of sustainability in terms of aviation fuel, which is an issue that also needs to be addressed as part of our aviation review policy. It is important that we have an aviation policy that reflects the regions and that, as a result, reflects the importance of Cork and Shannon airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> I appreciate that the Minister of State has come before the House. I could talk for my remaining four minutes, but I am not going to because, in fairness, the Minister of State does not hold a brief in the Department of Transport.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">On the wider point regarding Ministers coming before the House, while I do not want to be presumptuous, if there was a revision of the scheduling of ministerial engagements with Seanad Éireann after Christmas, that would be very helpful. As Senator Kyne will know from previous experience, in many instances we are being asked to give responses, through no fault of our own and no fault of the Minister responsible, on policy issues or difficulties with which we are not familiar. Maybe a schedule could be prepared so that Ministers would know a couple of weeks in advance when they are due to appear before the Seanad. In that way, some people who might feel that they will get a nose bleed if they came here would be more inclined not to say they have diary commitments that prevent them from coming to this Chamber. It has always been a pleasure for me to come in here and I have always been very warmly received.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> Now I will get on with the business in hand. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, attended the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications to discuss this issue last week. During that discussion they set out some of the objectives of the review of our national aviation policy and issues that will require consideration. The existing policy was first published in 2015 and its progress was reviewed twice, most recently in 2019. The development of that policy was thorough and launched in December 2012. It involved significant consultation and consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> Ireland's location, with no land connection to our international neighbours, serves only to highlight the importance of aviation. As such, a dynamic and forward-thinking policy is key to Ireland retaining its competitive position in the European Union. In her recent address to Dáil Éireann, the President of the European Commission, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, remarked that Ireland is a success story of the European Union and our aviation sector has played an important role in that success. Aviation is a generator of high-quality direct employment and also serves as a driver in the creation of employment in other sectors of our economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> Our existing policy had the principal goals of enhancing Ireland's connectivity, fostering growth in enterprise and maximising the contribution of aviation to Ireland's sustainable economic growth and development. Having said that, it is evident that the world and the whole aviation sector have changed considerably in the short time since 2015, with Covid-19 emerging in early 2020. It is because of Covid-19 that work on the review of our national aviation policy was stalled, with officials in the Department of Transport instead refocusing on addressing the impact of the pandemic. Outside of Covid-19 impacts, an area that will require significant consideration is that of the environmental impacts of air connectivity. Between the introduction of our existing policy and now, there has been significant focus on climate impacts and decarbonisation of the aviation sector which will need to be reflected appropriately in any policy review.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> At a European level, work is progressing on ambitious legislative proposals which will place obligations on airlines to incorporate mandated levels of sustainable aviation fuel into their supply chains and to strengthen their engagement in the emissions trading scheme, ETS. The need to secure the decarbonisation of the industry while also ensuring our connectivity is not negatively impacted is the primary challenge we face going forward. Recovery in aviation is well under way and it is time to refocus attention on the review of our national aviation policy and deliver connectivity between Ireland and the rest of the world in a more sustainable way.</p>

            <p eId="para_47">The Minister of State has made a good point regarding a revision of the scheduling.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> I thank him for the reply. Comprehensive work on our aviation policy is required. It is critical that we build on the success of our aviation sector to date because aviation plays such an important role for us. It enhances connectivity which leads to job creation and economic development. The Minister of State was correct in his off-script remark that Shannon and Cork airports are important. Everything cannot go through Dublin Airport and everything cannot be about Dublin. It cannot just be the hub airport; we must develop our regional airports.. </p>
            <p eId="para_49"> The final point I would make is that the inclusion of airports like Cork in any consideration of airport funding is critical. It is within the Government's gift to support the airports at both Cork and Shannon. As we all know, money talks. It helps to build connectivity and routes, increase development and attract investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">As I mentioned to my good colleague from Cork, I flew from Cork Airport recently and found the experience to be really good. It is a fabulous airport which I have used on many occasions, as have an awful lot of people in the wider Munster area. It is not just a Cork thing. In saying that, I mentioned Shannon Airport, which is very close to me although the closest airport to my home is Farranfore Airport in Kerry. It also plays a very important role in the development of tourism in the south west and in enhancing connectivity from an economic point of view.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> I compliment the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications. Often when I am locked away in my office on campus, I tune in to the proceedings of Oireachtas committees and I must say that the engagement the transport committee has had with the various stakeholders, particularly the airlines that service Ireland or those that should service Ireland more, has been very comprehensive. There are problems at a statutory level and at a governance level. Indeed, there are problems all over the place but there is also an ambition, particularly on the part of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, who is from the west and understands the importance of connectivity, to make sure we are not left in the situation feared by Senator Buttimer. From a Munster point of view, we have a very comprehensive network of airports, all of which have a sustainable and bright future in the context of a new, sustainable aviation policy. I will relay Senator Buttimer's remarks to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">I thank the Cathaoirleach's office for choosing this Commencement matter. I agree with Senator Buttimer regarding the lack of availability of the line Ministers for Commencement debates in general. That said, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, who is always very amenable to coming before this House. Any time I have raised issues related to his area of responsibility, he has been here.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> It goes without saying that the rape crisis centres nationwide do invaluable work. They are hugely important and while we all wish there was no need for them, unfortunately there is such a need and there will be in future as well. Galway Rape Crisis Centre is the second largest rape crisis centre in the country. At present it has a waiting list of 86 people and it has requested extra funding from Tusla. That funding is needed both to enhance services and to maintain the current level of services being provided. The centre provides extra clinical hours on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings, with counsellors working until 9 p.m. Since November 2020, the centre has run a Saturday clinic, with two counsellors seeing clients, but without the extra funding requested, it will no longer be able to provide the Saturday clinic or the extra midweek counselling hours that have been provided throughout the year. </p>
            <p eId="para_57"> On the current waiting list, there are 23 adolescents and two adolescent supporters. The centre covers the geographical area of Galway city and county, north Clare, south Mayo and Roscommon but anybody who has experienced sexual trauma or abuse can present to the rape crisis centre. There are two universities in Galway, the National University of Ireland at Galway, NUIG and the Atlantic Technological University, ATU, which are attended by thousands of people from the region and from across the country. In effect, Galway Rape Crisis Centre is seeing people from every corner of this country. Obviously, clients from the universities add significantly to the workload and waiting times at the centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> From January to October of this year, the Galway Rape Crisis Centre offered 4,375 counselling appointments. It offered 4,727 such appointments in the whole of 2021. From January to October 2021, it offered 3,687 counselling appointments which means that in the same period in 2022, the centre offered an extra 688 appointments. Despite this, the centre still has a significant waiting list. It is possible that such figures are replicated in other parts of the country. Clearly the need is there and the invaluable work the rape crisis centres do is evident. The waiting list is a statistic in its own right. The Galway Rape Crisis Centre also plays an invaluable role in the city's two universities.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> The additional funding that is required is pivotal to the future of Galway Rape Crisis Centre. Without it, the centre will have to turn to the public and engage in fundraising. While fundraising is an important source of income, the cost-of-living crisis is putting pressure on households and limiting people's ability to give generously to the most worthy of causes, including the rape crisis centres. I am hoping the Minister of State, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, will provide additional funding to allow the centre to maintain and enhance its existing service provision in order to provide the support that is so needed by women and men across Galway city and county and the wider area.</p>

          <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_19" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Patrick O'Donovan<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_60">I thank Senator Kyne for raising such an important issue. The statistics he raises are quite shocking. They are also quite enlightening and make us all sit up and pay attention to the scale of the problem the Senator has raised. On behalf of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, I fully acknowledge the vital work undertaken by Galway Rape Crisis Centre, by all rape crisis centres and by anybody who works with victims of sexual violence. The service that the centre provides to victims of domestic and sexual violence is recognised and appreciated, as is the service provided by all of our NGO partners who work with and advocate for victims and survivors of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. I would like to start by thanking them for the work they do.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> We know that the demands on services have increased over the past two years, as the Senator has outlined, and we know that costs have risen. This is not just true for Galway Rape Crisis Centre, but for most of the front-line service providers we engage with. As the Senator mentioned, Zero Tolerance, the new national strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, was launched earlier this year. It is an ambitious five-year programme of reform, a whole-of-society plan of action. Implementation is a whole-of-government priority, backed up by a substantial funding commitment under budget 2023.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> The total allocated to Tusla for funding domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services is now at €37 million, representing an extra €9 million, or a 22% increase, in funding for 2023. This record allocation is representative of our commitment to continue working with our NGO partners to deliver on commitments made in the third national strategy. The extra €9 million provided includes increased funding of €6.8 million for organisations funded by Tusla, which is being made available through a targeted funding call. Some €6.8 million will be used to maintain existing services, to address existing acute demands and costs and for the enhancement and development of new services. There will be an emphasis on supporting projects to address geographic need, on those with additional vulnerabilities or complex needs, and on supports for young people who have experienced sexual violence. Senator Kyne referred to the two universities in Galway, which was an appropriate comment to make in that context. Some €900,000 will be specifically made available for sexual violence services to meet the needs of younger people and to address geographical gaps in provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> I fully appreciate that security of funding is of key importance to front-line service providers. We are looking to offer multiannual funding commitments to the NGOs. This will promote more sustainable service delivery and planning to cover areas such as court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews and to sexual assault treatment units, emotional support, counselling and referral to other services. The introduction of standardised multiannual funding structures is something we will be examining under the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> Separate to the funding of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services, the Department of Justice has allocated €6.1 million for other measures to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, including through awareness-raising campaigns and funding for perpetrator programmes. The Department of Justice has allocated a further €5.8 million to promote and assist the development of specific support services for victims of crime within the criminal justice system, including victims of domestic and sexual crime. These services provide important information and supports including emotional support, accompaniment to Garda interviews, to sexual assault treatment units and to court, as well as referral to other services.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> On behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, I assure the Senator that we will continue to work closely with the sector as we progress the implementation of the third national strategy and realise the actions aimed at combating all forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and at ensuring that victims and survivors have the full range of supports they need. I will bring the specific issues the Senator has raised with regard to Galway to the attention of the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and Humphreys.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive response on behalf of the Department. Certainly when I was putting down this Commencement matter I knew that the functions were split between Tusla, which is under the Department of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Department of Justice. That creates a little bit of confusion. The Minister of State highlighted the delivery of the rape crisis centres covering areas such as court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews and to sexual assault treatment units, emotional support, counselling and referral to other services. There is a very hands-on approach that the rape crisis centres provide for victims of rape and sexual assault. It is extremely important work of support for victims. That is what this funding is about, to ensure the supports are continuously provided over the course of this year and into the future. I would welcome engagement from the Minister of State and will certainly follow up with the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and Humphreys on support for Galway Rape Crisis Centre.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">I will refer the Senator's comments to both Ministers concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> Without being in any way disrespectful to the issues he and others have raised here, I wish to raise the more fundamental issue of how he as a Senator is able to engage with the line Minister who has responsibility for policy. I do not disagree with anything the Senator has raised here but I am sure there are other moving parts within the Department that I am not aware of in this context. A suggestion I have made to Senator Buttimer already this morning is that the House might look at some sort of scheduling mechanism in order for it to be of value to Senators to raise matters on behalf of their constituents or policy-related matters. I am thinking of a provision whereby if a Minister gets advance notice of maybe a week or ten days, they or someone from their Department must be made available to the Seanad on that day. If there were five or six people who wanted to raise different issues in a fixed period to that Minister on that day, almost like a live mic or Question Time, it would be far more beneficial than having somebody like myself giving a scripted answer without the policy knowledge needed for a comprehensive level of engagement. As Senator Kyne has been in this position, I know he understands the point. I would not suggest anything to the Upper House as to how it should run its affairs. I have always enjoyed my engagement here. It is far more productive than the Dáil, to be quite honest. I have had many a good sword-fight with Senator Higgins. I think something needs to change in this regard. It is not fair to the scale of the problems individuals are raising, and nor is it fair to the Government Departments that want to get a message out.</p>

            <p eId="para_71">As the Minister of State will be aware, a new planning application was recently lodged for an apartment scheme on the former Bessborough mother and baby home site in Cork city. This application is one of a number of live planning applications for developments across this estate. This recently lodged application for a 92-unit scheme was lodged by the same developer who had previously been refused planning permission from An Bord Pleanála following an oral hearing in 2021. The refusal at that time was because the board was not satisfied that the site was not previously used as and does not contain a children's burial ground and considered that there were reasonable concerns in respect of the potential for a children's burial ground within the site associated with the former use of the lands as a mother and baby home from 1922 to 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> The Cork Survivors and Supporters Alliance, CSSA, led objections to the previous proposal and has suggested that no development permission should be granted until the areas marked out in historic maps as children's burial sites have been under public ownership and have been managed as a public cemetery. Senator Ruane and I agree. This has not yet occurred. While this application relates to separate parts of the site, the CSSA has concerns about the fact that there seems to be a potential dispersal of human remains throughout the Bessborough site. It emerged in the 2021 An Bord Pleanála oral hearing that topsoil from the land had also been disturbed. The site in question partially surrounds an enclosure that surrounds a folly and a graveyard. This creates particular vulnerabilities around that site. The developer has claimed that there is no basis to suggest the proposed development site contains a burial ground, despite the fact that the commission of investigation concluded that it is highly likely that burials took place on the grounds of Bessborough. </p>
            <p eId="para_73">The Minister will be aware of the mortality rates in Bessborough. They are shocking, even when compared to the mortality rates in other mother and baby homes across the country. A huge percentage of children in care there died. We know of 923 children who are understood to have died in care of Bessborough, even though only 64 burial records have been located. This means there are at least 859 children whose burial places were not recorded.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> The commission of investigation referred to the highly likely fact that those burials took place within the grounds of Bessborough. The commission has also said the only way this could be established is by a systematic excavation of the property. The Minister, however, has advised that there are no plans to establish an office of authorised intervention in respect of an excavation, as is planned in the case of Tuam, due to the difficulty in identifying the specific burial places of children. This decision has caused a great deal of disappointment and hurt for survivors and relatives, who believed, in good faith, that the Institutional Burials Act 2022 would have brought closure and justice. </p>
            <p eId="para_75"> I must express disappointment because during the process of the scrutiny and passing of this Act, our group tabled several amendments specifically concerning Bessborough to ensure it would be covered. We were told those amendments were not necessary, yet after the Act was passed we were told that, in fact, Bessborough would not be covered or included. The Minister of State will be aware that we have a Bill on the Order Paper now to amend the criteria in respect of burial grounds and the Institutional Burials Act to ensure situations such as Bessborough would be covered. The crucial issue is what actions the Government and the Minister plan to undertake. He previously intervened in making observations on planning applications, but we are concerned about what methods exist to ensure that the rights of those affected are reflected and that we do not see inappropriate development on this site.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Anne Rabbitte)<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_76">I thank the Senator for raising this matter. I am taking this on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. We are conscious that the uncertainty regarding the burial place of many children who were resident at the former mother and baby institution in Bessborough is difficult for the families concerned. The investigation of burial arrangements in mother and baby institutions, including Bessborough, was an important part of the work of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> Regarding Bessborough, the commission concluded it is likely that some of the children who died at the institution are buried in the grounds but, despite extensive investigation, it was unable to find any physical or documentary evidence of this. The Government's response to the legacy of these institutions is set out in the Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby Home and County Home Institutions, which was published last November. Action 22 of the plan commits the Government to advancing the burials legislation to support intervention at the institutional sites where manifestly inappropriate burials have been discovered. It also commits to encouraging local authorities to provide protections within development plan processes for burials sites in their areas that may be linked to former mother and baby or county homes. I can confirm that, in line with the commitments in the action plan, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has written to all city and county councils requesting that development plan processes give adequate consideration to incorporating appropriate measures to ensure the protection of unrecorded burial sites associated with an institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> The circular also notes that local authorities, acting as planning authorities, may attach conditions to potential development as appropriate in the circumstances. The Minister has also established a working group of departmental and local authority officials to consider issues at local level in relation to memorialisation, including memorialisation of known burial sites. Proposed developments in the grounds of Bessborough are a matter for the relevant planning authorities, Cork City Council in this instance. The Minister, Deputy O' Gorman, has previously emphasised that any proposed development should give adequate consideration to the views of survivors and families members and the potential need for further investigations relating to works commencing on the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> The recent communication to local authorities from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage further emphasises this point. Should manifestly inappropriate burials be discovered at the Bessborough site, the Institutional Burials Act, which the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, commenced in July this year, provides an underlying legislative basis for an excavation, recovery and reburial of the remains. The legislation was developed in response to the abhorrent situation at the site of the former mother and baby institution in Tuam, County Galway, where it was confirmed that the remains of children had been discovered that were interred in a manifestly inappropriate manner and the Government was advised that a full forensic-standard excavation, recovery and identification of those remains could not take place under current legislation. To avoid delays in responding to any similar situations that may arise in the future, the Institutional Burials Act is not site-specific and also allows for interventions at other sites should manifestly inappropriate burials be discovered. In the case of Bessborough, the location of burials is, sadly, unknown.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AliceMaryHiggins" eId="spk_26">
            <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_80">The Institutional Burials Act failed Bessborough. We talk about general provisions but we are also talking about specific sites. Bessborough was known to be one of the areas where concerns have been raised about inappropriate burials and where we have more than 800 children unaccounted for. These children are known to be dead but are unaccounted for. Choices were made in this regard. During the debate on the legislation, we were assured that Bessborough would be covered and that there was no need for amendments. In fact, we have now been told that it is not covered. This is a fact. The Act made choices and this is why we have proposed a Bill to amend the Institutional Burials Act 2022 in order that the director of authorised intervention would be empowered to engage in cases where there may not be precise burial sites identified but where inappropriate burials are highly likely to have taken place.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> With respect, to simply prove this to local authorities in a general sense is not adequate. We know that if these developments are allowed to take place then the opportunity for intervention will be lost. It may well be that the burials were not systematic, because the fact that they were not recorded is a part of the disrespect in this regard. It is important, however, that there are interventions at this point. It is not adequate to simply talk about development plans in the abstract when we have a real travesty in the case of Bessborough that the State should step up to address. What formal processes has the Department in mind to tease out the complexities of Bessborough? I recognise that a range of survivors have wishes. Those who wish to see memorialisation certainly do not wish to see inappropriate development nor do those who wish to see excavation of the burial places of their relatives.</p>

            <p eId="para_82">I thank the Senator. In her opening remarks, I think she said there was a live application and that this has gone in. In the remarks I delivered on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, he has been clear about what he has done. He has engaged with all the local authorities and made it clear to them what he has set out. Without complete and utter interference, he has been clear about what is laid out in the context of the local authorities. While this is a live application, I assume that the planner looking at it, whomever it is, will also be alert to what came into being when the Act commenced in July 2022 bears relevance to the Bessborough site, as it does to other sites as well. In fairness to the Minister, he has engaged with the local authorities. We can see as well how various other Ministers have written to the local authorities. I ask again that the officials in the local authorities read that circular and be familiar with it when they are making decisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">I thank the Minister of State for taking this Commencement matter. Not a week goes by now without us, as public representatives, hearing about shortages of GPs and the pressures on them. This is especially acute in areas where there are high numbers of Ukrainian people in crisis accommodation. We are all very aware of the unwelcome and unsavoury agitation by far-right individuals in communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">It makes sense that we respond to the shortages. More importantly, we must give an opportunity to Ukrainian people to be able to access Ukrainian doctors who understand the trauma they have experienced and understand what it is like to flee a war zone. It would also enable professional qualified doctors to work if they want. Work gives people purpose. It is an occupation. At the same time, we would never pressure anyone to do it given their experiences.</p>
            <p eId="para_85"> I am told there are approximately 400 doctors here from Ukraine. As non-EU doctors they need to pass an exam to show proficiency in medical English and they need to pass the Professional and Linguistic Assessments Board, PLAB exam. This is the clinical test that must be passed to register with the Medical Council. Normally non-EU doctors do these exams before they come to Ireland. Of course, Ukrainian doctors have not had this opportunity. It can take two years to access these exams. The Medical Council has not fully adapted to this situation and the urgency and opportunity we face. A company runs the PLAB for the Medical Council. The exams take place twice at year. I am told there is no availability until November 2023. This is not a good situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> Meanwhile, doctors are ready and desperate to work. They want to help. They want to be part of our front line to help Ukrainian people. I call on the Minister for Health to intervene and arrange emergency PLAB exams. The doctors can study for the English exams at the same time. I am told that 10% of the doctors can speak fluent medical English while others cannot. The supports are there if we match them to people to get this proficiency. The HSE is providing materials.</p>
            <p eId="para_87"> There is significant goodwill to support these doctors. I commend hospitals such as St. Vincent's, which have been running observerships. They take groups of 20 Ukrainian doctors for two weeks and allow them clinical oversight to see the procedures and methods used in Irish hospitals. This is bridging the gap proactively. This is what we need to see. We need intervention. The response of the Medical Council is detached from the reality of the war. Quite simply we need Ukrainian doctors for Ukrainian people.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">I thank the Senator for giving me, on behalf of the Minister for Health, the opportunity to inform the House on the progress made to date in assisting doctors arriving from Ukraine to gain registration and employment in Ireland. She has raised a valuable issue. The Department of Health has been working closely with colleagues in the six health profession regulators to examine ways to support all Ukrainian health practitioners arriving in the State. The regulators fully recognise the importance of assisting these practitioners and have been actively examining the measures that might need to be taken to support them to join their registers where possible and to gain employment in the health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> As the Senator will be aware, the Medical Council is the statutory agency responsible for the registration and regulation of doctors in Ireland. It is committed to supporting doctors arriving from Ukraine seeking to work in this jurisdiction. The Medical Council has established an internal working group to examine ways in which it can support these doctors. It has met the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland and it has a dedicated email address and web page with information for Ukrainian doctors. The HSE has also been heavily engaged in this and is working on providing employment pathways for those with health care qualifications and experience. The HSE is exploring the possibility of observer roles in clinical areas while doctors are awaiting full registration and is working closely with the Medical Council in this regard. To be fair, the Senator addressed this and acknowledged that it is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_90"> The HSE has a web portal open to Ukrainian practitioners who wish to register their interest in working in healthcare and it communicates regularly to inform them of updates on their profession. The Department meets on a regular basis with the HSE and health regulators to exchange updates and to address any issue arising in respect of Ukrainian doctors. In the course of this work, it has become clear that medical English language training is particularly required to assist many of the applicants to meet the standards necessary for registration with the Medical Council. I am pleased to inform the House that last week the Minister for Health approved a funding package for medical English language training to assist Ukrainian doctors and dentists in gaining registration here.</p>
            <p eId="para_91"> The medical language training package, designed in association with the HSE, consists of a language assessment and needs analysis followed by one of three subsequent training pathways. The HSE is finalising the application and operational details and will communicate shortly with Ukrainian practitioners, in conjunction with the regulators and the Ukrainian Embassy. Further funding will be made available to support Ukrainian healthcare professionals to meet additional costs that may be associated with achieving recognition and that may be outside the control of the regulators, such as professional competence exams. These supports will ensure that practitioners will not be precluded from registering because of financial barriers. These measures, when they come on stream early next year, will significantly boost the ability of Ukrainian doctors to gain registration.</p>
            <p eId="para_92"> I genuinely believe there is a brilliant opportunity here for the HSE. It is taking the proper steps and measures and putting them in place. the Senator mentioned 400 clinicians to which we would have access. The health services is on its knees needing people. That needs to happen at pace. I hear what the Senator said. Some of these doctors are proficient. Let them sit the language test and give them a clear pathway to do the exams. We see from the HSE portal that accessing employment takes approximately 38 other processes. It could take another 12 months. We need to ask the Minister, and after I leave here I will ask, how we can expedite the experience we have captured in this country not only for the benefit of Irish people but for the benefit of other Ukrainians in a similar position.</p>

            <p eId="para_93">I thank the Minister of State. She knows full well about some of the barriers in the HSE with connecting qualified people to positions. This is why I am raising the issue. I am aware of what is happening with language support, which is positive. We have to look at the costs. I have raised practical issues. All of this information is great. The Minister of State and I know that when it comes to the HSE it is difficult to get it to remove the practical barriers. Not having access to the PLAB exam until November 2023 is a practical barrier that could be easily removed. Emergency PLAB exams could be held in Ireland for Ukrainian doctors. This is a solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_94"> Ukrainian healthcare workers are not breaking through in the HSE. The posts are there. They are applying for them but they are not getting them. This is why I am raising the issue. We need a bridge between Ukrainian clinical professionals, whether they are healthcare assistants or doctors, and the positions in communities. The reply of the Minister of State is great and language supports are fantastic but the practical issues always hold us up. There reality is that there is a war. The Medical Council and the HSE need to address these issues with pace, as the Minister of State has said, and with urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_95">I absolutely agree with the Senator. There are practical issues involved. Not having a PLAB examination until November 2023 is not acceptable, to be quite honest. I will take that point with me when I leave the Chamber. I acknowledge and commend the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, for ensuring that where English has been a barrier for some of the UK citizens who have arrived here, funding and space has been made available. That is welcome. However, there is a cohort of people who would be ready to hit the ground running if they were allowed the opportunity to sit that examination. It is less than a year since Ukrainians arrived in Kiltormer and there was an endocrinologist among them. Ballinasloe is just up the road and Galway is on the other side. There is a rich availability of talent that the HSE would be unable to recruit if it had three years to do so. We do not want to lose that talent. We have a dearth of talent across the board. We have a war on two fronts. There is the Ukrainian war and there is also a war to keep our health services ticking over. I will talk to the Minister about that issue. I will also write to the Medical Council of Ireland to see if the matter can be expedited. This is an exceptional circumstance that requires an exceptional intervention. There could be many winners.</p>

            <p eId="para_99">I will have the Minister of State out of the Chamber before lunchtime. Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach. She is welcome back to the House. I am seeking an update regarding the transport charge that is being levied on service users who are attending HSE day services in community healthcare organisation 1, CHO 1, which includes counties Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. As the Minister of State knows well, disability is strongly associated with poverty. People with disabilities are twice as likely to be unable to afford to heat their homes, for example. Previously, I quoted the study compiled by Indecon on behalf of the Department of Social Protection that found the cost of having a disability is estimated at between €9,482 and €11,734 extra per year, on top of everyday expenses. Households that include people with a disability have to spend more not only on daily living costs but also on transport, therapeutic equipment, medical expenses, domestic services, equipment aids and appliances, to list but a few. With the cost-of-living issues and increasing inflation, the challenges are more acute. It is serious when extra charges are levied on families of persons with a disability and it is worse when the charge is levied in one area and not in others. CHO 1 is currently the only area in the country where charges are being levied.</p>
            <p eId="para_100"> As I raised previously, the transport charge has been applied to service users who are attending HSE day services at a cost of €4 per trip or €20 per week in the CHO 1 area. That amounts to a total of €960 per annum for a person with a disability. I am aware of a number of families with two persons with disabilities, which means transport costs of almost €2,000 per annum, which is a huge amount of money. It would be heartbreaking if families were to lose out or suffer a reduced level of service because of these costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_101"> As the Minister of State knows, the charges have been levied because the routes involved are deemed to be closed routes or exclusive routes. People who are using an open route can use their free travel passes, for example on Bus Éireann services. Unfortunately, that does not apply to this particular service. The problem with the CHO 1 area is that the routes are deemed to be closed routes. The service is top class but, unfortunately, many families simply cannot afford it.</p>
            <p eId="para_102"> I fully accept that the HSE decision to charge is to ensure there will be a service in the first place. However, by introducing this charge to ensure that no one loses out on a service, the HSE has created an inequality in the CHO 1 area. That is unfair on the people of Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.</p>
            <p eId="para_103"> When the Minister of State and I previously spoke about this issue, she mentioned that she had taken over the chairmanship of the transport committee, which I had no doubt was a positive development. Knowing the Minister of State as I do, I do not doubt that she will apply a bit of common sense and joined-up thinking in respect of how to address issues such as the one we are discussing this morning. I eagerly await her response about progress on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">There is nothing like a transport issue affecting healthcare and disability matters as we head into Christmas. I thank the Senator for raising this matter, which he has raised and advocated for on numerous occasions. I have been provided with a script but I am better without one for this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_105"> It is the case that CHO 1 charges. That charging mechanism was introduced to ensure all people in CHO 1 could have access to services. That service is being provided but we are now facing a cost-of-living crisis. As the Senator quite rightly said, the cost to individuals is almost €1,000. That has been shown to be an inequality. In other parts of the country, we provide transport for people to attend day services without any charge. The Senator is right that I took up the chairmanship of the transport committee and met all stakeholders and Departments around the issue. We discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> the open routes model that has been piloted in Leitrim and which has been incredibly successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_106"> Officials from the Department of Health will be meeting officials from the Department of Transport in the new year to discuss the potential around expanding the open routes project to other areas, including other areas in CHO 1. Routes may move from closed routes to open routes, which will mean there will be no charge for the people who need to access services.</p>
            <p eId="para_107"> The Senator and I live in the real world. He knows how long that will take to get over the line. However, that is the direction of travel. There is an inequality but a fantastic model has been developed in Leitrim and it can be extended. I have met with the operators of fantastic Local Link services in CHO 1. I see how well that is working in Donegal and Sligo. The system is working very well. At the same time, some people in those areas are being charged almost €1,000 per year while people in Galway are not being charged a single euro. That is inequality and with my functions due to transfer to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which was approved at Cabinet yesterday, I will find it difficult to charge people with a disability to use bus services while others are not being charged. It is my ambition, working with my adviser, that from January onwards, the open route system will be expanded and services will be brought to the people of CHO 1 on the same basis that services are brought to all others.</p>
            <p eId="para_108"> It is also important to say that the Department of Health spends in excess of €50 million per year on transport and yet it states it spends no money on transport. Some 90% of the cost of the route in CHO 1 is being provided. Only that 10% shortfall remains. It is incumbent on the Government, the Department of Transport and the providers to respond. The HSE is the main provider. It is not as if we have other providers in CHO 1. The HSE is the provider. It is incumbent on me, as a Minister of State, to ensure funding is found in the next round of budget allocations to ensure that the service can be optimised and that the service users are fully supported, no different from those in other parts of the country. We first need to find that extra 10%. The second piece is to expand the open routes model. The Department of Transport also has a role to play. The same situation should pertain in Donegal and in Wexford. There is a considerable issue in respect of transport in Wexford. We need to ensure that all disability service users have the right and option to access services without a charge and without the fear of losing that service. The service must be regular and consistent. I look forward to working with the Senator in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_109">I welcome the response of the Minister of State and thank her for the work she has done to try to progress this matter. The word "inequality" keeps popping up. All we are looking for is fairness and a level playing field for the people of Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. We want those people with disabilities to be treated no differently from anyone in any other part of the country. That is all we are looking for. I note that discussions are ongoing but I hope they will gather pace in January. </p>
            <p eId="para_110">I am not going to put the Minister of State on the spot here; I would not do that. Is there a ballpark timeframe for the conclusion of those talks? Would I be too optimistic to say we are perhaps at the beginning of the end? I would welcome her thoughts on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_111">I acknowledge the work CHO 1 has done. It ensured nobody got left behind when people were trying to stretch their money. That is why it has put in place a closed-route door-to-door service. Perhaps other CHOs might have taken the hard view that they do not provide that sort of service and left families with the burden of bringing loved ones to day services. CHO 1 has been fantastic in ensuring all people could attend the service but it has come at a cost. It is a burden of €1,000 in a cost-of-living crisis and if there are two siblings, it would be €2,000 a year. The working group I chair has finished. We had our final meeting last week. Now the matter has gone out for further observation to the various Departments. Anne Melly from the HSE and Department of Transport officials sit on that. I hope we will have a more concrete basis as to our direction of travel in early January. It will be incumbent on me to ensure funding is provided to CHO 1 in 2023's budget but in the interim I would assume, and hope, that the Department of Transport would meet me with the 10% shortfall.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">I support the Acting Leader with regard to the Order of Business. I will speak about towns, villages and rural regeneration, an issue that is important to all politicians, especially councillors in every local authority region. We have seen another big investment by the Government today. The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, has made an investment in excess of €27 million in the town and village programme up and down the country. It is good to see that a long-vacant building in Ballinasloe is to be repurposed as a hub and €500,000 will be allocated for the redesign of Arigna, County Roscommon, a little village well known to many which was once a great mining place and where there is now a fantastic mining museum. There is much good news in Galway, Roscommon and every other county today.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> Some towns and villages are just not making the mark, however. I do not know whether it is because the local community cannot agree on a project or whether greater engagement is needed with the Department. The town and village programme is a fantastic scheme. It is doing something we have all talked about for years in that it is regenerating towns, bringing more people into them and getting rid of vacancy by repurposing vacant buildings. It would be a travesty if a minority of towns and villages were left behind. We need the communities in towns and villages to come to an agreement on what they would like to be developed in their area. If the Department needs to reach out more to those towns and villages, let it do so because it is very important we use this scheme to its potential and ensure every community gets a share of the moneys available to repurpose its town or village.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> Before I conclude, I wish to refer to something that is upsetting to everybody, whether they live somewhere urban or somewhere rural. I am cognisant of the fact that we have schoolchildren from Malahide here. However, anybody listening to "Morning Ireland" yesterday could not help but be touched by the story of John Healy from Moneygall, which is on the Tipperary-Offaly border. He spoke about the appalling damage done to his sheep flock. Some 50 of his young sheep - I think they might have been hoggets - were killed. He told the story of heading to work and getting a call from his mother. She told him one of the lambs was in the back garden, which is quite a ways from where the sheep should have been. He rang his two teenage sons and asked them to go up to the field not far from the house to see if the sheep were okay. His sons called him back crying uncontrollably because they discovered that 50 of the sheep had been killed by marauding dogs. Senator Boylan has a Bill relating to dogs on the Order Paper. There was another attack in Kildare. This happens every single year. It must be stopped, both for reasons of animal welfare and because of the heartbreak it brings to the farmers who look after their sheep and lambs. We must do something. I do not have a magic answer, but we must do whatever needs to be done. If we have to ban certain types of dog, then we should do so. I appeal to people who have dogs to ensure that they know where they are and that they are under control.</p>

          <p eId="para_117">I bring the good news to the House that the Cabinet has finally approved a framework for legislating for surrogacy in prospective and retrospective cases. I am very grateful for that. Surrogacy is not something you choose - it chooses you. Generally, if you are a woman, surrogacy will be the option because you have had a series of illnesses and losses that have been very dramatic. It will also be the option for a gay couple who want to have a family together. We now have a provision for the State to ensure children have a right to the certainty of both their parents and a right to their identity and birth information being registered in the State. This is all built on a child-centred approached based on the Verona Principles. We will be the first state to legislate for them, which will be quite extraordinary. We also have a circumstance now whereby surrogates are protected and supported to ensure that they are not open to the possibility of coercion or being in any way exploited by having preconception safeguards in place to ensure their rights and entitlements are protected at all times. We also have legal certainty for parents to have a lifelong relationship with their children, and with both of their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> I thank the Ministers involved. I thank the Minister, Deputy McEntee, for her considerable work, because much of this was within the remit of the Department of Justice and the officials there worked extraordinarily hard over the summer months following the report of the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy. I thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and the officials in his Department. I thank the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, who assisted from the perspective of children. I pay great tribute to Professor Conor O'Mahony for his extraordinary report on the rights of children and the protection of children within surrogacy in Ireland. That report laid the groundwork in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> I especially thank the members of the joint committee, which was under the leadership and chairmanship of Deputy Whitmore. I thank Senator Ruane and Deputy Funchion, as well my colleague, Deputy Higgins, and Fianna Fáil colleagues, Senators Clifford-Lee and McGreehan and Deputy Murnane O'Connor, for the hard work that went into arriving at an ethical standard and framework for this State. Extraordinary collaboration and moving forward together went into this. It was a real example of what can be done. We had to do an extraordinary amount of work in a very time-sensitive manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> Most of all, I pay tribute to the families in Irish Families Through Surrogacy and Irish Gay Dads who bore their souls and told of the plight and hardship of not being recognised as their children's parents in Irish law. I am very grateful that this is coming. We need to see the legislative amendments and move this through the Houses with speed. There are families in precarious positions where either the biological father has a very serious illness or there has been family breakdown that places the second parent in a very vulnerable position and the children looking at not having access to that parent or not having that legal certainty. The devil will be in the detail of the amendments. I look forward to them. I am grateful to the Attorney General's office for working so hard on this matter. Yesterday was a great day to be celebrated. It is the beginning of the end of discrimination against our children.</p>

          <p eId="para_122">I note there is a huge amount of business on the Order of Business and it is our task and our job get through it, and I hope we will. I take this opportunity to thank the Leader's office because it is important to do so as we come to the end of another political term. I also acknowledge the significant work Ms Orla Murray in the Leader's office does in the context of organising the Order of Business. It is not an easy task to balance all the demands, all the asks and all the legislation and put it into a structure for us. We will do our best and I hope we will get through the legislation we are expected to get through today.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> I commend and thank the Cathaoirleach and all the members of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee. Our report on the constitutional future of the island of Ireland was finalised this morning and I acknowledge the important work of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, as well as Senators Black, Casey, Currie, Martin, Ó Donnghaile and Wall. It is a very important body of work. It is an interim report, as we always said it would be. My ask is that we have a debate in this House on this and possibly early in the new year. We had some really positive and enlightening contributions. I single out the young people who came into the Chamber in large droves. The key issues for them were equality in education, jobs, homes and the environment. They were the key issues we echo very much here.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> Senator Seery Kearney mentioned something the Cabinet approved yesterday. The Cabinet also approved new planning laws that will now go to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, of which I am a member. There they will be robustly scrutinised. One thing I can clearly say is emails are a barometer of public opinion for many politicians and I have had a huge amount of emails expressing absolute shock and horror from community groups all over the country who feel they are in some way going to be short-changed. We will have to tease that out in committee. There is clearly a role for communication here and I am not privy to the full outline of what is proposed, but that is why I say there is a fear out there. There is going to be a challenge. We are going to have to give this a serious in-depth analysis. This is going to be most hotly-contested legislation of the next six months.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">I echo the concerns with regard to what we are hearing about proposals to try to restrict people's access to justice when it comes to the planning process. We all agree the process is much in need of reform. We are all conscious we have major infrastructural projects to be delivered and are in the middle of a housing crisis, but if the Government thinks it is going to stop people and communities being part of the democratic process that is the planning system that is deeply concerning. I commend the Green Party members of the Cabinet who have at least spoken up about the protection of access to justice. I hope they hold firm on that and that the proposals are given the proper scrutiny they warrant when they reach the committee. However, what we have seen this week with the Bill dealing with An Bord Pleanála hearkened back to the bad old days of Fianna Fáil stuffing boards with cronies. We have seen where that led us. Having no independent public appointments process for appointing people to the board is deeply concerning. It does not bode well in the context of what we are hearing with regard to what came out of Cabinet yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> In my remaining time, I wish to speak on the issue of domestic violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">I will not have an opportunity to speak during the debate tomorrow. Last week An Garda Síochána released the latest statistics on domestic violence. This was timely as we approach Christmas which can be a difficult time for those living in abusive relationships. More than 49,257 domestic abuse reports have been received so far this year. That is a 9% increase on the same period last year. That has to be a cause for huge concern. In addition, 481 coercive control incidents have been recorded so far this year. This is again a steady increase on the number since 2020. Coercive control is a persistent pattern of controlling, coercive and threatening behaviour, including abuse which is emotional, physical, financial or sexual, and including threats. </p>
          <p eId="para_128"> On a positive note An Garda Síochána reports that 90% of gardaí have now completed specific training on coercive control, which is good news for any woman suffering under such circumstances this Christmas and new year break. As we approach the end of the year, I wish to acknowledge the work done by many of the groups across this island supporting those in abusive relationships. I refer to groups such as Women's Aid, which has worked for more than 45 years to make women and children safe from domestic violence, and Safe Ireland. I commend their work as we approach the end of the year. I urge anybody who is in a difficult situation to reach out and get the help they require if they find themselves in an abusive relationship.</p>

Ba chóir dom buíochas a ghabháil freisin maidir leis na heachtraí eile a bhain le comóradh 100 bliain de Sheanad Éireann a bhí ar siúl i rith na bliana, go háirithe na hiarrachtaí ar son mhná an tSeanaid. I pay special tribute to the Cathaoirleach, particularly as he will be moving into a different position on Friday. I wish to acknowledge the work that has been done to remember and commemorate the 100 years of the Seanad, particularly in highlighting how few women have passed through the Seanad over the past 100 years in regard to the portraits and the celebration of women. I want to acknowledge that. I thank the Cathaoirleach for his work on that. </p>
          <p eId="para_130"> I am conscious that this is probably my last contribution to the Order of Business before the end of the year. It is incredible to think that ten months on from 24 February, the savage war in Ukraine is still going with no end in sight. Millions of people are being forced to live in sub-zero temperatures, in deprived conditions without heat and electricity. We heard one of the Ukrainian members of parliament speaking this morning about the appalling conditions. Ukraine is on all our minds. Inevitably over the past few months we were distracted with other issues but we cannot lose sight of this continuing war in Europe. It is clear from the number of people who have come to this country, and in particular from speaking to Ukrainian parliamentarians, that Ireland has a good record of extending the welcome. We have encountered massive issues in accommodating so many people. In the current freezing conditions, Ukrainian refugees and people from other countries are living in tents in this country. This is an appalling indictment of a failure to plan for what we knew was going to be a massive surge. We have been talking about modular housing and preparing for thousands of refugees for many months now, as far back as March and April, but we still do not have proper provision in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> I am conscious that the protests in East Wall are ongoing. There has been a counter-response from people in the local community who do not want their community to be slurred. The north inner city is under enormous strain at the moment due to the shortage of housing and other services. We want to make sure that those who are extremely vulnerable are being welcomed. In that regard the Dublin City Community Co-Op issued a report this morning with its recommendations from the front line. It is engaging with all the various groups in the inner city about how we need to respond to the significant number of refugees on our shores and within our communities. First, it reports that education and training boards across the country have significant waiting lists throughout the country for English-language classes. If we do not get the availability of classes right, we will entrench people’s sense of remoteness. Second, the report also refers to training and employment. We all know we have a shortage of construction workers at the moment yet there are difficulties for refugees in accessing manual handling and Safe Pass courses. Third, the report refers to accommodation, staffing and training. We are entrenching the privatisation of supports in direct provision and in the new facilities being set up for refugees. There is inconsistency with regard to how people are treated in these facilities. We need to have those services professionalised and in public hands as opposed to lining the pockets of some security companies and hotels.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">I join in the expressions of concern about what seems a relentless attack on the democratic aspects of our planning infrastructure. I always tell people that policy-making and politics are about the decisions we make about how we want to live together. An important aspect of the decisions about how we want to live together is that people have a say in their local development plans and in planning. It is vital that we protect it. The concerns around the terrible proposals being flown at the moment should not distract from the very bad things that are in the planning Bill we will discuss tomorrow, which will further erode confidence in An Bord Pleanála and will further lead to people rightly seeking justice in the courts if they are not confident of a fully independent process in An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> It is worth looking in that context at the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on biodiversity. One of its key recommendations is that environmental law and European law are properly applied. I am conscious that the UN Biodiversity Conference is taking place at the moment. It is vital that this conference achieves strong and ambitious outcomes, protects indigenous communities and makes sure we do not see a land grab from corporations for biodiverse land. I welcome the fact that we are seeing some progress on biodiversity in Ireland. Will the Leader facilitate a debate on the results of the Citizens’ Assembly on biodiversity and the UN Biodiversity Conference in the new year?</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> It would also be useful as an international issue if we could have a debate in the new year on the ongoing famine in the Horn of Africa. Indeed, we have heard migration mentioned today. There are migrants who are not reaching safety because they are dying in the Mediterranean Sea or being interned by immigration control deals. That is an issue we should look at. I commend former Senator Grace O’Sullivan who is hosting an event today for those humanitarian front-line persons who are trying to help those seeking safety and are being persecuted for doing so. </p>
          <p eId="para_135"> Can we have those three debates, on biodiversity, on global hunger and on migration, in the new year? I say this because, as I said at the ceremonial sitting on Monday, the Seanad has a strong tradition in looking to international justice issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_136"> I join other Senators in commending the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, on his imaginative, passionate, committed, thoughtful and ambitious period as Cathaoirleach. He has done a great deal in that time. However, I am conscious that not everybody gets to speak at events like the ceremonial sitting. Therefore, it would be useful to have general statements on Seanad 100 in the first week back next year. Given the schedule, there will not be time for such statements before the recess. People right across this House have a great deal to contribute to the discussion on the Seanad, its history and its future. Perhaps we could have an additional session when we come back in the new year to allow for a wide range of contributions from Senators. That would be a really positive debate.</p>

I ask that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, come to the House to update us on the State's preparedness for this weather event. It is forecast to be -11°C in some parts of the country. I seek the debate on foot of a contribution on "Morning Ireland" this morning from geriatrician, Dr. Colm Byrne. He spoke about the need for gritted footpaths that could save the State millions and would help to save many of our elderly people, who are vulnerable at this time of year with the cold weather due to the fragility of their bones. If the Minister can come to the House to update us, that is an important matter. I hope and think that we have learned from the mishap of 2010. We now have a different code of warnings for weather.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> I share the concerns of some with regard to the proposed planning reform that if we are going to prevent community groups or residents groups from making objections, we should not do so with regard to those in the catchment area of a proposed development. Let us have that debate at a different time.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">I asked the Cathaoirleach and ushers to facilitate me in ensuring that there were no young children in the Gallery. I appreciate that. The Leader may have seen some of the work done last month by the Irish Women's Lobby. It took a deep dive into some reading material that has been recommended for schoolchildren by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA. While many books seemed innocent and helpful enough, a few other entries jumped out. Notably, one book offers detailed instruction on manually bringing men to sexual climax, anal sex and oral sex, with accompanying childish cartoons. The book, titled "This Book is Gay", is written by James Dawson. It is aimed at the junior cycle and it informs children as young as 12 that "perhaps the most important skill you will master as a gay or bi man is the timeless classic, the hand job. The good news is, you can practice on yourself.". While the book is tagged as being for the over-12 or young adult category, it is found on the Rainbow Book List, a project supported by An Post and Children's Books Ireland, which is included in all resource listings for junior infants onwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> I am sure many members of the LGBT community would share these concerns regarding children and age-appropriate material. The literature about heterosexual relationships does not seem to be as graphic, for whatever reason. It is not a cherrypicked example from a sea of similar content. It is just that inappropriate content happens to be in this particular book. The NCCA leaves it up to individual teachers as to which material they will use, choosing from a list which spans children from birth to 18 years. According to the Irish Women's Lobby, warnings for teachers to note the recommended age range and ensure it is suited for the class levels they teach were only added after the issues were flagged by the NCCA. Parents send their children to school and expect them to come back able to do long division and recite a little Robert Frost, not to be able to inform their parents, as the book states, "each guy has become very used to his own way of getting himself off.".</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> Nobody voted for this. I assure Members that there would be uproar if this was known by parents throughout the country. Can the Minister, Deputy Foley, urgently address the concerns of these parents and ensure that any and all material used in our schools is age-appropriate? I would say that there needs to be serious repercussions for whoever sanctioned this. It does not reflect the wishes of Irish parents and should not be acceptable in our schools.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">I concur with the comments of Senator Buttimer with regard to international surrogacy recommendtions which have been accepted by Government. Great praise has to go to our colleague, Senator Mary Seery Kearney. We would not be where we are today without the work that she has put in over the past 24 months. I want to say well done to her for her work on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> This morning, significant funding was announced under a town and village project, which I have been involved in for a number of years, to develop a skatepark. It is basically the start of a whole new recreational area in Longford town in an area known as the old dog track. There had been proposals for modular housing. It is an area that was zoned for recreational amenity. I think that is what we need to do by putting additional facilities in Longford town to look after the younger generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> Yesterday, at the Committee on Autism, Fiacre and Carmel Ryan gave evidence. Fiacre is a non-verbal autistic young lad. He did his leaving certificate, and achieved a number of honours, some years ago. He started in Atlantic Technological University in Mayo recently. I will read a couple of lines which were spoken by his mother describing how he felt. He asked us to try to see past the autism and realise that we are the same inside as others. He asked us to please listen to the voices of those who have been silenced by our society and that it is time they are heard, valued and understood. He said it is some people's perception that people who cannot speak do not have intelligence. He said we do not assume that deaf or blind people are of lesser intelligence and asked why we would do so with autism. They are profound words from a young lad.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> I hope the evidence they gave yesterday will lead to Government funding for assistive technology. The technology exists and is manufactured in the State. I hope we can allow children, particularly those who are non-verbal or low verbal, to communicate and show how intelligent they really are. It is incumbent on Government in 2023 to do that. The IT exists and is developed in this country. We need to fund it.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">Like other colleagues, I commend our colleague, Senator Mary Seery Kearney, on a remarkable achievement in 24 months. We all know how slow Government can be in getting things over the line. This was done relatively quickly when one considers the challenges and difficulties and the fact that a committee was set up. It is great that it has happened. Well done to Senator Seery Kearney.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> I encourage people who are in business to take advantage of the business energy support scheme. It is designed to help businesses with energy costs. One can claim up to 40% of the difference between a bill this year and a bill last year. The Government is stepping in to give vital supports to businesses to deal with rising energy costs. We can take some hope from the headlines this morning that the cost of diesel and petrol is back to what it was this time last year. Slowly but surely, we are seeing a recalibration in the right direction of the cost of fuel, particularly in the run-up to Christmas, in this very cold period. At least when people fill up their oil tanks, they will not be charged as much as they would have been three or four months ago. It is a small ray of hope in the distance for something that people can benefit from.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> I support Senator Buttimer's call for statements on the weather situation. Every six or 12 months, we need to be briefed in this House on our readiness to deal with weather emergencies. Weather emergencies are now happening much more frequently than in the past. As representatives and leaders in our communities, we need to be fully briefed on what the emergency response will be, depending on the weather warnings.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">I would like to raise a number of issues. First, I would like to join with colleagues in complimenting our colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, on her work on and dedication to the issue of surrogacy over the past number of months. I congratulate her. It was a great day for an awful lot of families. The fact that there is now certainty and light at the end of the tunnel is a great compliment. I say, "Well done" to the Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> In the lead-up to Christmas, Senator Conway raised business supports and local businesses. It is a time of year that we should encourage everybody to shop and support local. Many local businesses employ people locally. It is important, especially for the small retailers, that we go out and support them when buying presents for people. Many people shop online. I am not knocking the online offering, but local people support and employ local families and they, in turn, go back and spend the money in the economy. I encourage people to try to shop local. Especially in Limerick, we have so much of an offering in terms of crafts, from artists to "Made in Limerick" products. I encourage people to go out and shop local this Christmas.</p>

          <p eId="para_156">I suspect I will not speak tomorrow, so I want to take this opportunity to thank the Cathaoirleach and recognise the work that he has done over the past couple of years and recognise the incredible support of the permanent staff here - Mr. Martin Groves, Ms Bridget Doody and all of the people in the Seanad. I thank the Cathaoirleach for his patience and perseverance with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> I want to raise something positive that is happening in Limerick in the Crescent Shopping Centre. A homeless emergency has gone on for a considerable number of years. Right now, the Crescent Shopping Centre has allowed Focus Ireland to open up a pop-up shop where shoppers who are busy getting their presents for Christmas can avail of a wrapping service and make contributions to Focus Ireland, which does incredible work in terms of homelessness and, in particular in Limerick, in terms of the 265 people in emergency accommodation. I was delighted to see one of the Limerick hurlers, namely, Aaron Gillane, a true hero, volunteer his services to that wrapping service and to promote it and show people that it is there. I want to do the same thing and highlight the fact that there is a pop-up shop for Focus Ireland in the Crescent Shopping Centre in Limerick. I encourage everyone when they are shopping locally to support that very useful and valuable service if they can. </p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Given the challenging year we have had, one of my highlights was seeing Bob Dylan live for the second time. It was a fantastic concert, as always. He is 81 years of age and played for one hour and three quarters without stopping. It was terrific. His favourite song of mine is called “Chimes of Freedom”. It is particularly pertinent to quote from it, given the plight of refugees and, indeed, the plight of so many homeless people this Christmas. He writes of the chimes of freedom flashing:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_159">Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_160">Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_161">An’ for each an’ ev’ry underdog soldier in the night</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_162">An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing</p>
          <p eId="para_163">Bob Dylan is still as relevant as ever in 2022. I wish everyone a happy Christmas.</p>

          <p eId="para_167">I thank Senator Seery Kearney and the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy. It is a great achievement, and it shows the power of our committees as well. It came together in such a short time, sitting from February onwards to publishing report in June-July to now having more than 30 recommendations and the majority of those getting implemented. Senators were involved in the committee and it has been a great achievement for men and women and families across the country. Well done. That demonstrates the power of committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> I am overjoyed because we will have hopefully another 40 jobs in Ballinasloe. That is all thanks to the commitment and investment of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, in a remote working hub through the towns and villages funding that was announced this morning. Ballinasloe Area Community Development received nearly €500,000 through the just transition fund two years. It has been working over the past year to two years to design, prepare and get ready to renovate the old bank chambers on Society Street in Ballinasloe. It brought the project to design stage and tender, and it is great to see that this extra injection of investment will bring it to the point where it will now be able to start the works on that building hopefully this year. In 2023, those offices will potentially open for another 40 people to start working in the town of Ballinasloe and shop local, perhaps on <i>Ballinasloe.ie</i>, and support our great town.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> It is fantastic to see nearly €1 million being allocated to County Roscommon for the Arigna mines, but also nearly €160,000 for the town of Athleague. It is a fantastic place on the banks of the River Suck. It is getting funding to develop a mindful sort of space called the Circle of Life, where they are focusing on having a green space available for people to come, walk and be mindful. Sometimes we need to take a step back. </p>
          <p eId="para_170"> Happy Christmas. Hopefully I will get a chance to say it tomorrow too.</p>

          <p eId="para_172">That interruption is more than welcome. I also commend the Senator on her hard work. It is because Members are able to take on those minority issues that changes in our society are made. Without Senator Seery Kearney being in here and taking that leadership role, along with others, and being supported by many of her colleagues, that legislation may not have progressed as it is at this moment in time. I congratulate the Senator. It is no small achievement. She is in the ranks with just a few dozen people who have managed to get legislation like a Private Members’ Bill through this and the other House since 1937. That is an amazing achievement.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">I thank all Senators for their contributions. Senator Murphy talked about the important funding under the town and village scheme from the Department and Rural and Community Development. I would like to acknowledge the package announced by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, today of: €17 million investment in 75 towns and village projects nationwide; €6 million of funding to purchase and redevelop vacant derelict buildings and convert them to community facilities; €2.6 million to upgrade shop fronts and building facades in 26 towns under the streetscape enhancement initiative; and €1.56 million for planning and design works on a range of projects that are an early stage of development. That is very welcome funding for many of our towns and villages. Senator Murphy referenced Ballinasloe and Arigna. He also appealed for the Department and local authorities to get involved to identify why there is not movement on some projects in some local communities that have not been successful. That is very welcome as well. Senators Carrigy and Dolan referenced as well issues and funding under the town and village scheme and I welcome that as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Senator Murphy also talked about John Healy, the tragic events in Moneygall and the savaging of up to 50 lambs or hoggets. I can only image the scene that their teenage sons witnessed. I offer my condolences to all involved there. Unfortunately, it is an occurrence that has happened often. I recall from the 1980s an animated advert that used to be on the television of a dog – I cannot remember whether the name was Fido or whatever it was - where it had been let out and savaged sheep and came back home to the house. Perhaps it is time to reshow that put it out on social media platforms as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> Senator Seery Kearney thanked and congratulated everyone except herself, such is her modesty. However, everyone else mentioned her work on surrogacy. I would like to join with others in commending her on her advocacy in this House, in the committee and within our parliamentary party room, where she has advocated and brought in groups and interested parties to give us their testimony on an important issue. I welcome the Cabinet approval for the amendments to the surrogacy legislation that she has sought. I commend all Ministers, namely, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O’Gorman, Professor Conor O’Mahony, the members of the joint Oireachtas committee and, mostly importantly, the Senator for her advocacy for those families and children who will benefit because of these changes that have been initiated.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> Senator Boyhan referred to the interim report of the committee on the future of the island of Ireland. I am sure the Leader will bring this report to the House for a debate in the new year. It is a worthy request. I will certainly mention it. </p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Senators Boylan and Higgins mentioned the planning legislation. Obviously the Bill has been approved by the Cabinet and will go to pre-legislative scrutiny where the committee will have an opportunity to assess it. I appreciate that it is a very busy committee. Its members will have an opportunity to assess the intricacies of that Bill. There will be further debates at all Stages in these Houses. There is a concern about the planning process. I suppose the good name that An Bord Pleanála might have had up to the last number of years has been somewhat tarnished of late. It is important that we rebuild confidence in the process and that people have the right to object as individuals. I know there is concern regarding groups financing judicial reviews and all of that. I will leave it to the committee in the initial stages to debate that before it comes to these Houses. I agree that it is a very important issue and I am sure there will be heated debates on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> Senator Boylan referred to a report on domestic violence. That is not on the order for tomorrow but I am sure there will a debate on it in the new year. Refuges are doing very important work, mainly but not exclusively for women who are victims of domestic violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> Senator Sherlock spoke about Seanad 100. Senator Higgins called for statements on the matter in the new year, which would be important. Maybe we could get Dr. John Bowman back for a longer contribution because he said 15 minutes was not enough. His contribution was certainly very enlightening. The call for statements is something that would be in order.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> Senator Sherlock also referenced the East Wall protests and the issue of refugees from the Ukraine war. Like Senator Higgins, she called for a debate on migration in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> Senator Higgins also called for debates on the famine in the Horn of Africa and on the citizens' assembly on biodiversity. They would be important debates, subject to time, although it will be a matter for the incoming Leader or for the House to schedule the Order of Business in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Senators Buttimer and Conway spoke about the weather warnings and the need to grit footpaths. There is nothing that can be as life-changing as a fall, particularly for our elderly who may be in good health mentally and physically only to suffer a slip or a fall and fracture a hip or a leg. It can be a life-changing event. The gritting of footpaths in cities in towns should certainly be a priority, as should the call for the Minister to come in to make statements on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> Senator Keogan raised issues and her concerns about the NCCA and the curriculum. I do not know. We are a long way since Dr. Alfred Kinsey published <i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i> in 1948 and <i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</i> in 1953. I know puritanism has been described as that haunting fear that someone somewhere is having some fun.</p>

The Senator commented on the use of technologies for non-verbal children, which is a wonderful suggestion and should be taken up. I am sure he will find support in these Houses for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> Senator Conway highlighted the reductions in the costs of diesel and petrol, for which we are thankful, and spoke about the temporary energy business support scheme. Thankfully, as a result of the strong tax revenues it has, the Government is in a position to be able to support businesses that need assistance at this time. Indeed, individuals are also being supported under various social welfare schemes but Senator Conway mentioned the help being given to businesses with energy costs under the temporary energy business support scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> I concur with what Senator Maria Byrne said about the need to shop locally. While there will be online shopping over the Christmas period, I hope people shop online from Irish companies and such companies are prioritised. Many companies now have an online presence and it is an important part of their business. If people could prioritise Irish shops, that would be beneficial for those companies, for their employees and for the economy and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> Senator Gavan quoted from Bob Dylan's "Chimes of Freedom" and mentioned the services of the valuable pop-up shops that have appeared in Limerick city.</p>

          <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Roderic O'Gorman)<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_217">I am pleased to address the House on Second Stage of the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill. The primary purpose of this Bill is to ensure that Ireland has fully transposed Articles 6 and 9 of the EU Work-life Balance Directive, which are the final elements not already compatible with Irish law. The Bill also fulfils an important and long-standing commitment to extend the entitlement to breastfeeding breaks under the Maternity Protection Acts. With this extension, women returning to work after having a baby will be entitled to these breaks for two years after the birth of the child, raising that period from six months, as is the current situation. Breastfeeding numbers in Ireland remain low, particularly for extended breastfeeding. These breaks make combining the return to work and breastfeeding that bit easier and also normalise something which still can have a stigma attached to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> On Committee Stage in the Dáil, amendments were added to this Bill which will introduce five days' paid domestic violence leave. Addressing domestic, sexual and gender-based violence has always been a priority of mine, and I am pleased to be able to bring forward these legislative amendments which will mean that Ireland will now become one of the first countries in Europe to introduce a right to paid leave for victims of domestic violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">On Report Stage, further amendments were tabled to incorporate a right to request remote working for all employees, following a Government decision to bring forward the provisions of the Tánaiste's right to request remote working Bill as part of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill. Part 1 is a standard provision. Part 2 provides for the measures to transpose the EU work-life balance directive and provide for domestic violence leave. Section 6 inserts a new section 13A into the Parental Leave Act to provide for leave for medical care purposes. This new form of leave matches the provisions of Article 6 of the work-life balance directive on carer's leave. The Carer's Leave Act 2001 already provides for a form of leave for those with caring responsibilities but for a more extended period. In order to meet the requirements of the directive for a form of leave that can be taken flexibly, and without a notice period, it was necessary to introduce leave for medical care purposes. Under these provisions, up to five days' leave can be taken in any 12-month period and it can be taken in individual days or consecutively. The leave is available to care for a child for whom the employee is a relevant parent under the Parental Leave Act and also to care for a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, parent or grandparent, brother or sister or a person who resides in the same household. The leave is unpaid and in order to provide the necessary flexibility required under the directive it is not possible to provide a social protection benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> Section 7 inserts a new section 13AA into the Parental Leave Act to provide for five days' paid domestic violence leave in a 12-month period. The leave is available where an employee or a relevant person has experienced in the past, or is currently experiencing, domestic violence. The leave can be used to seek medical attention, obtain services from a victim services organisation or other counselling, relocate temporarily or permanently or obtain an order under the Domestic Violence Act 2018 or other legal support.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> Section 8 inserts new sections 13B, 13C, 13D, 13E, 13F and 13G into the Parental Leave Act that outline the right to request flexible working and the procedures which must be followed by the employee and employer. These provisions give effect to Article 9 of the work-life balance directive. A request must be made in writing, set out the form of the flexible working arrangement sought and be submitted not later than eight weeks before the proposed commencement of the flexible working arrangement. As with the leave for medical care purposes, the employer may seek further information. There are also provisions around the variation or termination of a flexible working arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> On Report Stage, a new section 13H was also added which provides for the review of the provisions under Part 2 within two years of their commencement to assess their operation. This will include consideration of whether the five days of domestic violence leave should be extended and whether the right to request flexible working should be extended to a wider cohort of employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> Part 3 provides for a right to request remote working for all employees. These provisions closely mirror those in Part 2 providing for the right to request flexible working. The request must be made in writing and the same timelines apply. There is also a review provision for this Part, to take place within two years of commencement.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> Part 4 includes a provision for a code of practice for remote and flexible working to be developed by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. This code of practice will provide guidance to employers and employees on the operation of the right to request remote working and the right to request flexible working. Part 4 also includes amendments to the Maternity Protection Act 1994, at section 2(1), to provide for a new definition of "employee who is breastfeeding", which extends the entitlement to breastfeeding breaks under the Act from six months to two years. This Part also deletes section 7(2) and amends section 16(1) by substituting "woman or other person" for "woman". These small number of amendments are necessary to ensure the entitlement to maternity leave is available to any person who gives birth. In addition, Part 4 contains the miscellaneous provisions of the Bill, which include technical and other necessary amendments to the Birth Information and Tracing Act, the Adoption Act and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> What we have is a wide-ranging set of measures that not only implements European Union law but includes measures that go beyond our EU law requirements. It is a suite of measures designed to protect and promote women's participation in the workplace. It will see the introduction of five days medical care; a right to request flexible work for parents and carers; a right to request remote working for all workers; and the extension of breastfeeding breaks, which will be a genuinely transformative development. Women are currently entitled to breastfeeding breaks for six months after giving birth but for any woman who avails of her full maternity leave, that period will have elapsed. While the right to breaks is on the books, it is not accessible in practice for the vast majority of women. Women will be able to take breastfeeding breaks of up to an hour's length per day to breastfeed or express milk for a period of two years after the birth of their child. It is a genuinely significant expansion of this right and one that will benefit tens of thousands of women every year as they return from maternity leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> I refer to the introduction of paid domestic violence leave. As Senators will know, when this Government took up office, we identified that there was an epidemic of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, in our society. We have introduced a wide range of measures, principally through the Department of Justice, with the Minister, Deputy McEntee, bringing forward the third national action plan against DSGBV, as well as the introduction of an Act that will create a new agency to tackle DSGBV. We are taking an important step with this Bill in recognising that those fleeing domestic violence, who are primarily but not only women, are more at risk of poverty because of the disruption fleeing one's home often entails. This is an important step towards recognising this and ensuring such persons have paid leave to do some of the things they need to do in the context of suffering domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. It is important to note that Ireland will be one of the first European Union countries to introduce this leave. It is a very new form of leave and there are not many countries around the world that provide for it as a paid measure. The programme for Government and the Green Party's manifesto made commitments to support victims of domestic violence in all circumstances, and this is an important step in delivering those.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> The Bill represents an important step forward in providing work-life balance and recognising that a parent's or carer's role is not suspended between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. every day. These provisions make it easier and allow more people to balance their working and caring commitments. I look forward to hearing the views of Senators. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_229">I largely welcome the Bill. It is a hard and often thankless task to balance employer and employee rights, and I know how much of the debate on the legislation in the Dáil and in the committee centred around time periods, whether it would be paid or unpaid, and who would be included or left out of certain provisions. There are those who would tilt the scales entirely in one direction and force employers to pay time and a half to a worker who is out sick for three days, thereby putting the entire country out of business. Likewise, others would love nothing more than to flirt with the opposite extreme and erode workers' rights to flatten profit margins. Neither of these approaches is desirable and it is essential the Government strike a balance, an all-important word in the Bill's Title. To that end, it would be of great interest and importance to analyse and appraise the impact of the Bill on our working economy once it has been in force for some time. Will the Minister speak to that issue? What plans are in place to carry out such an assessment so that we can revise some of the timings in the Bill, if needed?</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> We must address the fiasco that was the removal of the word "woman" from the Maternity Protection Act 1994. What a ludicrous sentence to even have to say. The Minister may well respond, as he did to Deputy Tóibín in the Dáil, that this Bill does not remove the word "woman" from the legislation. While that is true, it was not always the plan. By the time the Bill was presented to the House on 5 October, the word "woman" was in its rightful place, albeit alongside the term "other person". One would have no idea as to how close we were to that not being the case. The general scheme of the Bill published on 21 April states: "The Maternity Protection Act 1994 is amended (a) in section 16(1) by the replacement of “woman” with “person”." The accompanying explanatory note declares: "For the avoidance of doubt, “woman” is being substituted for a gender neutral term, such as “person”." That was the plan of the Minister's Department, and I presume he and I have no reason to believe it would have changed if I had not flagged it in this Chamber on 6 June. Once people got wind that this was coming down the line, a national dialogue was kick-started and we had three days of back-to-back coverage on the national broadcaster. Joe Duffy quickly saw how passionate the women of Ireland are about themselves, one another, their identities and history, and all the comes with being a woman and recognised as a woman.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">This level of honest discussion had many progressives clutching their pearls and reaching for the smelling salts, so aghast were they that both sides of the debate would be given space to talk by our national broadcaster. Indeed, the national conversation that opened up was decried in this very Chamber. It seems, though, that at least one person was paying attention. Whether this was the Minister, or an official in his Department, we can be sure that these few strokes of the pen that turned head 12 of the general scheme into section 16 of this Bill saved his Government even more of a PR headache than he may think.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> It is worrying, though, that none of this would have happened if one individual had not spotted a cluster of three heads in the general scheme of a little-known Government Bill, whose Title had nothing to do with the problematic provisions themselves. It is a good thing that Covid-19 taught us to raise the eyebrows any time we see "Miscellaneous Provisions" in a Bill Title and to go and do our own digging. The practice of hiding potentially unpopular provisions in technical, low-profile Bills is concerning and the apparent philosophy of women erasures is even more so. Work-life balance is good, but erasing women is bad. Let us see more of the former and stop with the latter. I thank the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulineOreilly" eId="spk_76" as="#Acting_Chairperson">
          <from>Senator Pauline O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_233">I welcome the Minister to the House. This is an important day. We are seeing the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 coming through the Seanad. Most people will know my passionate interest in supporting breastfeeding in Ireland, as the Vice-Chair of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality and co-convener of a new subcommittee of the Women's Caucus on breastfeeding. As the Minister rightly pointed out, the breastfeeding breaks did not really suit anyone. Few people would go back to work before six months and, as someone who has breastfed beyond two years for both my children, I think this time is appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> If we look at the data, we have a gap in this regard in Ireland. We will be looking to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to put in place some data analysis around how many women are breastfeeding beyond three months, because this is where the data stop in Ireland. In some ways, it is a little unfortunate that we do not have these data before we have this legislation. This does not mean, however, that we should not put this legislation in place. I would love to see people, as workers and carers, feeling supported in every way they can be to ensure their breastfeeding journey is as long as they want it to be. I think people feel pressured now in this regard to give up breastfeeding because of the lack of flexibility in workplaces. This is through no fault of workplaces but because there is no statutory instrument that will ensure all businesses are treated equally and are on an equal footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> The other important aspect of this legislation, as has been mentioned, concerns paid leave for domestic violence. Ireland is the first country in the EU to put in place this kind of legislation. This goes beyond the programme for Government. It shows the commitment of the Government and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to ensuring every possible avenue to support those experiencing domestic violence is pursued. We know this is a massive problem in Ireland. I refer to a meeting last week of the joint policing committee in Galway. This area has a particularly high incidence of domestic violence compared with the rest of the country. Some people will say more people are coming forward. This still does not change the fact that they are coming forward and that they are being abused in their own homes. </p>
          <p eId="para_236"> The Garda has now said it is taking an arrest-first approach to domestic violence, which is correct. Not only is this an assault, like any other, and a crime, but it also means people are living in constant fear in their homes. Children in those homes also live in constant fear and the experience impacts on them for their entire lives. Domestic violence impacts on entire generations in our society. We have a problem here and it must be addressed. This is an important part in doing that. I refer to there being paid leave to allow people to go somewhere safe and, crucially, that it will not be necessary to provide any documentary evidence under this legislation. It should not be a burden on the people who are the victims and being abused in respect of it being necessary to show evidence to employers when they may not want to. People have a right to privacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> The other important part to speak about in the context of this legislation is on the remote working aspect. This provision is being incorporated into this Bill. All the recommendations from the pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation are being incorporated into this legislation concerning remote and flexible working. Again, this shows a deep commitment to having the very best legislation when it comes to supporting people in their workplaces. We talk about the equal care that must be given by genders, but we know the majority of care is provided by women. When it comes to remote and flexible working, then, it is predominantly going to be women who will benefit from this initially. Over time, I hope this will change. The complementary aspect here is the provision to legislate for parental leave of up to seven weeks. The Minister has also put this into place. There have been many suggestions regarding how flexible work will operate to ensure there will be balance. I refer to ensuring that small companies, in particular, will be protected. The very fact that all these suggestions have been taken on board and incorporated into this Bill shows this measure will work. </p>
          <p eId="para_238"> From the Green Party's perspective, not only is this referred to in the programme for Government and fulfilling many of the negotiated commitments in that regard, but it has also long been a policy of our party to support breastfeeding, flexible working and care and this is exactly what this Bill is doing. I therefore thank the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EmerCurrie" eId="spk_77">
          <from>Senator Emer Currie<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_239">I welcome the Minister to the House. I will focus on the work-life balance aspect of this Bill and the transposition of the directive, which the Minister has overseen. Additionally, I will comment on the inclusion of the right to request remote working, which is now contained under this legislation and was inherited from the Tánaiste's Department. It is a good move to have all this under one Bill. I very much welcome the inclusion of leave for victims of domestic abuse, the extension of breastfeeding breaks to two years and leave for medical care purposes. I commend the Minister and the joint committee for their introduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> On the work-life balance elements of this legislation, we will now have flexible working arrangements contained in Irish law for the first time. This is significant. This part of the Bill has been widely overshadowed by the right to request remote working, even though remote working is only one type of flexibility and has limitations. Too much pressure is being put on remote work to deliver for everyone when there are many different types of flexibility. Flexible working arrangements open up possibilities like core working hours, compressed hours, reduced hours, flexi hours and jobshares, which offer radically more choices. After all, remote working does not work for everyone. </p>
          <p eId="para_241"> While the right to request remote working is universal, however, the right to request work flexibility is not. This will reduce its relevance and impact, unfortunately. The decision not to go beyond the directive's requirement to provide flexibility for parents and carers, although it does extend to children aged up to 12 rather than eight, reflecting the provisions of our current parental leave Act, means this legislation is not fully responding to the demand for workplace change that all workers want and have had a taste of during Covid-19. They do not really understand all the other aspects of flexibility that they could enjoy.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> Rather than using the introduction of flexibility as an opportunity to challenge workplace stereotypes of employees who ask for flexibility instead of putting their career before life all the time, this Bill cements the perception that flexible working is something for parents and carers and, therefore, predominantly something that women do. Having listened to my colleague, this is where we are. Women are the ones who take on most caring duties. They will be the ones taking most advantage of this legislation. </p>
          <p eId="para_243">To me, that is not good enough. As a society, we must challenge how we share the care. There are fundamental pillars to building gender equality and equal opportunities in the workplace. We need accessible and affordable childcare, flexible workplaces and a wider ethos of sharing the care. We have a mountain to climb in Ireland when it comes to that. With our current parental leave, women are three and a half times more likely to take it than men. When it comes to paternity leave, the take-up by men stands at around 50% even though it is now in its fifth year. Women with children are five times more likely to work part time than men with children. Our employment gap between men and women with children in 2021 stands at 18%, with 90% of men with children working compared to 72% women. We also know the more children women have, the further that figure drops. The longer they are out of the workforce, the harder it is to get them to return to work. According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that is reflected in the weekly earnings gap between men and women of approximately 23%.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> It is clear that if we are going to shift the dial on sharing the care, we need more than the same. Similar to the provision of leave for parents, which men do not take up as much, and now the provision of flexibility for all parents and carers that women are also likely to take. We need a deliberate, fundamental and brave shift in creating shared opportunities and shared responsibility. Access to universal flexibility would help Ireland in that regard, as it has helped in other countries. According to the Oireachtas research brief on the Bill, Lithuania has a 1% employment gap, and universal flexibility is offered. Finland has taken a different approach. It has moved beyond the right to request and is the closest I have found to providing a universal right to flexibility. It is not completely a right for everybody, because it depends on their roles, but it has introduced core working hours in offices as the norm. That was done in 1996. Since then, the country has built on that with access to flexitime and now has built on that again with flexibility in location. That is as close to a right as I can find. In Finland, where there are two parents, both parents spend an equal amount of time with their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> In the UK, the right to request flexibility from day one was introduced earlier this week. Iceland has also taken a different approach, with mandatory shared parental leave instead of separate maternity and paternity leave as a building block to sharing care, backed up with universal childcare provision from when a child is 18 months and it also has flexible workplaces. For that reason, Iceland is the most gender-equal country in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> There are different ways to encourage the sharing of the care, but universal flexibility is one proven approach. I fear we are missing a golden opportunity. It is a positive step that parents and carers will have the opportunity for a better work-life balance, helping those who take it to maintain their careers. It will help keep women in the labour market by giving them more flexibility, but it will not change the culture of work in the way day-one universal flexibility would. It will not level the playing field between the young mum and the "always-on-er" in the way it could. It will not encourage men to take flexibility in the same way as a system of universal flexibility would. We are going to have a situation in teams where one employee will have access to flexibility and a colleague of the same experience will not. We know that remote working generally works better for people with more experience and for people who do not miss the social aspect of the office. They might have children or an established circle of friends. Then we will have younger career starters who want to be in the office, who do not want remote working, but who do not get other types of flexibility as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> I will refer briefly to remote working. It is positive that there has been so much change to the Bill as we move through Committee Stage, but I am still concerned about the six-month wait because it does not remove location as a barrier. If a person is living in County Donegal and he or she wants to take a Dublin-based job remotely, he or she must work in the office in Dublin for six months before he or she can make the move. We are still basing remote work as something that people do a couple of days a week, as opposed to having remote roles for people and creating a digital-first or remote-first environment. The Minister has a role in taking the pressure off remote working because it does not work for everybody. We have put too much expectation into what remote working can do, but we must train companies on how to do it properly; how to create digital-first environments where the remote roles can thrive. We have spent €100 million on investing in communities and hubs. That is where people work, but we also need the supply of those jobs in order to keep those communities and hubs thriving.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">The Minister is welcome to the House. I also very much welcome the Bill. It is another step along the way of trying to make our legislation more equitable, look to families and people's lives and the all-elusive work-life balance we all strive for. I am sure that as Members we fail at that. I laugh at the irony of us bringing in this legislation while our lives are very much imbalanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> Nonetheless, this is an important day. The Bill builds on the gender pay gap legislation. It is about making work work for families and women. I will follow on from what Senator Currie said. It is about the culture of work and changing our attitude to work and the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. concept of it. We must be realistic that the system was made by men to work for men. At 9 a.m., the kids were at school and when they came home the kids were fed, the homework was done, and they had a nice evening ahead of them because the wife was at home doing all the work. Work must change and our concept and understanding of what work is must change, with more women in the labour force and more men sharing the care. We must change the concept of the work culture and how we understand it to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> I will go through some of the welcome changes in this amended Bill. For me, one of the big initiatives I was pushing, along with Women's Aid Dundalk and Safe Ireland relates to paid leave for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. It is a great step along the way. I know Safe Ireland has been working on it for so long. Ann Larkin from Dundalk Women's Aid is also on the board of Safe Ireland. Those organisations do significant work. I learn from them every day about the importance of this, and the acknowledgment that women in work go through domestic violence and they need a breathing space. The State has acknowledged that it is there to help. We accept that people, mostly women, need this. It is a great day. Five days' leave is a great start. As politicians we always ask for more. We must make this part of a step towards a minimum of ten days. It is difficult to move a family or to reach a safe place in five days, get help, get the refuge and all the things that are required. While five days' leave is very important, it is very tight.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> We need to train and support businesses to help them understand what this work-life balance Bill will mean to them and their staff. Breastfeeding, for example, is hugely important and businesses must understand their responsibility to make it as easy as possible. We do not want women feeling under pressure when they ask for these things in their workplaces. They must understand that these measures are in place and know what to do to accommodate these changes in their workplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> I will follow up on the contribution of Senator Currie, the Seanad's expert on remote working who has done an awful lot of work in the area and spoken about it since she became a Senator. We all have to learn exactly what is meant by flexible and remote working. We must encourage people to make the change and encourage businesses to allow change to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> I ask the Minister to ensure the Bill is constantly reviewed. The Workplace Relations Commission must have a role in reviewing the legislation, examining ways to improve it and pushing for cultural change. As the culture changes, what we expect from this legislation will change, as I am sure it will.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> I commend the Minister and his officials on the work they have done on this Bill. The Minister has produced a raft of legislation in the past two and a half years and hugely important changes have been made. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Senator Paul Gavan<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_259">I welcome the Minister. It is good to be able to talk about this welcome Bill. I should also point out that it has been brought forward because Ireland must fully transpose Articles 6 and 9 of the EU work-life balance directive. It is, therefore, something we have to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> I agree with Senator Currie that in some respects the Bill is a missed opportunity. It is a rare occurrence but the Senator is right that this is a missed opportunity. If we are going to do this, we may as well do it right and ensure it benefits our people to the maximum extent possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> Sinn Féin welcomes this Bill. It is a continuation of recent debates and legislation on remote working and flexibility. While a wider scope could have been adopted, the Bill is a welcome start. It provides leave for parents and carers, which is a good step forward. The Bill is not perfect and we have raised issues around the proof elements. More could be done on that and we can come back to it on Committee Stage. Indeed, the Minister can expect some amendments from us on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> Another very important provision in the Bill, as mentioned, is domestic violence leave. My party leader, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, and my colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, have previously put forward a Bill to provide this leave and the legislation before us resembles that in sentiment. However, we have issues with the five-day period. This Bill only provides between one and five days' leave. The wording of the Bill states the leave "shall not exceed 5 days", yet the Minister insists that five days is a statutory minimum. The wording is not clear enough for employers and could lead to those who would be inclined to provide ten days cutting back the period to five days. As we know, other countries and companies already provide ten days' leave. The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science recently announced ten days' leave for staff in the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, and called on the other universities to follow suit. I urge the Minister to reconsider the proposal and provide for ten days' leave. I acknowledge that a Fianna Fáil Senator has just made the same point. We will not get a chance to revisit this matter during the lifetime of this Government, so let us get the Bill right and provide for ten days' leave. We all seem to agree on that, so let us be ambitious and ensure the legislation is as effective as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> The Bill provides for flexible working arrangements, which are hugely important for parents as they try to manage or juggle childcare, school runs and other family commitments. Very few families can afford to live on one income so flexibility is crucial. We know that allowing an employee to have more control over his or her working hours and place of work has been shown to reduce absenteeism and staff turnover while increasing productivity. In other words, it is good for business. It also helps to cut travel cost and allows parents to manage their childcare and other caring responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> A new section 20(2) states: "An employee’s approved remote working arrangement shall not commence before a time when the employee concerned has completed 6 months continuous employment with the employer concerned." Seriously, the British Tories, perhaps the most right-wing Tory Party we can remember, have just agreed that people can request remote working from day one. Does the Minister want his legacy to show that he is somewhere to the right of the Tory Party when it comes to this provision? There are common-sense, practical reasons remote working should commence from day one. There is also a very good business reason it should commence from day one because we know that skilled employees are now in serious demand and we need to be able to attract those employees to work and live in Ireland. However, this legislation will put us behind the Tories. As my colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, said in the Dáil, we are only asking the Minister to do as much as the British Tories have done. For the life of me, I genuinely cannot understand why the Minister has not yet done this. I hope he will take into account Members' proposals, which I acknowledge have not come only from the Opposition side of the House. I urge him to make that change. He does not want to find himself to the right of the Tories on an issue such as this and he needs to do better. I do not know what his personal position is on this matter, and it would be interesting to hear it, but I urge the Minister to use his authority to recognise that making workers wait six months is not good for them or their home life and it is also not good for the commercial life of this country or the need to ensure Ireland is seen as a really good place to work. I ask the Minister to please come back and address that issue or allow us to address it on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> Section 20(3)(c)(i) states that employees must state the reasons they are seeking remote working arrangement. This is referred to as “the employee’s needs”. There are serious and genuine concerns about how someone's reasons or needs will be judged. What does it matter why someone wishes to work remotely provided the person is doing the work? This provision is too paternalistic and needs to be revised. Unfortunately, this and other amendments were brought forward by the Minister on Report Stage in the Dáil when they could not be properly scrutinised as they would be during Committee Stage. This caused a lot of frustration for my Dáil colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> Sinn Féin supports the Bill but we will bring forward amendments. I urge the Minister to take on board the comments made by everyone in this Chamber this afternoon regarding sensible amendments that would make this Bill stronger and better for the workers in this country.</p>

          <from>Senator Marie Sherlock<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_267">I welcome the Minister to the House. I am delighted that we are finally debating Second Stage of this Bill. I warmly welcome the transposition of the EU work-life balance directive. I acknowledge that there have been a number of very important additions made to the Bill, specifically the extension of breastfeeding leave from six months to two years. The argument that it was madness to extend this leave to six months has been articulated. It would have meant that women returning to the workforce would have been unable to avail of breastfeeding breaks. The provisions on domestic violence and remote working are also important. I am glad the Government has finally seen sense and merged the remote and flexible work provisions in one Bill, even though we still have the ludicrous situation where we treat flexible and remote work separately. I know there will be a review of two years but it is ludicrous that they are separate.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> Notwithstanding that the Bill transposes the EU work-life balance directive, it is about catching up with the events that have taken place within the world of work in this country and across the developed world over the last two and a half years. It puts remote and flexible work into a legal framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">We are all aware of the massive shifts that have taken place with regard to forced remote working and now hybrid working in remote instances. I draw particular attention to what has been happening to women in the Irish labour market over the past two and a half years and how access to flexible and remote work has been instrumental in this. Between the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2022, there was a 9.5% increase in the number of females in full-time employment. The rate of growth of female full-time employment is running at approximately 3.5 times the rate of growth for male full-time employment. Why is this? We know that part-time employment is defined not as working half the number of hours but as working for less than full-time hours. When many women reach a particular age, or because of the circumstances of their lives, they drop back from full-time hours to four days a week or fewer. The benefit of remote and flexible work is that they realised they are able to work full-time and still manage all of the other responsibilities in their lives, such as getting children to school. This is because they have flexibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> The key issue with the Bill is how we do not turn back the clock but build on the great progress that has happened. This is not in any way to diminish what is also happening in terms of the struggles for some women in the workplace with regard to productivity because they have been trying to manage responsibilities at home. How do we not turn back the clock with this legislation? How do we realise the potential? Senators Currie, Gavan and others eloquently made the argument about the opportunities that are available to us now. I am thinking in particular of the 13.5% of people who are categorised by the CSO as being in the potential additional labour force category and who say that they would like to work but are not actively seeking work because of the structural barriers in their lives, whether childcare, disability or other issues. It is important to consider how the legislation might play a role in getting those people into the workplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> When we compare Ireland with other EU member states, we discover that have the highest number of jobless lone parents and disabled persons in the labour market. How do we begin to ensure that lone parents and disabled persons have greater opportunities and access to the world of work? I think about all of this when I look at the provisions in the Bill. The Bill makes provision for a six-month waiting period to access flexible work. I have to appeal to the Minister. We cannot see flexible work as a perk for good behaviour. We have to build it in as a default right from day one; it should not be seen as something to be earned. The Minister has responsibility for equality and integration. I know he takes very seriously issues relating to the very high levels of unemployment among disabled persons. We have to look at how we make flexible work available from day one. The recommendation of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment is that we move to 13 weeks. I would not be happy with 13 weeks but it would be far better than the 26 weeks in the Bill. I would argue that it should be available from day one.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> With regard to access to flexible work provisions, the cut-off age for caring for a child is 12 years. Any parent of a 12-year-old knows that they cannot necessarily be given a key to let themselves into the house. It works for some families but not for others. We should not presuppose that just because a child turns 12 that all of a sudden the parent's responsibilities and requirement for flexibility disappears. They do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> I want to speak about caring roles. I have great difficulty with the Bill seeking to prescribe the circumstances in which a person is caring. If I happen to be caring for an aunt or my mother in law it is not provided for in the Bill. We need to put ourselves into a head space of recognising that people require flexibility with regard to hours of work and places of work for a variety of reasons that we will never be able to fully set out in legislation. It is disappointing that we do not have a full and comprehensive right to flexible work in the Bill. The Bill will work very well for those in jobs but does nothing for those looking to get a job. Where is our ambition, particularly for lone parents and disabled persons?</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> I warmly welcome the provisions on leave for medical care purposes. We have to ask whether the provisions as they are currently designed will benefit those who need to access the leave. Those who are salaried and higher earners tend by and large to have more flexibility as part of their work than somebody whose weekly wage is determined by the hours they work or those on lower incomes. We know those on lower incomes or more junior in workplaces have issues. Will the unpaid leave make a difference for them? They have the double whammy of paying for medical care if it is required and not getting paid. I urge the Minister to think about this. Domestic violence leave will not be at the full rate and will be set up by means of regulation. Those who are victims of domestic and sexual-based violence will have to think twice about taking the leave. This is a serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> There was a big uproar at the start of the year because there would be no right to appeal a refusal by an employer if an employee sought the right to work remotely or work flexibly. There is still no real right to appeal an employer's refusal. I am looking at section 27.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">I welcome the legislation. It is based on an EU directive and we need to remember a directive is not regulation. A directive has to be experienced at the same base level in every EU member state. This provides us with an opportunity to provide more rights than the base level intention of the directive. I echo much of what Senator Currie and others said. I concur that we should look at ten days instead of five. When we transpose we need a minimum equivalence but we can go way beyond this.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> I commend the enormous work since the first day I met her that Senator Currie has put into this subject matter. She has been extraordinary and has led in an extraordinary way on it with all of us. Throughout the Chamber we would echo this.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> I have a number of points to make and I will flesh them out on Committee Stage. A relevant parent includes those <i>in loco parentis</i>. How will this be tested? How will it be verified that someone is <i>in loco parentis</i>? In an emergency situation it is not reasonable that people may have to do this. We need more specific direction on how it will be tested as to whether someone is <i>in loco parentis</i>, be it on a temporary or full-time basis. Between now and legislating for surrogacy, for instance, will the second parent be deemed <i>in loco parentis</i> until they have statutory standing? How do they qualify?</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> With regard to carers' leave I note the Bar Council made comments on consistencies and inconsistencies with the Carer's Leave Act in this regard. Something that strikes me, and I will explore it further on Committee Stage, is that under employment equality law we have family status protection that would consider aspects of caring. Therefore, there is a protected status for someone with a child or another member of the family with a disability or an impairment. There is quite a body of law in the Labour Court about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Given that is a protected category, its intersection with this legislation needs to be considered, particularly in the context of the bar to having access to this entitlement after 26 weeks. We need to give this greater consideration. It is just one of the issues that we need to think about further on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> The next concern is that there needs to be a significant medical issue, as per section 5. How is that verified or adjudicated upon at short notice? Where does one cross the threshold into a significant medical issue? How does an individual know that he or she has reached that threshold and can avail of the related entitlement? We need feedback and further exploration in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> While I welcome the fact that domestic violence leave has been included, I have some concerns <i>vis-à-vis</i> the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the retention of domestic violence-related data. The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 which governs Garda vetting provides that only a designated person is allowed to hold information of a disclosure on the PULSE system related to an employee. We need to be very sensitive with regard to domestic violence leave. Where someone accesses such leave, and I would wholeheartedly support his or her right and entitlement to do so, there needs to be a sensitivity with regard to the storage of the related data.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">I have one final point to make. I thank the Acting Chairperson for her indulgence. It should be incumbent on every employer to set out the entitlement to flexible working or remote working, although I would stress that the latter is completely distinct and very different. When employers are creating a role, they should be obliged to set out the entitlement, and the ability, to perform that role in a flexible or remote way. There should be an objective test at the very beginning. Otherwise, employers are going to come unstuck in terms of how they adjudicate because it will be very personalised in some instances. We are in somewhat dangerous territory here and could be opening the door to a flood of Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_293"> While the Bill includes a number of important provisions for family carers, there are several aspects of this legislation which are of concern. I refer specifically to the list of those for whom unpaid carer's leave days or flexible working can be applied. This definition excludes applicants in respect of care provided to non-relatives who do not live in the same household. I am conscious that members of the LGBT community, for example, may rely on friends and other members of their community for care. The Bill's narrowing of the meaning of family is at odds with the spirit of pending referendums around the definition of family and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> My party colleagues in the Dáil previously highlighted the Bill's defects in the context of the required sharing of personal information. Again, I am concerned about this requirement for members of the LGBT community who, for historical reasons or for fear of discrimination, may not wish to disclose personal medical information to their own or their carer's employer. I ask the Minister to consider whether there is another less intrusive way to deal with that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> I also wish to raise the very important issue of maternity leave for Oireachtas Members. Despite a number of Opposition amendments being proposed, the Government failed to bring forward amendments to provide for maternity leave for Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas. When this legislation was approved in September, the Government signed off on using it to provide for maternity leave for Oireachtas Members. In October, the Minister, in response to a parliamentary question, informed Deputy McDonald that it was his intention to introduce maternity leave provisions in this Bill on Report Stage in the Dáil. In November, that intention was restated but we have not seen the amendments yet. I ask the Minister to provide an update. Why were maternity leave-related amendments not tabled? As this Bill will shortly conclude its legislative journey, I ask him to clarify whether it is now his intention to introduce separate legislation to provide for maternity leave for Oireachtas Members?</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> While I welcome the Local Government (Maternity Protection and Other Measures for Members of Local Authorities) Bill 2022 which provides leave for councillors and temporary substitution for all councillors who are absent, I would point out that Members of the Oireachtas do not have access to those same provisions. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">I thank Senators for their detailed consideration of and response to the draft Bill. I will do my best to address as many of the issues raised as possible. A wide range of issues were raised, many of which we can look at in more detail on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> I will begin by addressing the points made by Senator Keogan regarding the heads of the Bill that were published in the summer. In the heads of the Bill, we set out a range of objectives for this legislation, one of which was to ensure that where a trans person becomes pregnant, they can avail of maternity leave in the same way as anybody else and that goal continues to be achieved in this Bill. My concern is not with how we achieve the goal but with achieving it and we have done that. I am very happy to make changes to legislation when appropriate and have demonstrated that with many of the Bills that I have brought through this and the other House. I have listened and made changes. We have made changes in the terminology here which achieves the goal and hopefully assuages any concerns that Senator Keogan or others may have had.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> It is also important, in the context of the earlier use of terms such as the erasure of women, to put on record my passion, as Minister with responsibility for equality, and that of this Government to protect and strengthen the position of women in the workforce and across Irish life. In that regard, I would draw attention to certain provisions in this legislation. Obviously, while the provisions for carers and parents are not solely directed towards women, as Senators Sherlock, Pauline O'Reilly and others said, it will primarily be women availing of those provisions. Again, the provisions on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are not solely directed towards women but we know, to our shame, that the vast majority of victims of such violence are women.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> The provisions on breastfeeding will benefit women returning to the workplace. Beyond this Bill, I would point to the work I have done on childcare, with massive investment to provide sustainability for childcare providers. Again, the providers of childcare are, for the most part, women. They are female entrepreneurs who have set up their own businesses. We have seen 73% of childcare staff get a pay increase and we know that 95% or 96% of them are women. I would also point to the work the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, has done on the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and on implementing the O'Malley report recommendations, not to mention the work done by the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, on the women's health action plan and the introduction of free contraception for women. Senator Warfield also referred to the work being done by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, to ensure that female local authority members have access to maternity leave, which is a really important step. It is important to restate the work this Government has done and the work being done by my Department to protect and strengthen the role and position of women in society and in the workplace. Senator Sherlock spoke to the advances we have seen in terms of women's participation in the workforce, particularly with regard to full-time work. We want to see that continue, and this Bill is part of that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Regarding Senator Currie's concern about the right to request flexible work remaining available to parents and carers, the right to request remote working is available to all workers. I share her concern about that distinction. That is why, when I agreed to the proposal by the Minister that we amalgamate these two Bills, he agreed to my proposal that we examine that difference after two years. There is a specific review provision built into the Bill to examine after two years whether to extend the right to request flexible work beyond parents and carers to broader categories. The Minister agreed with my proposal to put that in and that is something I welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> The Senator spoke about the implications for women of the difference in workforce. It is worth recognising that this is the first reporting period for the Gender Pay Gap Information Act, which we passed last year. We are soon going to see that information, which will be so valuable for the Government's and State's understanding of the gender pay gap and having a better understanding beyond the raw numbers. We know the numbers but it is about getting a deeper understanding of that with regard to employees, and primarily women, looking to target companies where they see a real effort is being made. There is also a requirement in the legislation that the companies themselves have to bring forward proposals for how they can start to bridge that gender pay gap. All of that will be kicking in following the publication of that information.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> Regarding terminations, there is a provision for an employer to terminate remote working arrangements but there are protections for employees built into those provisions to make sure it is not an unbalanced process. The employer can only terminate under the "any other relevant matters" provision, if it is relevant to the substantial adverse effect on the operation of the business. Employers are required to consider the employee's needs when making a decision. They are also required to have regard to the code of practice when making a decision. The code of practice would provide guidance on the process. An employee may make a complaint to the WRC if they believe the employer has not fulfilled the obligations under that section. It is not just a raw or hefty right to terminate, as the Senator described it. There are procedural protections around that particular point.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> Senator McGreehan and others spoke about the DSGBV leave. I think everyone welcomes that. As I said, we will be one of the first EU countries to introduce it. There has been discussion about the amount of time provided. Recognising that this is a brand new leave, and that it is paid leave so there is an obligation on employers, we decided to introduce the five days' paid leave now but also built in a review clause after two years. Normally we review legislation after a bit longer but we thought, with regard to both this issue and the previous one we discussed, that it would be important to review them quickly. After two years, we will review the paid DSGBV leave provisions with regard to their uptake and their adequacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> Senator Sherlock spoke about the rate at which the leave will be paid. Again, that is something that can be looked at. As it currently stands, we are looking at parity with sick pay but that may change. We have to start this process somewhere. It is important to state that few other countries have paid DSGBV leave at a national level. Quite a few have unpaid leave but very few have paid leave. We are starting something new, novel and valuable and we have built in a mechanism to review it rapidly. Two years is enough time as it will let it go through two cycles but at the same time allow for changes to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> It is also important to remember that we did not just say we would bring in this paid leave. We are also doing a piece of work, led by officials in my Department, to develop template policies for employers, both around how they will implement paid domestic violence leave but also more generally on how they engage with employees who have been victims of DSGBV. That is a concrete and useful support to employers. When I engaged with the social partners, particularly on the employer side, they were nervous about this. Senator Seery Kearney raised the issue of GDPR. They were nervous about having the knowledge that one of their employees was a victim of DSGBV. I can understand that. We are looking to put in place policies that will help them in that regard. We made a call early on that we would not require proof to be brought forward to access this leave. Is an important step in making it easy for people and not forcing anyone to go through unnecessary hoops at a difficult time in their lives. Any information in any application for this leave will of course be governed by the well-known rules of GDPR in terms of what an employer can or cannot reveal. I hope the introduction of those policies will help address the concerns Senator McGreehan raised about women potentially feeling pressured not to take up that leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> Senator Gavan mentioned that the Bill is implementing EU law. Part of it is but there are three significant elements that go beyond EU law obligations, namely, the introduction of the right to request remote working, the extension of breastfeeding breaks and the introduction of paid DSGBV leave. None of those are EU requirements. They are programme for Government commitments or, in the DSGBV leave situation, go beyond programme for Government commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> It is important to state that the five days of DSGBV leave are a statutory minimum. That will not impact in any way if an employer, be they in the private or public sector, decides to do more. A number have done so, in both the public and private sectors and I welcome that. Just as there are minimum rates of holiday leave set out in domestic legislation, that does not impact an employer giving more as a recruitment tool, nor will this.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> Regarding the comparison with the UK legislation, the UK has only published draft legislation. It is just a response document and, therefore, it is a distance behind us. It is important to recognise that our Bill does not contain a ground for refusal of the right to request remote working, whereas the UK sets out eight explicit grounds under which an employer can refuse. We learned from the debate during pre-legislative scrutiny, when there were 13 reasons for refusal in the draft Bill and they were heavily criticised. In that way, our Bill shows an improvement to the approach adopted by the UK. Our legislation contains an explicit requirement that in making a decision on granting the right to remote working, the needs of the employee be considered. That does not exist in the UK legislation, nor are there any limits on the number of applications that can be made under our legislation, whereas the UK proposals contain a limit on the number of possible requests. Our legislation, which has now passed through one House and is before another, stands up strongly to that draft proposal, which as yet has a lot more meat to be put on its bones.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> I have addressed a number of the points Senator Sherlock raised about the five days and the rate at which the payment will be made. With regard to appeals and engagement with the WRC, an employee can appeal the refusal to the WRC on the basis that the employer did not apply the statutory code of practice, which will be developed by the WRC and put on a statutory basis through a statutory instrument. That is a big change, following on from what was outlined during the pre-legislative scrutiny process around how the call would be made. It was decided that a code of practice would be developed by the WRC between employers and employees for how requests for both flexible and remote working would be adjudicated on. Where employees believe they were refused in breach of the code of practice, they can go to WRC. That allows the WRC to engage in a somewhat substantive analysis of what is happening. A range of redress options is set out, including a direction by the WRC or the Labour Court to an employer to fulfil their obligations, or compensation of up to four weeks' remuneration, to be paid by the employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> Senator Seery Kearney asked about the term "significant" with regard to medical issues and the definition of "leave for medical care purposes".</p>
          <p eId="para_313">We are relying on that term, as used in the directive. We considered broadening it out and providing more definitions but, inasmuch as the Tánaiste was criticised for going into more detail when he set out a range of reasons to refuse a right to request remote working, we felt using the language of the directive was the right way to go. If we seek to overly define the term, we risk narrowing the availability of this leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> Policies will be put in place on how DSGBV leave will be applied. That will strengthen and, I hope, address concerns around GDPR and the retention of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> This important legislation brings us into compliance with a key EU directive and advances the position of employees generally, and female employees in particular, in the workplace. It works to support the return of female employees following maternity leave and seeks to protect some of the most vulnerable people in the State, namely, victims of domestic violence, and ensure they too can be supported in the workplace. It is positive legislation that is designed in a way that recognises the cutting-edge nature of some of the protections being provided and allows them to be re-examined within a reasonably tight timeframe. This will allow us to go even further or make changes to ensure these new rights can be as effective and widely available as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> I look forward to hearing from Senators regarding potential amendments on Committee Stage. I thank the House for its consideration of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_321">That Seanad Éireann, noting that the Government on 13th December, 2022, nominated Mr. John Curran, Ms. Maura Quinn, Mr. Alex Attwood and Professor Caroline Fennell for designation by the President to be ordinary members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin, recommends that, pursuant to section 9(9) of the Electoral Reform Act 2022, Mr. John Curran, Ms. Maura Quinn, Mr. Alex Attwood and Professor Caroline Fennell be designated by the President to be ordinary members of An Coimisiún Toghcháin.” </p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Peter Burke)<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_322">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion, which recommends the appointment of four ordinary members of the Electoral Commission, An Coimisiún Toghcháin. An Coimisiún Toghcháin will be a statutory, independent body and indeed, the motion before the House reflects an coimisiún's accountability to the Oireachtas. An coimisiún will take on a broad range of existing and new electoral functions. As a specialised body, it will bring about a more cohesive and efficient administration of electoral functions in Ireland. In line with international best practice, it will be independent of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> Its functions will include a new policy research and advisory function to advise the Government on electoral issues, oversee the electoral register and review the conduct of future electoral events. An coimisiún will have a new voter education and awareness function, expanding on the work which referendum commissions did so well. An coimisiún's work will aim to increase participation in, and awareness of, our political processes. It will take on several existing statutory electoral functions from other bodies, including the work of the Referendum Commission, the registrar of political parties, the constituency commission and the local electoral area boundaries committees. An coimisiún will also have responsibility for the regulation of online political advertising. To ensure our elections remain free from hidden influences on how we vote, an coimisiún will regulate the compulsory labelling of paid online political advertisements during electoral periods. This will help to ensure transparency in the run-up to elections and referendums.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> Independence features strongly in the appointment process which the four nominees came through. The Electoral Reform Act 2022 outlines this process requiring that the Department engage with the Public Appointments Service to independently identify and recommend the best candidates. The Act sets out seven key criteria to which the Public Appointments Service had regard. These include electoral matters, the administration of electoral systems in Ireland and internationally, public administration and expertise in financial matters, expertise in ICT and its application in the context of elections and referendums, and advertising and publicity, particularly in respect of the digital aspects of a political campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> The selection process was advertised in October 2022 and 30 applications were received. The final interviews took place in late November and the names of four successful candidates were provided to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. I am confident that the candidates selected by the Public Appointments Service will bring a broad range of skills, perspectives and experience to an coimisiún. Their experience takes in such areas as electoral matters, corporate governance, oversight, public administration and expertise in political campaigning. The Act requires that the Public Appointments Service strives to achieve a gender balance across the ordinary members and I am pleased this has been achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> An coimisiún will comprise seven members in total. In addition to the four ordinary members who are the subject of the motion, two <i>ex officio</i> members, namely, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Ombudsman, will also sit on an coimisiún. The holders of these senior public offices have for a long time been involved in the functions which an coimisiún is taking on, for example, constituency commissions and referendum commissions. An coimisiún will benefit from their experience, competence and integrity.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> The chairperson of an coimisiún will be a serving or retired judge of the High Court, Supreme Court or Court of Appeal who is nominated by the Chief Justice and appointed by the President. This process is ongoing. The Judiciary traditionally has a strong association with electoral functions, with the chairpersons of previous constituency commissions and referendum commissions being a member of the superior courts. It is very welcome and appropriate that this association is continued in an coimisiún.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> Returning to the motion before the House, and An Coimisiún Toghcháin's ordinary membership, the standard term of office for ordinary members of an coimisiún is four years, with one reappointment permitted. However, it is important that an coimisiún has a gradual turnover of its members. Accordingly, in line with section 11 of the Act, the Government is recommending that two of the candidates, namely, Ms Quinn and Mr. Curran, be appointed for four-year terms, while the two others, namely, Mr. Attwood and Professor Fennell, are recommended for three-year terms. Subject to the passing of the motion before us this afternoon, these appointments will be made by the President.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> The road to the establishment of An Coimisiún Toghcháin has been long. I am greatly looking forward to the establishment of an coimisiún very early in the new year. It is more important now than ever that many of our electoral processes, which sit right at the heart of our democracy, are brought together in a single home with a broad focus, which is set up on a regulatory and advisory footing. The candidates I put before the House today are well placed to be at the core of an coimisiún and it is my privilege to recommend these candidates to the House for appointment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NiallBlaneyIND" eId="spk_103">
          <from>Senator Niall Blaney<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_330">Fianna Fáil supports this motion recommending the appointment of four candidates nominated by the Public Appointments Service to the board of An Coimisiún Toghcháin. An coimisiún is scheduled for establishment in early January 2023, which is welcome. It must be established as a matter of priority to facilitate the review of Dáil constituencies in line with our constitutional and legal requirements. Its necessity was made clear by the recent census and I hope it is commissioned as soon as possible with a view to bringing forward recommendations on those new and amended constituencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> I welcome the gender balance in the appointments. I also welcome the Northern Irish representation on the commission. Many of us have advocated for the vote in presidential elections to be extended to all Thirty-two Counties on this island. Northern Irish representation is important and welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> It is also important that the new commission will take a close look at constituency boundaries, particularly with regard to counties that are broken up. It is important that representation in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, particularly the Dáil, is in line with local authority areas. I speak in particular of the areas I know best, which are Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon. Many people in those areas are not satisfied with representation being broken between county councils. That south Donegal can be represented by people who normally would be elected in a different boundary area that is not aligned with the local authority area is an unsatisfactory situation. I hope that will be an issue that the seven people who will sit on the board will be conscious of when they make new decisions in respect of boundaries in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The Electoral Reform Act requires the commission to conclude its work no later than three months following the publication of the final census. I believe the final census results are expected at the end of quarter 1 of 2023. The constituency review work is expected to be completed by summer 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> More broadly, the commission will be sensitive to the functioning of and public confidence in our electoral process. Our next scheduled electoral event, which is the local and European elections, will take place in summer 2024. It is vitally important that the commission is in place and gets to do its work, particularly with the new function relating to online political advertising and ensuring integrity of our electoral events, and, as such, protecting our democracy. The Electoral Reform Act provides a legal basis for significant electoral reforms in line with the commitments in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. It includes the establishment of an independent electoral commission and modernisation of our electoral registration process. It will deliver greater accessibility and improve integrity, including improved voting arrangements, for persons with mental health difficulties. That is particularly important work. It is too easy for our current system to be tampered with, particularly in the run-up to general elections when people apply online. It is not currently serving us well.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> The regulation of online political advertising to provide for transparency in political advertising in the online sphere during electoral periods will support open political discourse in our democratic process in a way that will protect it from hidden influences. There are also commitments regarding integrity of elections, public health restrictions, political donations and island voting. The idea of having a vote on our islands on the same day as the inland vote is taking place needs to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> I welcome the independent appointments of the four persons mentioned. I look forward to the work of the commission. The work it intends to do is needed, particularly at the moment, to ensure we have effective public representation in protecting our democracy and institutions. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Senator Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_337">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Cuirim fáilte freisin roimh an ainmniú seo de cheathrar chuig An Coimisiún Toghcháin. Is coimisiún fíorthábhachtach é seo ó thaobh toghchán don todhchaí sa tír seo, agus tá sé neamhspleách freisin. I welcome the Minister of State. I welcome the progress in the establishment of the Electoral Commission and congratulate the four nominees, subject to the signature of the President. I know they initially expressed an interest, and it is important that people have an interest in serving on the Electoral Commission. They then succeeded in getting through interviews and were chosen. They have important work to do. It is the first Electoral Commission to be chaired by a serving or retired judge. That is an important point with regard to accountability and the respect that people have for the Judiciary.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> The Electoral Commission's most important initial work will be with the boundary review. I would prefer if it had been established earlier and if it was further along in the process than it is. It has to be established, go through public consultation and engagement, and then it or the Minister will decide on the number of seats in the new Dáil. I am not sure who will make the decision. The commission will then determine the boundaries. From soundings, that is likely to happen next June or July and will be legislated for before the summer recess. That is important because in any role or job, people need to know where they stand. Electoral boundaries are important for any practising politician. They might not exercise the general public too much, but for serving politicians and people who want to be politicians, they are important. People are impacted and upset when counties are divided by new electoral boundaries. South Mayo is part of the Galway West constituency. A proposal to include south Mayo in the name of the constituency was turned down. People in south Mayo rightly feel they belong to Mayo and would rather it stayed in the county for electoral purposes. That may occur, subject to the next boundary review. It has happened in other places, including Carlow, Tipperary, Limerick, Clare, Leitrim, Donegal and even Westmeath. It is important that, where possible, the division of counties is limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> The electoral register is another important issue. In some ways, this will become easier because the register can move to an online system and more people now have means to check the register and so on. Compilers used to physically go out to new estates, at least to some degree, and some local authorities were better at this than others. What role will local authorities have? In my engagement with Galway County Council, it is happy to pass the parcel to the Electoral Commission so that it will do the register and the local authority will not have to do it. If an estate has been built in the last two or three years, with 50, 60 or 70 houses in it, people will move in, with some being from the locality or others from a neighbouring town or county. By the time they organically decide to change their voting location on the register or to check the register, when they realise it is something they should do, it might be very close to the election. One might find that the residents of a new estate are totally disenfranchised in the subsequent election. The Electoral Commission and county or city council should engage with residents in new estates at an early opportunity. Once it is known that a new estate is occupied, they should get in there and ensure that a majority of people are registered. There will always be changes. People will move. I would be concerned if we are leaving new estates without an accurate register of their residents.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> We have a proud history of referendums in this country. It is not always easy. An independent electoral commission has had to be established for every referendum, which is now a role for this Electoral Commission. It is important work. I congratulate the Minister of State on his involvement in this. I hope to see the boundary commission established as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Senator Mark Wall<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_341">I welcome the Minister of State to the House for the debate on this important motion. I welcome this announcement, given its importance to our democratic process, as referred to by colleagues. The Labour Party will support the motion. It is five months since the Electoral Reform Act 2022 was passed but its four independent members are only being appointed today. Will the Minister of State inform the House if there is a reason for the delay in the nomination process and what happened in that interim period? We now have the names of the nominees in front of us. Will he also indicate what work has been completed in the period since July. I know much work needs to be completed. What work is intended to be done in the coming months? What are the timeframes? Colleagues have referred to a final report being concluded in June or July. Will the Minister of State confirm what he knows about that?</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> The four people nominated are Ms Quinn, Mr. Curran, Mr. Attwood and Professor Fennell, and I welcome their expertise and the gender balance. I know of no reason these individuals should not be nominated. I am aware of their expertise and how important that will be for the vital and important tasks they have ahead of them. This expertise will only assist in this important process. I wish them well in that work. They have an important job to do on behalf of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> I concur with colleagues who have raised the importance of maintaining county boundaries, where possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">I speak as someone who experienced this situation and was unable to vote in one election in 2016. The rules were changed again in the following election. This causes a great deal of strife and anger, particularly when the announcements are made after the event. I refer to situations where those voting are not aware that they will be voting in a different county. This causes problems, as other Members have already stated, concerning the boundaries of county councils, etc. Where possible, I know that the commission will look at this aspect because it does cause a lot of strife.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> A question was asked about public consultation. I am not sure what public consultation can be undertaken concerning county boundaries, but people only finding out they are no longer voting in their own county on the day of the announcement of the report is not a good place to be. Public consultation prior to that would allow people to know that such a possibility was being discussed and this would mean a lot to many. It will allow them to be part of the process as well, which is also important.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> As other Members have done, I also wish to mention this age of communications we are in now. Internationally, we have seen the effect online advertising has had on the democratic process. The commission has a body of work to do in this regard. It is important that it recognises what has happened in other jurisdictions. I am sure the commission will look at this context. Equally, the commission is responsible for increasing public participation in our electoral system. This is another part of its remit. Voter education is key to our election process, as is greater voter participation on election days. This is also important, and I am again asking whether there will be public consultation regarding voter registration and public participation on election days and if this is also part of the commission's remit. The Minister of State might confirm whether these aspects are included. It is safe to say that voter education is crucial to the democratic process here and it is vital to our democracy in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> My other issue is that of the rolling register. I spoke to my local authority regarding this issue in recent weeks. As was also mentioned by one of my colleagues, panic sets in during the run-up to an election. I am not sure if these dates have been tied down or if the commission will be examining the deadlines set for people to register to allow them to have and exercise their democratic rights and vote on election days. I do not know if these dates are changing or if this aspect will be considered by the commission. It is important, however. Many people fail to vote and then panic that they do not have the ability to vote when it comes to a referendum or Dáil and local elections. The Minister of State might respond to confirm if this matter will be a part of the commission's remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> I again welcome this important work and wish the four nominees well. I look forward to reading the report. The Minister of State might confirm when it is expected to be published.</p>

        <speech by="#AliceMaryHiggins" eId="spk_106">
          <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_349">I welcome the Minister of State. I join others in welcoming the nomination of the four new members of the commission. I congratulate them on being successful in achieving these nominations. They bring a good and diverse range of skills which will assist the work of the electoral commission. To highlight one question, I am aware that Professor Fennell brings a particular expertise in respect of gender, which is important in the work of encouraging wider engagement in our electoral system in the context of gender equality. She is one of the nominees who will potentially serve a three-year term. I flag this point because it may be an important aspect, following on, as it does, just a few years after Votáil 100 and when we are still trying to ensure that we have equity in participation among those standing in our electoral system. This would be useful in terms of the education of voters, as well as the wider education function of the commission, because there is something to be done here not just in terms of voters but also in encouraging candidacy and participation in our elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> In addition, on an international level, I am extremely proud of our proportional representation system. I think it is one of the best electoral systems in the world. Ireland and Malta have this system operating. It has been adopted in some US states and it is a system being debated around the world now. Having a permanent electoral commission, therefore, that can explain and talk about our electoral system and the single transferable vote-proportional representation system internationally will be very useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> Sadly, however, what I need to focus on for the rest of my time is what is missing. I refer to the large missing piece in respect of the mandate which these new members of the electoral commission will be taking up. We brought forward a proposal, a Bill on Seanad reform, at the very beginning of the last Oireachtas. We were asked to put that proposed legislation aside and, instead, to engage in a cross-party implementation group that would consider the Manning report. We agreed, through that process, with a Seanad reform Bill that was going to offer ways to expand and address the many inequalities that exist in respect of the electoral franchise for elections to the Seanad. We put aside our initial Private Members' Bill and we engaged in that cross-party process. We gave legislation to the then Taoiseach, and now Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, but no progress was made.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> At the beginning of this Oireachtas and the Twenty-Sixth Seanad, we again brought forward proposals on Seanad reform. We were again told we did not need to progress them because all these issues were going to be addressed in the context of the electoral commission Bill and when that legislation came through, these functions would be absorbed and addressed through the electoral commission. It was incredibly disappointing, therefore, when the electoral commission was established with a massive, ostentatious gap when it came to the Seanad. The legislation refers to chapter 7 on boundaries relating to the Dáil and the European Parliament and chapter 8 concerning local authorities. We have the European Parliament, the Dáil and the local authorities included in the work of the electoral commission, but the Seanad, the second House of the Oireachtas, the one which has probably had the most controversy in respect of its electoral arrangements, the most issues raised in this regard and the most legislation on the Order Papers trying to address the problems existing terms of electoral representation, constituencies and the configuration in this regard, is ostentatiously missing from the mandate of electoral commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> We brought forward and proposed amendments to include provisions on the Seanad. We brought forward specific proposals based on the proposals from the cross-party Seanad reform implementation group, on which sat the current Acting Chair and Senator McDowell, along with many others. We also tried to bring forward amendments to state that, under its policy and research remit, the electoral commission would be able to examine the Seanad, its electoral system and reform. We referred to the widest, simplest mandate to even look at the Seanad and even this was not agreed to. We have this electoral commission that leaves out a massive part of the elections in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> We must remind the Government that it did not win the referendum to abolish the Seanad. This House does still exist. In that context, it seems very odd that we have an electoral commission which does not look to the Seanad. I know it may not be within the remit of these new ordinary members of the commission to add topics as they wish, although I wish they did have this freedom. This is an issue that will, however, come back up repeatedly as an incredible omission at the time when we are doing something that I very much welcome, that is, to establish a permanent electoral commission in this State. I ask the Minister of State whether he can comment on the plans to review and widen the remit of the commission. This would be useful. I again congratulate the newly-nominated ordinary members of the electoral commission.</p>

          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_355">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for bringing this information to us today. To be fair, Senator Higgins has made a telling contribution in this context, no matter what one's view is on Seanad reform or one's position regarding this House. I am anxious not to digress from the matter before us, but if we are to build upon the Taoiseach's contribution on this subject last Monday and his claim that he saved the Seanad, as the leader of the Government, and in the context of this proposal of the nomination of the four members of the electoral commission and its wider body of work, the omission of the Seanad from the terms of reference does, from a cursory glance, seem glaring.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Maybe it is not. If it is not then the Minister of State will illuminate us and tell us. We look forward to having that debate at a later date. Building on last Monday if we are serious about reform of the Seanad, my position as Acting Cathaoirleach, as Senator Higgins knows, has not changed from when I was on that piece of work, the McDowell report. There is a legitimate role for the county councillors and Members of the parliamentary community in addition to extending and writing the franchise. How we arrive at that end game is what we can work on. </p>
          <p eId="para_357"> I welcome the appointment of the four members. The one who will gain the headlines will be former Deputy, John Curran, who is a very fine person and I have no issue with him. Also Alex Attwood who is a former politician in Northern Ireland. Professor Fennell in UCC is an extraordinary person and I wish all of them well in their role. The new Electoral Commission, if I am correct, will present new electoral boundaries to the Houses of the Oireachtas by next summer based on the census. The number of Members of the Lower House will then increase. I have been clear in my view that the Electoral Commission for its success is not going to be about its impartiality because it will be neutral and fair. It will not be that it does its work. It will be its failure to read and recognise the submissions made about the composition of the next Dáil electoral boundaries. We had the controversy this morning with the planning and development around the new An Bord Pleanála about community groups and residents’ associations. Equally the Electoral Commission could become potentially mired in controversy over its failure to acknowledge legitimate submissions by people across the board. I will give two references, the first of which will not surprise Members. We have disenfranchised thousands of people in Cork City who are living just by my left arm here in the Chamber and voting in a constituency with which they have no affinity or anything in common. It is not right that a person living in Bishopstown on the north side of Curraheen Road cannot vote as the people on the south side of Curraheen Road can do. That is not right. I am challenging the Electoral Commission today in this House to look at the way in which they draw the electoral constituencies in order to be fair to people and communities. I accept that proportionality must apply in order to meet the constitutional requirements. I understand that. However as a State we can be creative when we want to be in many different ways. The second example is in the context of the number of seats allocated to a constituency. It is five, four or three. One of the successes of the local election was the increase in the number of seats to six or seven in some cases. </p>
          <p eId="para_358"> I welcome the appointment of the four people, two of whom I know. They are excellent people. The four come with tremendous track records and I wish them well. </p>

It was considered a great deal by the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, of which I am a member. We teased out many options. We heard from many people. The independence of the Electoral Commission is critically important. I have every confidence it will be independent. The Government has really tackled this. The days historically of gerrymandering constituencies and manoeuvering for political expedience and political favouritism are long over and about time. I am not suggesting that happened in recent times. It was way back. We have to instil and encourage confidence in our electoral system whether we are dealing with electoral matters, administration of electoral systems, the funding of them which is critically important and there has been much discussion about the funding and issues around it. This is important. I hold the view that we should centralise our system but that is not something that came through. It is going to be maintained in each of the local authorities. That was clearly decided as the best option. I commend the Minister. He engaged heavily with it. This is really important legislation. It is the beginning and we can work on it. I also commend him on the candidates which I believe are the best candidates. They have been chosen for skills and experience that they will bring to the job. I wish them well.</p>

          <p eId="para_363">I thank Members for their contribution on the motion. I wish the nominees the very best on their appointment to the President. I will respond to a few concerns and statements by some of the Senators. In regard to the electoral register which Senator Kyne raised, the Act provides for the extensive modernisation of the electoral register. These provisions were commenced in October. Local authorities still have full responsibility in compiling the register. Obviously the Electoral Commission will oversee the register. That is a significant responsibility on their part. In regard to public consultation, it is at its core when the boundary commission sets about doing its work. It will be open to conduct a public consultation at that juncture. In the Act, three months after the final census figures, the report must be completed. Going on that trajectory we hope to have the new boundaries legislated for before summer. That is important as the Senators pointed out both for the electorate and people practising politics. Senator Wall raised a number of issues on the timelines on when the Act was brought through the House. I assure him that a transitional team, led by Art O'Leary, provided administrative preparations for An Coimisiún Toghcháin and its establishment. The work it carried out in the intermediate time was setting out and getting agreement on the commission's organisational structure, drafting the commission's internal governance documentation and procedures, putting in place an coimisiún's ICT structures and services including its website, working with the Office of Public Works, OPW, in respect of an coimisiún's office accommodation and agreeing an coimisiún's budget for 2023. As Members will be aware its budget is €5.7 million. They are working to get a chief executive at that juncture through the public appointments service. The competition for the ordinary members was advertised on 13 October. Interviews were concluded at the end of November and we are obviously now at this juncture where we have the four nominees before us. I anticipate that the chief executive selection process will be advertised in the coming days. Hopefully we will have a chief executive in place by quarter 2 of 2023. That puts more meat on the bones of the journey we have travelled since the Act was brought in.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> Senators Blaney, Kyne and Buttimer raised the constituency boundary commission. The publication of the final results of the census will be in spring 2023. I look forward to continuing further. On Senator Buttimer's point, I reiterate that public consultation will be at its core. In regard to Senator Higgins' point the programme for Government set out the trajectory of the commission. The debate in regard to Seanad reform has been a permanent fixture in the Oireachtas for a significant period of time. In an advisory capacity the commission can make recommendations in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_365">I leave it to Senators, as Members of the House, to try to square that circle. It is a significant body of work that has been raised on a number of occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> I thank Senators for their time. I am delighted these nominees will now be brought to the President.</p>

          <p eId="para_368">I am happy to update the House on the recent travel disruption at Dublin Airport and contingency planning in place for the coming weeks. We experienced the first snowfall of the year in Dublin last Thursday night. While all surfaces at Dublin Airport were pre-emptively treated through the night and were fully open and operational on Friday and throughout the weekend, unfortunately, passengers were adversely impacted by flight cancellations and delays due to the conditions overall at the time. The role of the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, is to maintain runways, taxiways, aprons and stands to facilitate aircraft movements . The DAA has advised me that it is well equipped to do this with all the necessary machinery available. Airlines and their ground handling service providers are responsible for de-icing aircraft. The DAA has advised that it put in place all the necessary preparation and work to ensure the airport remained operational throughout this exceptionally cold weather event. The DAA also advised that Dublin Airport's snow and ice teams worked throughout the night to ensure runways, taxiways, aprons and stands were fully operational. However, I understand that ice clearance was a challenge for the whole airport community on Friday due to the severity of the conditions. Some airlines experienced significant delays and disruptions to their flight schedules because of difficulties they had in de-icing their aircraft. I understand difficulties were also experienced at times in clearing ice from aprons and stands at the airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> I commend the continuing hard work of staff at the airport, and all those who operate within the airport ecosystem, who worked throughout the night and recent days to ensure the flights that did take off were able to do so safely. Safety must always be the top priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> As I mentioned, airlines and their ground handling service providers are responsible for de-icing aircraft. There have been between seven to nine de-icing units in operation at Dublin Airport by the relevant service providers over recent days. It is ultimately the responsibility of the airlines and their ground handling agents to ensure they have sufficient staff and resources in place to deal with demand. Some airlines flew in de-icing crews from other airports to bolster their capacity on Saturday and I understand these have remained on-site.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> The weather on Thursday night into Friday morning resulted in very high humidity, some precipitation and below-zero temperatures, which presented a particular challenge in respect of ground ice control and de-icing aircraft. Airlines typically get over an hour of effectiveness from a de-icing application of Glycol, although in some cases on Friday this was as low as 20 minutes. This created a significant and unusual level of demand on airlines and their de-icing contractors for repeat or enhanced de-icing and was the primary contributor to delays and cancellations on Friday and, to a lesser extent, on Saturday. Over the weekend, the major disruption experienced by passengers alleviated somewhat and the majority of first-wave departures from Dublin Airport on Sunday morning took off without any undue delays.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> It is worth noting the disruption to passengers was not confined to Dublin Airport. The weather over Thursday and Friday was not as severe in the west of the country and while our regional airports remained open and operational, they were impacted to some extent by issues at other airports, which resulted in some delays to inbound flights and cancellations. Stansted and Gatwick Airports had to close temporarily to clear snow from their runways, and yellow warnings of ice, fog and snow have been in place for much of the UK. The DAA has advised that the delays and cancellations experienced by passengers since Sunday have largely been driven by weather and subsequent flow restrictions at UK airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> As Senators are aware, the national emergency co-ordination group, NECG, met on Sunday to provide details on weather conditions expected this week, to review current and potential impacts across all sectors and to understand the mitigation and contingency measures in place. Representatives from the DAA and Shannon Airport have attended the daily NECG briefings and have provided regular updates to the NECG and my Department on operations at our State airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> I remind Senators that EU Regulation No. 261 of 2004 sets out the rights of air passengers and the resulting obligation on airlines in the event of cancellation, denied boarding and flight delay. In summary, in respect to the cancellation of flights, the regulation provides that where a flight is cancelled, the air carrier must offer the passenger the choice of: rerouting as soon as possible after the original departure time; rerouting at a later date; or a refund of the cost of the unused flight ticket. If the passenger chooses to be rerouted as soon as possible, the airline should offer care and assistance, which should include meals and refreshments; hotel accommodation where an overnight stay becomes necessary; and transport between the hotel accommodation and the airport. If an airline does not provide care and assistance, passengers should make their own reasonable arrangements and retain all receipts in the process. Passengers are advised to then submit copies of these receipts to their airline for reimbursement. In Ireland, the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, is the designated body in the context of the enforcement of the regulation. The CAR is proactive in its engagement with airlines on matters relating to the application of passenger rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> My officials and I continue to engage regularly with the DAA in respect of operational readiness at the airport this Christmas. The DAA is particularly focused on passenger throughput times at security screening given the busy holiday period ahead. Earlier this morning, I met with the DAA's interim CEO and senior management who updated me on Dublin Airport's readiness for the expected busy Christmas period. The plan is focused on ensuring lane supply meets passenger demand on an hour-by-hour basis in each terminal. The DAA also has several contingency measures in place in the event that they may be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> Recruitment and retention of security airport search unit, ASU, officers remains a key area of concern for the DAA. However, it has advised that it continues to recruit - as it has done continuously over the past 12 months - for a number of roles at Dublin Airport. The DAA's concerted recruitment campaign included its recent jobs fair, which attracted more than 800 potential candidates. The DAA is focused on generating a strong pipeline of potential candidates for the roles available to enable the authority to meet both the current and future needs of the business. Over the year, following a concerted recruitment campaign in 2021, an additional 300 security officers are now employed at Dublin Airport. Currently, the security ASU headcount is 645, which means that the DAA is at 90% of staffing levels compared with the same period in 2019. There are also more than 100 other security staff who work at the airport's vehicle control posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> On passenger wait times at security, I am pleased to advise that, since the summer, Dublin Airport has experienced vast improvements in security queue times. The DAA has advised that, last month, 90% of all passengers queued for 20 minutes or less and 98% queued for 30 minutes or less. In total, since June, almost 17 million passengers have been processed through the airport without any significant security related challenges. I assure the House that I will continue to engage with the DAA as we welcome those arriving in Dublin Airport for the Christmas period and facilitate those who are departing from the airport to reconnect with loved ones over the festive period.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Collectively, our focus will be on ensuring all passengers using the airport have as seamless a journey as possible at this busy time of year.</p>

          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_379">I welcome the Minister of State and thank her for her presence this afternoon. I acknowledge that we have a severe weather alert and there has been a major issue across Europe with weather incidents. It is important that the 35,000 passengers and travelling members of the public who have been discommoded over the past five days are looked after and adequately and properly recompensed. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, which has heard concerns expressed around the preparedness of Dublin Airport Authority for the Christmas holiday period. Notwithstanding the weather, and the points the Minister of State made in her very informative speech, is the DAA prepared? What was the contingency plan for de-icing? The Minister of State mentioned that within an hour of de-icing, people had to be brought in to de-ice again.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> In the Lower House, Deputy McDonald, the leader of Sinn Féin, accused the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, of being asleep. To be fair to him, it is not the Minister's job, nor is it the role of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, to make sure everything is prepared and the airport is winter ready. It is the role of the DAA. I know from engaging with the management and staff of the DAA that they are very competent and capable people, but the debacle last summer raises concerns among us all, if we are being honest, and not just among the travelling public.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> Many independent commentators and analysts will tell us that travel numbers are back to pre-Covid levels. The Christmas travel period is coming. Representatives of Ryanair recently appeared before the transport committee and Aer Lingus representatives appeared at it this morning. I am a little concerned. The Minister of State indicated that the number of staff before Christmas was to be 800. There are now 645 so that leaves a deficit of 155 staff members. Representatives of Aer Lingus reported the same figures this morning at the committee. The company met the DAA about different issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> Our job in this House and on the transport committee is to represent the people and we would not be doing our job properly or correctly if we did not articulate the need for the DAA to come forward with a clear and precise plan. To be fair, the Minister of State gave us an outline of that based on her meeting with the DAA's chief executive. Does the Dublin Airport Authority have the capacity to deal with the surge in people travelling for Christmas? Mr. Kevin Cullinane, who is a very fine official and a valued member of staff and management in the DAA, stated the airport would be able to cope with the volume of passengers. We thought the same last summer and look what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> The Minister of State spoke about the number of lanes open, the number of staff on duty, processing ability and queue times. That is excellent but the plan is only as good as its execution. If the plan is not carried out to the letter of the law, there could be trouble and I do not want that to happen. As we all know, our aviation sector is critical to jobs and central to our tourism sector, both for inbound tourism and, more important, outbound tourism in the context of the perception of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> I am pleased the Minister of State has met with representatives of Dublin Airport Authority and was given reassurance. It shows that she and her colleague, the Minister, have been proactive. There is a grey area between the responsibility of the airline and that of the DAA. To be perfectly honest, the members of the travelling public do not care, do not know and do not necessarily want to know where the responsibility lies. All I want to know, if I am taking a flight from Dublin to Rome, for example, is that I will get there at X time, get back at Y time and I will not be discommoded. Anecdotally, I understand some people spent five days trying to get in and out of the airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> I thank the Minister for her presentation and her engagement. It is reassuring that she has been proactively engaged on the matter. She must hold the DAA to account. The travelling public want her to do that. I thank her for being here and for the meeting today.</p>

        <speech by="#EugeneMurphy" eId="spk_116">
          <from>Senator Eugene Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_386">Like Senator Buttimer, I extend the fáilte ar ais go dtí an Teach seo to the Minister of State. She has been here on numerous occasions and I fully acknowledge that she is in touch with the situation and is doing her best to handle it. We do not get snow and frost in this country very often and when it happens it throws down a challenge. To be fair to everybody involved, we are not like countries that are dealing with these issues all the time. Having said that, we need to make sure the Dublin Airport Authority has the capacity to de-ice and prepare for extreme weather events to maintain key connectivity through aviation. We know how important that is on this little island, particularly at Christmas or during the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> State agencies are established by law. They are resourced and people are appointed to senior positions. There is an obligation on them to be prepared and to respond to situations such as these. That said, Dublin Airport is not the only airport, as the Minister of State noted, that has had challenges during this period. Part of the problem was due to Manchester and Heathrow airports having issues. They had significant challenges and these spilled over into Dublin Airport. We should acknowledge that as well. There was severe fog and snow in the UK, which forced airlines to cancel flights causing disruption at Dublin Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> I am aware the Minister of State and her officials engage regularly with DAA senior management in relation to the be winter-ready operation, focusing particularly on security screening operations, which were among the issues experienced over the summer period. Senator Buttimer is right that none of us likes to be discommoded when travelling by air. We are on deadlines and we have to get to other places. I have seen people who get delayed at airports getting very frustrated. For those with families, it is extraordinary to be delayed at an airport and have to hang around for hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> In some parts of the country, people are saying the county roads and footpaths have not been gritted. This is because we are not ready every winter, even though we have lots of salt to ensure certain roads can be gritted. If Dublin Airport Authority believes I am wrong on this, that is fine, but in my view, the DAA has not got up and running again as it should have since Covid-19. The staffing levels are not sufficient, as Senator Buttimer stated. The Minister of State had some pretty good news in that respect but they are still not up to the level needed. What sort of deal are the people working in the airport getting? These are very important people running a very significant part of industry. They, and all the emergency services, should be paid and looked after well. Is the DAA offering them a good deal or is there a difficulty in trying to get people to work? I acknowledge that having 800 people attend a workshop is positive for employment in the future and hopefully that will have good results. However, I wonder if these people are being treated well enough. They are a vital part of keeping our society going, not alone at Christmas but throughout the year. Dublin Airport is an extremely busy spot.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> As regards dealing with the weather, I know from somebody inside the airport that there was a massive issue with de-icing. The runway was de-iced and before the planes were able to use the runway, the ice had formed again. As the Minister of State said, they had to be de-iced a second time.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">That is an extraordinary challenge and safety has to be a priority. In general, I am satisfied the Minister of State is doing her best. I know she is keeping a close eye on the situation coming up to Christmas. We do not know how the weather will be. Met Éireann seems to say it will go this way or that way and we could still have frosty, cold weather. I know the Minister of State is in touch with DAA, which I appreciate, but does the authority need to take a look at itself with regard to employing people again? It is important to have the exact number of people who are needed in the system to keep it flowing and working properly.</p>

        <speech by="#NiallODonnghaile" eId="spk_117">
          <from>Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_392">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. I thank her for being here. I asked on the Order of Business yesterday that we would have statements on this issue and I am glad the Deputy Leader and the Minister of State were able to facilitate that because it is an important issue. The Minister has laid out the reasons it is an important issue quite comprehensively. l acknowledge that we all accept this is a multilayered, multifaceted and multi-agency issue with responsibility across a range of Departments, State and non-State agencies, private interests and others. No one is saying an approach to these issues is straightforward or simple. Senator Buttimer will be familiar with the famous Cork man, Roy Keane, saying, "Fail to prepare, prepare to fail". That is the problem here.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> Colleagues have referenced the chaotic scenes in Dublin Airport during the summer, but it seems when we come in to talk about what is happening in the airport, we are not coming in to talk about how important the aviation sector is to our economy, communities, job creation and our tourism sector. We are coming in, unfortunately, to deal retrospectively with crisis management. Senator Murphy is correct in that we do not get extreme frost and cold snaps every year but winter is winter and it could come aniar aduaidh orainn, unexpectedly, at any stage. If we cannot be prepared for adverse weather that is cold and pretty standard, it does not bode well for planning for other even more unique and uncommon situations that might be faced down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> I agree with Senator Buttimer in that I do not think anyone expects it is the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, or any other Minister to get out to de-ice a plane or grit a runway but, ultimately, the clue is in the title. He is the Minister for Transport and this is a transport issue. We are reaching the point now where someone in government needs to get a grip on the numerous issues coming to light in failing to prepare. We have seen the evidence of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> I have to caveat my remarks by saying I am appreciative of the Minister of State's coming in here to outline the actions the Government is taking and the important points she made regarding air passenger rights and what passengers are entitled to. I encourage her, if she has not done so, to think of a way to get that message into the public domain better to ensure passengers are aware of their rights, entitlements and protections in situations such as those we have seen in the past number of days.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> It is not too much that we as representatives and, indeed, the community has the right to expect that a major European airport such as Dublin Airport would have contingency plans and strategies in place, especially in winter time, to deal with incidents of cold and adverse weather. There needs to be strategic oversight but responsibility also needs to be taken for the failure to plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> I would also like to acknowledge the workers in Dublin Airport who, not just over the past couple of days but the past couple of months and years, have been up against it. It has not been easy for them. They are all human and I hope they sympathise and empathise with the people who found themselves in this predicament at this time of the year. Together we have to ensure we give the staff and workers the capacity to deliver a first-class service that, in turn, makes sure that anyone travelling in or out, especially in the run-up to Christmas, gets out safely and effectively and in a way that causes the least amount of disruption for everyone. I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to come in. I wish to hear a bit more, not just about this situation, but the situation going forward to ensure there are no repeats in the time ahead. I wish to hear what the departmental officials and the Minister will do to ensure Dublin Airport is prepared and, ultimately, that the Minister will have the oversight to ensure delivery for people.</p>

        <speech by="#HildegardeNaughton" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_118">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Deputy Hildegarde Naughton)<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_398">I have listened carefully to the issues the Senators have raised and I assure them of ongoing communication with the DAA and weekly meetings on this. We are all on the same page in ensuring passengers make their flights on time and that we can move our passengers safely through the airport, especially over this festive period. I assure the Senators that is my priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> It is worth recalling why and how the disruption occurred over the weekend at Dublin Airport. Following the cold weather across the weekend, temperatures fell to below -5°C in many parts of the country and the average temperature on Monday evening was -2°C. According to Met Éireann, Ireland experienced its lowest temperatures in 12 years on Monday. The adverse conditions impacted our airports throughout the country, which resulted in flight delays and cancellations. Some flights were also diverted where necessary and possible. On Monday, three flights had to be diverted from Cork Airport, as low visibility conditions prevented them from landing. All three planes landed safely in Shannon Airport and returned to Cork when the conditions improved. However, this had a knock-on impact in that it caused significant delays to some outbound services.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> The United Kingdom also experienced its coldest weather since 2010. This meant passengers intending to travel to the UK by air this weekend were impacted, not only by the weather here, but by the conditions in the UK. Manchester Airport closed for a time on Friday and Gatwick and Stansted airports closed their runways on Sunday due to the bad weather. Delays and cancellations at these airports carried through to Monday and it is worth noting 70% of the cancellations at Dublin Airport have been related to flights originating from or departing to UK destinations. This reflects the high level of traffic between our jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> I am also advised Dublin Airport's ice plan remains in place and runways, taxiways and apron areas are being continuously monitored. An additional airfield-and-apron snow plan was implemented on Saturday night as teams worked through the night to clear deposits in anticipation of further freezing temperatures. These airport workers are commended for their ongoing efforts. It is important, as Senators have done, to acknowledge the hard work of all the staff at the airport for their dedication in helping passengers move safely through the airport. Of course it is not only airport staff who are involved in ensuring the airport remains operational and safe. Airline crew, ground handling staff and other support workers work to keep the airport open in order that flights can depart and land safely. The current weather events have magnified this intricate ecosystem once again. I thank them for the extra effort they are putting in.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> The DAA expects the airport will remain busy over the coming weeks with total passenger numbers on a par with the same period in 2019, although some individual airlines may be slightly above or below their respective 2019 levels. I am advised by the DAA that it also remains in continuous contact with the airline partners on the forecasted passenger numbers for the Christmas period. The House should also be aware that while the busiest days of the Christmas season at the airport will see a total of 90,000 passengers, Dublin Airport has been facilitating this level of activity on a regular basis since May. In fact, the airport has handled in excess of 90,000 passengers on more than 40 days this year with more than half of those days occurring towards the end of July.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> Security lanes were not mentioned in the debate and I will give the House an update.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Detailed hour-by-hour passenger estimates for the airport are examined by the DAA to calculate and plan for the number of security lanes required at any given time at each terminal. The DAA regularly communicates with its airline partners as part of this process to facilitate planning and the allocation of resources, as appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> With regard to the number of security lanes that are open at a given time, Senators will appreciate that it is not efficient, feasible or necessary for Dublin Airport to operate all of its security lanes at all times, especially when there may not be enough passenger traffic to make this essential. The DAA has advised that it plans to open the optimum number of security lanes required to satisfy anticipated demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> Again, it is worth noting, that since June, almost 17 million passengers have been processed through the airport without any notable security-related challenges. In November, 98% of passengers queued for 30 minutes or less. More recently, in the first week of December, 98% of all passengers queued for 30 minutes or less while virtually all other passengers were processed in under 45 minutes. There is a task force in place, overtime is available and a number of contingency measures are in place. The real evidence is the time it takes passengers to get through security and that is a measurement the Department is certainly watching.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> I stress to those who intend to travel that it is important they follow the advice of their airline and the airport and present at the appropriate time for their flight departure.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> I assure Senators that I will continue to engage with the DAA's interim CEO and senior management to ensure all necessary preparations are being made by the DAA in order that passengers have a satisfactory and efficient experience passing through the airport over the holiday period. I also assure the House that I will continue to engage with the DAA in the new year with regard to its preparation for the summer of 2023.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">I acknowledge the significance of the passing of the Bill. Last week in the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media, we welcomed representatives from Fáilte Ireland, including the CEO, Paul Kelly, the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, and the Department. I also acknowledge the significance of the extra capital expenditure provided under the Bill for an offering for tourists coming to Ireland. That cannot be overlooked. There are significant areas in my own county of Meath and on the eastern seaboard.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> One point that was raised by representatives in the debate on the broader context is the need for continued engagement on the hotel accommodation situation in the new year. The Minister meets regularly with the representatives. That is not her responsibility, but primarily a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Notwithstanding that, it was interesting to hear the IHF point out in the breakdown that a disproportionate number of those fleeing from the ravages of war are in counties like Kerry where 30% of the accommodation is now taken through those schemes, and 50% in Donegal. It is something we are going to have to grapple with very early in the new year to make sure that we do not reach the cliff edge in March or April.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> It is interesting that 70% of our tourism revenue comes from the international tourism market. Those people would have their bookings made and their accommodation secured. Those who face the squeeze will be domestic tourists who might only book in April or May of next year. They will be the ones who will get squeezed on price because of the shortage of accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">A big effort by all of Government is required. In the context of this debate, the capital expenditure provided for in the Bill in terms of what we can offer people is hugely important. </p>
          <p eId="para_416"> I wanted to make those points on the record given that representatives of Fáilte Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media attended last week's Oireachtas committee meeting.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinGarvey" eId="spk_123">
          <from>Senator Róisín Garvey<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_417">I welcome and thank the Minister. She has done stellar work since assuming her role. I am from north Clare, which is heavily reliant on tourism, and were it not for the work the Minister has done with regard to finances, many tourism businesses there would have closed. I wanted to acknowledge that.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> I am happy to support the Bill but wish to make a couple of points. The Minister is working on the development of a new sustainable tourism policy. It is important that we see this work coming to fruition. We want a green tourism agenda, not a greenwashing agenda and there is already some of the latter in the tourism sector. We hear a lot about eco-this and eco-that but when one looks into the product or service, one finds that it is not ecologically sound at all. The Wild Atlantic Way is a good initiative but it also increases driving and has made some roads unsafe. We need the tourism sector to promote public transport to get places and we also need more tourism initiatives that promote walking and cycling. Slow tourism leads to higher spending, yet we had a new Burren driving route presented to us by Fáilte Ireland recently that will increase car traffic in the Burren, an ecological UNESCO site. When I asked the Fáilte Ireland representatives about walking and cycling routes, they said they would come later. We cannot increase the number of cars coming into an area and then hope we will increase participation in walking and cycling. </p>
          <p eId="para_419"> Where are the segregated bins for tourists? Where are the shuttle services so people can avoid bringing their cars to areas of natural beauty? Why can tourists not be brought to these areas by way of small electric buses? Where are the restrictions on giant tour buses? One-way systems are in operation in County Kerry but we cannot do the same in County Clare. We have asked the tourism operators to do this but they have refused. The Burren eco-tourism network has also asked them but they said "No" so we have this crazy situation where there are giant buses travelling in both directions. Where are the restrictions? This is something that Fáilte Ireland will have to address. Where are the drinking fonts to refill water bottles so that plastic bottles are not thrown into our ditches and all over lovely parts of County Clare and everywhere else? </p>
          <p eId="para_420"> We need to raise our game. If money is going to be invested in tourism, it must be in sustainable tourism. It is not enough to keep using the word "sustainable". The management of the Cliffs of Moher is looking for lots of money, which is great, but it is not making sure that local villages benefit. It is looking at shuttle buses but is not including the option for local people to use them. It is not giving proper consideration to walking and cycling routes or taking these options seriously. </p>
          <p eId="para_421"> If we do not get this from Fáilte Ireland down, it will not work and that is something I wanted to make clear today. I welcome the Minister's work on the Bill. She is a great Minister for tourism but she is also a Green Party Minister for tourism. This is the Emerald Isle and that is why people come here but we will lose that attraction if we do not take care of our biodiversity and reconsider how we travel. The slower that people travel, the more they appreciate a place. They fall in love with it and then they come back again.</p>

          <p eId="para_423">The Minister is welcome. I concur with the comments of Senator Cassells on the recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media, of which I am a member. The IHF painted an extremely stark picture. The Minister is well aware of this and is engaging with the stakeholders but a strong conversation will have to take place early in the new year or the tourism industry will be decimated.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> I come from Longford and was involved in the development of the Hidden Heartlands brand to try to promote tourism in my region. This region had the lowest tourism numbers in the country. We had started to build a product but now we are facing a situation where there will be no accommodation for tourists who come to the area. This needs to be at the top of the Minister's agenda. I also reiterate what I have said on a number of occasions, which is that the Minister needs to look again at the VAT rate because the entire industry is facing into a difficult period due to the accommodation situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_426"> As I have outlined previously, this is a technical enabling Bill but its outcome is important in that it allows for the continued funding of Fáilte Ireland's work in the area of tourism product development. I look forward to working alongside Fáilte Ireland as we continue to further the development of Ireland's tourism offering. </p>
          <p eId="para_427"> As Senator Garvey said, I am the Minister with responsibility for tourism but I am also a green Minister and deputy leader of the Green Party, which I would never forget. I am working on the development of a sustainable tourism policy and I see amazing opportunities ahead as we emerge from Covid. My engagement with the industry tells me that stakeholders want to embrace sustainability and put the green into our Emerald Isle. We have so much to offer here in terms of slow tourism and long stays but we must make sure that the protection of our environment is at the core of what we do. This new tourism policy will seek to support sustainable economic development in communities throughout the country while protecting our environment and natural resources. It will also aim to promote a greater spread into the regions and encourage longer stays. I will raise the concerns articulated by Senator Garvey, some of which are the responsibility of Fáilte Ireland while others are under the remit of local authorities. </p>
          <p eId="para_428"> I acknowledge the concerns of Senator Cassells regarding accommodation. We are in the middle of what is, by some distance, the largest humanitarian operation ever undertaken by the State as we give refuge and shelter to those who are fleeing the most horrific circumstances in Ukraine. However, as I said last week in this Chamber, I am very aware of the concerns relating to the wider tourism industry and am engaging on a consistent basis with the sector. My officials and myself are also engaging with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. Across the board in government, we are working urgently to source alternative accommodation from agencies, NGOs, and local authorities. I am cognisant of the need to ensure tourist accommodation is available before the peak tourism season begins. That said, we are resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine. </p>
          <p eId="para_429"> Senator Carrigy expressed a similar concern with regard to accommodation and also referred to the VAT rate in the tourism sector. As I have said previously, the latter is something that we will keep under constant review. We may have to make a call on it in the new year. I thank Senator Boyhan for his kind words.</p>

          <p eId="para_433">The celebrations over the last few months have been very timely. I was honoured to see the portrait downstairs of Tras Honan who is a Waterford woman and is originally from County Clare. She was the first ever female Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and it is fitting to mark her achievement. I say well done to the Cathaoirleach on all of his work and all the support he got from Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the House on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2022. The Bill was published on 24 November and concluded its passage through the Dáil on 7 December. I welcome the support received in this House for the Bill and the core principle of community rating, which is a long-established and well-supported Government policy for the health insurance market.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> Currently, over 46% of the population in Ireland hold private health insurance. This amounts to 2.4 million people and represents a total annual premium income of approximately €2.97 billion. Health insurance in Ireland is provided according to the four principles of open enrolment, lifetime cover, minimum benefit and community rating. In our community-rated health insurance system, customers are not charged based on their risk profile. This means that the premium charged for a particular health insurance product is the same for everyone. Insurers cannot take into account personal circumstances like health status, risk or age in which case older and sicker people would pay much more for health insurance than they currently do.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> Risk equalisation is a mechanism designed to support the objective of a community-rated health insurance market. The risk equalisation scheme has operated in the health insurance market since 2013 and is provided for under the Health Insurance Acts. Under the risk equalisation scheme, insurers receive risk equalisation credits from the risk equalisation fund to compensate for some of the additional costs of insuring older and less healthy members. The risk equalisation scheme is a carefully calibrated and highly complex scheme. Risk equalisation credits are funded by stamp duty levies. The levies are payable by health insurers on all health insurance contracts written and are paid into the risk equalisation fund. The risk equalisation scheme is designed to be Exchequer-neutral. It is not funded by the State, nor does the State derive any funds from it. None of the stamp duties on health insurance contracts go to the Exchequer. They are all used to fund the credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> This is an annual technical Bill comprising eight sections, all of which focus on the specific area of health insurance. A health insurance Bill is necessary each year to update the amounts of risk equalisation credits paid to insurers and the stamp duty levies required to fund them. The rates of credits and levies are based on recommendations from the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, following an evaluation and analysis of health insurance claims. The Minister for Health has approved the risk equalisation credits to apply in 2023 and the Minister for Finance has approved the corresponding stamp duty levies. As the risk equalisation scheme is deemed to be State aid, it must be approved by the European Commission. It was duly approved in March 2022 to operate until March 2027.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> In addition to the standard technical amendments, this year's Bill provides for the specification of the end date of the act of entrustment. This is the legislative mechanism under which the risk equalisation scheme operates. This is a requirement of the European Commission as part of its approval of the risk equalisation scheme earlier this year. The end date of the act of entrustment should be viewed as a technical end date required under European law. This date matches the duration of the Commission's approval of the operation of the risk equalisation scheme. The Bill provides for the Minister to specify a new date after consultation with the European Commission and the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> The Bill makes further provision for the appointment and powers of authorised officers of the HIA, thus strengthening the enforcement powers of the authority in carrying out its role as regulator of the private health insurance market. I will now outline the specific sections of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> Section 2 amends the principal Act by inserting a new section 6B, which specifies the end date of the act of entrustment - the legislative mechanism under which the risk equalisation scheme operates - as required by the European Commission as part of its approval of Ireland's risk equalisation scheme. The end date for the period of entrustment should be viewed as a technical end date, which is required under European law. This section provides for an order-making power for the Minister to specify a new date after consultation with the European Commission and the Minister for Finance. This power will provide the Minister with the authority to extend the duration of the period of entrustment in exceptional circumstances to ensure the continuity of the risk equalisation scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> Section 3 amends section 11C of the principal Act to provide for 1 April 2023 as the new effective date for revised credits payable from the risk equalisation fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> Section 4 amends section 18E of the principal Act by making further provision for the appointment of authorised officers of the HIA. The amendments outline in more detail who may be appointed as an authorised officer and when the appointment may cease.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> Section 5 amends section 18F by extending the current legislated enforcement powers to non-registered businesses purporting to be carrying on health insurance business in Ireland. This amendment bridges a limitation of the existing legislation which permits investigation of registered undertakings. Again, this section follows, insofar as possible, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, as amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> Section 6 replaces table 2 in Schedule 4 of the principal Act. This table revises the applicable risk equalisation credits payable from the risk equalisation fund in respect of certain classes of insured persons. The amounts are applicable on or after 1 April 2023. The Bill provides for a decrease in the age-related risk equalisation credits payable across approximately half of the age groups over 65. These decreases are to facilitate the redistribution of high-cost claims credits, which results in a more targeted distribution of credits based on health status rather than age.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> Section 7 amends section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to specify the stamp duty rates to apply to the market in 2023. The amount of stamp duty levy is calculated to offset the costs associated with the payment of risk equalisation credits. The HIA recommends the amount of stamp duty levy to the Minister each year, having regard to the risk equalisation fund. For next year, the stamp duty payable on non-advanced health insurance contracts from 1 April 2023 will be €109 per adult. This is a decrease of €12 from 2022 rates. The rate per child will be €36, which represents a decrease of €4. On advanced health insurance contracts, the stamp duty will be €438 per adult. This is an increase of €32 from 2022 rates. The rate per child will be €146, which represents an increase of €11. A surplus of €55 million, or 7% of the fund, is expected next year as there was a lower level of claims on the fund than anticipated. The HIA recommended that this €55 million should be used to reduce the amount of stamp duty to be charged from 1 April 2023. The rates of stamp duty payable incorporate the €55 million surplus. This surplus has built up because of lower claims due to lower levels of hospitalisations as a result of Covid-19, and an increase in expected stamp duty receipts due to higher numbers of people entering the health insurance market than had been projected.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Section 8 provides for the Short Title, commencement, collective citation and construction of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> While the Government continues to maintain the community-rated private health insurance market, I will conclude by highlighting its commitment to improving public health services under the Sláintecare programme. As access to these services improves, the Department will monitor the impact on the health insurance market over time. I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_449">I am standing in for Senator Conway. I welcome the Minister of State. I hope this is not her last time to address the Seanad as Minister of State at the Department of Health because, to be fair to her, she has been a very proactive Minister of State. I do not say that patronisingly. As a former Chairperson of the Joint Committee on Health and Children I found it refreshing to see her take on vested interests in her Department. I commend her on the work that she has done during her time in office. I hope that if she is not promoted elsewhere next week, she stays where she is in the Department of Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> As the Minister of State has said, this Bill is important as it deals with risk equalisation and private health insurance. However, I will begin on a discordant note. The HIA produced a report last summer which found that some private health insurers were not fully compliant with the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2020. I hope that the whole issue about the obligations under risk equalisation being fulfilled will be dealt with, and the incidence of non-compliance will be identified and published, but in the main it has been well done.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> This whole issue is about the march towards universal healthcare and Sláintecare. In welcoming the progression of Sláintecare, which is the proposed model to deliver the healthcare system, and the advances we are making, I would have a fundamental worry about Sláintecare. On a personal level, I worry that it may not deliver what we want. Having said that, last week the Minister for Health was successful in being able to get the new hospital consultants contract over the line and I congratulate all involved. </p>
          <p eId="para_452">It is positive that we will see public hospitals being used as such and the whole reverse in terms of private and weekend use and so on. It is important that we recognise that delivery is working.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> At the Seanad 100 celebration last Monday, Dr. John Bowman spoke about his Japanese political scientist. I often wonder how an outsider would view our healthcare system in terms of the way in which we administer and pay and fund it. I should put on record my appreciation to those men and women who work day in, day out in all parts of the healthcare system. They do a tremendous job.</p>

          <p eId="para_455">I thank them for that. I know first-hand from my own experience this year of how much work they do and the care and attention they give to the families and those patients who need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> The Sláintecare consultant contract is transformative. A public-only hospital contract is to be welcomed. Then, in tandem with that, there is €23 billion in the healthcare budget for this year. We have increased the number of acute beds with a 26% increase in critical beds. Senators Gavan or Maria Byrne will come into the Chamber and speak about capacity in places like the emergency department in Limerick hospital. I see it in Cork. To be fair to the Minister of State, she has tried very hard to apply the model of care in the community at home. I hope that in the next round of Sláintecare, however, we will take that piece and augment and add to it in the context that the best place to care for people is in the community and at home. The Minister of State has been a champion of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> We have an issue of capacity around emergency departments, however. They are chock-a-block. Whether that is because of the variety of delivery of free schemes to people now I do not know. GPs will tell the Minister of State they are swamped, however. They have an older and younger cohort in the middle. They cannot cope. They cannot get people. Staffing is a big issue across the whole country. In conclusion, rather than delay the House, we will obviously be supporting this as a party. The advance of Sláintecare is to be welcomed. I thank the Minister of State for being here tonight.</p>

          <from>Senator Victor Boyhan<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_458">I welcome the Minister of State. At the outset, I echo what Senator Buttimer said. I thank the Minister of State for her ongoing engagement and support in this House at all times, be it for Commencement matters or legislation. She is always willing and ready to come to the House and meaningfully engage with Members. That is acknowledged and appreciated across the House. I wish her well at the weekend's deliberations and all that goes with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> To get back to business, we are dealing with the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2022. The Minister of State set out the rationale and I understand that. It is an annual event that happens every year. Indeed, the Minister of State might have done it last year as well. What I really wish to say is that we need greater scrutiny and clarity in terms of the options for private healthcare. It is one of a facet of choices people have in healthcare. The Minister of State spelled that out too. It is an option. People are entitled to take out private healthcare and they pay for it. It is an expensive care package, really. That is the reality of it. Most of us will have had private health insurance for many years and never made a claim, but we never quite know when we will have to make a claim. There is a comfort in that as well. It is costly, however. The big issue in terms of consumer protection is that there are so many differences and different packages and policies. I would like to have a debate another day on how we can be clearer about what people are getting for their money and what it says on the tin. I know myself it is always difficult to ascertain. There are always variations and changes within one's own policy, be it Vhi Healthcare or whatever. I ask the Minister of State to take that away with her.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> I will deal with two or three points from the Minister of State's presentation to us today. She referred to a surplus of €55 million or 7% of the fund. She went on to say: "This surplus has built up because of lower claims due to lower levels of hospitalisations as a result of Covid-19." We know that. In some cases, some of us would have received money back from Vhi Healthcare and private health insurers last year and the year before unexpectedly. One could call it a refund or bonus or whatever but we got cheques back, which are always nice to get. We need to see all around the policy of that, however. It is clearly a Government decision to ring-fence this money. The Minister of State set that out and I have no difficulty with it. I would like if we could have a bit more background paper on that from the Department at some stage in terms of the policy and the surplus. We know it is €55 million. That is a considerable amount of money. There are various choices around that. I do not expect the Minister of State to go through them today but it would be helpful if we could have a briefing note on the policy, governance and decision-making around how she apportions that percentage of funding. She went on to say that "the programme for Government commits to retaining access to private healthcare ... " I would agree with that too.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> Senator Buttimer touched on Sláintecare and universal healthcare. That begs the question about universal healthcare, which is something we have been promised for many years but do not seem to be making real progress on. It was very much on the platform of the manifestos two or three elections ago. It continues to raise its head and we do not seem to be any nearer to it. I know we have had different setbacks. I welcome anything that sees further progress of Sláintecare. While we are not really dealing with Sláintecare, I will take the opportunity to say there is progress. It is slow and it could be faster but I recognise there are many constraints. It is something on which we need to continue to focus. I think the Minister of State very much for her presentation today.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineArdagh" eId="spk_135">
          <from>Senator Catherine Ardagh<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_462">I stand again today for my colleague, Senator Clifford-Lee. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House. It is always great to see her. She has done some super work in mental health and in her portfolio. I wish her the best of luck.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Fianna Fáil will be supporting this Bill. The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2022 is somewhat akin to the Finance Bill and Social Welfare Bill, arriving in November or December every year just like Santa. The measures within are designed to support risk equalisation and sustain community rating in our health insurance market in order that older citizens and people with illnesses can afford health insurance and are not discriminated against in favour of younger and healthier people.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill provides that stamp duties on non-advanced health insurance contracts will increase to €109, which is a decrease of €12. This comes on top of a decrease of €35 this year. Stamp duties on advanced health insurance contracts will increase to €438, which is an increase of €32.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> It should be pointed out that despite this increase, the levy on advance cover will still be lower than 2021. The stamp duties collected on health insurance contracts do not go to the Exchequer. They are collected into the risk equalisation fund and redistributed in the form of credits to health insurers to compensate for the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy people. I very much welcome this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> With regard to health insurance and how it links with orphan drugs, we know many health insurance providers such as Vhi healthcare and others are now paying for orphan drugs. They would have been under a lot of pressure from large policyholders and multinationals to pay for these drugs because they are available when they pay for health insurance in other countries. However, I would like to see a space where orphan drugs are more widely available to the public and those who do not have health insurance. I am hopeful that is something at which the Minister of State can look.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> This next item is not related to the Minister of State's Department. It is more of a matter for the Department of Finance, but I would hope that the Minister of State would bear her weight when raising it with Minister for Finance. The Central Bank (Amendment) Bill 2022, which deals with the right to be forgotten for cancer survivors, came before this House recently. I am Chair of the cross-party group on cancer that came up with the Central Bank (Amendment) Bill, which received massive overwhelming cross-party support in this House. The Bill seeks to ensure that cancer survivors who have had cancer in the last five years will not be asked questions regarding their illness when they apply for life insurance policies or other financial products.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> This is not something novel we are starting in Ireland. This legislation is well-entrenched, especially in France. It was one of the main election items in President Macron's manifesto. They started out with people having a right to be forgotten for ten years and President Macron reduced that to five years during his presidency . There was strong rebuttal by the insurance companies and much lobbying was done in France. We are obviously seeing similar pushback in this country. I am hopeful it is something the Minister of State could raise with her colleagues, however, because it is really important. The Minister of State has spoken out about her own survival journey. I am sure she will be supporting this.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">It is one of the main priorities of the Irish Cancer Society.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> I will refer to another matter in order to finish to a very positive note; we have done great work this term on women's health and mental health services. We have menopauses clinics, endometriosis clinics, “see and treat” clinics, and a significant decrease in gynaecological waiting lists. Yesterday, we saw announcements about surrogacy. There have been significant advances in women's health and mental health.</p>

          <from>Senator Vincent P. Martin<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_474">As always, the Minister of State is very welcome to the Chamber. As has been stated, Ireland has a community-rated voluntary private health insurance market, which means all people pay the same price for the same health insurance policy. The risk equalisation scheme is the mechanism designed to support the objective of our community-rated health insurance market.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> The content of this Bill, which is largely technical in nature, is to be broadly welcomed as a fair approach to health insurance provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> I will use some of my time to point out that the Bill highlights and reminds us about the divide in the Irish health provision, between public and private services. While it is a very important Bill for people who rely on private health insurance, it is worth noting that it also ensures fairness across the system and guarantees that sicker people or those at risk are not paying more for their policies. However, as I stated, it highlights the unfairness in the health service that forces people to take out health insurance for fear that if they get sick the public health system will not be able to treat them in a timely manner. The health budget in Ireland is approximately €22 billion, yet around 50% of people here take out private health insurance. We are very much part of a two-tier system. The current two-tier health system has failed many. The creation of a waiting list acts as a perverse incentive, creating a need for patients to purchase health insurance in order to access treatment, as it offers the safety net of being able to access treatment if the need arises. That is because they are aware of the two-tier system. The result is a system of unequal access to healthcare with arbitrary barriers to access and often preferential access for those who have the financial wherewithal through taking out private health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> In all, there are currently approximately 897,000 on hospital waiting lists in Ireland. There are more than 97,700 children on waiting lists, which is one in four children on their respective lists for more than a year. The child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, have a waiting list of 3,914 children. Some 53% or 1,808 of them are waiting for less than 12 weeks for an appointment, while 9% or 221 are waiting longer than 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> We hope Sláintecare will herald a change. The Green Party policy on health is to support the reform of the health system through Sláintecare. This includes a single-tier health system based on need rather than the ability to pay, which is funded through general taxation. It includes multi-annual budgeting, activity-based costings and blended capitation schemes to incentivise efficient, targeted use of resources through our health system; a fully-funded national service of public health nurses at an advanced level, who would engage with patients in their own homes and who could refer patients, as appropriate. We must properly fund the wonderful people on the front line.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> Sláintecare includes increased numbers of advanced paramedics who could treat patients in their own homes so that they would no longer have an essential need to go to hospital. It is intended to have extended services in community pharmacies to increase the support for general practice services. Sláintecare will provide for more investment in general practitioner services to allow for minor procedures and specialist services to take place outside of hospitals. It is intended to reform the Health Service Executive and to set up local community health organisations which will include a balance of community and patient participation as advised by healthcare professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> There is a process in place through the Government to respond to the ongoing waiting list situation, but it has not yet resulted in what I would consider to be significantly reduced waiting list numbers across the public system. The Government says it is working with the Department of Health and the National Treatment Purchase Fund to improve access to care, fund weekend work in public hospitals, use private hospitals and provide virtual clinics. The latest news is the effort made to get consultants to work in public hospitals. It is all to be welcomed if people will buy into it, and if we attract consultants home.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> The cancellations that occurred during the height of the Covid-19 shutdown continue to have an impact and the health service is still catching up with it. A task force has been established as part of the 2022 waiting list action plan to reduce waiting times, yet they continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> I have used much of my time to concentrate on the elephant in the room, but I want to be fair – I know the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, in particular and the Government have made progress. I would like to put that on the record and commend it. Much progress has been made, but at a time like this when we are discussing a technical Bill, I want to draw attention to the long-standing reality of inequality in the system which is still a two-tier one. In the longer term, I would like to see that addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_489">That is a different story. As other colleagues have noted, the Minister of State is very welcome to the House. I also appreciate her regular engagement with this Chamber. Before coming to speak to the Bill before us tonight, I am sure she and other colleagues will join me in sending our solidarity and support to the nurses in the North of Ireland and in Britain, who are on strike at the moment. They will go out onto the picket again tomorrow. It is an absolute disgrace that they have to do that, not least in sub-zero temperatures. I call on the British Government to bring forward a deal that meets the needs of those workers, who are out for fair pay and better working conditions. In particular, I note the sterling work of Pat Cullen, the secretary general of the Royal College of Nursing, RCN. She is a Tyrone woman, but she has lived in south Belfast for many years and she has provided first-class leadership to the nurses there. I thought it was important to make reference to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> I have spoken on this legislation previously. I must reflect on my own experience as this State moves ever closer to a universal healthcare system. I am very conscious that I have had the privilege to grow up with a universal healthcare system, free at the point of delivery, in the North. It is deeply regrettable and hugely regressive that it seems the British Government is moving further away from that all of the time by hollowing out the NHS and moving to a privatisation model. We are seeing the consequences of some of that in the strike action by the nurses, but sin scéal eile.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> I want to set my comments on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill in the context of how people in need of the health service or those who work in it currently experience it at the point of delivery. I am stating the obvious when I say that our health is our wealth. Is fearr an tsláinte ná na táinte. From the cradle to the grave we all, at some time on the spectrum of life, will use the health service. I am also stating the obvious when I say that the health service of this State is not in a particularly healthy state. Currently, there are 1.3 million people on some form of health waiting list; 897,000 people on hospital waiting lists - 200,000 waiting for more than a year, which I acknowledge is down since last year, but nowhere near where it needs to be. Some 200,000 people are waiting on a diagnostic scan; 97,000 children are on hospital waiting lists; 100,000 children are on community waiting lists; and 18,000 on children disability network teams, CDNT, waiting lists. The Minister's approach to waiting lists is failing.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> It is no wonder that half of the population hold onto their private health insurance. However, we must recognise the shortcomings of private health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Sinn Féin tabled an amendment previously when the Government saw fit to increase the profit allowed for insurers from 4.4% to 6% with no improvement to those services. We sought to reverse this increase and to undo it at a time of rising costs of living for families across society. We are all caught in that cost-of-living crisis, whether it is rising energy costs, insurance costs, food costs or all the other costs that people face.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> All of that said, as the Minister of State will know from contributions in the other House, Sinn Féin will support this Bill as we always have. We recognise the reliance of many people on health insurance. It is an annual Bill that renews the risk equalisation mechanism that supports the community-rated health insurance market. The Bill revises the stamp duty levy on policies and the risk equalisation credits payable to insurers for 2023. It is a self-funded system. Risk equalisation ensures costs are constant across the lifespan of the individual. It seeks to ensure, where possible, that age, gender and health status do not influence the cost of insurance product. </p>
          <p eId="para_495"> In supporting this Bill, I want to make our criticism of the current insurance market and the two-tier healthcare system in this State clear. The two major areas in which little progress have been made and that are relevant to this Bill are, first, removing healthcare from public hospitals and, second, expanding universal GP access and free GP care. The lack of action is driving much of the private sector activity in healthcare, which is embedded in our public hospitals. We need, once and for all, as other colleagues acknowledged, not just to agree but to deliver on the commitment to disentangle private healthcare from public hospitals. In addition, the Government needs: multi-annual capital funding to enable quicker delivery of hospital expansions; a strategic workforce plan to expand training and the number of workers to deliver universal GP care or expand primary and community care to reduce the burden on acute hospitals; to address the shortage of home support assistants or transitional step-down beds; and a plan to remove out-of-pocket charges and make all health and social care free at the point of delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> While Sinn Féin supports this Bill, we do so because it is technical legislation. We do not support a two-tier health service. That is the crux of the issue. When it comes to removing private healthcare, to free GP care, investing in public health care, and reducing people's need for private health insurance, Government policy is defined by a failure to plan. This Government is without a health service plan and, unfortunately, it shows.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Mary Butler)<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_498">I thank all the Senators for their contributions to the debate. The Bill allows us to maintain our support for the core principle of community rating, which is a long-established and well supported Government policy for the health insurance market, and ensure that the cost of insurance is shared across the insured population.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> The main purpose of the Bill is to update the amounts of risk equalisation credits paid to insurers and the stamp duty levies required to fund them. The amendments outlined in the Bill will ensure the ongoing sustainability of the private health insurance market. It will allow us to maintain the community-rated health insurance market and it will increase the effectiveness of the risk equalisation scheme. </p>
          <p eId="para_500"> On some of the comments made, it is quite right that almost 47% of people have decided to have private cover in Ireland. I also want to point out that 44% either have a medical or a doctor-only card. We will see more people receive the support of a doctor--only card in 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> We are making a lot of progress on Sláintecare. The public-only consultant contract signed recently is a huge step forward. This was one of the important pieces of the jigsaw. That is something that we have to recognise. We saw the best of Sláintecare during Covid, when the vaccine roll-out was one of the best not only in Europe, but in the world. The vaccines were free at the point of contact for all people who wished to receive one. That has to be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> I am always conscious when I stand up in health debates that sometimes there is a lot of criticism of our health system. However, today I want to acknowledge and appreciate the 136,000 people who work in the system. I was in the Dáil last night at 11.20 p.m. taking a motion that was tabled on the challenges in emergency departments, and we recognised that. I was conscious at 11.20 p.m., when I was leaving the Dáil Chamber to go to my bed, that all over Ireland in acute and community hospitals, nursing homes, Caredocs and wherever, all of these people are working every night 365 days of the year to make sure that we are all safe, secure and that we receive the best healthcare possible. It is important to acknowledge that. These Houses go into recess for a month at the end of this week and we will see a new Taoiseach elected, but all of those people in healthcare will still be working. It is important that is acknowledged. </p>
          <p eId="para_503"> I wish to raise another point, because, as I said, we hear much negativity. This morning, for example, I was in Cherry Orchard and I was delighted to launch our 22nd integrated care programmes for older people, ICPOP, team. It is the most fantastic facility and a one-stop shop for older people to address the challenges they might have in, for example, their dietary requirements or whether they are risk of stroke or falling. A huge amount of work is being done. The most fantastic facility is being provided. Some 163 people were referred this year specifically for dementia. They are receiving the supports to age well at home with dementia, but also have the supports in the community. It is a lot of good work. </p>
          <p eId="para_504"> A huge milestone will be reached in University Hospital Waterford this Saturday. It will celebrate 1,000 consecutive days without a person on a trolley, which is an amazing achievement. I want to acknowledge Grace Rothwell, the general manager, her staff, the consultants, the doctors, the nurses, the healthcare workers, the porters and everybody who works in the hospital. To have that kind of an achievement is unbelievable. An awful lot of good work is going on and there is much more to do. I am happy to be in a position to try to effect change as best we can. </p>
          <p eId="para_505"> I will move back to the Bill again. It also makes further provision for the appointment and powers of authorised officers of the HIA, which is the statutory regulator of the health insurance market. These amendments strengthen the enforcement powers of the authority in carrying out its role as the regulator of the health insurance market. </p>
          <p eId="para_506"> The Government is committed to improving public health services under the Sláintecare programme, and the Bill demonstrates the Government's commitment to community rating. As access to public services improves, the Department of Health will monitor the impact on the private health insurance market. The programme for Government also commits to retaining access to private healthcare services for people in Ireland, ensuring choice for those accessing healthcare. </p>
          <p eId="para_507"> As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I say every day that the voice and choice of people has to be listened to. This Bill continues our policy of ensuring solidarity with and affordable premiums for less healthy or older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> Again, I thank all Senators for their contributions to the debate and for facilitating the passage of the Bill. I would also like to thank the three officials who have accompanied me in the Dáil and the Seanad to take the Bill. They put a huge amount of work into it and I thank them for all their work.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_521">In page 8, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</p>

          <p eId="para_523">I welcome the Minister of State. He will be aware that there has been substantial digitisation of maps but that several anomalies arose in the process. Some may be attributable to historical disputes due to the maps themselves not being clear but some may be the result of the digitisation process. This is particularly important in respect of protected disputes relating to land ownership in rural areas. We would be very keen to have the Minister of State examine this issue further and produce a report on it. I would welcome his response. I may not contribute again, unless something arises.</p>

          <p eId="para_524">I thank the Senator for his contribution. The proposed amendment relates to a report that Tailte Éireann be required to prepare, within six months of the passing of this Act, in respect of a review of the digitisation of the land registry and proposed reforms to expedite land disputes where title deeds are unclear. To add this additional function in the manner proposed would not have the effect sought by the Senators and would present practical difficulties, particularly taking into account the proposed timeframe for completing the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> The national land register is a legal register that operates under a non-conclusive boundary system and is subject to the rights of those in possession. Where anomalies appear, the Property Registration Authority, PRA, can update the map under set protocols and in the absence of dispute. There may be instances where a property was mapped many years ago and the boundary on the ground now is not as it was at the time of registration. Boundaries can change over time for a variety of reasons. </p>
          <p eId="para_526"> Procedures exist to rectify boundaries on consent; otherwise, disputes are a matter for resolution in court. There is no intention to change the statutory legislation grounding the functions of the PRA, Ordnance Survey Ireland or the Valuation Office.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> Tailte Éireann, when established, will be independent in the performance of its statutory functions, including the registration-of-title function. The PRA registers in accordance solely with the deeds, documents of title and maps lodged on application. Appeals arising from decisions made by it are a matter for the court by way of appeal under section 19 of the Registration of Title Act 1964. This will not change when the legislative functions of the PRA pass to Tailte Éireann under the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> It should be noted that, under section 23 of the Bill, Tailte Éireann may prepare and submit to the Minister such reports on its activities as it considers appropriate. In addition, under section 23, the Minister may give a direction to Tailte Éireann to prepare and submit a report, in writing, no later than such date as the Minister specifies in the direction, in regard to any particular matter relating to the functions of Tailte Éireann as the Minister considers appropriate. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to legislate for specific reports, as is envisaged by the proposed amendment. Unfortunately, therefore, I must oppose it.</p>

          <p eId="para_529">I wish to contribute on the back of that amendment in respect of the Land Registry. My point relates to a matter we discussed previously. The Minister of State will be aware of the key role that the PRA was likely to have played if, as planned, it had moved ahead with the proposal to have any rights of way or <i>profits à prendre</i> not registered with it expire automatically last autumn. There was a very welcome decision by the Minister in response to me and others raising the issue to ensure no mass expiry of rights of way and <i>profits à prendre</i>. Rights of way and <i>profits à prendre</i>, which are not necessarily possessions, are currently registered with the PRA. Not all of them are, but many exist through lengthy use. For those that have been registered, what are the consequences under the transfer, even regarding the land registry and digitised land registry? Is there a separate register? I am almost looking for an update on the implications for those rights that do not entail ownership but that are property rights nevertheless, how they have been registered and how the transfer will work.</p>

          <p eId="para_531">I move amendment No. 2:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_532">In page 8, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_533">"(8) Within six months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report setting out further consideration by his Department and the Department of Justice on the transfer of responsibility for the Property Services Regulatory Authority to the Department of Housing and its location within Tailte Éireann.".</p>
          <p eId="para_534">I had expected the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to be here. It is probably more suitable that a Minister from the Department of Justice is here to deal with this amendment. The Bill considers three of the main bodies responsible for housing and property in the State but not the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA. The placing of the latter within the Department of Justice means it is placed in a Department that is already overloaded.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">In the view of Sinn Féin, the PSRA should be located within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage because it has a more natural fit with the brief of that Department. Such a change would also facilitate greater reform of the regulatory function and regulation. Indeed, this was a recommendation of the Oireachtas committee. It is within the gift of the Department of Justice to facilitate this change. Although the Minister of State will probably not accept this amendment, I encourage him to begin those discussions within his Department, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Cabinet as a whole.</p>

          <p eId="para_536">I thank the Senator for his contribution. The intention of this Bill is to bring about the merger of the PRA, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Valuation Office. The provisions of the Bill include the transfer of the current functions of these bodies into Tailte Éireann. It is not envisaged at this point to expand the current functions of the existing bodies during the merger process. As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process for this Bill, the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage recommended that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage engage with the Department of Justice to consider integrating the PSRA with Tailte Éireann. I thank the Senators for their valuable contributions to the pre-legislative scrutiny process. The primary role of the PSRA is to regulate property service providers, namely auctioneers, estate agents, letting agents and property management agents. It is considered that the functions of the PSRA are not sufficiently closely aligned with the functions of the bodies already identified for Tailte Éireann, being the registration of deeds and title, State surveying and the valuation of rateable property. The Taoiseach, as head of Government under Article 13 of Bunreacht na hÉireann, is responsible for the allocation of functions between Ministers and for the overall organisation of the Government. Any changes to the functions are a matter for the Taoiseach and are not a matter to be dealt with in this legislation. Of course, these matters are always kept under review. Under the circumstances, I am opposing the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_538">I move amendment No. 3:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_539">In page 8, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following: </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_540">“(8) Within six months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the creation of a real time land transaction register similar to the Residential Property Price Register.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">I urge the Minister of State to support this amendment. At the moment, there is a real-time registry of property prices, the property price index. If you are interested in a house that is for sale, you can check the property price register to get a range of information on other properties in the area. By contrast, the land market is the most opaque market we have, despite the huge costs that are associated with such purchases. Land costs vary widely depending on location and other factors. Indeed, land speculation is a huge factor in the ever-increasing cost of housing. There is a need for greater transparency in this regard. The location of such a register in Tailte Éireann is another recommendation that the Oireachtas committee made in its report. I would welcome the Minister of State’s response and I ask him to accept this amendment.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Browne<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_542">I understand the intention of this amendment is that Tailte Éireann would commission a report to explore the feasibility of creating a register for land transactions. While I appreciate the objective of the Senator’s amendment, I will mention a number of reasons I am not disposed to accept this proposal. As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process for this Bill, the joint committee recommended that Tailte Éireann be given as one of its statutory functions the responsibility for maintaining a publicly accessible and searchable electronic register of land transactions that would include the price, location, size, zoning, date of sale and ownership details. This new register would operate on a similar basis to the existing residential property price register. With regard to data that are currently available on residential property sales prices, the PRA maintains the national land register, as Tailte Éireann will do on its establishment. The register is electronic, publicly accessible and searchable by anyone online at <i>landdirect.ie</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> A considerable amount of information is available. Such results give a description of the property, the date of registration, details of the owner and any burdens relating to the property, such as a mortgage or a right of way. Associated spatial data are also available. However, under current land registration legislation rules the national land register does not record property price. The property price register that is maintained by the PSRA, which is currently under the remit of the Department of Justice, holds information on residential properties by description only and includes price and date of sale. There is no associated spatial aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> The Civil Service Renewal 2030 programme includes the ambition "to develop and deliver trusted, evidence- and insights-informed public policy which advances the social, economic, cultural and environmental well-being of Ireland". Improved data quality, analysis and sharing can improve the evidence base for policy development and can drive more seamless delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> The pathways in Housing for All address challenges in our housing system. However, these do not exist in isolation but sit in a wider context. Under Housing for All, the Government's housing plan to 2030, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is committed to evidence-based policy development and will continue to improve data availability and analysis. The Government recently published its first annual update of the plan's actions, which sets out how the Government is responding to changed circumstances and ensuring that focus remains on delivery. Under the updated action 24.2 of Housing for All, the Government has committed to developing a national zoned housing land register, based on local authority development plans. This will build on the work that is under way for the introduction of the residential zoned land tax, which will be completed by quarter 1 of 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> We are also progressing proposals for the introduction of land value sharing measures in accordance with objective 8.1 of Housing for All. An updated general scheme of the land value sharing and urban development zones Bill was recently brought to the Government. This will be submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in early 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> As mentioned previously, there is already scope under the legislation for the Minister to call for reports. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to legislate for a specific report such as the report proposed here. The legislation provides that the board of Tailte Éireann will have the statutory power to guide generally the strategic direction of Tailte Éireann and to advise or make recommendations having regard to Government policy. I should point out that the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006 provides for the maintenance of a register of deeds and for the information to be contained within it. I am not convinced that the specific requirements proposed are necessary. Therefore, while I note the benefits of evidence to support policy development, as in the Senator’s proposal, the appropriate time for considering these matters is following the establishment of Tailte Éireann and the appointment of the board.</p>

        <speech by="#AliceMaryHiggins" eId="spk_167">
          <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_548">I have not tabled any amendments to this section because the matter I am raising has been provided for. My concern with regard to the transfer of functions from Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, relates to the fact that a new board structure will come in. There will be many new ideas. There will be huge pressure in relation to property registration, in particular. Things like zoned land will be key issues. I am a little concerned because it often happens when two bodies merge that some of the functions may not be as pressing or get as much political pressure. I refer, for example, to some of the functions that OSI has in its current mandate in respect of heritage, geographical features and ancient sites. These are all part of the mandate of OSI. I am a little concerned that some of the functions may not get the same attention when we transfer them. That is always the case when two bodies are blended and there are new strategies. I am noting my concern to ensure that when the functions are transferred, some of that geographic work, such as the tracking of our blanket bogs and heritage sites, does not become a poor relation under the new structure. That is a fear I have.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> I do not know if we are about to run out of time but I would like to mention another measure. When two bodies blend together and a new body is established, we must ensure there is full archiving. I appeal to those involved to ensure nothing is lost from the physical archives of OSI in any transfer. These archives are extraordinarily important for the history, geographical history and heritage of our State. </p>
          <p eId="para_550">I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that those functions which may not get as much political attention but are vitally important are not lost or neglected under new agendas which may come under the body and that the physical archives are fully protected in the transfer.</p>

          <p eId="para_551">I will follow on from what Senator Higgins has said. I do not know if any Senators have visited the Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, premises in the Phoenix Park. It is a unique and amazing premises. I have visited it and looked through many of the historical manuscripts and maps. It is an important facility. I raised this matter with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, who happened to take part of this Bill, given that he has responsibility for heritage. It is a unique building and a protected structure. The historical maps and manuscripts in it are amazing.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> The accuracy, colour and quality of the original ordnance and archive are rich. Many historians visit the building and a specialist trained group of people guard their job well. They love engaging. I have not been there in the past year or so, and do not know what is happening. These manuscripts are critical and need to be minded. I ask the Minister of State take that message back to the Minister. We need to be conscious of the significance, importance and great accuracy of these maps and manuscripts.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">While the three bodies are merging, the functions will not change. I understand that is not the concern of the Senators but, rather, the concern is that the functions will retain their importance, in particular the OSI and its archives and important history. It is a unique facility. I expect the new body will respect that. Section 37 states that all records will transfer over and I expect that will be done in a professional manner and the archives will be protected for posterity. I have heard what the Senators have said and that message will be carried back to the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_556">The transfer of land and other property comes up in a couple of places in the Bill. The Minister of State has heard about the value of the physical archive, and we will come to the content of the paper archive in a minute. The records are one piece. However, there are things that are not necessarily records. All archival material should be construed within the definition of "property". The particular property which is a great resource to the public and historians, when transferred, should maintain its function. I have not tried to amend the section, but I wish to convey the hope and expectation that the function of that particular property would be maintained in terms of being a public resource in the way that it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_557">In respect of the transfer of staff, I welcome that the rights, terms and conditions of the staff will be maintained, including their superannuation, pension rights and so on. That is appropriate. I am concerned that we need to ensure that pension rights will be properly maintained. I am looking at the intersection of subsections (4) and (5) in that regard. The Bill seems to state that the terms and benefits will be no less favourable than applicable, but subsection 4, which guarantees the continuation of pension rights, might be subject to a requirement for consent or approval from the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. I ask the Minister of State to clarify this. I do not know whether subsection (5) potentially undermines subsection (4).</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> I recognise that people's working terms and conditions may be transferred because the functions are changing and their roles may well change. I am trying to ensure that those who specialise in geology, geography or the documentation of geographic features are able to continue with those specialisations. There are some very specific specialists among the staff who will transfer. I ask that they do not end up working in filing and we lose some specialist functions or roles, even though their wages may stay the same.</p>

          <p eId="para_560">The Minister of State identified this section as relating to records. Records can be interpreted in a very narrow or wide way. Documents, maps and files are records, but the source documents which may have been involved in the creation of Ordnance Survey maps and materials input are also relevant. In many cases there is a huge historical archive in the process of mapmaking that OSI has undertaken. We know, for example, that place names are a key issue in <i>Translations</i>. OSI has had a particular mandate in terms of Irish and English place names, and is often very involved in strong local engagement, locally and historically, around the origins and appropriate translations of names. There is a wealth of material underneath the Ordnance Survey maps that we have. I urge the Minister of State to take the widest interpretation of records and not deal with end product pieces but also the ancillary materials that have contributed to a record. They are an incredible resource for us as a nation.</p>

          <p eId="para_573"> I am delighted to introduce this legislation on behalf of the Sinn Féin Seanad team. No disrespect to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, but it is disappointing that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, is not here. We have heard a lot of bluster in the past week about the importance of animal welfare to the Minister. We have requested a debate on the Oireachtas report produced in October but he has refused to come in to debate that. I appreciate the Minister of State coming in and giving of her time. I know she is a dog lover and look forward to hearing her comments on the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> I have been working on the legislation for over a year. I thank the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, for all its support in the drafting. I thank the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, and the Irish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, for their input. They live with the reality of the need for this legislative change. Like the Minister of State, I am a dog lover. I am the proud owner of a rescue dog, Cooper. He is a 15-year-old bichon. He was rescued from a puppy farm, where he as a stud dog, and now his only concern in life is that he has his stuffed pig and a warm sofa to curl up on. That is how it should be for every dog.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> It is timely that we are discussing dog welfare as we approach the Christmas holidays. It can never be said enough that if you are thinking of bringing a dog into your family, always adopt, do not shop and never do it at Christmas when there is so much else going on with families and in homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> The legislation has three elements to it. I will discuss each in detail, but first I thank all of the shelters across the country working at the coalface of dog welfare. They are overwhelmed with the number of dogs being surrendered due to post-Covid regret puppies and many have had to close their doors to accepting more dogs while they struggle to find homes for those already in their care.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> As a country, it is time we faced up to the fact that the industrial breeding of dogs and the ease with which someone can buy and then discard a dog has to change. We should all work collectively to do that. Dogs are being bred in poorly socialised conditions and go on to exhibit behavioural problems, which is why many are then surrendered. Owning a dog is a ten- or 15-year commitment,and not something anybody should do on a whim.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> This legislation would help to alleviate some of the capacity issues shelters are dealing with by ensuring that dogs seized under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 can be rehomed without delay. Section 2 amends section 38 of the 2013 Act to align it with the provisions in the Control of Dogs Act regarding rehoming of dogs that have been seized. Under the provisions of the Control of Dogs Act, a dog that has been seized as a stray or because it is unlicensed can, if unclaimed, be rehomed after five days. However, a dog seized under the Animal Health and Welfare Act must be retained until legal proceedings have concluded or it is voluntarily surrendered by the owner. Seizures under the latter Act include the most horrific cases we see of animal abuse and neglect, the ones that make the headlines. These are dogs left in their own faeces, dogs with urine burns and matted coats or those kept in crates to churn out puppy after puppy. No matter how professional and loving dog shelter staff are, they are no substitute for a loving family home. Shelters are noisy places and dogs can easily become stressed in such an environment, so from an animal welfare perspective, it is vital that once a dog has received any required veterinary care and been adequately assessed, it spends as little time as possible in kennels. Likewise, puppies seized at ports or from illegal puppy farms do not belong in shelters. There is clearly a lacuna in the law. If a dog seized under one law can be homed in five days whereas a dog seized under another needs to wait it out in a shelter for years, it is a lacuna that shows an incoherent approach to animal welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> In drafting this legislation, we have allowed for procedural safeguards to address property rights by requiring the oversight of a veterinarian and having regard to the code of practise established under section 25 of the 2013 Act. Apart from the obvious welfare benefits of the quick rehoming of dogs, there are significant savings for the organisations involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">It was welcome to see increases in the funding for animal welfare in the two most recent budgets and the Government, and in particular the Green Party, should be commended on that, but it is important the funding maximise the welfare of dogs. Preventing organisations from rehoming animals places a significant cost on the welfare organisation and those costs are often unrecoverable, even after prosecution. The passing of this legislation will free up financial resources to help more dogs with those shelters, which are struggling with capacity issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> A second element of this legislation relates to the tightening-up of the dog licensing system. There has been much talk in recent weeks following the horrific attack on wee Alejandro, to whom we all send our best wishes on his road to recovery. What happened to him should never have happened and it would not have happened if we had enforced the Control of Dogs Act. In recent days, there has been another horrific dog attack, this time resulting in the deaths of 50 sheep. Dog owners have a responsibility to know what their obligations are and to be law abiding when it comes to their pets, but we have good microchipping regulations and good legislation when it comes to the control of dogs. What we do not have is enforcement. There are local authorities that did not issue a single spot fine in 2021. This is simply not a credible deterrent. Every day, we see dogs unmuzzled or fouling on the streets, and we all know there are dogs that are not licensed. During the review of dog welfare legislation carried out by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we highlighted the need for microchip databases to be kept up to date and for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to hold the information in a single online portal. The microchip is such an important part of the jigsaw when it comes to animal welfare and responsible dog ownership. Traceability leads to responsibility. If properly enforced, it will make owners accountable, help prevent the illegal sale of dogs, ensure the reunification of family pets with their owners and, if properly completed, give us a breakdown of the breeds of dogs in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> Section 1 will mean that it will no longer be optional to fill in the microchip number on the dog licence form. Currently, the ownership of seized animals is often asserted but rarely proven definitively. Linking the microchip to the dog licence will tighten up the enforceability of obligations on dog owners to prove ownership. It will also make it easier for the local authorities to do their jobs in enforcing the Control of Dogs Act, given they will know which breeds of dogs are in their areas and where they are located.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> The Bill will also strengthen the dog licensing laws relates to general dog licences, which are obtained by individuals who keep an undetermined number of dogs on their premises for non-breeding purposes. Again, to collect better quality data on these individuals, a holder of a general dog licence will be required to provide information to the local authority quarterly as to the number of dogs being kept on the premises and their microchip numbers. </p>
          <p eId="para_584"> There is nothing controversial in the Bill. It is evidence based and the organisations directly impacted by the absence of its provisions are calling for it. There is no reason for it to be delayed. As I have said repeatedly when asked about the Bill, I am not precious about it and I do not want to take ownership of it. In fact, I have repeatedly said on record that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine should take it, own it and just get it done. Delays mean more dogs delayed in finding their forever home, and more valuable resources being diverted to care for those dogs. I urge the Minister of State not to oppose the Bill, but not to stop there. I ask her to progress it and to allow us in this House to use time co-operatively to get it passed in this House, before using Government time to get it through the Dáil. She could give a commitment not just to expediting it but also to engaging the legal services in the Department to draft amendments to broaden its scope to include equines and other animals. Following the drafting of the legislation, a number of organisations have indicated they have the same problem with equines. In fact, one animal rescue has spent €250,000 caring for 25 horses seized under the Animal Health and Welfare Act, and the owner of those horses is now seeking a judicial review to further delay the transferral of those animals to loving homes. Last week, it was announced to great fanfare that the Minister was carrying out a review of animal welfare legislation. I would like him to know that we on the agriculture committee requested that and conducted it more than a year ago, producing a comprehensive report in October. I recommend, therefore, that he and the Minister of State examine those recommendations and implement them without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> As I said, I am not precious about the Bill. I just want to see it enacted because it will have a real-life impact for animals and for those people who work around the clock to give better lives to animals that are being neglected.</p>

          <p eId="para_586">I commend my party colleague Senator Boylan on her work on this issue and welcome the Minister of State to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> Overcrowding in Ireland’s dog pounds and shelters is the worst we have seen in a decade. In recent weeks, more than a dozen shelters have announced they have no space for new dogs. On one day alone, five shelters closed their doors. This surge can, in part, be attributed to the increase in the number of post-pandemic surrender requests from people who got pets during the lockdowns. There is a greater need for education and advice for people of the time and financial and emotional commitment involved in owning a dog. Different dogs have different needs in terms of exercise, food and other expenses. It is important for people to clearly understand how the full range of factors, including breed and age, can impact on this commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> Many people have often carried out this assessment and nonetheless gone on to buy a dog from a dog breeding establishment in good faith. Unfortunately, many are unaware and ill prepared to deal with the range of behavioural issues associated with such dogs. These behavioural issues are caused by the fact these dogs have been bred on industrial puppy farms, where they are inbred and deprived of human interaction for those important first few weeks. In the long term, how can overcrowding in shelters ever be effectively addressed if the Government continues to refuse to regulate these puppy farms or to end the harmful practices of inbreeding and a lack of socialisation?</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> As for the long-term use of these shelters, the overcrowding is not a new phenomenon. It cannot be attributed solely to an increase in the number of surrenders following Covid-19. Current legislation means animals are often kept for years before they can even begin to search for their forever home. While we all know the incredible and tireless work undertaken by those who care for animals in this position, it can often result in the animal being less easy to home than it would have been when it first presented. This can be due to a variety of factors including ageing and the associated medical costs and a lack of regular socialisation. Often, the quick resolution of this process is entirely dependent on the willingness of the current owner to engage actively with the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, to surrender the dog. The situation is even more precarious for puppies seized at ports and other points of entry to the island. Just yesterday, we heard the harrowing case of one such dog that had been kept for more than three years. Even apart from the social and other implications for the animal in question, this is an expensive undertaking, as anyone who has ever used a kennel will know.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> Turning to the resourcing of animal shelters, the regulation of puppy farms and the prolonged use of shelters may require more long-term resolutions. The Government can also assist shelters in the short term. One way in which it can do this is by providing much-needed financial assistance to shelters. In the programme for Government, it committed to "a doubling of the ex-gratia funding for animal welfare organisations within two years.” Budget 2022, as Senator Boylan mentioned, provided for €3.7 million, a shortfall of €1.17 million on what the Government had initially proposed for this same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> This is an issue on which there is a consensus among all our parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Senator Boylan mentioned that we are not precious about the ownership of the Bill and that we are willing to work with all parties and none to progress the legislation through these Houses. I ask all Members to support us and invite any of our colleagues who believe they may be able to further progress the Bill to do so within their respective parties as well. Let us work together. I welcome the review of all animal welfare legislation that Senator Boylan and the folks on the Oireachtas joint committee have undertaken. Animals are our ancient brothers and sisters - they were here for millennia before we were - and it is only right that we give time and attention to these issues.</p>

          <from>Senator Erin McGreehan<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_593">I thank the Minister of State for being here for this important discussion. Every so often we see horrendous acts by dogs or unto dogs and this entire topic comes to the fore. It is all over the media and in the papers and then it goes. I genuinely believe that each Department then breathes a sigh of relief that it can sit in the mess for a wee while longer. We have been delaying change for so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> I think of the most recent case of that poor gorgeous wee boy, Alejandro Miszan, who was savagely attacked by a dog. Unfortunately, he is not alone. Many people are living with the scars of dog attacks. That attack seems to have been the one that broke the camel's back, causing action. It is sad because many of us in this House have been asking for greater dog controls for an awfully long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> I commend Senator Boylan on her work because she has been steadfast in this area for an awfully long time. This is really important work. I also commend the joint committee, chaired by my Fianna Fáil colleague, Deputy Cahill. It published a great report this year. The Bill is a good starting point. We can go further and be more ambitious, but it fills up a lacuna that has been highlighted and would be remedied by the Bill. It should be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> There are a few glaring issues when looking into dog control and animal welfare or doing any research on the matter. There are three Departments in control of it, which is a huge problem. There is a lack of enforcement, a lack of will on the part of successive Governments to take on sole responsibility, a lack of investment in dog wardens, a lack of cross-Border co-operation, a lack of adequate Garda powers, a lack of databases and a lack of an incentive, either carrot or stick, to purchase a dog licence or to have a dog microchipped or just to be a good citizen and a good, responsible dog owner.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> I very much welcome the recent intervention by An Taoiseach to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to convene the interdepartmental group on dogs. It will consider and review current legislation on dogs across all Departments and look at how local authorities can implement this and be more effective in doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> I wish to highlight lots of other issues. Dog owners need to be held responsible for the damage their dogs do. Unfortunately, there is a <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude in that regard. A lack of personal responsibility on the part of dog owners has led to desperate things happening. We must start investing again in dog wardens, hire more of them and make sure they are fully equipped to deal with the new challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> We need to streamline and integrate the process of licensing and microchipping. In this era of technology and the online world, I fail to see why we cannot have a national database and an ability to work cross-Border to identify dogs in the Six Counties as well. There needs to be a consequence for not having a licence and not having a dog microchipped.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> I commend Louth County Council on what it is doing. It has brought its licensing system online. Our county vet is Garrett Shine. Almost by themselves, not with any extra government resources, the local authorities are working across different counties. Louth County Council has a streamlined process for licensing dogs. Its success came during Covid, when people could go online to licence their dog. Again, however, a microchip, as highlighted this evening , is not a necessity. No one should be able to insure or license a dog or get veterinary services if he or she does not have a microchip. He or she should have to be able to identify his or her dog. Responsible dog owners want that to happen. I would take it a step further. We need dog control notices. An owner in receipt of a series of dog control orders should not be able to get a licence for a dog. If someone is not a responsible dog owner, he or she should not be able to continue getting licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> Anyone who has ever come across a field of sheep that are after being worried will know that it is the most desperate sight. A couple of years ago I was on our family farm checking our sheep and witnessed dog attacks on animals. It was bloody and awful. Those sheep miscarried and died. That is a basic animal welfare problem right there that we are not looking after - and we are not looking after the dog. It is not the fault of dogs that they are wild animals; it is the owners' fault that they are not taken care of. Accidents can happen, of course, and we will not stop all maiming, all dog attacks and all sheep worrying, but we will reduce them and we will ensure personal responsibility. This Bill is a very important step towards real dog welfare reform and accountability among dog owners.</p>

          <p eId="para_602">I commend the Bill. Any of us who read about or heard the story of the young lad who was mauled a number of weeks ago or heard his young brother could not but be touched by what happened. It is important we send our best wishes to young Alejandro. I hope he recovers.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> I come from a rural area and a farming community and have spoken to landowners, farmers and so on. I have seen what has happened with dogs going out at night and destroying and mauling young lambs and sheep. It is, therefore, timely that we address this. There is a fairly simple mechanism to this. I will give the House an example. Licences were mentioned. I work in a post office and regularly fill out dog licence applications. There is a space to put in the microchip number, but that is not conditional on printing the licence. I would say 95% of people who apply for a dog licence do not have a microchip number. That is my experience from doing this at home. There is a mechanism here whereby we will be able to control these animals and to identify who owns them, and then we can address these situations if they happen. I will be quite honest. I did not realise that dogs could not be rehomed following situations such as these. That makes sense rather than having the homes full and their not being able to take in other animals while there are families that would be only too willing to take the animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> This is a very well drafted Bill. The Government should support it. It is not over-complicated. The quarterly return might be a bit much. It would be very difficult to get people to make-----</p>

          <p eId="para_607">I thank the Minister of State for taking this Bill. I acknowledge the significant work Senator Boylan has put into this. She is an active member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, along with Senator Lombard. I am also on the committee as are other Senators. One thing I can honestly say about Senator Boylan is that from the very day I met her when she came in here I knew she had genuine concern for and commitment to animal welfare. She has been consistent about it and has consistently raised it at every opportunity at the joint committee. She is a champion of animal welfare and is greatly respected among her colleagues on that team, so much so that a lot of space is provided to her on the committee, she will agree, to advocate for animal welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">She brings a vast knowledge and empathy and commitment to the subject. That is clear to anyone who talks to her and from the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> I strongly recommend that every Member pick up a copy of this report from October 2022. Senator Boylan was instrumental in pursuing all aspects of this report. It has 13 recommendations which are all very reasonable. I also thank the people the Senator secured to come forward as witnesses. They were very important people who had a significant contribution to make to the debate. They had considerable experience, knowledge and expertise in the area of animal welfare. It is not always easy for members of a committee whose party does not have a majority - we should remember that the Government has a majority on all these committees - but the Senator pursued this matter and secured significant, strong and robust recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> I will share two of the recommendations that jumped out at me today when I read the Bill again. Recommendation No. 2 states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_611">From the committee’s hearings it became apparent that there are several government bodies involved with different parts of canine welfare related legislation which can lead to confusion over which body is responsible for which part. Three pieces of legislation currently fall under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine including: Animal Health and Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pet Animals) Regulations 2019; Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015; and Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_612">The following two pieces of legislation are currently under the remit of the Department of Rural and Community Development: Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, and Control of Dogs Act 1986.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_613">The committee recommends that all five pieces of legislation should fall under the remit of one Department to ensure joined-up thinking and a consistent approach in canine welfare policy. </p>
          <p eId="para_614">This is a very significant recommendation and Senator Boylan has made it very clear when advocating for this Bill. The recommendation concludes that "It is the committee’s opinion that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should have this remit as it is currently responsible for general animal welfare." That is an important recommendation to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> I found the following startling, frightening and disturbing. Recommendation No. 4 states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_616">The Committee is also concerned that canine fertility services are being performed illegally by untrained people. The Committee heard that artificial insemination techniques can be evasive and dangerous to a dog. Canine fertility services should be regulated in order to prosecute illegal occurrences of these practises, however, given Surgical Artificial Insemination carries risks even when performed in a controlled, sterile and surgical environment, the committee recommends a complete ban on Surgical Artificial Insemination.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">I very much support every aspect of this Bill. It carries on with the same theme of much of the work Senator Boylan had already produced in the committee. The committee wholly endorsed all those recommendations. I hope we can collaborate, which is one of the great things about the Seanad. We do not always need to divide in these Houses. We spoke about Seanad reform the other day and the things we do well. One of those is that we in this House collaborate on general issues. It is not a "them and us" situation. We all share concerns about animal welfare. I know the Minister of State is especially concerned and I am glad she is here taking this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> I will support the Bill, as will my group. We hope its passage will be speedy. In particular, I thank the proposers in Sinn Féin for putting together comprehensive legislation that reads easily but is meaningful. If enacted, it will be very effective animal welfare legislation. I thank all the animal welfare groups that appeared before the committee and shared their stories with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> I will conclude by saying something about the Minister, Deputy McConalogue. To be fair to him, he has a commitment to animal welfare. Only recently he rolled out additional Government funding for animal welfare charities. However, more is needed. It is not all about money. It is about bedding down in legislation protection for animal welfare. That is the key and will be the success of this legislation. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Senator Annie Hoey<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_620">I express my personal support for the Bill and that of the Labour Party. It is very timely and welcome legislation. We have had quite a number of animal welfare discussions in the Seanad over the years and I am sure it will come as no surprise to anyone to hear where I fall on this Bill. I commend Senator Boylan on all her work, not only on this Bill but on animal welfare generally and especially canine welfare. It is a topic that is considered important by many people in Ireland. We consider ourselves animal lovers, yet when any of us goes into a rescue centre we can see how animals have been treated. We see the conditions in which they do their best to look after animals. We hear of the animals that never got to make it to the rescue centre. That holds a mirror up to us and shines a light on the notion that Ireland is a country of animal lovers. It is unfortunate that there are people who give the real animal lovers from all sorts of backgrounds a terrible name. The cruelty that I and all those in the animal rescue centres have witnessed is incomprehensible. It beggars belief that in 2022 we still see stories on the news or shared in our social media timelines weekly or daily of really upsetting animal cruelty.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> I commend Senator Boylan and Sinn Féin on introducing this legislation which we hope will tackle some of the issues, outliers and problems in this area. We can always amend Irish law on animal welfare to make it better. There no question but that the Health and Welfare Act 2013 was a significant step forward for animal welfare in Ireland. This positive Bill will hopefully make the Act better and stronger.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> When we talk about this topic, part of the challenge is getting people to shift their perception. All is not well in this area. We see the call to "Adopt, don't shop" and various other advertisements, and people buy cards to support the sector, but I still am not sure that people are as switched on to the issue as they could be.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> I will reflect on some of the penalties relating to animal welfare breaches. The Bill proposes a significant increase in some of the penalties, for example, it proposes changing the €100 fine "that on summary conviction, to a class B fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both, or (b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €250,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or to both." This section relates more to the abuse of dog licences than animal welfare, which is the issue I am discussing. However, any increase in penalties in the area of dog licensing could and should lead to less mistreatment or abuse of animals. Previous speakers outlined the licensing situation and its impact. I was doing some research earlier on the types of sentences people have been given in the past couple of years for animal mistreatment or cruelty. In 2018, a judge in Ireland gave a suspended sentence for the breach of the Animal Health and Welfare Act because the defendant had been on prescription drugs at the time. The judge said that he was a contributing member of society so it was better if he was not in jail. I am not a particularly big advocate of locking people up in jail with wild abandon but convictions and penalties in this area are lacking. They are poorly enforced. Perhaps that is partly because we rely so much on animal welfare charities, particularly the ISPCA and DSPCA to go out to inspect for animal welfare breaches. Animal welfare charities have received funding of more than €5.8 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">This is a €2 million increase over the past two years. It is not to be sniffed at, but it is still a small amount considering the €91 million allocated to the Horse and Greyhound Fund. We discussed that fund at length here a couple of weeks ago. I want to put on the record that animal welfare resources are desperately underfunded and rely mostly on charities. We can create laws and regulations, and I hope the Bill gets Government support and is moved along, but without adequate funding, not much is going to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> According to the ISPCA, it takes €50,000 to keep one inspector on the road. If every penny of that €5 million was invested in inspectors, it would still only give us 116 inspectors. That does not seem to be enough, even if every penny of the money going to all of the charities was invested in inspectors. We are woefully under-resourcing and under-supporting the people who will regulate not all of the areas in the Bill but a number of areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_626"> We fully support the Bill. I commend Senator Boylan and Sinn Féin on bringing it forward. There is no question in this House about my thoughts on animal welfare, in particular canine welfare. We have a long way to go and I hope the Government will seize this opportunity to use this Bill to move us a little bit closer to where we need to be.</p>

          <p eId="para_627">I welcome the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, to a particular seat in the Chamber. It is always good to see her there. She has a keen interest in the subject matter of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> I commend the Sinn Féin Seanad group on putting together a most worthwhile Bill. The Bill further strengthens provisions in animal health and welfare legislation relating to dogs, in particular re-homed puppies that have been brought into the country illegally and have been seized at ports. At the moment, when dogs are seized by authorities they must be housed in kennels while they wait for defendants to come to trial in court, which can take months or years. This current situation also results in significant costs for welfare organisation such as the DSPCA. It is not always possible to recover costs in court. The Bill also seeks to tighten the enforceability of obligations on dog owners to prove ownership of their dogs by linking the microchip to the dog licence. This will help in court cases where ownership of seized animals is asserted but rarely proven definitively. </p>
          <p eId="para_629"> It is a good Bill for animal welfare. The Green Party has always been supportive of legislation that supports animal welfare. Green Party policy in this area states that animals have the right, as sentient beings, to be protected from maltreatment and abuse at the hands of humans and to live in accordance with their natural instincts and needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> The Minister of State has a particular interest in puppy farms and is doing fantastic work in that area. While many good dog breeding establishments exist, unfortunately, many others have poor animal welfare conditions. Stories break every year about illegal dog breeding farms. The puppies which are rescued must be re-homed, which is a considerable cost to organisations such as Dogs Trust and the ISPCA.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> We do not have enough dog wardens. Freedom of information requests released to <i>The Irish Times</i> showed that there are 60 full-time dog wardens for 192,348 licensed dogs in Ireland, equating to 3,205 dog per warden. This is not good enough. It is no surprise that dog wardens are overworked and unable to perform their duties efficiently and to the best of their ability in an effective way.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> Tougher restricted breed laws will stop dog attacks. Restricted breeds are dog breeds that are aggressive and violent. We all heard about the awful case in Waterford last week, where a boy was attacked by a dog who was off lead in a park. He has suffered life altering injuries and my thoughts and prayers go to him and his family. </p>
          <p eId="para_633"> There is not enough enforcement of the law relating to illegal dog behaviour. Most counties in Ireland imposed just a few dozen fines between 2018 and 2020, with almost all fines falling within three categories, namely a lack of proper control or fouling. Countrywide, I understand just six fines were imposed in respect of restricted dog breeds legislation for dogs that were not muzzled or were off lead.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> In respect of the Bill, which I welcome, it is important to mention at this time of year dogs given as presents at Christmas. Dogs Trust has relaunched its campaign to advise the public not to give puppies as presents for Christmas. Every January, Dogs Trust receive unwanted puppies that need to be re-homed. This comes at a significant cost to the charity. </p>
          <p eId="para_635"> This is a good Bill. I hope it is supported and we can show co-operation and collaboration across the floor of the Chamber. I wish the Bill a speedy journey on its way through the Upper House. The sooner it is passed the better, with the wisdom of amendments at the appropriate stages. Let us get it into the Dáil and make this happen.</p>

        <speech by="#AliceMaryHiggins" eId="spk_196">
          <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_636">I want to begin by commending Senator Boylan on the Bill. It is well drafted and thought through. It shows the sign of somebody who has been passionate and thoughtfully engaged in issues of animal welfare throughout the time I have known her into Seanad and far beyond that. It is something that would make a significant difference. The Bill contains concrete and practical proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> We want to move away from the idea of giving dogs as Christmas presents, but something we can give to dogs would be not only passing the Bill but also committing to constructively giving the Government time to ensure that we can accelerate good ideas and legislation and ensure the Bill moves into law. I hope in her response the Minister of State will commit to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> I want to highlight some aspects of the Bill that are good and strong. In respect of ownership, it is important that the ownership of dogs is not ambiguous. It has to be subject to proper regulations and conditions. Dogs are not something that can be property in the simplest sense, without proper conditions being attached to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> The requirements regarding general dog licences in the Bill are strengthened by the provision in section 1 that would ensure general dog licences genuinely match, and can be shown to match, the particular dogs to which they relate. The Bill is not simply about a licence to have a dog, which may or may not refer to a specific dog or to dogs in the abstract. Rather, it is specific. It is a reasonable provision to require that persons who have a dog licence should be able to demonstrate, through the use of a microchip, that the licence pertains to a specific dog. In the case of those with a general dog licence it is even more important because there is a vulnerability. People who have general dog licences for a number of dogs may launder dogs through a single owner without individual licences. That is the kind of thing we see in stud and breeding dogs and puppy farms. If people can have cover-all licences, they can apply at any point if an inspector calls without ensuring proper accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> As Senator Boylan mentioned, there are a lot of ancillary benefits to having proper documentation through microchipping, in terms of dog management, being aware of dangerous dog breeds and what kind of dog breeds are in an area. That is useful information to have. In a positive sense, if we have genuine registration of dogs, we can also plan for them in terms of public spaces we want dogs be able to access along with their owners. Development plans and planning for parks and so forth could also reflect the spaces and the prevalence of dogs in a particular area.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> In respect of the second very important piece I was, like others, shocked and only learned through Senator Boylan of the fact that where animals are seized under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 they are kept in this limbo until legal proceedings have concluded. There is no reason for that given we set conditions, in respect of animal control, which must be met by the purported owner. There is a provision, as inserted in section 2 (4A)(a)(i), that states: "proves ownership of the dog to the satisfaction of the authorised officer". That is a reasonable requirement which meets the property requirements. There is absolutely no issue, from my perspective, in terms of property rights being affected because there is a provision but the onus is placed on the alleged or purported owner to prove their ownership. I think that satisfies the property piece.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> We must then ask if there is any other reason one would not allow these dogs to move towards being able to get new and loving homes. It is very important that it is not simply due to evidence. I say that because when there is a raid on a puppy farm the puppies are not evidence but victims. Damage has been done to them so we certainly do not want to continue that and, therefore, it is important that the rehabilitation and care for those who have been damaged by an action should be the priority. In that sense, it is important that we ensure they have access to socialising and forever homes. That is a very sensible provision and precedence has been set in the Control of Dogs Act. Those are the provisions that are mirrored in this Bill. This really is a good proposal and it will make a huge difference by ensuring those who are mistreated do not continue to suffer in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> I welcome the review of animal welfare. We need to have a proper debate on the report on these issues that was compiled by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This House has a record of dealing with these issues. We tabled amendments to the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 that specifically dealt with welfare and the obligation to rehome greyhounds. However, I have been concerned by reports over the past year that Greyhound Racing Ireland has rolled back in terms of the amount it contributes or allocates from its resources to issues of welfare. There have also been questions about not engaging in rehoming projects with welfare organisations that have been critical of the greyhound racing industry. That is very unfortunate because we need all organisations to be supported in terms of these welfare issues. We also need to ensure that we do not have a roll back in the delivery of the obligations under section 29.</p>

        <speech by="#MariaByrne" eId="spk_197">
          <from>Senator Maria Byrne<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_644">I thank the Minister of State for coming in to discuss this all-important issue. We are all concerned and extremely aware of dog welfare and animal welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> I wish to follow up on some of the previous points made about control. Wardens are very scarce in some local authorities and, therefore, I am concerned as to whether there is full control. Do wardens follow up on licence to make sure that people obey the law? I understand that a person cannot let one's dog off the lead outside of one's own property so I wonder how many wardens enforce that law. That is one question I would like the Minister of State to consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Not every local authority has a dog warden and some have a skeleton warden service. If a big local authority has only one warden then it is very hard to follow up on every single complaint; I am sure that some of the complaints go amiss. I compliment the people who go out there and carry out their job. I also compliment the many volunteers who work with the different animal welfare groups. In my own area of Limerick there are many people involved in animal welfare but there are also private groups that collect abandoned dogs and other animals, particularly around Christmas and at different times of the year. These people bring the animals into their own homes and then try to rehome them. It is a welcome development that we do not see as many dogs being put down as happened in the past or at least there are reports that dogs are not being put down and instead are being rehomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> What happened to a young boy in County Wexford a few weeks ago and the attack on sheep last week are two really serious issues related to the control of dogs. I understand that microchips are linked back to the breeders although this does not happen in every area. The microchip should be linked to the dog licence, which is a very clear request in Senator Boylan's Bill. If the microchip is linked to the licence then it is linked to the owner of the dog. One regularly sees on Facebook or social media images or notices about different animals that have been abandoned yet the owner cannot be traced because the dog has no microchip. It should made compulsory that every animal is microchipped and the microchip is linked to the licence details. I have highlighted the fact that there is only a skeleton warden service in some local authorities. If people do not have a licence then I wonder who will follow up on matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> Overall, I welcome that the thrust of the Bill is very positive. The Bill is a step in the right direction in how we deal with animals and animal welfare because none of us wants to see animals being abandoned especially any of us who have our own animals. I am sure that most people feel the same as almost every household has had a dog or other animal at some stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> I compliment Senator Boylan on bringing forward the different suggestions in the Bill and I would like to see some of them implemented in the future.</p>

          <from>Senator Paul Gavan<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_650">I welcome the Minister of State and the general debate that we are having here this evening because it is quite clear that on a cross-party basis there is widespread support for Senator Boylan's Bill. I commend the Senator. As others have already said, she is really passionate and very knowledgeable about animal welfare issues. She has produced a very practical Bill this evening. The challenge for us, and it is a challenge that we have met before, is to unite around a common cause. I appeal to the Minister of State that, when responding, she give a commitment that her Government will facilitate this Bill's quick passage through all Stages in the Seanad. It is a very simple Bill on which we all agree and there are no complicating factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> As others have said I did not know that when animals are seized in welfare cases they face months and sometimes years in an animal shelter until the case in completed. I do not think that the general public know that and if they did then they would find it entirely unacceptable. I am a passionate dog owner and I hope that my 15-year-old dog, Blossom, has tuned in this evening. If so, she is giving up watching the World Cup semi-final and that is the level of commitment we need to see.</p>

          <p eId="para_653">Is it? On a serious note, I believe it is important to recognise, and there has been collective agreement on this point, that we have a real problem with policing and enforcement. I refer to that awful incident with that poor child. My heart goes out to him and his family. We also have to be clear that what we need is enforcement and resources, otherwise new laws are not going to help the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> Thanks to Senator Boylan I looked at figures for where I live in Limerick and there are just 2.5 dog wardens for 8,500 dogs. That detail is really telling because last year there were no prosecutions under the Control of Dogs Act and only nine fines, of which five were paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">I looked at the figures across a range of counties. It is quite clear that there is problem. There were 97 prosecutions in the State, but 74 of those were in one county, namely, Cork. There is a massive problem here. Collectively, we need to ensure that the Government addresses the issues of enforcement and accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> I want to speak now on a wider but related issue. When I distributed some publicity material relating to this topic, I got a huge response from the general public, especially from people in Limerick, which is where I live. It was pointed out to me that there is not a single animal welfare inspector in Limerick at the moment. This means that in cases of cruelty to animals, the only recourse is to An Garda Síochána. The reality is that while gardaí are wonderful people, oftentimes they do not have the time and resources to respond to these issues. Simple practical steps need to be taken at local authority level and that needs to be funded by the Government in order to make a real difference in the context of animal cruelty cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> The legislation we are discussing tidies up an anomaly in existing legislation and will assist animal welfare groups to improve the lives of dogs that are rescued under the Animal Welfare Act and to trace ownership. It is a very worthy Bill that should be pushed through the Houses of the Oireachtas speedily. It is clear that this legislation enjoys cross-party support. All of the contributors to the debate have spoken about the difference it will make in terms of being able to trace a dog licence to an actual dog and the much improved information that will be available to local authorities, including information on the type of dog, as a result of this legislation. This is one of many issues on which we should work together. We should not play politics with it and should work to get this Bill through the Seanad as quickly as possible. The general public would like to see these issues tackled clearly and quickly and thanks to Senator Boylan, we have a Bill to do just that.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> I commend the Bill to the House. I also commend Senator Boylan and all of the Senators who have spoken so passionately here this evening.</p>

          <p eId="para_661">-----the committee meeting and this debate were scheduled for the same time. I compliment the Senators who sit on the aforementioned committee. They do amazing work. We all bring our own little bit of knowledge to these Houses, but we have a Senator here who brings exceptional knowledge when it comes to the issue before us today, namely, the welfare of dogs. We have had committee hearings on this issue, and it is clear that Senator Boylan's knowledge is exceptional. I chaired some of those meetings. The learning curve for me was steep. I am a bit of country bumpkin and I did not know about half of the stuff that is happening out there. Those hearings were quite graphic in many ways. We heard examples of what is being done to dogs. It is terrible stuff all together.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> We really need to tighten up the legislation in this area and this Bill is a very important step in that regard. It addresses some of the issues that came up during the course of the committee's hearings. We should endeavour to move this legislation forward in a timely manner in order to ensure that the regulations that are in place are workable. The regulations that exist at the moment are absolutely bizarre and I do not know how Departments have allowed this to happen. The current regulations are unworkable, but this legislation goes a long way towards sorting out the core issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> This is also a cultural issue. While it is important that we legislate, we must also inform and educate people. We have all read the reports on recent sheep kills which is another significant issue. I spoke to Senator Kyne about this yesterday. He rightly stated that the advertisements we had in the 1980s about sheep kills must be rerun. We must educate people about what they need to do to control their dogs. That does not form part of this legislation but it must form part of our work for change. The theme of change is important. The situation must change because society wants it to change. As other speakers rightly said, this is a huge issue. The vast majority of households have a pet of some kind. While 99.9% of pet owners take care of their animals appropriately, unfortunately there is a minority that does not do so. That is why we need legislation to make sure that dogs, and all other pets, are treated properly. This important issue must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> I am disappointed that I missed the start of this debate but I want to lend my support for this Bill. I will do what I can to make sure that this legislation goes through the Houses as quickly as possible. We all have our own skill sets and while this issue does not form part of mine, I have learned a lot in the past eight or nine months. It is important that we try to push this legislation through in order that we get meaningful change on what is a really important issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_666">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Táim sásta go bhfuil sí anseo chun an Bille seo a phlé. Gabhaim comhghairdeas le mo chomhghleacaí, an Seanadóir Boylan, as an mBille a chur os comhair an tSeanaid.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> It is great to hear unanimity across the House in support of Senator Boylan's Bill. As Sinn Féin group leader, I want to recognise the dedication, passion and commitment of Senator Boylan to animal welfare. She was determined to ensure that we, as a group, used our Private Member's time to initiate this Bill and get the ball rolling on what is an important issue. As colleagues across the Chamber have acknowledged tonight, there are practical and sensible proposals in this Bill that will have real, tangible benefits and outcomes and that is what matters here. A lot of the time when we talk about legislation the effect of same is abstract or out on the ether but we can see the practicality in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> One of the great strengths for me, which Senator McGreehan will appreciate, is that in taking the measures provided for in this Bill, we can harmonise our approach, North and South. My pet, a cocker spaniel called Tuan, who is seven years old this month, thanks Senator Boylan for bringing this legislation to the House. In the North, dog licences and microchips are already connected. All dogs kept in the North must be microchipped before they can be licensed. Owners must provide a microchip number on the application form for a dog licence and a dog licence will not be accepted without a microchip number. The number must be registered at the dog owner's current address. Dog owners must hold a valid licence for their dog and the dog must wear an identity tag with the owner's name, address and contact number. We know that it can be done because a few miles up the road, they are doing it and given the nature of Border communities, where we know that some families have plots of land or farms that straddles both sides, it makes sense to do it here too.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> While the primary focus of this legislation is on dog welfare, it can be extended to apply to other animals. It can lead to greater protections and accountability for harm caused to other animals such as cattle and livestock, as was referenced earlier. In conclusion, I want to reinforce a message that the Minister of State has heard repeatedly during this debate. Sinn Féin is not precious about this being our Bill; we just want to see it getting done. We want to see it become law because the reality is that every single day that this legislation is not progressed through these Houses, passed and then effectively implemented adds to the waiting time for dogs who are looking for a loving family and a forever home. While we wait, they wait even longer so the sooner we get this done, the sooner those of us who are dog lovers - and there are many of us across the Chamber - get this done, the sooner dogs can be re-homed and sent to forever homes. That is why this Bill makes sense. Ultimately, the outcome of this legislation will be positive which, for me, is the crux of the matter. I appreciate and recognise the support of colleagues across the Chamber tonight. I hope we can take a constructive approach and get this Bill through this House and the Lower House as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_206">
          <from>Senator Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2022-12-14T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_670">I thank and compliment Senator Boylan for initiating this Bill. I compliment the members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for their work on the publication of the report, which contains numerous recommendations and observations that should be progressed over the coming period. I know the Minister is reviewing the guidelines at the moment. In a previous life I served as Minister of State at the Department of Community and Rural Development. We enacted the revised guidelines on dog breeding establishments, which came into effect on 1 January 2019. They were a vast improvement on what was in place previously. Obviously, not everybody was satisfied that they went far enough, but they were certainly a huge improvement in relation to the socialisation of pups, and focused on improving the welfare of dogs and pups. They provided greater clarity on socialisation, placed greater emphasis on the need for accurate record-keeping and contained directions on staff-animal ratios and a provision for unannounced inspections of dog breeding establishments by the local authority veterinary service. Of course, when I talk about establishments I am referring to those that are registered. Are they all registered and regulated? We can see that they are not. Those are the difficult ones that are run by individuals who do not comply with the law and keep breeding animals to sell. As someone who had a rescue dog for a number of years until she passed away, I know the importance of the socialisation of dogs and the difficult backgrounds that many breeding dogs come from. It takes them a period of time to recover from their ordeal and get used to being loved, held, cuddled and everything else we do with dogs. There are legal issues in respect of the ownership of pets. I know that the value of some dogs is quite astronomical. That probably accounts for the difficulties in rehoming them, but that is no excuse. The animals, and particularly puppies, need socialisation and to be with people often to ensure that they have a decent life and also that they can be what they are supposed to be, and not turn feral or whatever. I certainly think the provisions of the Bill are very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> I was contacted by a lady on foot of the tragic case in Wexford. Her mother was killed in 2017 by three presa canario dogs. I will not go into the detail of what happened, but the inquest was held in 2019 and the coroner made recommendations. It was recommended that big muscular dogs should kept in an enclosure at all times, and when in public, should be muzzled and on a chain. The coroner also recommended that anyone who wants to keep such dogs should undergo special training and hold a special licence, and that this specific breed be put on the restricted list. I understand that as of this month, the presa canario breed is now under consideration to be put on the restricted list. However, the dogs are still available to buy. If you google them, you will find them. According to a description on one of the websites I looked up:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_672">Known for their strong guarding instinct, Presa Canarios are considered to be an owner-focused breed that's highly intelligent and trainable. With ample socialization and proper training, the Presa Canario can become a loyal family pet—and model canine citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">It is possible that they can become loyal family pets and model canine citizens if they are trained at a young age, but if they are not looked after, they can kill. Dogs of that breed have killed at least one person that we know of, and I am sure there are other cases in this country. The question is how we address that, when the pups are so valuable. They can be purchased online at astronomical prices, and there are individuals who are not always law-abiding or do not care about the law. If these dogs are not loved and socialised, they end up killing people. That is the crux of the matter. If human beings get into the wrong company, they can end up causing harm. Dogs, no matter how good they are, can do damage if they are in the wrong company and do not know what they are doing - herd instinct takes over or whatever. We saw the atrocious images from Moneygall of the 50 hoggets or lambs that were killed. Unfortunately, that is an annual occurrence. There will be such an incident next year again somewhere else in the country or multiple cases at a smaller level; perhaps not as many as that. There is a lot of work to be done in this area and I compliment everyone involved. I hope this Bill can be progressed, and further work done on legislation in this area. </p>

          <p eId="para_674">I thank Senator Boylan for bringing forward this legislation. At the outset I should say that the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, intended to take this item. I offered to replace him because the bell has been ringing non-stop in the Dáil and I wanted to facilitate the smooth passage of the debate and look after the welfare of my fellow Senators. That is why he is not here.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> It is worth acknowledging that the Seanad, this wonderful Chamber, has discussed issues in relation to animal welfare on many occasions, as mentioned by Senators Hoey and Higgins. It is welcome that we discuss these issues. Like Senator Kyne, I acknowledge the work of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this area, and the input of the Senators on the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> I acknowledge the value that dogs bring to homes and families across Ireland. They are fantastic and loyal companions, and valuable friends to many people around the country. I was heartened to hear Senator Boylan tell us about her rescue dog. Indeed, I have two rescue pets at home, who are perhaps watching the football: Penny the whippet and Millie the lurcher. They certainly bring great joy and love to our family. I concur with the wonderful value that dogs, particularly rescue dogs, can bring to people's lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> It is clear that we need to do more work to strengthen the enforcement of the legislation that is already in place, as Senator McGreehan and others have pointed out. Indeed, the events in Wexford and Moneygall are absolutely horrifying. We have to take every step to ensure the existing policy and the legislation are being implemented and enforced. That has been highlighted by a number of Senators. That is why the Taoiseach has asked my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to take a leading role in this area and to examine what shortfalls there are regarding issues around the control of dogs, dog welfare, licensing, breeding, microchipping and policing, both nationally and at the local authority level. Perhaps we can learn from our colleagues in Northern Ireland, as Senator Ó Donnghaile highlighted. We should look at reaching out and engaging with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> Senator Boyhan articulated well the cross-governmental nature of this challenge because the responsibilities for ensuring the welfare of our dogs and other animals lie with three different Departments. First and foremost, my Department is fully committed to promoting responsible pet ownership. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has begun that review process. He has tasked senior officials in my Department with scoping out where the responsibility around dog microchipping, welfare and pet sales can link in with a broader framework for a wider interdepartmental effort to improve co-ordination and effectiveness in this area. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Rural and Community Development have also been in contact in this regard. As Senator Boyhan highlighted, the Minister for Rural and Community Development holds responsibility for the Control of Dogs Act 1986 and the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, while the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage's Department has responsibility for local authorities, which have a role to play in the area. That highlights further the cross-governmental challenge involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> In early 2022, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Community and Rural Development launched an awareness campaign highlighting the responsibility to dog owners in relation to dog control and sheep worrying. </p>
          <p eId="para_680">Last year the Department launched Ireland's first national animal welfare strategy, Working Together for Animal Welfare: Ireland’s Animal Welfare Strategy 2021-2025. This strategy sets out broad principles as to how we will improve animal welfare in Ireland over the coming years. It will be relevant to the review the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, will lead in the coming weeks. One of the commitments in my Department's animal welfare strategy is to establish an advisory council on companion animal welfare. That council is now up and running with independent members with a range of expertise and experience having been appointed. The council has met on several occasions this year. It will advise on policy matters and, where appropriate, will issue guidelines and recommendations in relation to companion animals, including on some of the issues under discussion here this evening. The council is scheduled to meet again tomorrow. The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and I look forward to receiving the group's recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> My Department has primary responsibility for the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015. Data received on compliance is encouraging. According to the latest figures available, 124,408 dog microchips were registered during 2020. This represents a 24% increase on the total number of dog microchip registrations in 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> On the safe sale and supply of dogs, my Department has introduced SI 681/2019, which requires anyone selling or supplying pets to keep records, including a record of from whom the pet was obtained, and to whom the pet was sold or supplied. These regulations also prohibit the advertisement of a dog for sale or supply without providing minimum information about the seller, origin and age of the dog, and its microchip number. This applies to all forms of advertising. Unfortunately, the reality is that not all dog owners act responsibly. It certainly does happen, unfortunately, that some dogs are often kept in conditions without adequate space, exercise, or socialisation, as has been highlighted tonight. This can lead to problems with temperament. The knock-on effect of this is that it creates a welfare problem, not only for the dogs concerned but possibly a risk then to other animals and perhaps to people, if the poor treatment and management of these dogs leads to aggression.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> My colleague, Senator Vincent Martin highlighted the Green Party's long record in supporting stronger animal welfare legislation. What was clear from tonight's debate is that we do have some good strong legislation. We have good laws but it is about the enforcement of those laws. This is something we really need to focus on in the months and years ahead. For this reason, one of the priorities for my Department in working with the Advisory Council on Companion Animal Welfare is to develop and promote a responsible pet ownership campaign. Responsible pet ownership is about educating people on what they need to consider before deciding whether to get a dog or a cat, or any pet animal: how to keep and manage a dog, which is the topic tonight; how to manage a dog appropriately; breeding healthy dogs with the right characteristics and healthy confirmations; and the responsibilities of dog owners towards others, particularly in relation to issues such as aggression and sheep worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> The Bill before the House today has several recommendations that are of merit, and many aspects are already being examined by my officials internally. Department officials have also engaged with stakeholders and dog welfare charities on many of these issues, including those relating to the welfare of dogs. In early January 2023, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, will meet with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and officials from both Departments where both Ministers and sets of officials will bring their internal findings together to progress this matter with the urgency it needs and deserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> The co-operation of the authorised officers from the Irish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, with An Garda Síochána and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is recognised and deeply appreciated. I have full confidence that this cross-governmental approach will lead to definitive action to improve the situation without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> I reassure Senator Warfield that we have doubled the funding to animal welfare organisations as per our programme for Government commitment. That was finalised last week and it is most welcome. It is only one element in dealing with this and improving the welfare of animals in this country, but it is welcome all the same. I thank all of the Senators. I thank Senator Boylan for bringing forward legislation and Senators for their continued interest and engagement on this topic.</p>

          <p eId="para_687">I will not delay people any longer because it is one of those nice moments when we are in agreement. I thank the Minister of State for her comments. I am heartened to hear of the work that is going on and that the elements of this Bill are under consideration by the relevant Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> I would caution about the information on microchip compliance. While we know that the law states one must have a dog microchipped, the problem is that a lot of people are not aware of the need to update that information. While we heard from Senator Byrne about the obligation of this staying with the breeders, it is the breeders' obligation to re-register that in the owner. Members of the public are not aware either of the need to update the information if the animal dies. There is a simple example from Australia where a person gets a yearly text message from the database the microchip is registered with, just to ask if any information needs to be updated about the dog. There are simple ideas out there we can adopt. As Senator Ó Donnghaile has said, we only have to look up the road to show how effective it can be to link the microchip to the licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> I will not labour the point any more other than to commend this report. I ask that people who have not already read it do so. I thank all Members for their comments tonight and for their generous comments about my own work. I extend a special thanks to the members of the Oireachtas Joint committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine. Senator Lombard might be a country bumpkin but I am a Dub and the only woman on the agriculture committee. Agriculture and fishing are huge areas of policy and a lot of work gets done on the committee. In fairness, when I came to that committee and said that we also had responsibility around animal health and welfare, including canine welfare, all of the members of that committee facilitated the hearings and the extensive work that was done. We worked together. Everybody participated in those hearings and co-operatively we produced that robust report. It again shows how important it is that on certain issues we can put politics aside when we all have a single purpose, and we can actually produce really good work.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> I take great heart from the debate tonight. As I have said, we just want to see this legislation enacted. The Minister of State has said that the area is under review. Because there are so many areas that need tightening up I fear it could delay this legislation further. This Bill can make a change overnight; it is not complicated and it is not controversial. I encourage the Minister of State to maybe expedite this legislation while that review work is ongoing.</p>
