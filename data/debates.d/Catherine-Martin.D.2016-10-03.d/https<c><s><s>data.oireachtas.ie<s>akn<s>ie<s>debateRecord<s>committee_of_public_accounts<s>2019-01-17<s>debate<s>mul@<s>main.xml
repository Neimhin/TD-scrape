          <p eId="para_10">We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee. He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit. Apologies have been received from Deputies Cullinane and Deering. On behalf of the committee, the staff and myself as Chairman, I offer our sincere condolences to Deputy Cullinane on the passing of his mother in recent days. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> The minutes of 13 December is the next item on the agenda. Are they agreed to? Agreed. We just have to make one typographical correction. The next item then is matters arising from the minutes. There is nothing specific that we will not come to in the course of our meeting. The next item is correspondence received since the last meeting. There is quite a bit because it has been a month since the last meeting. We will give this an hour or so and try to complete as much of it as we can. I do not want to hold too much over indefinitely. We go into our public session dealing with the Irish Prison Service some time after 10.30 a.m. </p>
          <p eId="para_12"> The first item of correspondence in category A, briefing documents and opening statements, is Nos. 1835 A and 1845 A from the Department of Justice and Equality, dated 10 January 2019 and 16 January, and the briefing papers and opening statements for today's meeting. We will note and publish those. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next category of correspondence is from category B, Accounting Officers or Ministers or both, as well as follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publication. The first item of correspondence is No. 1761 B from Ms Mary Lawlor, Communications and Public Affairs Manager, NAMA, dated 29 November 2018, providing further information requested by the committee in relation to Project Nantes and the question of the sale of assets. We raised the issue in respect of section 172 disclosures. I suggest we note and publish this letter from NAMA on the breakdown of the €24 billion in asset sales categorised by the jurisdiction of purchaser. In respect of the section 172 declaration, we are getting legal advice on that. We might take that in private session early next week. We will publish that documentation but we will have to come back and get legal advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, as NAMA has sought its advice as to where we are with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> The next item is No. 1792 B from Mr. Phelim Quinn, CEO, Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, dated 11 December 2018, enclosing a copy of HIQA's workforce plan for 2018 as requested by the committee. It is good and positive to note that the Department has sanctioned 47 additional posts for the authority. We will note and publish that, including the workforce plan. It may already be in the public arena but we will publish it in any event. The next item is No. 1794 B from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General, Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, dated 11 December 2018, providing notes requested by the committee in relation to Galway as the European Capital of Culture in 2020, including the role played by the Department's representative on the board as well as a note on monitoring reports and meetings. We will note and publish that. There are dates of meetings and reports. </p>

          <p eId="para_17">That is helpful and I thank Deputy Connolly. The next item is No. 1795 B from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 11 December 2018, providing a briefing note on the national broadband plan and metropolitan area networks, MANS. We are going to have some of the private providers in that sector here at a special meeting. This document has quite a bit of information provided on the national broadband plan, the reasons given by companies which exited the tendering process and a briefing note on the metropolitan area networks. That includes specific reference to the maintenance of MANs contracts with Enet and the roll-over of that contract. I know Deputy Catherine Murphy will want to speak on this. I want to let people know to which document we are referring. There is also an update on the national broadband plan as to where we are with that at the moment. There are also some appendices attached showing the lists of various areas where the MANs network exists. Finally, appendix 2 gives statistics on the increased use of Eircode. I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p>

          <p eId="para_18">A lot of the information given is useful. There are some specific pieces of information that we sought.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">One was the percentage of the investment by the Irish Infrastructure Fund that came from public funds. Is that separate?</p>

          <p eId="para_21">The other issue is the coverage. Some areas in the country covered by metropolitan area networks, MANs, contain blackspots. We also looked for that. It is more to do with mobile phone coverage than it is to do necessarily with the MAN. However, it is one of the documents that was requested. We should specifically go back after that.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_9">

          <p eId="para_23">We were to receive information on black spots. The Department promised it before Christmas. It was on the existing state of the fibre and where there were black spots.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">Okay, we will ask specifically for that where there might be parts of the metropolitan area not covered by the metropolitan area plan where there are obvious gaps in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> For people who will read this document when we publish it, I want to highlight the reason Eir gave for withdrawing. That is in this document. The rationale for the State purchase of a €200 million stake in Enet is there. It continues to deal with the broadband plan. We will come back to that because it keeps referring to high-speed broadband. We have asked it to define what it means by that. It refers to download speeds of 30 Mbps and upload speeds of 6 Mbps. That is not high-speed broadband. High-speed broadband is the biggest misnomer of all time. That is not high-speed broadband by anybody's definition in this century. If those figures are mentioned in any of the contract details, we are not getting what it says on the tin. Before we finish with that we need specific data. It has to be future-proofed. If those types of references are in the contract, it is a waste of space before we start. There should be no investment in broadband that is delivering 6 Mbps of upload speed. That is a waste of money in this day and age. If that is what the plan entails, we will need to discuss that in more detail. We will be talking to a number of private operators here as set out in our work programme. We have quite a bit to come back to on that. For the moment, the letter contains interesting information and we are noting and publishing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> No. 1797 from the HSE provides information as requested by the committee on the national ambulance service. Deputy Lahart had requested information on this. I propose we publish this and forward a copy of this to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> Next is further correspondence from the HSE providing information on the development of national screening guidelines for hepatitis C; the reviews that have been undertaken in Portiuncula Hospital and the Portlaoise maternity hospital; issues relating to miscarriage diagnosis; and an update on the changes being made in clinical assessment. We asked for this in the context of medical negligence issues. We also asked for a note on the project team established to examine local reviews. We asked for a note on the plan to enhance learning from incidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> I wish to make a few comments on aspects of concern. On page 4, the HSE confirms: "Doctors may require retraining as part of the outcome of a disciplinary hearing, investigation of an incident or following a legal settlement with or without admission of liability." The idea that they may require training is not good enough if there is a major incident. It should be almost mandatory. We will come back to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> On the current practice of local reviews of an issue that arises in a particular hospital, at the bottom of page 5, it is stated: "At a local level, once a review has been completed, learning is expected to be shared across the service...". That is harmless. If that is the policy, we expect something might happen. The final page refers to the plan to enhance learning from incidents. That is what we want. We want the HSE to learn to reduce future incidents. The letter states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_32">Though the current practice outlined above remains valid, the HSE has identified that there are also a number of other ways in which learning can be captured…</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_33">The second project is focused on putting in place a system whereby ‘lessons learned’ from incident reviews can be provided to a single point within the organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">We are hearing that the HSE does not have a single point where lessons from medical incidents can be learned and it is now developing a project to centralise the lessons to be learned. It is decades behind what is acceptable. That will be the recommendation when we come to issue a recommendation on that; it is so obvious. It is dreadful that it is saying that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2019-01-17T09:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_35">This applies in other parts of the public service. For example, a local authority has a legal requirement to give a decision for planning permission within a specified time. It becomes almost the number one requirement because there is a legal requirement. While it is a different scenario, the lack of a legal requirement to do this puts it down the pecking order. When we issue a recommendation, we should consider requesting a statutory obligation rather than anything that would fall within the voluntary category because this is of such importance in changing the culture. It changes the mindset if they can be sanctioned for not doing it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineConnolly" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2019-01-17T09:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_36">I welcome what is set out in this letter. Is it adequate? It certainly is not. We should not just leave it to our report. We need to look into this further to identify how to save money. I could tackle this in many ways. I could tackle it on an emotional level from my personal experience with family, which is most people's contact with the health service when something happens and they are left in that place. Alternatively, I could tackle it in the way I should as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts. What is proper governance? When reviews are set up local independent outside the country, what do they cost? What do they learn from them? What can we avoid in the future? That is the purpose. Like the Chairman, I am in no way reassured that that is happening here.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> I will give a specific personal example without going into any details whatsoever of an independent review of a family member that was carried out. It was anything but independent. It was absolutely forced from the system. It was not proactive in what was an open-and-shut case involving admission. Notwithstanding all that, it placed unacceptable pressure on a family to try to get some accountability. I am only giving one tiny example. This is repeated. If we go back to Savita Halappanavar in 2012, there was no openness and accountability in that case. It was dragged from the system and eventually an independent review was set up.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> As the Chairman has pointed out, something must happen about learning. That is an extraordinary statement. Those of us on the committee are endeavouring to get value for money. The health service is under pressure and I am the first to acknowledge that. I have great admiration for most of the staff. However, mistakes are being made. Some are part of life and others are because of the extraordinary stress they are under, lack of training and lack of learning.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> It ties in with the State Claims Agency, which ultimately picks up on behalf of the public the claims that inevitably come which people do not want to bring at all. They want accountability and want someone to apologise. They want someone to explain how something went wrong. Most important, using my family as an example, they want assurance that this will not happen again and that the next patient will not suffer as experienced by a family member. I do not see that happening. I seek the Chair's assistance as to how we deal with this in terms of the HSE and the State Claims Agency because I am tired of this type of language.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">More important, it is not bringing accountability to the system. It is not saving money and it is not giving value for money. I will finish on an issue, which I have raised previously. I tabled a parliamentary question which asked what independent reviews had taken place in the hospital in Galway over the past ten years and I received the extraordinary answer that there was no system for recording reviews or their cost. That is just about the review and the cost, without mentioning the learning from the reviews. As a Deputy in Galway West, I do not know how many independent reviews were carried out over the past ten years, what they cost or, most importantly, what was learned and what changes were made. I am referring to independent reviews but we also have the language of "local reviews". We cannot leave this. I would like to come back to it. I will take direction on how to deal with it, but it is certainly a big issue.</p>

The State Claims Agency and the HSE are involved. I will just jump to the work programme for a moment. Aside from our periodic report, I will propose that we do two special reports in the coming months on work we have commenced. I propose one on medical negligence dealing with exactly what both Deputies have mentioned and a second on the issue of housing. The chief executives of local authorities will come before the committee. I expect two special reports. I propose to pull these two separate reports together and that the committee publishes two separate reports. We have commenced work on both of them. That is a definite.

          <p eId="para_50"> No. 1801B is from Mr. Paul Dunne, CEO of the Local Government Management Agency, responding to a request from the committee for a copy of the value for money report in respect of Irish Public Bodies produced in 2015. It includes a letter dated 13 November 2018 from Irish Public Bodies that sets out its position, which is not to release the full report due to commercial sensitivity. It also includes a summary report prepared by PwC in 2016 and the report of the Irish Public Bodies value for money steering group prepared in 2016. To summarise, the Information Commissioner has recommended that this be published. The matter is before the courts because Irish Public Bodies has objected to this being released under freedom of information legislation. That matter is proceeding. It has given us a summary document, which members will want to read and study, even though there is not much commercial information in it. It has given us the summary report prepared by PwC in respect of the value for money review, which will be useful for members who have an interest in this area to review this document. Finally, it includes a report from the Irish Public Bodies value for money steering group, which deals with the County and City Managers' Association, education and training boards, ETBs and the Office of Government Procurement, OGP. We will publish that. There is, however, one request in the letter, which is that some appendices not be published. That is a separate item. Irish Public Bodies is saying that, in its view, the publication of the summary does not unduly prejudice its interests. It has happy for that summary to be published. We will do that here today. We note and publish that.</p>

Is that stated anywhere in the accounts? Is there mention of the liabilities that do not go up the food chain to Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance, IPBMI? I refer to claims that would normally fall under the category of insurance but which, because they are below a certain threshold, are not stated.

          <p eId="para_54">I cannot speak about the commercial State bodies because I do not audit their accounts. In respect of Departments, claims that were settled in year are set out in a note in the appropriation accounts. There is a figure and there is generally a separate figure for compensation and associated legal cost payments in the appropriation accounts. Many State agencies will carry commercial insurance but insurance costs are not isolated as a separate item. There is an element of initial or minimal payments that would be made. It might be difficult to extract them directly from the financial statements, however. There is not a single place to which one can go to find that information.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">This came up with the State Claims Agency. Interestingly, it said that it had just recently taken on dealing with section 38 bodies and major hospitals which are voluntary organisations. The agency is now handling all of their claims. We asked why the agency did not take on the insurance for local authorities. I still feel that there is unnecessary duplication when the agency is handling all of the insurance claims for most Departments but there is a separate parallel insurance scheme for the ETBs and the city and council councils in respect of claims by members of the public, their own staffs, or whatever. We are running two separate schemes to deal with the one issue. I was trying to get at whether it made sense to have one State agency dealing with it all. On the face of it, it would appear that it would. That is why we are trying to get information. It would be useful to be able to compare the experience of Irish Public Bodies with that of the State Claims Agency which deals with the HSE and every other Government body. We have not been able to get there yet. I do not know how far we will get on it. We are the first to start pursuing this. That is all I will say at this stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">The report of the Irish Public Bodies value for money steering group was also commissioned by, as I said, the County and City Managers' Association, ETBs, and the OGP. We will come back to that because this insurance issue is definitely on our list. We will note and publish that.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> The next correspondence is No. 1802B, from Mr. John O'Connor, the CEO of the Housing Agency, providing information requested by the committee in respect of the breakdown by local authority of the 2,424 properties that have been offered to local authorities but which were considered unsuitable. Detail has been produced on a county-by-county basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">Within each county, every single offer is listed for every individual town, village or townland where the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, felt it had a property that might be suitable. We will note and publish the correspondence. Some of this information is possibly already in the public arena. It should be available through the local authorities. I suggest members will want to study it in their own right and use it at local level to find detailed explanations for why various local authorities did not take up various offers of housing. </p>
          <p eId="para_64"> No. 1805 is correspondence received from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, providing information requested by the committee on correspondence received on allegations of unauthorised state aid to Horse Sport Ireland. The Department refutes the allegations which are being investigated by the European Commission and provides details of the Department's position. We will note and publish the correspondence and forward it to the person who wrote to us directly about the matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_65"> No. 1806 is correspondence received from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, providing information requested by the committee. There is a lot of very interesting information. First, the Department was asked for the gender breakdown and age profile in respect of sick leave taken within it. The details given include age and the number and length of absences. We will note and publish the correspondence. Copies of the reports on the back to education allowance and JobPath are also available. The Department also deals with false self-employment cases. There is a detailed chart showing the savings achieved in that area as a result of employer inspections. </p>
          <p eId="para_66"> There is a note on various other items, specifically historical debt in cases where there were overpayments. I would like to highlight some of them. The Department states in the report that 156,000 debts are due to the Department from individuals, totalling €475 million. We asked for a breakdown of debts amounting to more than €30,000. There are 3,208 cases where the debts are in excess of €30,000, totalling €178 million. We asked how many of the debtors were in receipt of a payment from the Department, meaning that some of the debt can be recouped by way of a reduced payment on a weekly basis. Where the person concerned was no longer in receipt of a payment, we asked what mechanism the Department had in place. </p>
          <p eId="para_67"> We asked for details where debts amounted to more than €10,000. There are 11,580 cases where the outstanding balances exceed €10,000 and they add up to €319 million. Some 48% of these are making repayments, which is good. The Department says that 25% of cases are suspended. No recoveries are taking place because the cases are under appeal, there are bankruptcies, the cases concern deceased persons and the Department is dealing with their estates or the Criminal Assets Bureau or other agencies are examining them. The Department states there is a residue of 25% of cases in which it has no specific arrangements in place. This is money that is due to the State and there are very large cases. In more than 11,000 the amount exceeds €10,000 and in half no serious effort is being made to actually collect the money owed. We are asking the Department for a systematic effort to be made. This will have to form part of our periodic report. These are cases where the Department is satisfied that the amount listed is due, but it has not got around to devoting the resources needed to follow up on them. It is as simple as that. We will come back to the issue. As I said, we will note and publish the correspondence. </p>
          <p eId="para_68"> The next item of correspondence is from the Secretary General of the Department of Finance. A short note was requested by the committee on the procurement competition for the delivery of Government banking services which led to the award of the contract to Danske Bank. In order that members are aware, I note that last summer as a result of an EU competition Danske Bank won the contract to handle and process all social welfare payments and public sector salaries. I propose that we write back to the Department to request an indication of the volume of payments being handled by Danske Bank across each Departments. We would like to get an indication of the scale of payments being handled by Danske Bank. I do not think the Department will have the answer, but I propose that the committee send a brief note to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service. It should be very simple to prepare a report outlining how many of the 28 EU member states use banks from outside their jurisdiction to handle all social welfare payments. I would like to know if it is normal across the European Union. Is Danske Bank doing this in several countries or is Ireland the only country that has chosen to have a system where a bank from outside its jurisdiction is handling all social welfare, pension and salary payments? I was surprised to see it. Perhaps the matter might be put in context and it is a regular feature. I do not know, but I would like to know. I am not suggesting there is anything wrong with it as it did go through a procurement process. As I said, I would like to know what happens in other jurisdictions.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">There was at least a perception of encouragement to have social welfare and pension payments and so on made through the banks which had the consequence of undermining the post office system. The perception - I will put it no stronger than that - was that it was really intended to improve the health of the banking system by having additional activity, but there was a consequence for post offices. It undermined something that could be an organic third force in banking, or at least part of one. There are other issues. As well as the winning of a contract, there is the potential undermining of another State entity by the policy followed by the likes of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in pretty much directing that people be paid by direct debit or standing order, rather than collecting their payments at a post office. That is the other side, of which we should not lose sight.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">That is valid. My concern is the number of jobs we have exported from Ireland as a result of the giving of the contract to a bank located outside it. Perhaps all of the Danske Bank staff processing the payments are based in this town; I do not know, but we have seen the library in Dún Laoghaire outsource library provision to a company in England. Is this another example of Ireland's procurement law giving firms outside the State business with which other countries may deal with differently? We will receive information on the levels of payments made. We might ask the Department of Finance if it knows where the jobs involved in processing payments are based. Are they based in the State?</p>

          <p eId="para_79">Appendix 1 is very interesting. During the crisis the Minister made a decision to provide for free screening, a decision that had profound consequences. I will not criticise him for making it because one could take the argument either way, but the introduction of free screening has had serious consequences for the screening programme. The delay is now 20 weeks, which is having a detrimental affect on women's health. Furthermore, following questioning by me, it has been determined that there is no prioritisation mechanism or way to deal with priorities. The system cannot distinguish between a woman who has to go back for screening quickly or a woman attending for routine screening. The 20-week delay affects equally the woman who needs screening as a priority and the woman who is going back for routine three-year screening. The decision has had other impacts down the line that could have a detrimental effect on women's health because of the delays caused. As a consequence, it has had other impacts outside what was intended and the Minister and the Department did not have the capacity or chose not to provide adequate resources to deal with the excessive demand created by the decision. On top of that, we have a breakdown of the figure of €4.7 million required to provide women with a free GP consultation, with €2.36 million being the estimated cost of the consultations.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> There are further costs related to how the laboratories undertaking the work were paid. For commercial reasons, the Department has refused to tell us the cost. I am not sure that this is fair or appropriate. I fail to see a reason it would not tell us. It states the total is €10 million. Therefore, if we deduct the other two amounts, the total is approximately €3 million. Why it cannot state the cost is beyond me because we can add and subtract. I am not happy that it is not telling us what the cost is. There has certainly been secrecy surrounding the dealings with the laboratories from day one. The Royal College of Obstetricians review will probably not be completed this year. It has already been saidit will probably be completed six months from now. There is a secrecy surrounding the relationship with the laboratories. Following the money trail to determine the cost of cervical screening and the work done by the laboratories is shrouded in secrecy and this is another example. I fail to see why the Department cannot give us the figures. I, therefore, ask the Chairman to write back and ask for them.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">The committee agrees to write back to ask for them. The final paragraph in the appendix to which the Deputy has referred states women who availed of an early repeat smear test with CervicalCheck will be called for their next routine appointment according to their individual screening recommendation. This means that most of the women who have been screened will be recalled for screening in either three or five years and that the future cost of providing smear tests will be offset to a degree by this out-of-cycle smear testing. I think that at the time people thought in good faith that there would be extra screening, but it is now being said that if a woman avails of extra screening, the next test will be three or five years later. Essentially, therefore, they are only bringing forward the tests women were due to have. No extra screening is being offered. Essentially, upcoming planned tests are being brought forward such that they are being done now, rather than when the women concerned were due to have them, for example, next year.

          <p eId="para_83">It is important to indicate that there has never been an offer of a repeat or an extra smear test. All they are saying is that if a woman had a test and is concerned, they will bring forward the next test, rather than doing it at the regular time, but she must then wait three or five years for a further test. Therefore, there is no extra screening.</p>

Essentially what is being said is that the women concerned will now go to the back of queue.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">I have a history on this matter. When I was a Minister some years ago, I provided the first funding for one of these schemes. At that stage, the Department of the Environment and Local Government rather than the Department of Justice and Equality had responsibility for the matter. The funding was provided to pilot a CCTV scheme in the Chairman's county. It is up and running and has been successful, which shows this can be done. We are facing into Brexit with all the potential complications arising from that, whatever the outcome. It is a farce if we cannot sort out data protection and CCTV schemes. This has been going on for years. We all know the issues relating to crime, which I will not go into, but this is a cost-effective way of helping areas to deal with crime. The Chairman and I both deal with the issue of criminals in high-powered vehicles using the motorways to travel up and down to Laois and Tipperary, left, right and centre. A number of areas in my constituency affected by this because they are close to motorways have been granted funding. The issue that arises is who will control the data and where it will be held. The matter has gone back and forward between the Department with responsibility for local government to the Department of Justice and Equality. It is farcical that this cannot be dealt with. A fund is available to be drawn down but there are insufficient applications because the local authorities will not bother to do so on the basis that this issue has not been sorted out.</p>

          <p eId="para_108">There are issues which need to be teased out, including value for money issues. The research I read suggested the jury was out on the value of CCTV schemes in certain areas, although there is definitely a place for them. Sometimes CCTV comes under the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda Síochána and then there are community schemes, but in my experience they often do not work. Vast amounts are spent installing cameras but they have never worked. In addition, there are privacy issues and the question of a private company being employed. There are serious issues, in our case primarily related to value for money, with money being spent on cameras that are not used. I understand is the position with a number of cameras in Galway and throughout the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">The local policing board in Kildare discussed this matter and adopted a policy on it. There is an expectation that if one puts a camera up out in the countryside, it will solve all sorts of problems but the practical experience is that it does not. There are locations where they work and others where they do not work. Too much is expected of CCTV schemes. The other issue is that communities must find a sizeable amount of matching funds. If we are to criticise the scheme, we should do so in the round and understand that it is not merely a problem regarding data collection but also with what is expected of the scheme and the requirement for matching funding.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">The frustration arising from the failure of this scheme to kick on has been debated here and in the Chamber. Frustration is shared by members of the Opposition, the Minister, who has spoken frankly about this matter, and the Department. The scheme is motivated by genuine concern to help communities but its format has not worked, which is borne out by the level of take-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> On the broader issue, CCTV does work and I have given examples of previous schemes going back three Administrations. Deputy Kelly referred to his time as Minister for the Environment and Local Government and he is correct that responsibility has moved from Department to Department. Previously, the Department of Justice and Equality ran a scheme in a different format which worked well. My county benefitted from it and the chamber of commerce was the applicant which drew down the funds. It has been successful because the Garda use it as a pre-emptive tool and to help with traffic management around the towns. It has an impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> We must ask why CCTV is wanted and if cameras are located in the right areas. The crucial question is who are the applicants. In many cases, community-minded volunteers do not have the wherewithal or fundraising capacity to make the application in the first instance. Given that the joint policing committees are effectively a collaboration between the Garda and local authorities, the local authorities need to apply for the scheme. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government must work with the Department of Justice and Equality if this scheme is to be successful across the country. Otherwise, it will only operate on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis, where it works in a small number of communities but will be largely unsuccessful in the rest of the country. </p>

          <p eId="para_115">If the matter I raise is not relevant, the Chairman may dismiss me. The current scheme - I do not know its exact name - sees €1 million provided annually, but only €430,000 has been drawn down. I was looking at the figures yesterday. Not to disagree with my colleague, but the reason is that there are problems with drawdown. There is a policing committee which theoretically includes everybody in the community, all of whom have a seat at the table. However, the data controller has to be the local authority and most local authorities, with the exception of Fingal County Council which has €100 million on deposit, do not have a red cent. Sligo County Council, in particular, can barely pay its librarians, which has been an issue in recent years. For this reason, local authorities are not queuing up to assume additional overhead costs and further responsibilities with GDPR and everything else to be the data controller. We could usefully suggest to the Department that it needs to review who can apply for the scheme and who can be the data controller. Perhaps the scope can be broadened. There is a network of community councils - chambers of commerce, for example, to which Deputy Cassells referred - and others, who, if provided with adequate training, may be better placed to be the data controller given the financial constraints on most local authorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">On a technical point, there is a difference between a data controller and data operator and where the onus on the work output lies. In our case, the Garda is the data operator. It is the gardaí who do all the work. We want that role to be performed by the professionals, in other words, An Garda Síochána. The Garda does all of the work.</p>

          <p eId="para_117">Last night, I spent two hours at a meeting of Laois County Council attended by the chief executive of the council and members of various groups from around the county which discussed this exact issue. People refer to the previous CCTV scheme for urban areas, which involved the chamber of commerce in the various towns and the Garda taking a direct monitoring role. That system worked. For some reason, the community CCTV scheme was linked to the local authorities, although I acknowledge it is based in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">I saw the document produced last night by the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice and Equality. The format laid down by them is that the local authority has to be the data controller. There then has to be a data processor and people can then have access and can look at it. In fact, it can only be gardaí who have access to that to get copies of what is in the system for evidential purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> The system approved by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda Síochána referred to somebody having access in order to view what is on CCTV - this is exactly what the Department has written down. There must be a written request from an officer not below the rank of superintendent to the data controller, which is the local authority, and there must be confirmation in writing that this can happen before the officer can see it. What happens at weekends? The local authority has to have a staff member at the end of a phone 24-7, 365 days a year if it is to meet the data protection rules under the responsibility given to it. It cannot allow anyone else to access it without that specific request to the data controller. The involvement of the local authorities has put an awful ream of responsibility on them, although I know it was brought in through the policing committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> The Garda can operate this very effectively in urban areas because the local authority is not involved. In rural areas, under the informal arrangements that applied before the data controllers came in, gardaí would come out and look at the issue straight away, for example, they would see two strange cars in the area and they would be moving on it in a few minutes. Now, we are bringing in the local authorities, and they are expressing concern that their staff will be subpoenaed to give evidence every time a case arises in court. I listened to the chief executive in my area and I understand the position. In addition, there is no funding from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or the Department of Rural and Community Development for the ongoing costs of operating this system. Everything we are talking about comes under a capital grant to get it up and running and then, after maybe three years, the volunteers get tired maintaining the system and technology changes, and what they have is not as good.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> It is a very complicated system. We put the Department of Justice and Equality on notice that we are going to raise it. We want to simplify the system given there are too many layers of people getting involved. Unless the local authority signs a consent to act as the data controller, the application cannot be accepted by the Department of Justice and Equality for funding. It is not that there is not drawdown; it is that, in certain areas, there is a block on the applications going in. We will raise that with the Department of Justice and Equality when it comes in, although not today as it is dealing with the prisons issue. I believe it is scheduled for a visit in the near future. This is of relevance to many people in certain areas of the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">This is a bit confusing. Employee assistance helplines, as we know from dealing with protected disclosures and all of that, should be mandatory and that is why I asked for a list of when they were put in place. We can see that it was done in some institutions in accordance with the timeframe, in some others it was done beforehand, and in others it was done quite late. It is alarming that some institutions were doing it and others were not. That is one issue. The fact it took months for the Department to get this information through the HEA is concerning.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> There is another issue. As I understand it, employee assistance helplines are also meant to be the first port of call for people who have issues which could potentially end up being protected disclosures. Having looked at the names of some of the firms involved - this is no commentary on them and they may all have a role in regard to well-being, employee assistance and so on - but I am not sure these organisations can deal with those sorts of issues. I want an inquiry in this regard. We have all the issues in regard to third level institutions and they are in again next week. I want clarity on this issue. If somebody has issues that concern them and which are not necessarily about their well-being but concern what is happening in their workplace corporately, for want of a better phrase, are these the right organisations to be going to? I genuinely do not know. I have a suspicion these are not the organisations that many individuals feel would be able to deal with their concerns.</p>

We will note and publish that, and we will write to the HEA on that basis for further information in regard to the service provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> The next item is No. 1815 concerning the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland providing information requested by the committee in regard to SBCI, how much it has provided through the banks and how much is provided through non-bank on-lenders. The correspondent states that the information provided in the appendix is commercially sensitive as it concerns amounts provided to different banks. I propose that we publish the letter on our website but that we do not publish the appendix because it contains this commercially sensitive information. The person has requested that. He said the attached appendix 1 sets out details of SBCI's current lending relationship and the facilities provided to those on-lenders, and some of the details are commercially sensitive. Obviously, there is competition between all of these financial institutions. SBCI has asked that it be deemed confidential and not be published or circulated to a wider audience. We can circulate the letter, which will not give the specifics that the committee had sought. At least the members of the committee have the answer.</p>

Essentially we were told that an extension was given to a contract years in advance of when it was required, that may well have ended up costing a State entity - not necessarily the one that was dealing with it - more. The committee wanted to know if public money was used, and whether public money was used in any of the amount that came from the infrastructure fund. The funding can be raised in different ways but we want to know if any of that was public money. That was the net point.</p>

On the rationale for extending maintenance of metropolitan area network contract with Enet, the earlier document stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_142">Enet was awarded the first Concession Agreement for an initial 15 year term in July 2004. In July 2009, following a further procurement process, Enet was awarded an initial 15 year contract to manage the 60 Phase II MANs.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">They say that in that original contract there was provision for a roll-over for another ten years. On page 4 and 5 they also state "Norcontel Consultants were engaged in April 2016 and provided advice and modelling on the financial and commercial aspects of both options", as in "an extension of the Term or [a] return to the market for the purposes of securing a new Concession Agreement". They are saying that the consultants came back and recommended an extension of the contract was the most beneficial from a financial perspective.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">Yes, the Irish Infrastructure Fund. One would almost think it was a State organisation with that name they put on it, which is confusing. I see in public documentation that the Irish Infrastructure Fund has regularly stated that it is a State-backed investment. I took this to mean that the State had a shareholding. I thought that our correspondence from the committee was to know what percentage of the shares are held by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund in the Irish Infrastructure Fund. They have come back to say that the Irish Infrastructure Fund has a number of investors, one of which is the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. When I read "State-backed" and "investor" I took it to be a percentage of ownership. Now it appears that the investor in this case really only has a financial interest in the outcome of the investments. Using the words "State-backed" and "investor" I was under the impression that the State had a shareholding in it. This committee wanted to establish the amount of that shareholding. Now it is said that it is just a joint venture to the extent that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund has put in €250 million, the others have put in €250 million and they hope to benefit. It is, therefore, more of a joint venture than an investment or a shareholding.</p>

There was procurement for this event but can we ask the OPW for greater detail about one or two of these suppliers? The same suppliers seem to emerge from the process because there may not be the kind of competition available to enable a genuine procurement process. Can we drill down into that a little bit and perhaps pick one or two items? There is no point in looking at the multiple suppliers. The first one is an obvious candidate for further scrutiny. We should ask the OPW to provide us with further detail about the procurement process, certainly as it concerns Actavo and the provision of platforms, media risers, trackways, fencing and that kind of thing. What was the procurement process?</p>

          <p eId="para_214">As a second request, we could ask about the multiple suppliers. Many items have been combined to reach €2 million. We will ask that the OPW provides us with a breakdown of any individual company that received over €50,000. That should not be too difficult; there cannot be too many of them. We will ask the OPW for the information requested by Deputy Catherine Murphy. </p>

          <p eId="para_216"> No. 1820 B is from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, providing information regarding the legal costs for the prosecution of cases of tobacco-related offences. There are no legal costs because people can effectively do what they like in that area. There are no prosecutions to any meaningful extent, as we established on the last occasion. We note and publish that. </p>
          <p eId="para_217"> The next item is No. 1821 B, a bimonthly update from the Tax Appeals Commission, providing information on high-value appeals, which we had asked for. We have seen one of the lists before, and we also have an updated list. We have asked for an update every two months about how it is progressing, because we are very concerned that there are cases worth €1.6 billion sitting on its desk. We want to keep the pressure on it, and for it to keep the pressure on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for additional staff to ensure that it is more efficient in dealing with those issues. We are following up with that for a good reason. </p>
          <p eId="para_218"> The next item is 1822 B, from Ms Jackie Maguire, chairperson of the County and City Management Association, clarifying that local authority chief executives will make themselves available to assist the Accounting Officer from the Department at a future meeting, for which we have a provisional date. It is good that there is agreement on this issue; there was some confusion about the letter we received on the last occasion. We will note and publish that. </p>
          <p eId="para_219"> The next item is 1793 C, requesting that the committee makes inquiries from the Residential Tenancies Board about a landlord who has not been registered since 2012. This is not within the remit of the committee, and the individual should seek clarification directly from the board itself. We will write to the person on that basis. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> Item 1796 C is from an individual requesting that the committee makes inquiries into the procurement arrangements for section 38 and 39 organisations, and senior HSE managers taking up positions in those organisations. We will ask for an information note from the HSE to that end. Is that agreed? Agreed. </p>
          <p eId="para_221"> The next item is 1803 C, from an individual to a number of newspapers. It is a copy of a letter concerning Galway GAA, which is not within our remit. We will simply note the item.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">I wish to make a brief comment. The last line of the letter asks that this committee investigates this matter. The Chairman has pointed out that it is a letter to the newspapers to which we have been cc'd. I do not want to overstate the matter, but I want to comment because it has been published. It states that we should remember that the taxpayer has funded the GAA over many years, with many millions of euro received from the Exchequer. Any cent of money received by an Cumann Lúthchleas Gael from the Exchequer is accounted for. The issues pertaining to Galway GAA are issues pertaining to internal GAA issues concerning ticketing and credit cards and are, as the Galway GAA chairman has stated, damning. The issue of public moneys paid to the GAA are accounted to at the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport in terms of revenue or capital, and every cent received from the Exchequer is utilised to the maximum for the benefit of local communities throughout this country. The GAA provides a focal point for many communities, not just in a sporting sense but also in a community sense. Any negative inference that could be drawn from that letter, or any attempt to conflate issues, is wrong in the extreme.</p>

          <p eId="para_223">I do not know the person who wrote this letter but it is certainly the case that this issue was in the public domain before Christmas. Despite the assurances from Deputy Cassells, who is passionate about the GAA, we are not here to be passionate about the GAA or to defend it. We are here to discuss public money and accountability for its spending. That is the issue here. I am aware that we have not been written to directly, which is a difficulty. However, the issue being raised is accountability for public money. It arises everywhere, including, for example, in the charity sector, and I am reminded of the issues faced by Console in the past. There are always people who come forward who say that charities do tremendous work. It is irrelevant; it is important to remember their work but that is not our role. We have to look at whether public money is being spent on an organisation and how it is accounted for. I do not know about the extent of the issues raised in the letter. I was made aware of it via the media before Christmas and it certainly made me wonder about the public moneys provided to the GAA and how they are accounted for. The same question will arise when we talk about the prison services, and Government moneys being provided to, for example, the Red Cross for a particular programme. I will be asking questions about how that money is accounted for. It is a legitimate question. I require guidance on whether-----</p>

          <p eId="para_224">I was very clear in my contribution that the money provided to the GAA from Exchequer funds is fully accounted for. It is a large organisation. I can be very dispassionate when dealing with Exchequer funds and I hope Deputy Connolly knows that. When I attended my own GAA club's annual general meeting last week, I saw that the public moneys it received were fully recorded and accounted for. The GAA is a large organisation, operating at central council level, provincial county level, county board level and club AGM level, which all have separate accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Public moneys paid to the GAA must be fully accounted for and are subject to scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport. My point is that public moneys were not the issue here. Instead, it was ticketing issues and a personal credit card. Public moneys must be properly discharged and accounted for not just by the GAA but also the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, or any other sports organisation in receipt of such moneys, and rightly so. There was an inference in that letter that tried to conflate two things which are completely separate. That was my point.</p>

          <p eId="para_226">The basic question is: where do we go with this in the context of guidance on it? I do not want assurance from a member because I am not here for that. I am here to ensure that public money is accounted for regardless of the organisation involved. I do not know enough about this, just what was on the radio and in the newspapers, which is that there was, at least, serious mismanagement of funds. I do not have the details but what was published was extremely worrying. It is legitimate to ask about public moneys going to the GAA if this is the such moneys are being handled. I seek guidance on that. Clearly, the GAA does not come under our remit, but public money and value for money do.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">I agree with Deputy Connolly. It is not a question of us examining GAA funds but the public money going to it. I agree that there is an attempt to convey the perception that public money is being mismanaged. If that is not the case, let somebody in the GAA tell us that and show us how the organisation is managing the money. It is a genuine question. Guidance is needed.</p>

I presume we could consider writing to seek confirmation from the Department regarding payments to the sporting organisation concerned, the GAA, and that it is satisfied that the moneys it has allocated from public funds have been properly accounted for.

          <p eId="para_245">Once we get that, we can consider the matter further. We will write to that person.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> No. 1804C is correspondence from an individual making observations regarding cases that have been before the courts recently and an EU directive that apparently prevents police from using historical telephone records. I propose to note this item. The Committee of Public Accounts is not getting into that issue. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> No. 1812C is correspondence from an individual refuting information that was provided to the correspondent on foot of a committee request to the HSE regarding the refunding costs for the provision of services in the Brothers of Charity in Roscommon. We have put this matter on our work programme. We will note that for now and return to it. I had agreed to meet that person in the new year and I will arrange to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">Grand. I gave a commitment that I, as Chairman, would arrange to meet him in the new year. We are not proposing that the person meet the full committee. We will put that arrangement in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> No. 1823C is from Professor Mey in the University of Limerick providing information regarding an in-house psychiatrist at the University of Limerick. We will note that. It is not for publication.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> No. 1824C is from Mr. Mark Rea, secretary, Northern Ireland Standardbred Association, requesting the committee to make inquiries regarding the monitoring of State funding to the Irish Harness Racing Association. I propose to forward the correspondence to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for a response.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> No. 1825C is from an individual who has undertaken research relating to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. I propose we write to the individual to thank her for her offer to meet us. We may make further contact at some point.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> No. 1826C, dated 27 November 2018, is from an individual who has provided some observations regarding the University of Limerick, UL. We will note this item and it may inform our engagement with UL on 24 January 2019. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> No. 1827C is from an individual who has copied the committee on a letter to the HEA regarding the UL. There is no specific request to the committee so we will note this.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> No. 1831C is from Deputy Catherine Murphy. We will consider this as part of our work programme regarding the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board. We note it.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> The final item, No. 1832C, is from Deputy David Cullinane proposing a number of questions for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. We agree to requesting the Department to provide this information. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> We will hold over the next item, which is the 15 accounts and statements for review, for the next day as we wish to move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> We will agree not to have a long discussion on the work programme. We might have a longer discussion on it on the next day. The work programme is up on the screen so we can get things moving in the meantime and so members are clear on it. Today we are meeting officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and the Irish Prison Service. At 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday next we will have a private meeting with specific staff members or former staff members who have made protected disclosures or raised particular matters relating to UL. It is not our main meeting of the week. It will not be a long meeting and it will take place over at lunchtime. Next Thursday, 21 January, we have report No. 103 from the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the UL and the Institute of Technology Sligo regarding the remuneration of certain senior staff. We will have an update on the Thorn report and a special report, No. 104, from the Comptroller and Auditor General on Waterford Institute of Technology regarding disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry. We will have witnesses from Waterford Institute of Technology, the Institute of Technology Sligo, University of Limerick, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> With regard to 31 January, before the summer recess last year, Deputy Catherine Murphy had written us a letter and I suggested that we might invite members of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to discuss the overrun and the fact that they do not appear to know how to prepare a tender. They have obviously entered into many commitments and I suggest that we examine the board's most recent financial statements to see how it is running the organisation. Members of the board appeared before the health committee yesterday but I was not aware of that when I suggested putting this on the agenda. We will try not to duplicate what happened in the health committee so we might have to look at what it did. With a €1.7 billion investment, it would do no harm to have a second pair of eyes look at it without specifically duplicating or repeating what happened in the health committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">It would be in the context of the 2017 financial statements. The Taoiseach stated in the Dáil that the Committee of Public Accounts should examine this issue. He has clarified that he intended to refer to the Joint Committee on Health.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">I have written seeking that the Minister appear before the committee because there was political sign-off on this project. The Taoiseach is well aware of the project because the go-ahead for it was given while he was the Minister for Health. It would be of use for the committee to investigate the checks and balances that are in place for other projects as well as this one from which we can learn a great deal. There are often significant overruns in capital State projects. Other countries are far better at managing the cost of such projects. There is a process issue in regard to the management of these projects which we need to investigate. There is a section of a Department which deals with procurement but that relates to buying things rather than dealing with matters such as the roll-out of infrastructure. Local authorities have been responsible for a significant number of positive projects through the years because they built up an expertise in how to tender. The expertise is not in place for once-off or occasional procurement such as a national children's hospital, which, obviously, is a hundred year project. There is a very significant process or oversight gap in that regard and this is an example of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_264">I concur with Deputy Murphy that the Minister should appear before the committee. I spent four hours at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health yesterday going through this issue. It was useful in terms of what the Committee of Public Accounts will be doing for separate reasons. Prior to the meeting, I was not fully aware of certain facts. The board that was set up is a publicly constituted board which reports to another board which reports to another board which then reports the Minister. The reporting line is that the chairperson of the board reports to another chair, namely, Mr. Dean Sullivan, who then reports to Mr. Jim Breslin who reports to the Minister. There are four layers and it is important that the people in charge of each layer appear on 31 January because that is the decision-making process.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> A significant amount of documentation was requested at the health committee. I ask the clerk to contact the clerk to the health committee to obtain that documentation in advance of our meeting on 31 January. It deals with issues of great importance which this committee would examine such as the scoping of the project, financial decisions, tendering and so on. I ask that all of those relevant documents be provided to the committee. The meeting yesterday was quite an enlightening experience. Although there is a role in the matter for the health committee, there is certainly a role for this committee. This is the first time this form of build has been undertaken in this country. The chair of the board yesterday made repeated reference to best practice and stated that he would not change any of the decisions that were made. He stated that he was disappointed and that there were issues in respect of tendering for electronics, electrical work and so on but that he would not change any of the other decisions that were made. It is critically important that all of that documentation be provided in advance of the meeting. For information, the relevant figure is €1.733 billion.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">I second that request.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> As members are aware, the refurbishment of Leinster House is ongoing. As a former member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, I can testify that the refurbishment is many decades overdue. I am sure all members support it and look forward to its completion. Regardless of the cost involved, the work is vitally important, given that Leinster House was built in 1745. The work continues on from the construction of Leinster House 2000 in the 2000s and the refurbishment of Government Buildings, which is home to the Department of the Taoiseach, in the 1990s and late 1980s. That said, €8 million was provided for the work on Leinster House but according to media reports the funding has been exhausted. Although I am certain the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is considering the matter, against the backdrop of the overruns regarding the national children's hospital and in the light of the media coverage of the matter, the committee could usefully inquire as to the outlook in terms of total expenditure and completion dates in order to ensure that adequate oversight is in place. This is a horse of a completely different colour to the issue of the national children's hospital. Regardless of the cost involved, all members agree that the work is many decades overdue. Some €8 million or €10 million is a modest sum compared to the billions being discussed in regard to the hospital. I suggest that the committee write to the Office of Public Works and the Ceann Comhairle to ask what is the situation, how works are progressing, what is the budget outlook and so on. As I stated, I am sure the Oireachtas Commission is giving close consideration to the matter. It has a finite budget that is allocated on a multi-annual basis over three years and I am sure it is not happy about cost overruns. The committee should write to the head of the commission, the OPW and perhaps the Ceann Comhairle to ask for an update on the budget, the status of the project, how much more will it cost and the likely completion dates.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">It normally advises on the form of the project, such as whether it should be a public private partnership or a conventional project. I do not know whether this project was brought to the National Development Finance Agency. We can inquire as to whether it had an involvement in it. This is a specialist board. It is different to a situation whereby a Department is undertaking a capital project on a one-off or programmatic basis. This is a specialist organisation which only exists for the period during which the hospital is being developed. There is a separate structure for the new hospital to run with the management and integrate the services from the hospitals that are being amalgamated. Generally, instructions and arrangements for the adequacy of appraisal and control of projects are covered by the public spending code which is within the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">They do have some capacity to look at individual projects and examine and report on them. I might suggest looking to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform around what are the arrangements in place to ensure there is adequate control and appraisal of capital projects.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">In addition to the four groups we have invited in, we are writing directly to the Department and the National Development Finance Agency, which is a branch of the NTMA in respect of their role and advice in this issue, which they may or may not have had. I do not think we will get six witnesses here. We will write to the Department and the National Development Finance Agency and say we want an early answer. Depending on the answer we get, we may need to bring them in. As of now, we are asking the others to come in on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> On 7 February we want to deal with all the different Votes that go before the Oireachtas and the group of Votes for the Department of An Taoiseach. There are six of them there and there are Accounting Officers in most of those separate areas. I propose that we break it into two groups on that day, one dealing with the legal side of it, namely the Votes for the Office of the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor; and the other engaging with the Secretary General of the Department of An Taoiseach, which will cover the Department of the Taoiseach, the President's establishment, and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which I think has a separate Accounting Officer. We will not have all six in together but will break the meeting into two halves.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> On 14 February we have agreement in respect of meeting with broadband providers. Eir has accepted the invitation to come in. Imagine has accepted. Siro has declined because it pulled out of the bidding process and did not want to get further involved. Enet has accepted and we are waiting to hear from BT. They are only assisting us as a committee with no knowledge of this technical area. They are just coming forward voluntarily as witnesses to assist us in our understanding of the broader issues so that we will be more informed on the issues when we are talking to the Department. They are not required to be here. They are here to offer us knowledge on the whole broadband area to be of assistance to us in our work dealing with the national broadband plan.</p>

That would be a matter for the line committee. Of course Siro has to decline; it is the only tender bidder left.

          <p eId="para_299">I think the Committee of Public Accounts has to watch the cost of the broadband decisions that are being made and commitments that will tie the taxpayer. The scale of the investment in the national broadband plan is at least double what is being proposed in the National Children's Hospital. If the Committee of Public Accounts were to say it is only €4 billion and we are not going to look at it, we would not be doing our job. We need to be as informed as possible when we are dealing with the national broadband plan. We already had a letter this morning from the Department which is shocking, saying that they specified 30 MB of download and 6 MB of upload, which is pathetic. They should not proceed if that is what they are talking about. We do not want the State to be spending over €3 billion on something that is out of date years before it is even switched on. They have not defined what.</p>

Do not be guided by the Miriam Lord view of how we conduct ourselves at this meeting and just shut up and listen when people are talking. That is what I would suggest. There was a Secretary General here before Christmas. We asked him whether the Department looked at 5G and he said it did. When we got in under the bonnet, we discovered it had not. That is about spending €2 billion for this as opposed to X amount less for that. We established this at a meeting before Christmas as a fact, down to numbers, sums and expenditure, not policy.</p>

There are issues that we would welcome talking to the like of BT about, for example in respect of the metropolitan area networks, MAN, contracts and some of the decisions that were made around them. It is perfectly legitimate for us to be getting a degree of expertise. Each organisation will have its own viewpoint or its own bias. It is a means for us to gather information.

          <p eId="para_324">Okay. I am moving on. The policy issue in respect of the need for a national broadband plan is beyond dispute. Nobody in their right mind will debate that policy. We are talking about the implementation and the cost of carrying out that policy, not the policy itself. It is sacrosanct that we need the broadband plan. In respect of the processes, controls, implementation, value, cost and tendering process, we need to examine it.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> On 21 February we have the financial statement of Kildare-Wicklow Education and Training Board, ETB, for 2015, which is the big bogey that really started us down the road of the ETBs. Will there be any more recent financial statement?</p>

I note, however, that for the meeting, there will also be the chapter concerning central government funding of local authorities. That is a significant issue in itself and work was done in respect of it last year by the Comptroller and Auditor General. During the last discussion we had on this, there was such a myriad of financing and spending details, examining it proved difficult. It is good the CCMA representatives will be here that day. Will the secretariat make it aware that we will be discussing this issue? I would like the CCMA representatives to address the distribution and utilisation of local authority funding to ensure there is a structured discussion around it.</p>

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p>

          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2019-01-17T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_343">The Irish Prison Service is formally part of the Department of Justice and Equality but in effect is operated as an executive agency and is funded and accounted for separately through Vote 21. While the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for Vote 21, the service is headed operationally by the director general and is administered centrally from headquarters located in Longford town. The Department has policy and legislative responsibility for the service. The 2017 Appropriation Account for Vote 21 records gross expenditure of just under €327 million in the year. As indicated in the figure on screen, more than two thirds of the expenditure related to pay. The remainder relates to maintenance and improvements to the prison estate and equipment purchases, services for prisoners including education provision, and other operating costs. Cash receipts for the year amounted to €13.1 million and comprised mainly retained pension related deductions from staff salaries. There was an underspend of €3.8 million relative to the net Estimate provision. An amount of €2.2 million was carried forward to 2018 under capital carryover provisions, leaving just under €1.6 million for surrender to the Exchequer. I draw attention in the audit report to a material level of procurement in 2017 that was not compliant with procurement rules as disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_252">
          <from> Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll<recordedTime time="2019-01-17T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_344">I welcome the opportunity to meet the committee to discuss the 2017 appropriation account for prisons Vote. I propose to keep my opening remarks brief and hand over to the newly appointed director general of the Prison Service, Ms Caron McCaffrey, who will also make a brief opening statement. The Prison Service is a key component of the criminal justice system and its voted expenditure is directed towards one strategic programme - the provision of safe, secure, humane and rehabilitative custody for people sent to prison. As the Comptroller and Auditor General said, the gross expenditure for the Vote in 2017 was €326.9 million, of which 71% related to payroll costs, 22% related to non-pay current expenditure and 7% or €22.8 million was capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> The Prison Service currently operates 12 prisons. There were 9,287 committals to prisons with a daily average of 3,680 prisoners in custody during 2017. In total there were 3,186 staff in the Prison Service at the end of 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> The Prison Service operates as an executive office of the Department of Justice and Equality within a statutory framework and policy parameters established by the Minister. The practical effect is that while the Secretary General of the day is the Accounting Officer for the Vote, the director general of the Prison Service and her team carry out the day-to-day operation of the prison system. Each year, the director general of the Prison Service and the assistant secretary in charge of prisons and probation policy agree and sign an oversight and performance agreement. This commits to a minimum of two formal governance meetings per year. Further, this is subject to a yearly review by the agency governance oversight subgroup of the Department of Justice and Equality, which conducts an annual governance overview of the bodies under the aegis of the Department and reports to the management board on any key issues arising or matters of concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> The committee may wish to note that a number of reports over the years have recommended greater autonomy for the Prison Service from the Department. Recent reports in this regard include a report from the Inspector of Prisons of November 2015. The effectiveness and renewal group, ERG, recommended in 2018 that the Government examine converting the operational elements of the Irish Prison Service into a separate agency and the ERG may return to this issue in its next report which is due shortly. In part, what is generally envisaged is that the director general would become the appropriate authority for issues relating to staff management including disciplinary matters and possibly the Accounting Officer for expenditure on the prisons Vote. These matters are being pursued with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and in order to give them effect they will involve legislative change. This approach is consistent with the review of the governance relationship with our agencies which is taking place alongside the very significant transformation programme in the Department which I am currently leading. I am pleased to inform the committee that this project is under way with the major restructuring of the Department to be completed over the next nine months.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> Penal policy is constantly evolving and the Department and its agencies continue to work towards implementing the recommendations of the penal policy review group. The recommendations of this body emphasised, among other things, the importance of interagency co-operation in the development and implementation of penal policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> I will briefly address certain matters which have been receiving attention recently in relation to the Prison Service. A court affidavit by a serving prison officer makes allegations about activities in the Prison Service, including unauthorised surveillance. Notwithstanding that it was the subject of a newspaper article, that affidavit has not yet been opened in court and so its details cannot be publicly discussed. The committee will be aware that because the Minister was of the view that the publication of these allegations created a public concern, he asked the Inspector of Prisons to carry out an urgent preliminary investigation to determine the facts as far as possible and report to him. The investigation is now under way and we await its outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> I am also aware also that the committee recently met a prison officer in private session on certain matters, which I assume included reference to a protected disclosure made by the officer in question. As there are ongoing issues relating to this case, including matters before the courts, we cannot comment on the specifics of the case during today’s proceedings. However, with regard to protected disclosures generally, the Department put in place a protected disclosure policy in 2015 in accordance with the requirements of the Act. The procedures were updated in 2018 to provide for external independent assessment and investigation of disclosures made by Department staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Over the past three years, the Department has also engaged Transparency International Ireland, TII, to provide advice and support to disclosers and also participates in TII’s integrity at work initiative which facilitates the Department and its agencies to learn about best practice at multi-stakeholder forums and annual conferences as well as testing and developing existing policies and procedures on whistleblowing. </p>
          <p eId="para_352"> I will hand over at this point to the director general, Caron McCaffrey. </p>

          <p eId="para_353">A review of the protected disclosures policy for the Irish Prison Service has taken place and a revised policy was introduced in July 2018. The review was carried out to ensure that procedures regarding protected disclosures are up to date and in line with best practice and to take into account any lessons learned from protected disclosures received to date. An assessment undertaken with TII informed the review. Arising from the review, a number of new measures have been put in place in the protected disclosure process. They include independent professional advice for staff on the process and enhanced independent external assessment of disclosures including all notifications of penalisation. Employees making disclosures are now also provided with periodic and confidential feedback regarding assessment, investigation or review.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> The committee has in the past expressed concern about the level of sick leave in the Prison Service. There are limited international comparators available to us as very few countries publish sick leave statistics for their prison services. However, from the figures available to us, the 2017 sick leave figure of 15.7 days per employee per year places the Irish Prison Service at the lower end of the scale when compared with other prison services. Comparable figures for 2017 show Northern Ireland reported a figure of 19.7 days, Denmark 21.9 days, Latvia 18.88 days and Slovenia 15.3 days per member of staff. </p>
          <p eId="para_355"> Prison staff work in an extremely challenging environment in which, on a daily basis, they face unique circumstances unlike most others in the public sector. Notwithstanding this, the Irish Prison Service is tackling the unacceptable level of sick leave we are currently experiencing in two ways - first, by providing staff with the best possible supports to target the work-related causes of sick leave and, second, through focused, structured management of all absences to identify and reduce absenteeism. The Irish Prison Service is committed to strengthening the support we provide for our staff. In addition to the employee assistance programme which has two national officers and over 40 locally appointed staff support officers, the supports in place for staff include an independent counselling service which we introduced in 2016. The service is available to all staff free of charge and provides staff with access to up to six counselling sessions for support covering a wide range of issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> In 2019 the service will complete the introduction of the critical incident stress management model of support interventions for staff, which has been endorsed by the State Claims Agency. The model aims to minimise the emotional impact of critical incidents on staff, increase the resistance and resilience of staff to harmful stress and prevent the harmful effects on staff of such incidents by working with and supporting employees at the time of critical incidents. </p>
          <p eId="para_357"> I pay tribute to the employees of the Prison Service, many of whom work in a difficult and challenging environment to maintain a safe, secure and humane prison system which contributes to safer communities. Both the Secretary General and I will be happy to take any questions the committee has. </p>

          <p eId="para_358">We will now move on to the members of the committee. Deputy Farrell has 20 minutes and Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has 15 minutes. The following speakers have ten minutes each: Deputy MacSharry, Deputy Kelly, Deputy Catherine Murphy and Deputy Connolly. At least six members want to get in before the divisions in the Dáil. Even if a member is mid-sentence at the end of their ten or 15 minutes, I will stop them because otherwise other members will not have time to contribute. Everyone can get back in a second time. The first six speakers have indicated they want to get in before the divisions in the Dáil. I will start with Deputy Farrell.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">I will do my best to take much less than 20 minutes. I thank the witnesses for attending. If they want to contribute at any point during my questions, they should feel free to do so. That includes the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> Notwithstanding the remarks on current matters before the WRC, among other things, and the whistleblower who appeared before the committee, the only observation I will make on the point is timeliness. I refer to the timeliness of responding to the issue, dealing with the issue and, in one particular instance, the timeliness of the provision of crucial information to the whistleblower which, on my observation, was very poor. I will not get into the detail of it. I do not expect the witnesses will want to either but I just wanted to put it on the record. </p>
          <p eId="para_361"> I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his work on the accounts. Two major issues jump out at me. The first is non-compliance with procurement rules and the second is the issue of the additional Vote, which as a percentage of the overall budget is quite significant. I will start with the non-compliance with national procurement rules. I would like some details. The numbers have increased quite significantly as provided for in the report. There were five urgent purchases for €0.5 million. What is deemed urgent in the Prison Service? What would urgently require €0.5 million of expenditure that could not be foreseen? </p>

          <p eId="para_364">There are a number of circumstances where we have contracts in place that were not subject to a competitive tender. To focus specifically on the area the Deputy identified, within that category are urgent requirements and issues of security consideration. Of the five cases, which total €498,000, three related to security equipment we were not in a position to go to the market to tender on. That comprised handcuffs, an explosive detection system and the installation of security netting at a prison to combat a particular issue we have with drugs being thrown over the walls.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">How did the Prison Service not foresee it would require nets? Nets have been a very common feature of the Irish Prison Service for many years. How did it not envisage it might require bomb detection equipment and why was it urgent?</p>

For security reasons, we are not in a position to go to the market.

          <p eId="para_374">There are a number of security systems in operation in our service that relate to a sole supplier. They include some of our locking and access systems and our fire safety systems. As they are provided by a particular supplier, their servicing and maintenance can only be undertaken by that service provider. There were six such cases in 2017 which totalled €1.42 million. They will continue to be included until the systems are replaced. Similarly there are some ICT legacy systems within our organisation and the updating and maintenance of those systems can only be undertaken by one company. However, we are looking at opportunities to move away from that and develop our own in-house models. In one of the three cases in 2017, which totalled €0.396 million, we have moved towards putting in place our own system so we will not be wholly dependent on one supplier in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_376">Of the 18 procurement scenarios, some are still under review. My understanding is that this is a common feature in the Prison Service where matters are being reviewed. Could Ms McCaffrey give us some of the details of this amount?</p>

          <p eId="para_377">The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, undertakes a great deal of tendering on behalf of the Irish Prison Service, and any delay in the OGP's tendering process gives rise to a roll-over of contracts. In 2018, that equated to €5.2 million, which included contracts for the provision of ICT, plumbing and heating supplies, bedding, dental supplies, and GP and pharmacy services. Of the 18 cases, the OGP now has contracts in place for eight. A further two have been advertised, two are under evaluation and the requirements have been specified for the outstanding six.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">There has been a significant increase in the volume of instances of non-compliance. From 2012 to 2017, it increased almost fivefold from ten instances, worth just shy of €1 million, to 50 with a value of €8.8 million. The Prison Service constantly reviews how it operates procedurally as a quasi-Government department. Is there anything the service can do to improve how it operates? Is the escalation going to continue?</p>

Second, we are working internally with our director of finance to enhance the procurement skills available to us so as to ensure that our team, where appropriate, can put those contracts in place in a timely manner.

I am sorry, as I had the information in front of me a moment ago. The report was commissioned internally regarding the operation of various funds and programmes within the Irish Prison Service and a review was conducted. I will see if I can find the name of it in my documents, but it related to financial controls over the prison shop, the assisted programme fund and prisoner cash accounts. I would like to get some general information on that last item. I am intrigued as to how it can work efficiently or effectively from a cost perspective. Ms McCaffrey might be able to inform me. A review of how the service controls its financial affairs is ongoing. Ms McCaffrey might enlighten me on it, please.</p>

Some issues were identified through a combination of situations by our internal audit unit, the audit committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of potential risks at prison level. In response, we have put in place a business process review. It is aimed specifically at areas of administrative, operational and accounting practices at prison level with a view to strengthening the processes that are in place. In particular, the review has examined matters such as sentence calculation, HR processes and cost management and led to us introducing more than 40 new standard operating procedures, SOPs, for staff at prison level so that we can ensure that the best procedures are in place and there is good compliance with same.</p>

I agree with the Deputy that it is an onerous requirement, but it is necessary for prisoners.

          <p eId="para_402">Grand. Perfect. This question is rather appropriate in the context of prisoners' injury and compensation claims. How does our figure of approximately 5% benchmark against other prison services, to the best of Ms McCaffrey's knowledge? In her opening statement, she gave us figures on absenteeism which appear to benchmark relatively well against other countries. While I welcome that, it would be useful if broader figures could be provided from the UK, in particular, because it is very close in terms of culture of employment and things like that. How does our 5% figure for claims compare internationally?</p>

          <p eId="para_404">Okay. The ratio of the cost of legal services to the level of compensation payments - it is roughly 2:1 - is a very common theme across a lot of Government Departments. Is there a manner in which that figure can be reduced? Is the Prison Service talking about the volume of individual claimants who are dealt with individually? I ask Ms McCaffrey to comment on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_405">We are proactively seeking to reduce the number of claims to which we are exposed as an organisation. We have a very good working relationship with the State Claims Agency. A number of structures that are in place are aimed at reducing compensation, which will then reduce the equivalent legal costs that relate to those claims. We have a risk management liaison group in place with the State Claims Agency. Our own internal compliance executive is chaired by me. Along with every governor within our system and all of our directorate staff from headquarters, we are looking at reducing the incidence of exposure to claims. We need to learn lessons from the incidents that happen in our prisons to ensure we can get the numbers down.</p>

I appreciate that Ms McCaffrey only took up her position on 13 December last. Does she believe it represents value for money for the Prison Service to go outside the service for training?

The training is done between our college and Waterford Institute of Technology. Our staff get a formal qualification - the higher certificate in custodial care - from a third level institute.</p>

Human nature determines that stresses in the workplace go beyond the workplace and extend to people who do not work within the Prison Service. Given the nature of the work, does Ms McCaffrey think it would be appropriate for the Prison Service to provide these services to family members on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as a matter of course?</p>

I will ask a series of questions, some of which will be straightforward quickfire questions. I will start off with compensation and legal costs. Is there a reason that legal costs for claims by prisoners are far higher than the level of compensation awarded? It is the only category in which we are paying more in legal costs than we are in compensation itself. Is there a reason for that?</p>

          <p eId="para_426">While Ms McCaffrey is checking her papers, I would like to say that the vast bulk of these claims are managed by the State Claims Agency. This includes the legal costs that are incurred. The Department, or the Prison Service in this case, finds itself paying the relative amounts. This is common across Departments. Obviously, some cases are more complex than others. Legal fees mount up in those cases. I think there were compensation cases in relation to slopping out. They are historic at this stage. The expenses in those cases would have been incurred by the State Claims Agency. I would like to make a general point in this context. I come across this in other jobs. As Ms McCaffrey has said, an agency or Department can try to reduce the number of claims by managing the process better, but it has very little control over the legal costs that are incurred because decisions on such matters are made by the State Claims Agency in many cases. I think that might be borne in mind here.</p>

          <p eId="para_427">The amount of money paid as legal fees with respect to prisoner cases came to €914,000 in 2017. Any payment on the slopping out cases that have been mentioned by the Secretary General is included in that figure. The State Claims Agency is managing slopping out claims on our behalf. To date, it has received 1,658 claims and High Court proceedings have been served in 983 of those claims. The payment that was made in those cases in 2017 may be inflating the figure.</p>

When representatives of the State Claims Agency were in here recently, they had a list of mass actions. I do not think they are called "class actions" in Ireland.

          <p eId="para_457">We introduced, during 2017, a commitment to ensure that all of our prisoners have at least two hours access out of their cells. So the numbers who have access out of their cells of less than two hours are very small. The last time that we completed a census of our population was in October and that figure stood at around 35. Included in that figure would be prisoners who for medical reasons actually are not in a position to avail of out-of-cell time greater than two hours.</p>

          <p eId="para_469">These are just protection prisoners who have sought to not participate in the full regime. Of the figure that I gave, which is around 35, there would be prisoners within that category.

          <p eId="para_471">For example, at any one time within our service we have between 20 and 30 prisoners on the waiting list for the Central Mental Hospital. Those prisoners would be suffering a severe and enduring mental illness and, potentially, be actively psychotic. It would be in those circumstances, Deputy, that that person would not be in a position to leave their cell.</p>

          <p eId="para_472">So for those 20 to 30 people, without putting words in Ms McCaffrey's mouth, a prison setting is not ideal. They should be in the Central Mental Hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">The Prison Service absolutely agrees with the Deputy. The caseload of the national forensic mental health service within the prison system is approximately 250. So there are 250 prisoners who are deemed to have a severe and enduring mental illness, and that would generally be either psychosis or schizophrenia. We agree that prison is not the best place to provide them with care because it is not a therapeutic environment. However, I do have to say that we get a fantastic inreach service from the national forensic mental health service.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">My next question is on the difference in services available in a prison setting as opposed to a hospital setting. Is there any service that these individuals do not get in a prison setting that they may be able to avail of if they were in the Central Mental Hospital?</p>

          <p eId="para_475">The big difference, in terms of medical care, is that in a designated centre, and obviously the CMH is a designated centre, there are differences around medication and the ability of the Central Mental Hospital to administer medication perhaps to patients who are not willing to take their medication, which can be an issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_477">As I mentioned, the national forensic mental health service provides us with an excellent inreach service. It is in all of our prisons bar three. So we do have a difficulty in terms of forensic mental health inreach services in Cork Prison, Limerick Prison and Castlerea. In 2016, the HSE did sanction the recruitment of forensic psychiatrists for those prisons but they have not been in a position to fill those posts so we do have a significant issue in those prisons. Where we do have an inreach service from the national forensic mental health service there is a team of doctors and nurses who come from the CMH who provide the appropriate care and oversight. I would like to mention our own staff, who do an amazing job in terms of assisting people who are suffering from mental illness in prison, the compassion and the humanity that is displayed by our discipline staff and our own internal nursing staff, in addition to the national forensic mental health service.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">I do not doubt that for one moment. It would also be fair to say that the staff would not have the training that the staff in the Central Mental Hospital would have in dealing with these individuals.</p>

          <p eId="para_479">We actually have provided mental health awareness training to all of our staff. It is an area that we identify as an issue or a skill that our staff require. All of our staff have gotten specific mental health awareness training. Obviously the nursing staff and our doctors would have quite a lot of background and training, and that is augmented by the specialist service that we get.</p>

          <p eId="para_488">I notice that the opiate programme has seen a decrease in the number of people who are accessing it but we have seen an increase in the number of people who are accessing addiction counselling. Is the opiate substitution programme available in all prisons?</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_379">
          <from> Ms Caron McCaffrey<recordedTime time="2019-01-17T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_489">It is available in all prisons with the exception of our open centres. We do not have methadone maintenance in either Loughan House or Shelton Abbey. It available across the estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> The reduction is actually related to a reduction within the community of those availing of that form of treatment. So, on any given day, we have approximately 530 prisoners on methadone stabilisation treatment within the Prison Service. We provided that service to almost 1,700 prisoners in 2017, which is 17% of the population who avail of methadone substitution treatment in Ireland. So a very significant contribution is made by the Irish Prison Service in providing drug treatment within the country. </p>

          <p eId="para_491">So the opiate programme obviously will deal with heroin addiction. An increasing number of people have a serious addiction to prescription drugs when they enter prison. What provisions are put in place for those individuals? Obviously they would not avail of an opiate programme. If one has a serious prescription addiction the come-down or going cold turkey in a prison or any other setting can be quite dangerous for that individual. What procedures are put in place for individuals who have an addiction? How do we assess on intake what a person's addiction is? I ask Ms McCaffrey to give us some information on this matter. I will leave it at that, Chairman, and will move on.</p>

          <p eId="para_492">Obviously, on committal, all of our prisoners are interviewed by both a nurse and a doctor, and we seek to engage with them around any addictions they may have be it in relation to illicit or prescription drugs or any alcohol addictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> A range of services are in place to provide drug treatment programmes to prisoners within our care. The Deputy mentioned the addiction counselling service that we have got in place. That is run by Merchant's Quay Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_494">The service is very successful and there is a significant uptake in respect of it. In addition, we have a nine-week drug treatment programme which operates in Mountjoy Prison. The programme forms part of a broader unit within the prison that has 50 beds available to assist people with drug treatment.</p>

I apologise in advance because people - particularly journalists - can be of the view that I am a bit abrupt in questioning.

          <p eId="para_547">Good. In the context of a protected disclosure made before, an external review was carried out by a retired judge, William Earley. In it, he made distinctions between bullying and victimisation that I want to put on the record. In part 7.5 he states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_548">It is not essential to identify a specific, individual bully where there is a finding that the IPS is responsible for repeated acts of carelessness or inefficiency which have, or are reasonably likely to have, an adverse effect upon the morale, health and welfare of a worker. Such acts can amount to unfair treatment, bullying or harassment, and/or penalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> He also states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_550">There is no definition of "bullying" in the Act. Section 3 (1) does interpret "penalisation" to mean any act or omission that affects a worker to the worker's detriment, and in particular includes</p>

          <p eId="para_565">I realise that but I am sure the Chairman will be reasonable with the Deputy. The issues arising from that case have now moved on into other fora but the Deputy is right that Judge Earley's report was issued, he made a finding that the officer was treated unfairly in some respects as a result of his actions and I am aware that following that, the previous direct general apologised to the officer. The case has now widened significantly because the officer has raised other issues. There are a large number of issues in this case which I presume the committee is aware of and they are now in front of the WRC, the Labour Court and the Circuit Court. In the WRC and the Labour Court, matters have been suspended pending the outcome of the Circuit Court proceedings. That is as much as I can say.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">In the Prison Service and in the Department, new systems have been put in place regarding protected disclosures and, of course, throughout the public service we have put new systems in place regarding dignity at work. Deputy MacSharry is aware, I imagine, of the dignity at work policy, which has been throughout the public service since, I think, about 2015 or 2016.

A relatively small number of people have come forward and made quite significant claims and allegations. These various issues are being examined in different fora. One of the key things we have introduced regarding protected disclosure in particular is external independent examination, both at the point of assessment, that is to say, assessing whether it is a protected disclosure, and at the point of investigation, that is to say, where it has been deemed a protected disclosure and one investigates the issue.</p>

However, in the case of prisoner A, who might be a guest of the State for a considerable period and who wants to have as easy a run as possible, and prison authorities that could do with a bit of intelligence as to what is happening on the landing, can Ms McCaffrey state categorically that said prisoner would be allowed a mobile phone and could feed back to the authorities as to what is happening on the landing in order that the authorities would give him or her an easier run?

          <p eId="para_635">No, I have not been answered. Mr. O'Driscoll has danced around the matter and told me it is against the law to have a mobile phone in prison. I asked a specific question.

          <p eId="para_648">Let us say a governor uses his or her discretion to gather intelligence and gives a mobile phone to lifer prisoner No. 56, for example, who gathers information that is fed in and used as intelligence. If a conscientious prison officer then inspects that prisoner's cell, finds the mobile phone and hands it over, what happens to that prison officer? He or she is in the governor's bad books, even though he or she acted in line with the legislation that Ms McCaffrey quoted and the power vested in the Prison Service, has done his or her job and has seized the contraband.</p>

          <p eId="para_659">That would help with a number of matters and clarify where surveillance is going on because if it is, there must be associated costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> The Protected Disclosures Bill was enacted in 2014. Why was it not introduced in the Prison Service until October 2015? Why did it need to be updated recently? The opening statements by Ms McCaffrey and Mr. O'Driscoll noted that a policy has been introduced to ensure employees who submit a protected disclosure are given periodic feedback and liaised with, which I welcome. Why was that policy introduced and how does it work?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_529">
          <from> Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll<recordedTime time="2019-01-17T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_661">I will take part of the response before asking Ms McCaffrey to add to what I say. My notes indicate that the policy started in July 2015, but either way there was a slight delay after the 2014 policy was introduced. That reflects the fact that all public sector organisations took a while to catch up with the protected disclosure provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> The protected disclosure process in the Prison Service has changed, and I will ask Ms McCaffrey to elaborate on that. It has also changed within the Department. With the benefit of experience, and recognising, in particular, the need to be as independent as possible and to be seen to be so, and partly because of the unpredictable workload from protected disclosures - which has not been such a great deal but it has been unpredictable - we have decided to outsource all assessment and investigation, as I said earlier. The OGP has put in place a panel from which we can draw in that regard, which we are now using for all the cases. </p>
          <p eId="para_663"> Until July 2018, the director of the internal audit at the Department was the recipient for protected disclosures, not only in the Department but also in the Prison Service. Since then, the Prison Service has put in place its own recipient and, therefore, its own process. Some protected disclosures, even in the Prison Service, continue to be sent to the Department because some people address protected disclosures to Ministers and we must deal with that. When that happens, we generally refer them to the Prison Service unless there is some sort of conflict, for example, with senior officers.</p>

          <p eId="para_668">Mr. O'Driscoll has answered my questions and, for time reasons, I will move on. I am interested in the change of internal auditor which was made. I accept that the issue of protected disclosures is changing and evolving. We, including those of us in the committee, are learning collectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> I will not beat around the bush. We all know which body we are talking about, and Deputy MacSharry made reference to it. The panel or company that is purported to be investigating the disclosure is an outside firm, which I will not name. I presume that its terms of reference were written by the person who was then the head of internal audit, but he was one of the recipients of the disclosure when it was made. I do not suggest anything against that person, but this needs to be examined because, as has been seen in other cases, terms of reference being partly or in any way written by somebody or some section that was party to the trail is not good practice. Will the Department consider that and reflect on the panel, the terms of reference and whether the matter needs to be re-examined? It would be good to examine because of the trail. I will leave the matter without seeking commentary from the witnesses but I ask them to reflect on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> I also ask them to reflect on the issue of mediation, specifically in this case because it has been requested a number of times. There will be different opinions on it but, again, it might be that somebody needs to make contact. If that happens, perhaps there will be changes in some of the way in which the subject traverses the media and so on. </p>
          <p eId="para_671"> I understand that all the external firms that the Prison Service and the Department use are selected from a panel established by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>

          <p eId="para_681"> Is there a loss to the Exchequer by actions or behaviour being tolerated in prisons? For example, are there cases in the Prison Service where catering has been provided for events outside of prisons? Is that normal? Who pays for this? Is there a loss to the taxpayer?

          <p eId="para_689">Mr. O’Driscoll will take on board what I said about the issue of the internal audit and mediation. Several committee members met this individual. What I have said in this regard should be taken on board in a generous way.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> An apology was given by Mr. O’Driscoll’s predecessor. I have read the judge’s findings on the matter several times. However, it went to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, where it was fought tooth and nail. That is behaviour from a different time. Most of us believe that should never have happened. The reason and the way in which it was fought, particularly considering the judge’s opinion, was from a different time. There was an award made in this case which was never paid. I urge the Department and the new Secretary General to reflect on this. This case should never have occurred. It now has the opportunity to deal with this. It was unacceptable that after the findings of the judge and the apology from the service, it was then fought all over again at the WRC. I accept Mr. O’Driscoll’s point but I find it unusual for such behaviour to happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">The Deputy has gone a little too close to the bone on an individual case for me to go with him on it. However, I agree completely with the usefulness of mediation in many cases. Sometimes, it happens that mediation is offered but there is a discussion about the precise scope of the mediation. That can happen in certain cases. I want to make it clear that we have a preference for mediation. The dignity at work policy in the Civil Service specifically highlights the desirability of mediation or of informal processes rather than formal investigations. I agree with the Deputy on mediation but I am not going to talk about the individual case in question.</p>

          <p eId="para_703">We work very closely with the State Claims Agency. We have access to its national incident management system which allows us to generate reports at an organisational level, but also on a prison-by-prison level. We have a system in place with a compliance executive. We have health and safety co-ordinators in all our prisons and those reports are shared so that we can actively ensure we are learning lessons from those claims.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">There seems to be a number of categories, or that was the response I received to my parliamentary question. For example, something that jumps out to me addresses why claims occurred. The numbers I have were from 2016 and 2017. One of the categories was self-injurious behaviour where somebody has inflicted an injury on themselves. Why would that be a compensatable category if somebody was injuring themselves?</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> Bacteria is another of the categories. Did that relate to something like TB? There is then a category, from 2016, of wrongful arrest or unlawful detention in the amount of €28,000. The Prison Service does not arrest people.</p>

          <p eId="para_706">We would fall into the category of unlawful detention. A significant number of claims are taken by prisoners about their detention and, at any one time, 160-odd claims may be under way by prisoners against the State for unlawful detention. The Deputy is correct to say it would not fall into the category of arrest. It is unlawful detention.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> Regrettably, I do not have breakdown of individual cases but perhaps I can talk in a general sense. I mentioned we have a compliance executive team and one of the areas around which we are very focused is the environment and particularly risks that arise within the environment. The Deputy mentioned TB and there is also legionella and other bacterial infections. We have a huge amount of work and focus in place in ensuring that, from a health and safety management perspective, we have systems in place to ensure we mitigate against those issues arising in the prison.</p>

          <p eId="para_724">-----the imposition of disciplinary sanctions against prison officers is a power vested in our prison governors. The governor has various sanctions at his or her disposal, including a loss of increment. In 2017, nine cases were received under that policy, six of which were resolved through mediation. We take a proactive approach in dealing with cases through mediation. We established our own internal mediation network to coincide with the introduction of the 2015 policy and we are trying to encourage staff, at the earliest stage, to engage to address any workplace issues because the earlier the engagement, the better the outcome for everybody. Six of the nine 2017 cases were resolved through mediation. One case is still ongoing and one was concluded after investigation.

          <p eId="para_733">For example, if I had 20 years service and I was injured on the job, the maximum additional pension payment that I can get if I am being retired from the service is six and two third years. That would only bring me up to 26 and two third years of service and I would still be short from a pensionable point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">They are the same superannuation rules that civil servants generally operate under. The injury warrant scheme recognises that particular issue and allows for additional payments to be made. However, injury warrants are a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the application from the officer concerned must go to that Department. I have worked in other areas of the public service and, generally speaking, injury warrants are not common. In my best recollection over the last ten years, little or no injury warrants have been granted. </p>

In the normal course of events, we can accommodate people but the accommodations policy is one which is designed to allow people to regain full health. It is a temporary accommodations policy.

          <p eId="para_746">There is no hard and fast rule on that. It depends on the particular circumstances of the individual case. We start looking at this in a very detailed way once an officer is out on sick leave for in excess of 12 months. That said, we have had people on sick leave for longer than a year who have not retired then on the grounds of ill health but who have retired on those grounds subsequently after three or four years.

          <p eId="para_747">Let us say the ill health is a direct result of injuries suffered on the job. I am not referring to an officer retiring on the basis of general ill health but on the basis of injuries suffered by that officer in the course of his or her work which renders the officer incapable of performing the full duties of the role. Can the CMO retire such an officer on ill health grounds or is there a different mechanism when the ill health is the result of injuries sustained on the job? If a prison officer is assaulted on the job and he or she can never work again, it is not right that he or she should be retired on the grounds of ill health by the CMO. The Prison Service must make it clear that such an officer is retiring because he or she is not capable of doing the job having been injured on duty. The CMO will probably not take that second step so that the person who is injured while on duty is just being retired on the grounds of ill health but that ill health is a direct result of the performance of his or her daily duties within the Prison Service. Some people feel that they are being trapped in that space.</p>

          <p eId="para_748">There are a number of mechanisms available to people who retire because of ill health. The first is retirement on the grounds of ill health under the superannuation arrangements. The Chairman is correct that the same superannuation rules apply regardless of whether the retirement is a result of injuries sustained on duty or a general medical condition. However, persons who are injured in the course of their duties have access to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, CICT, and can pursue a case through the tribunal if they feel that they are at a loss because of an injury sustained on duty. There is a second avenue available to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_751">That is unsatisfactory from the point of view of a prison officer who has been injured in the course of his or her work. The Prison Service grants the officer superannuation benefits because he or she is retiring on the grounds of ill health but does not acknowledge that the reason the officer is in that position is that he or she was assaulted on the job. The Prison Service is essentially telling the officer to take a case to the CICT and take his or her chances there. That is not a good way to treat employees.</p>

          <p eId="para_752">Could I just say, on a exceptional basis and given the nature of the injuries that our staff can sustain while on duty, we went to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2015 and were given permission to introduce a special scheme which only applies to prison officers. It is a serious physical assault scheme and relates to people who are seriously injured on duty. Ordinarily if staff are injured on duty, they are entitled to six months' sick leave on full pay and six months on half pay but under this scheme, they are entitled to 12 months' sick leave on full pay. This is now forming part of a review of occupational injury and disease and their treatment within the Civil Service. That review is being undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. We are playing a very full and active part in that review because we recognise the specific issues facing some of our staff.</p>

          <p eId="para_753">That does not address the point I am making. It is fine that an additional six months of sick leave on full pay is available to prison officers but I am talking about people who are long past that point. The extra concessionary months under the rules of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are fine but I am talking about people who are facing the prospect of leaving the service. How does a person prove that his or her injuries were sustained on the job? The CMO might say to a prison officer that there is no way of knowing whether he or she had a back problem anyway. Do the witnesses understand the point I am making? It is all well and good to say that this is being looked at by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to ask how long is a piece of string and to ask if it will ever happen, who will be covered going forward and so on. I am talking about current serving officers who have been injured at work and cannot continue to work. They do not want to be retired on the grounds of ill health without some recognition that their ill health is a direct result of injuries sustained at work. The Prison Service is their employer and it has a duty to deal with them rather than telling them to take their chances with the CICT.</p>

I understand the point the Chairman is making but we can only apply the superannuation arrangements that are in place at this point in time. They provide that someone who is injured in the course of his or her duties can have access to enhanced pension arrangements, unlike someone who retires because of other medical conditions. They are the arrangements with which we must comply and we have no authority or derogation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to introduce any extended arrangements, apart from the examination that was conducted some years ago about which the director general spoke, following which we received authority from the Department to introduce an enhanced sick leave arrangement.</p>

          <p eId="para_777">I am sorry for the delay in replying. There were two elements to the question. There is the prison shop and then there are our staff canteen arrangements. Procurement for the prison shop is done by the Irish Prison Service and the funds are managed by it. We reinvest the profits from the tuck shop into a prisoner assist programme fund which we then use to make hardship payments to prisoners. We also use some of that profit to fund the community return scheme which allows prisoners to go out early onto community service.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> The mess committees are separate and they manage their moneys themselves. They are aware of the principles of good governance, notwithstanding the fact that they are not part of our voted expenditure. As part of our business process review, when we were looking at cash management and handling within the Prison Service, we thought it was an opportunity for us to engage with those committees to ensure that they did have the appropriate financial arrangements in place, but those arrangements are a matter for the mess committees themselves as opposed to the Prison Service.</p>

As the director general referred to there, we have been engaging with them in terms of reminding them of their own governance obligations. Off the top of my head, I cannot honestly say whether they have a tax number. It is very much up to the individual mess committee. Each kitchen is staffed by prisoners. It is part of the work training initiatives within the prison that they are engaged in the operation of the kitchens. We have also been in correspondence with Revenue to get an opinion on the exact situation concerning Revenue obligations in that regard. For instance, there is no Revenue obligation to register for the Department of Defence mess committees. We have been trying to engage to get a formal decision in relation to that. We are awaiting outstanding correspondence from Revenue at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_797">I will select one area - slips, trips and falls - that gives rise to a significant number of claims. Approximately 20% of incidents recorded on the SCA's database related to slips, trips and falls between 2013 and 2016. That was 188 per annum. Using the data we got from the agency, we were able to target individual prisons and ensure appropriate action was taken at prison level. We have now reduced that figure from an average of 188 claims per year to 129 per annum between 2017 and 2018. That is a 31% reduction in that area of claims because of engagement, co-operation and the lessons we are learning from the agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_798">The 2016 figure was €159,000 and it was €36,000 in 2017. It reduced even further between 2017 and 2018. The big area is probably violence, harassment and aggression under the exposure to behavioural hazards. Were there recommendations in that area?</p>

          <p eId="para_799">The SCA undertook specific work in that area and made 50 recommendations on how we could work together to make the workplace safer for staff. Over 30 of those recommendations have been implemented to date and we have seen a reduction in the number of assaults on staff. One assault on a member of staff is too many so there is no level of complacency within the organisation regarding assaults. In 2017, there were 104 assaults on staff. It is an area we target for continuous improvement. Some of the security equipment we bought earlier, particularly the handcuffs, was one of the recommendations made in the SCA report, which was that we would standardise our equipment across the service and ensure that everybody was properly trained. Again, we are actively working with the SCA with a view to minimising the amount of claims and the number of incidents in our prisons.</p>

We were successful in recruiting 22 people. They gave service for 12 months. However, as recruitment through 2018 has accelerated, those contracts have not been extended.

          <p eId="para_854">We have an ICT governance group, which is chaired by the director general and it will now be chaired by me. A number of groups sit under that, one of which is a business case planning group. The business cases which come to the governance group are therefore fully costed and specified. The decisions are then made by the governance group having regard to the moneys available and the priorities within the service at the time.</p>

I mentioned earlier that we have a significant number of unlawful detention claims. As such, it is important that we do not keep someone past his or her sentence expiration date. One of the former governors to whom I referred brings a great deal of technical skill and knowledge to bear around sentence calculation, which is complicated and technical in nature. Between the middle and end of 2018, we conducted a review of 1,500 prisoners and checked individually that their warrant and sentence calculations were correct to ensure they did not give rise to future claims. That is a particular area.</p>

          <p eId="para_915">As I mentioned, one of our key objectives is to reduce the number of claims for which we are liable. One of those claim areas is around unlawful detention. If we have systems of insurance and checks and balances in place at prison level, it mitigates any compensation we might be exposed to at a future date.</p>

          <p eId="para_944">I understand that. Politicians assure everyone that they are above board and accountable but there must always be an external system to ensure that is the case. What has emerged from various reports, that of Mr. Justice Charleton being the latest, is that institutions are simply incapable of holding a mirror up to themselves. We know that from issues involving Tusla, the Garda and politicians. An effective oversight system must be in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> It is difficult to sit on this committee and listen to what whistleblowers go through. The word "punitive" is often used. It is upsetting that somebody would feel they have been punished and, further, that there would seem to be evidence that they were punished. That is a matter for another day but we have seen evidence of that in every forum, including third level institutions, some of which will appear before the committee next week. We are utterly reliant on whistleblowers because governance issues do not work. I wish Ms McCaffrey the best of luck with the new approach she is bringing in and I hope we can work together to make it a success.</p>

          <p eId="para_949">We are undertaking a major transformation of the Department of Justice and Equality, which I have publicly described as the biggest restructuring of a Department undertaken in the history of the State. That is not an overstatement. One element of that is putting in place new governance functions on the criminal justice and civil justice and equality sides of the Department. That will provide an organisational platform for a new relationship between the Department and the agencies we oversee. Some 24 agencies, including the Irish Prison Service, report to the Department. The agencies vary in size, function and degree of independence. We will put in place a new governance function which will, at least, provide the organisational basis for a new relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_950"> I mentioned in my opening statement that we are discussing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the issue of making the director general Accounting Officer and-or the appropriate authority for disciplinary purposes. </p>

          <p eId="para_953">I thank Mr. O'Driscoll. In regard to the cases about which questions have been asked, how many relate to sexual harassment, if any? How many reviews are under way by the Prison Service or the Department in regard to cases of sexual harassment or other matters or issues that have been raised by whistleblowers? How many investigations are under way?</p>
          <p eId="para_954"> I am particularly interested in the area of mental health. I do not have much time for my remaining questions. An interesting doctorate carried out by a young man in Trinity College Dublin quoted the prediction of the World Health Organization that the prison system will become the asylums of the 21st century. It seems to me that that is happening. I ask Ms McCaffrey to comment on that. How many prisoners have mental health issues? How many have drug issues?</p>
          <p eId="para_955"> The Red Cross is involved in a particularly interesting project in regard to non-violence. It is in place in three cities. I ask Ms McCaffrey to provide further information on it and to explain where the funding comes from. Does it come from the Department through the Prison Service? What accountability is in place in that regard? I ask that question of all organisations in receipt of public moneys.</p>

          <p eId="para_956">I will take the questions in reverse order if that is acceptable. The Red Cross programme to which the Deputy referred is a community-based health and first aid programme. It is an excellent example of innovation within the public service. It is run jointly by the Red Cross Ireland, the Prison Service and ETBs. The Probation Service has recently become involved. It is about empowering prisoners to take care of themselves and their health both in prison and in the wider community. We have received dormant accounts funding for the past four years for the project. There was a payment of €200,000 in 2017 and 2018.</p>

          <p eId="para_971">I am not asking what the cases are. I am asking what reviews are under way by the Irish Prison Service or the Department around issues such as sexual harassment. What reviews are in place, if any, by the Irish Prison Service or the Department?</p>

          <from> Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll<recordedTime time="2019-01-17T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_972">I will come in on that and one other issue raised by the Deputy. I realise the Chairman is under time pressure, so I will be brief. There was one anonymous protected disclosure on sexual harassment. Again, a private law firm was engaged to examine the case. That report was received in November and was shared with the Prison Service. As a result, certain undertakings have been given to the Department about procedures in the Prison Service, especially under the new dignity at work policy that I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_973"> On the Deputy's other question about prisons becoming the new asylums and the relationship between mental health and crime, the Deputy has touched on what is one of the single most important issues we are facing in criminal justice. This is not just in Ireland, but affects every country. The report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland by Kathleen O'Toole is very much focused on this issue. It points out, for example, that the average policeman or policewoman in a developed country - it is not exclusive to Ireland - spends 75% of his or her time dealing with vulnerable people and 25% of the time on dealing with actual crime. It is also true that a large number of people who arrive into prison have drug or mental health problems. I do not have precise figures, but in a recent visit to one prison, the governor estimated it at 75%.</p>
          <p eId="para_974"> This relationship that the Deputy has touched on between mental health, drug abuse and crime is crucial. The solution to this lies partly in the way we run the prisons but it primarily arises before an individual ever reaches the door of a prison. It is also about how we do policing in particular. One of the key points about the Kathleen O'Toole report is that it does not just look at the work of the Garda Síochána. It looks at policing under a much broader frame and it binds together a view of the enforcement agencies, those being the Garda, the Irish Prison Service, and the Probation Service, the health services, the social services and so on. The report proposes a joined-up approach to that. The high-level implementation committee for that plan includes the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Health, Housing, Planning and Local Government and so on. The high-level committee is at Secretary General level and includes my colleagues in those Departments and me as the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality. This is a fundamentally new way of looking at criminal justice in the State and it is very promising.</p>
          <p eId="para_975"> Other programmes that we have rolled out, including those that relate to community release, have been very successful in this space. A very successful programme that has won an innovation award in the Civil Service is called the joint agency response to crime, JARC, project. It has run a number of different pilot projects now and is highly successful. Again, it wraps all the various services together into dealing with people who have a high propensity to offend. These are people who are repeat offenders but have been identified as possibly likely to benefit from a more caring approach rather than a discipline approach. The Deputy has touched on what I would regard as perhaps the most exciting development in criminal justice in Ireland at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_977"> I wish to follow on from Deputy Connolly's point about capacity in our prisons. We have 12 prisons, which I believe are full, at a cost of €327 million, and with a staff of some 3,300. Is the capacity there for the prisons that are coming on stream or the prisons we foresee being built next year? We all hear about the revolving door system. I am aware of a case some years ago in Kilkenny where an individual was brought up with two garda escorts. There were costs with bringing that person up, and the garda had to get cover for the day and food and so on. The man they brought up was out and in his home before they came back that evening. I ask this in the context of capacity in the years ahead. Have we enough prisons and prison spaces currently? Reference was made to Thornton Hall. I went to see that site with a committee a long time ago. It was going to be a state-of-the-art prison. It is still in the pipeline, once funds become available, to have that state-of-the-art prison at Thornton Hall. There have already been costs incurred there.</p>

          <p eId="para_980">We do have capacity in the system at the moment. Our numbers are subject to peaks and troughs, depending on the activity happening within the courts. As I said, we are seeing increases in certain categories of prisoners. We are certainly seeing an increase in the numbers of female prisoners being committed to custody. It has gone from 122 females in custody in January 2017 to 168 in custody in January 2019. This is across two prisons, namely, the Dóchas Centre and a small female prison in Limerick Prison. We are also seeing an increase in the number of prisoners on remand where 579 persons were in custody on average in January 2017, and this increased 21% to 701 people in January 2019. There are some measures under way that will give us additional capacity. We are introducing a step-down unit for female offenders. This is a recommendation of the penal policy review group.

          <p eId="para_984">Absolutely. It will not be run by the Prison Service. It will be run by a service provider in the community. Between the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service we will have access to ten beds. It is for women who have very complex needs so we can release them into the community with those wraparound services they require in order not to reoffend and come back into our custody.</p>
          <p eId="para_985"> The Deputy may also be aware that we will sign a contract imminently for the replacement of the A and B wings in Limerick Prison. That is our next major piece of capital expenditure. That project will take place over the next 18 to 24 months. It will give us an additional 125 spaces. As well as the male wing that is being replaced, we are building a stand-alone prison for female offenders on the Limerick site, which will provide 50 female spaces. That will be very welcome capacity in the context of the increase we are seeing in female offenders.</p>

          <p eId="para_987">To ensure that we are in a good position to deal with demands that can go up and down, we are looking at capacity across the estate currently. We are conducting an audit of all our accommodation to see what additional capacity might be available to us within the estate. We also have some accommodation that is not in use currently. The training unit is a prison located on the Mountjoy Prison campus site. It has been out of operation for the past 18 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">We will bring it back into operation and it will give us 100 spaces. The progression unit, formerly St. Patrick's Institution, also on the Mountjoy Prison campus will give us 50 additional spaces. I am confident, therefore, that for the foreseeable future there will be additional capacity in the system which will allow us to manage our numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_989"> On temporary release, we have moved from what the Deputy described as a revolving door to where anyone on temporary release is part of a structured programme. The Secretary General mentioned two programmes that we run in co-operation with the probation service. The community return scheme is for prisoners who are serving sentences between one and eight years, swap some of their prison time for time spent doing community service. They are contributing greatly to their communities in the projects they undertake. The community support scheme is for prisoners who are serving between three and 12 months who can be released with supports in place. They could be supports to deal with addiction or mental health issues in order that they will not fall into a pattern of reoffending. </p>

          <p eId="para_992">To relate it back to the schemes I mentioned, the community return scheme has a 91% success rate, in other words, 91% do not reoffend or breach the conditions of their temporary release during the period. That is a phenomenally high figure which is down to the very careful selection of the prisoners to participate in the scheme. We are very careful in choosing the prisoners whom we deem to be suitable for temporary release. The compliance rate is lower for the community support scheme. However, that might be expected because of the complexity of the needs of some of the prisoners who are serving longer sentences, but even then there is a compliance rate of 75%. The other 25% are returned to custody where they breach the conditions in being allowed out early. They then serve every last day of their sentence.</p>

In our open centres there is a lower ratio of staff, while in our maximum security prison in Portlaoise, there is a greater ratio of staff to prisoners. The cost per staff member is €68,535 per annum. It works out at €188 per day to keep an offender in custody. I do not have a breakdown of the cost per prison, but if the Deputy is interested, I can make it available.</p>

          <p eId="para_1001">We are trying to reduce the number of people committed to prison. For example, under the Fines Act, there has been a huge decrease in the number of committals to prison. This was part of the revolving door aspect to which the Deputy referred, as many of the people in question would have been in and out of prison on the same day. We have tried to get rid of this to the greatest extent possible. There has been a huge fall in the number committed for the non-payment of fines. What we are trying to do at a policy level is develop alternatives to prison. This also has a bearing on the Deputy's earlier question about the number of prison spaces needed. If we can develop the use of community service orders or attachment of fines or recovery orders, for instance, which do not involve the use of custodial arrangements, it will be a win-win all round because the Exchequer would not have to pay €68,000 to house somebody in a prison and somebody would not be put in a prison who was not suitable for it, given the nature of his or her transgression which should not lead them into a prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> There has been a debate recently on the neighbouring island - when they are not debating other things - about short sentences - sentences of less than six months or one year - whether people in that category should really be in prison - by definition, the transgressions must be relatively minor if the sentence is of that length - and whether it might be better if they did community service. That is the direction of policy.</p>

How it now looks at Thornton Hall is as a strategic land bank available to the State. It was purchased and investments have been made, particularly in providing access roads and so on.

          <p eId="para_1006">The Land Development Agency's immediate concern is the provision of housing, but it does not absolutely follow that housing will be provided there. For example, in order to build houses elsewhere, other facilities must be moved. Would they want to move a facility of some kind to the Thornton Hall site, which would be one possibility? The agency is to deal with the housing issue, but that does not necessarily mean that houses will be built.

          <p eId="para_1010">I know and if the Deputy gives me one minute, I will work my way back to it. I am saying I cannot comment on an individual case, that the protected disclosure process is in place to allow anyone to raise a genuine concern they may have. Someone can make a protected disclosure which can be investigated. Sometimes they are found not to have merit, but that is not to imply that the person in question did not genuinely have concerns when they were raised. The protected disclosure process is very important to provide an avenue for people to raise concerns in a way they can consider to be safe. Some issues are best dealt with through formal investigation and that is the direction we have taken to protected disclosures. One thing which I hope gave comfort to the committee was how we had moved towards the most independent form of investigation, that is, investigation by external independent investigators from panels picked by the Office of Government Procurement. They are very independent-minded. They genuinely look at the complaint and the issues raised, assess them and reach their conclusions independently which we accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">However, that is not the only mechanism available. Under the dignity at work programme, which is a very important programme in the Civil Service now, we also look at less formal forms of engagement including mediation. That was raised earlier and I indicated-----</p>

There are all these processes in place, I guarantee the Deputy that. It is a fact. However, that does not mean an individual will not seek to go in front of his public representatives. This is important too. In any individual case, we try to adapt our response to the nature of the case. If mediation is possible, we look at that. If it requires full-scale independent investigation by external independent people from reputable companies, we do that. We do try to operate these programmes in a reasonable and open way, encouraging people to come forward with complaints if they have them, preferably within our existing systems but if necessary through protected disclosure. The systems are there and they are robust and independent.</p>

I am talking about prisoners going out to dentists, hospitals, doctors and so on. I was contacted by prison warders over an issue. I suppose we cannot debate it here either. It happened in Dublin, a stabbing incident of which I suppose Ms McCaffrey is well aware. A prison warder was stabbed and the unions representing prison staff were not very happy with the response they got. It was all hush hush. I do not want to say too much about it because there is probably a court case or something like that going on. What is in place? I am talking about that individual case because it is the only one I know of and I received complaints from prison warders whom I know personally. It could happen again. Why was it allowed to happen? I am talking about health and safety for both the prisoner and the prison warder. There was a lot of concern about what happened.</p>

We have introduced new escort guidelines for staff. All of our staff have received specific training in respect of those guidelines.</p>

We have our new escort guidelines in place. All of our staff have been trained. One of the recommendations in it came up earlier in respect of the purchasing of handcuffing, namely that we would standardise the handcuffs that are in place right across the Prison Service in order that everybody was fully familiar with the handcuff and how to put it on and remove it from a prisoner.

          <p eId="para_1033">We have problems with drugs in prison because we have problems with drugs in our communities. Our prisons are very much a reflection of what happens within our communities. Clearly, addiction is a societal problem and it is a major contributory factor in respect of criminality. A significant proportion of people who are committed to custody have addiction problems. Mr. O'Driscoll made reference to a figure earlier. It is quite old research but it suggests that between 70% and almost 80% of prisoners have a problem with addiction.</p>

          <p eId="para_1035">Those figures relate to prisoners prior to their committal. We have a huge range and take a two-pronged approach to dealing with drugs in prison. One is dealing with the demand and that is around our drug treatment programmes, which are in place to assist people. Prison and the interventions we have there are a great opportunity for people who have not dealt with their addiction issues in the community to engage with the services to deal with their addiction problems. We also have a huge focus on reducing the supply of drugs. We have invested very significantly in front-of-house security in terms of the level of screening people go through. We have drug detection dogs. We have netting on our yards. A lot of our prisons are in a city centre location, which means they are highly susceptible to drugs and contraband being thrown over the walls. In some instances we have netting or double netting on our yards to ensure, insofar as we can, that contraband is not getting into the prison. It is a significant challenge. A lot of contraband brought into the prison is concealed internally by prisoners. It is a significant challenge to the Prison Service but one on which we are determined to continue our efforts. We have a drugs policy which is being reviewed this year and we are going to look at what additional measures we might take in respect of this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_1036">I have one question on legal costs. I was going to ask more but my time is up. Awards came to €492,000 in 2017 but the legal costs were €1 million. That does not add up. The legal costs were double what the awards were. Why would that be? How can the witnesses stand over it? It sounds incredible and sounds like an extremely large sum of money. I am sure some procedures could be put in place. For example, with whiplash, a court will only give so much for a whiplash.</p>

They are managed by the State Claims Agency on behalf of the State, as are our slopping-out cases. The increase in respect of the legal costs to which the Deputy referred actually concerns the slopping-out cases at the moment. More than 1,600 proceedings have been lodged in court by former prisoners in respect of the fact that they did not have in-cell sanitation during their period of detention. In 2017, €351,000 of the €1 million related to legal costs incurred by the State Claims Agency in defending those cases.</p>

As the Chairman rightly pointed out earlier on, that process is managed external to the Prison Service, albeit that we may be asked for our views in relation to a particular incident. At the end of that process when the prison officer, if it is a prison officer, is awarded moneys under the CICT regime, those moneys are paid out by the Irish Prison Service. It is something that is dealt with external to the Irish Prison Service and we have limited involvement in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1074">This sounds a most unfair situation. There are prison officers injured in the course of their work, they have exhausted their sick leave, they probably feel they want to do some light duties, and the Prison Service is saying there is not a great facility for it as the person is not fit for work. In the meantime, the prison officer has not been pensioned off - or whatever is the phrase one likes to use - but has no money. Such staff are off payroll receiving nothing. Is there much of this? This sounds very unfair for somebody who was injured doing his or her job on behalf of the State. I am trying to highlight the unfairness here.</p>

We are looking to have that particular regime reviewed and we want to actively engage in that with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

          <p eId="para_1089">It is a tiny number. The Chairman was concerned that certain individual officers may find themselves in a no-pay situation. Because of the new sick leave arrangements implemented by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2014, nobody goes into a no-pay situation. At worst case, they go onto a regime called temporary rehabilitative remuneration. There are payments to such officers, albeit that the payments might be quite low. As I understand it, they do not fall below the threshold that is set by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the context of disability payments and so on.</p>

I am well aware of the situation from reading the reply to one of the parliamentary questions I asked last year on temporary rehabilitation and remuneration. The Minister stated that while the Irish Prison Service endeavours to provide reasonable accommodation, which Mr. Culliton has mentioned, within the constraints provided in the prison environment, it should be noted there is no onus on the service to provide such accommodation, and this is reflected in the employment equality legislation in section 37 of the 1988 Act. I am again hearing about all these lovely schemes, but when push comes to shove, there is no onus to facilitate an officer injured in the course of his or her work.</p>

Some people find themselves trapped. Does Mr. Culliton have influence to tell the chief medical officer to sign the form because a person is impaired? The chief medical officer will not do so and sign out the person because he or she is capable of doing light work. In the meantime the injured officer is out there, and Deputy Aylward highlighted a case a moment ago. I know Mr. Culliton stated this case was dealt with but he can understand how some of the officers injured in the course of their work feel let down by the system. What can happen to bring this handful of cases to a conclusion?</p>

          <p eId="para_1122">People have to get certificates of impairment from the chief medical officer if they want an injury warrant, but now I realise the injury warrant is a waste of time because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does not use it. In response to another parliamentary question last year, I was told the number of people who retired from the Irish Prison Service due to ill health in 2017 was 17, and in 2016 it was it was 19. There are quite a number of cases each year. Some people feel they should not have had to go down that route and they should have been accommodated.</p>

          <p eId="para_1123">The difficulty is that we are obligated to work within the parameters of the policies that apply to all civil servants. This is why we went to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2015 to seek the extension of a scheme that did not apply to any other civil servant. It is why we have petitioned the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for a review of the occupational injury and disease provisions for civil servants that recognises our staff are in a unique environment. I completely accept the concerns expressed by the Chairman. It is why we are engaging in the review process with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I am as concerned as the Chairman about the circumstances in which some of our staff may find themselves. Certainly from our perspective we are committed to looking for solutions in the context of the review. We have no discretion to operate outside the parameters of the schemes in place for all civil servants.</p>

          <p eId="para_1124">I understand the Prison Service is confined to the public service schemes and I know it is looking for a review, but we still have these situations. The Irish Prison Service is trying to recruit people, but people being recruited into a uniformed service, whether the Garda or whatever, and we are speaking about the Irish Prison Service today, know that if they get stabbed in the course of their job, the chief medical officer in the Department of Health will not sign them out because they are capable of desk duties. They will run out of sick pay but the Prison Service states it can do nothing for them and cannot retire them on health grounds unless the chief medical officer states they are not fit for work. In the meantime they go off pay. The public service collectively is not looking after staff who have been seriously injured in the course of their work on behalf of the citizens. The witnesses get the point I am making. These people are being caught. Do the witnesses share my concern?</p>

What is the position involving the Garda and the Irish Prison Service regarding security when transferring prisoners? There are 41,000 transfers per annum. Obviously, the Irish Prison Service has to have a serious protocol. Is the Garda always available at the drop of a hat when needed? There is a security issue I do not want to go into but the public wants to be satisfied. If there are 41,000 movements of prisoners in and out of jails every year, mainly to and from courts but also to and from hospitals and so on, are those movements secure from everybody's point of view? Is there a protocol? The media reports at the time to which I am referring suggested certain people were not available or whatever. Has the bigger picture been addressed?</p>

As part of the implementation programme concerning the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, there will be a strand looking specifically at the question of prison escorts and how we can rationalise the process, taking into account the increased use of video but also examining the use of gardaí and Prison Service staff and the optimal arrangement.</p>

What is the process in place and the protocol involving the Irish Prison Service and Garda regarding the taking of witness statements? If it happens in a public place, that is fine. Let us say it happens within the four walls of a prison. Does everything have to go through the governor? What is the protocol? Do the gardaí come in and physically question every witness?</p>

          <p eId="para_1173">There is a Garda liaison officer in place for every one of our prisons. There is a specific Garda liaison contact for each prison. Where there is an assault on a member of our staff, it is notified by the governor to the Garda liaison officer. It would obviously be notified by the person concerned to the Garda. There are arrangements in place between the prison and the local Garda station for the notification of assaults.</p>

We were told before that if there is a case involving a prison officer, the governor is notified and that it is then up to him or her to inform the staff member of the issue.

          <p eId="para_1182">It has been highlighted to us, as members, that information was being channelled relative to the prison officer affected. It was said the information was channelled by the governor to the Garda or liaison officer but it was not given down to the prison officer, which led to difficulty. I am not asking Ms McCaffrey to comment on the case. There is a command structure in regard to the flow of information that does not apply to other citizens in that gardaí feel freer to make contact in the way I have described. The Irish Prison Service has a protocol and that protocol does not apply to other citizens. Are the prison officers in some way hamstrung? I have heard of an assault case, on which I am not asking Ms McCaffrey to comment, in respect of which the governor did not facilitate every witness in making a statement to the Garda. The injured prison officer's case did not succeed due to a lack of evidence. It seems to be the case that a governor can in some way be involved in the process or restrict a process.</p>

          <p eId="para_1198">I wish to ask about two other matters, the first of which is work and training participation. According to the service's 2017 annual report, the capacity was put at approximately 70%, which means a good bit of capacity remains available within the prison system. The participation rates are only 24% or 25%. What steps are being taken to encourage greater participation, given that we have the capacity and it would be of benefit to the prison population?</p>
          <p eId="para_1199"> The second matter is education. I do not know what the capacity is in this regard, as it is not stated in the report, or whether education is available to every prisoner or is based on capacity within prisons. It is done in partnership with education and training boards, ETBs. Participation rates in this regard are usually slightly higher, at 35% to 40%, but what steps are being taken to increase them?</p>
          <p eId="para_1200"> I also wish to ask about the incentivised regimes, of which there are three - basic, standard and enhanced. Can Ms McCaffrey briefly provide details on what each entails?</p>

On top of the vacancies, we have mentioned the number of escorts that the Prison Service is required to conduct annually. We sought the value for money review, which has recently been completed, because we were significantly concerned about the draw of prison officers from our prisons to assist in escorting. We have a Prison Service escorts corps, PSEC, but it is not staffed sufficiently to deal with what has been an exponential increase in the requirements placed on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1260">I echo that. It is an excellent programme that will help reduce reoffending and maintain those family links, particularly for prisoners serving lengthy sentences, which are anything between one year and eight years, as the Irish Prison Service categorises them. Will Ms McCaffrey give me a note on it? I do not want to put anybody on the spot, but is there a reason it is not being rolled out? Is it because the pilot project is still under way or is it still being evaluated? I certainly would not like to see a situation where it is not rolled out due to a lack of resources, whether that is through staffing or any other resources.

Mr. O'Driscoll told me that we cannot really talk about these things and Ms McCaffrey is saying that we have a rule in place since 2015 which does not permit this, except there was a camera in one instance in Wheatfield Prison which no longer exists, so I am taking that as a "No".</p>

I know that in the normal course there might be a soccer match between one prison and another, leagues and so on, as there are in the Garda and the Army, and that there might be outside catering at some event in tennis club A or rugby club B. Is there any accounting of the term in terms of auditing to say, for example, that it cost €300 or €500, that it was the contribution of the Irish Prison Service in the soccer game that took place between the PSNI and the Irish Prison Service?</p>

The Irish Prison Service invests significant resources in training its staff, including for the kitchen area, driving and so forth because those activities are part and parcel of our core business. As we have to feed prisoners and cannot go to the local takeaway, we need people to staff the kitchen. On a day to day basis I cannot say whether we might have somebody who does not have full qualifications working in the kitchen, but, if we do, it is out of necessity because of staff shortages. We certainly invest a lot of resources in training personnel.</p>

          <p eId="para_1471">Okay. So we will take 60 off our 1,000 giving 940. I am told the mess committees provide good meals to the staff who are on duty on a particular day. The average cost of breakfast is €2.50. The average cost of lunch is €3. The average cost of dinner is €5.50 subsidised. My research suggests that the mess committees typically buy meat and vegetables. Ms McCaffrey said earlier that they pay for all their own food. My research indicates that a very substantial amount of the resourcing is subsidised from central prison stock. That routinely includes bread, milk, cheese, chips, cooking oil, gravy powder, curry powder, salt, tinfoil, pepper and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_1473">It is also for me. There is a bigger point here. With an average spend per day of €10 and we take the 60 off the staff number, it comes to €9,400 per day multiplied by 365 giving €3,431,000 in turnover. This is a very crude calculation. If we took the cost of that food at €5, because it is about €11.50 there, and we will divide that by two, that gives a profit of €1,715,500 for the year. We need to bear in mind that my information is that all these other things are routinely drawn from central prison stores. We know they do not pay anything for heat or light. We know the chefs and prisoners who help are not paid from their funds; the Irish Prison Service pays them from the central funds. There is no rent and there are no staffing costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1474"> Ms McCaffrey can correct me if I am wrong in this. My research indicates the mess committees have no memoranda of articles of association. They have no rules. They are not registered charities. They are not limited companies. The Comptroller and Auditor General, the top accountant in the State is present. He can tell me if I am off the wall in my very crude calculation. They may have at their disposal in the region of €1,715,500 in profit, subsidised by taxpayers' payment of resources for the Irish Prison Service's stores, staff costs, heat and light. Nobody audits that money. Nobody knows where it goes and nobody knows what it is used for.</p>

          <p eId="para_1569">At the beginning, we asked how many people are on duty full-time. The numbers were given. We picked a speculative 1,000. We then took a third of the three prisons off that and suggested a figure of 940. Let us go really low and say there are 940 people at a €3 spend per day, below the lowest amount, and multiply that by 365, that is approximately €1.2 million. If we then remove 556 per day, there are still hundreds of thousands in profit, especially when it is known that staff, heat, light and equipment are, anecdotally, subsidised from the service's own resources. Even if we assume that it is not, there are still major profits, with no audit, no oversight, no accounting, that the Comptroller and Auditor General does not get to look at it and that the Department of Justice and Equality does not look at it. All we know is that Mr. O'Driscoll is so frustrated with my effrontery in raising such a matter that it just does not suit him and he wants to send me a note on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1570"> These things need to be in the public domain because it is not good. Prison officers are entitled to their full entitlements. The director general said that after a long industrial relations negotiation, this was agreed. That is fine if it is an entitlement but we do not know how much it is. To an unqualified person who can simply add, as opposed to being a chartered accountant, it seems to me that there is a lot of money flying around beyond the actual costs, especially when the overhead is free. That puts Templemore in the ha'penny place. If it was part of a negotiation that it was to be this obscure and not for profit, then where is the profit going, because it is clearly profitable? What does the Chairman think?</p>

          <p eId="para_1571">I think we are speculating on figures. The Committee of Public Accounts has a duty to deal with real figures. We can all run the figures of how many hours a person works in a year. An average of five officers are required to give 24-hour coverage for 365 days of the year. If one works 40 hours a week for 45 weeks a year, that is 1,800 hours out of 8,760 hours in the year, so five staff are required. For every prisoner, only one fifth of the staff are on duty at any one time. The staff member is only there for a third of the day, while the prisoners are there for 24 hours per day. The Committee of Public Accounts wants real figures and we ask the witnesses to do their best. I am not passing the buck to them. There was an issue in Templemore. I do not know if there were issues in the Army; I think it has a slightly different system. It is all integrated and maybe this needs to be integrated. I do not know. I will only look at it with regard to real figures. I am not disputing the witnesses' figures but I do not know. I want to get real figures.</p>

          <p eId="para_1572">I do not know either. I went as low as €3 and as high as €10. The fact is that mess committees are not regulated by anybody with no oversight, accountancy or audit. There is a suggestion of them cross-subsidising stock from taxpayers' cash for prisoners' food and so on and there is no oversight. I am sorry to have to say this and I appreciate that people are new to particular roles but the blank faces and lack of answers are perhaps the most worrying fact. It was somehow okay over there and on a not-for-profit basis. If any meals are being sold, there is serious profit with no overhead. If it is going out to tender tomorrow, the witnesses can stick my name on the list to try to put a catering company together.</p>

          <p eId="para_1595">I promise to not take too much longer. I understand that mess committees are registered charities and limited companies. Have they memoranda and articles of association? Are there procedures? Where does all the money go? Are they all cash payments? Do those cash payments tally with a tally roll from a till? Are all transactions put through the till? Is all the money that comes in lodged to this account? If there are such modest amounts left, taking into account the cost per day to feed people, it would seem to me that money is missing. This needs to come under the Comptroller and Auditor General for auditing. I appreciate that the witnesses might be annoyed with me for throwing this at them today. They might not have been ready for it but it is clearly the first time it has come up in this way and it clearly needed to. Let us get to the bottom of it. I appreciate that the witnesses think I am looking for headlines but I am not box office and my name is not Healy-Rae, so it probably will not.</p>

I am just looking at the health of the prisoners and that is where I am coming from. I do not know the answer, I am not a doctor, but on the face of it, it seems very light. Health and mental health are big issues. A number of prisoners are on prescription. I would be afraid that the volume of work for those four permanent doctors and locums is so large. One would hope prisoners have good access to a doctor, if required, although I know nurses probably handle many of the issues.

          <p eId="para_1691">The most important people in that review are the prisoners, the recipients of the service. It is like a health centre with the doctors talking to other doctors and then talking to the officials. The Prison Service has to talk to the patient and every doctor will say that. That report is fundamentally flawed before it starts if the prisoners who often require the service are not a major part of that review. Ms McCaffrey gets my point.</p>

          <p eId="para_1704">That would be exceptional. Our governors see the value of the education service that is provided to us and it would be an exception that the school officer post would be cut. It may happen on occasion and I can certainly give figures for when a school might have closed. The governor would try to protect the opening of the school on a daily basis to ensure that the significant number of offenders who engage in education can be facilitated, given that the teachers are on site and, as the Chairman mentioned, in a position to teach.</p>

          <p eId="para_1705">Ms McCaffrey will appreciate, at this hour of the evening, that I am going as quickly as I can. Do prisoners of basic, standard or enhanced status all have equal access to education or does it depend on where they are? How equal is access to education throughout the Prison Service and for the three categories of prisoners? Does a prisoner with enhanced status get greater access?</p>

          <p eId="para_1706">Whether a prisoner is of basic or standard status would not necessarily interfere with the provision of services such as education. Prisoners on an enhanced regime have access to things over and above other prisoners, such as access to an additional phone call. The fact that a prisoner was of basic or standard status would not restrict access to education.</p>

          <p eId="para_1707">It does not impact on education. That is fine. Ms McCaffrey mentioned sick leave in her opening statement. Is she able to send us the details on sick leave?

          <p eId="para_1709">What way can it be done? Can that be sent on in writing because the witnesses might not have it in front of them there? Here is an awkward question. Ms McCaffrey mentioned people who are wrongfully detained. How many prisoners are released straight into homelessness the minute they walk out? Ms McCaffrey's predecessor mentioned at this committee that some prisoners have passed their release date but the Prison Service knows they have nowhere to go and the service tries to hold them for an extra period, maybe a matter of days, until something gets sorted. I need to know what arrangements are in place to ensure the Prison Service knows where prisoners who have been released from prisons end up within 24 hours. If the director general has a system that she believes covers that, her system is not working as well as is documented. That is all I am telling her.</p>

          <p eId="para_1712">We have invested significantly in pre-release planning for prisoners because we are cognisant that the prisoner needs to be very well supported in the community in the immediate period after release. Of course, the provision of accommodation and services to prisoners once they leave the custody of the prison is no longer a matter for the Prison Service. However, as I have mentioned, we have significantly invested to ensure the best supports are in place for prisoners when they are released. We have taken action around a number of areas and have made arrangements with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to ensure that any prisoner who is eligible for a medical card and is in a position to have applied for and received that medical card before he or she leaves prison has a means of payment and to ensure that anybody who is entitled to social welfare benefit and has made that application in prison is in a position to have a means of payment when he or she is released from custody.</p>
          <p eId="para_1713"> We have also made arrangements with local authorities around housing. There is a person in each local authority with whom we liaise about housing. As the Deputy has pointed out, there are significant issues of homelessness for prisoners who are coming out of our system and particularly around the provision of accommodation to male offenders. Often the local authority is only in a position to put in place hostel accommodation on a nightly basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_1721">The Chairman makes an important point. There is also a high rate of homelessness in people going into prison. I have seen figures on that, although offhand I cannot quite remember them. The figure is something like 14% or 15% of people going into prison go from homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1722">There is a commitment under the national Housing First policy for a Housing First project in which prisoners will be considered and funding has been provided for this for 2019. Some €500,000 has been provided under the Probation Service Vote for that initiative. The target is for 25 tenancies per annum for three years, amounting to a total of 75. It is not a large project.</p>

          <p eId="para_1724">Yes. It is part of the broader Housing First initiative nationally. In this case, it is dealing with people with a high level of need. Each tenant will be supported by a multidisciplinary team. It applies to people with chronic homelessness problems or who are facing a multitude of problems. Homelessness is usually not an issue in and of itself but is linked to a whole set of other issues. This is a broader issue for our society, as the committee is well aware. The Housing First initiative is one strategy that is being adopted nationally and within it, a strand for prisoners is being established. I accept that it is just a start.</p>
