            <p eId="para_9">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, to the House.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LynnBoylan" eId="spk_3" as="#Acting_Chairperson">
            <from>Senator Lynn Boylan<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_10">I welcome the Minister of State. It is regrettable the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, could not be here. She sent her apologies. The reason I continually ask the Minister for Rural and Community Development into the House is that her Department has responsibility for the Control of Dogs Act 1986, which includes dangerous breeds. The dog breeding establishment licensing regulations also fall under the remit of this Department. One of the things the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine found in its recent report on canine welfare was the fact that issues relating to canine welfare and legislation fall across three Departments, which is regrettable as it makes it very hard for us to have a coherent approach when it comes to issues around dogs.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> After the horrible attack on nine-year-old Alejandro Mizsan in County Wexford, there is a growing concern within the public about attacks by certain breeds of dogs. The<i> Irish Independent</i> reviewed the data from local authorities since 2016. There are a couple of issues. Apart from the fact that the number of attacks by certain breeds is increasing, there is also much concern around the fact there is not consistency in the reporting by different local authorities. Fingal County Council said it started recording the breeds involved in attacks only this year. South Dublin County Council declined to comment. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council recorded 11 attacks involving pitbulls. Dublin City Council had 80 complaints about aggressive dogs but did not provide a breakdown of the breeds involved. Other local authorities did provide a breakdown of the breeds. That shows there is a lack of consistency around the Control of Dogs Act, particularly those regulations that apply to the dangerous breeds.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> One of the questions for the Minister of State is what he will do about that lack of coherency around the Control of Dogs Act. I hear repeatedly from Ministers of State who come into the Chamber and read out the position from the line Minister that the Department is responsible for the legislation but not its implementation. If I go then to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, however, it sends me back to the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> There are a number of issues around the control of dogs, one of which is the number of wardens in the local authorities who are actually able to enforce the legislation. We are quite lucky in this country that we have good animal welfare legislation. It could be improved but it is especially strong. The issues are more about the enforcement of that legislation. Therefore, what is the Department's view on the adequacy of the number of wardens within the local authorities? Do they have the resources they need? We know the problem with many of these dangerous breeds is that people are not muzzling them. People are not actually complying with the regulations. The regulations are there and they are very clear but people are not complying. The reason they are not complying is they have no fear of being caught because dog wardens are few and far between.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> The other issue, which again falls under the remit of the Department of Rural and Community Development, is the fact it has responsibility for the dog breeding establishment licensing. I draw the Minister of State's attention to a number of recommendations in the Oireachtas joint committee report.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">Recommendation No. 10 flags the issue of the 1:25 ratio of staff to dogs in dog breeding establishments. Recommendation No. 11 calls for a cap on breeding bitches. Recommendation No. 12 calls for greater socialisation of puppies, which is particularly relevant as dog pounds have stated that many dogs are being surrendered by their owners because the dogs are presenting with behavioural issues, with such behavioural issues manifesting in dog attacks. We must get a grip on the dog breeding establishments and puppy farms and we need a cap on the number of breeding bitches. There needs to be a proper ratio of staff in order that dogs are properly socialised by the time they are purchased.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> Recommendation No. 4 is about fertility clinics and this is particularly relevant to the bully dog breeds. Many people are providing fertility clinics from their back garden sheds, from which dogs born and are being sold for huge amounts of money. We are aware of the issues with some of the bully breeds, including the recent attack on poor Alejandro.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> There is a lot for the Minister of State to address in this. When are we going to have coherency of canine legislation?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ThomasByrne" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Thomas Byrne)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_18">I thank the Senator for raising this issue, about which I speak on behalf of the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys. The Senator is right in that the Minister has responsibility for this legislation but there are other Departments involved and it would be better if there was a different approach. We discussed this in our parliamentary party meeting last week because we are not satisfied with the situation either.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> All our hearts were broken when we saw Alejandro Miszan suffer life-changing if not a life destroying injuries when he was attacked by a dog in Wexford. Our thoughts are with Alejandro and his family and friends following the horrific ordeal he endured.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> As the Senator noted, the Department of Rural and Community Development has policy responsibility for dog control under the Control of Dogs Act and the Dog Breeding Establishments Act. Local authorities are responsible for operational activities under the Acts. This includes the dog licensing and dog warden service, implementation of legislation, imposing on-the-spot fines and taking court proceedings, etc. The Control of Dogs Act 1986 sets out a range of requirements for all dog owners and persons in charge of a dog. In particular, section 9 of the Act outlines specific requirements for keeping dogs under effectual control. Section 9(2) states that the owner or any other person in charge of a dog that worries livestock is guilty of an offence. It is also an offence not to have a dog licence. Prosecution under the Act allows for a fine of up to €2,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or both. This is enforced by local authorities across the country. Section 21 of the Control of Dogs Act states that the owner of a dog shall be liable for damages associated with an attack by the dog on a person or livestock. This is a civil matter rather than something that is enforced.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> The Department publishes annual dog-control statistics from all local authorities on <i>gov.ie</i>. There were 182 prosecutions in 2019 and the number of prosecutions in 2020 and 2021 were down to 82 and 97 respectively. We can accept that Covid-19 and level 5 restrictions had an effect on those figures. A total of 1,749 fines were issued in 2019, with 1,069 issued in 2020 and 924 in 2021. These fines cover a range of matters such as not having a dog licence, a dog not being under control, a dog not being muzzled, a dog not being leashed, livestock worrying by dogs etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> I refer to the number of dog wardens. In 2021, the latest year for which statistics are available, there were 50 full-time dog wardens and 21 part-time dog wardens. The dog control statistics for 2022 will be collated next year and will be published on <i>gov.ie</i>. The Control of Dogs Act states that every local authority must employ at least one dog warden. It is a matter for each local authority to determine if more than one dog warden is required to carry out the necessary functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> In addition to the Control of Dogs Act, the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 outline the requirements regarding the restricted breeds of dogs, that is, dogs that are required to be leashed and muzzled when in a public place. These breeds, a list of which is available publicly, include some well-known breeds that, if kept by the right owners, are okay in their own homes. The regulations require that these breeds, or strains or crosses of them, must be kept on a short, strong lead by a person over 16 years who is able to control them when in a public place. They must also be securely muzzled when in a public place and must wear a collar bearing the name and address of their owner at all times. I have to agree with the Senator. I have seen a number of these dogs without muzzles on a regular basis. I am sure they are lovely pets once kept by the right owners. However, the law is the law and the law must be complied with. I also agree the law must be enforced.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Earlier this year, the Department published its consultation report, a Review of Measures Relating to the Control of Dogs in Ireland. This report followed a public consultation, to which over 1,000 responses were received, and is available at <i>gov.ie</i>. A selection of responses received from representative organisations was also published alongside the report. The review included measures relating to specific breeds and dogs in general in both urban and rural settings. Following this review, the Department intends to increase penalties for all offences under the Control of Dogs Act and the secondary legislation; to increase penalties for the offence of livestock worrying; to have greater active promotion of a culture of responsible dog-ownership in Ireland; and to amend the statutory instrument to include the presa canario breed of dog. Furthermore, under proposed amendments to the Control of Dogs Act, the Department is also considering a new provision to allow for the issuing of a dog control notice. This notice would be issued to a dog owner whose dog has been found to be out of control. It would outline the measures the owner must take to make sure the dog is controlled in a manner that ensures the safety of others and prevents further incidents. Some of these measures, which may include muzzling and leashing the dog, already apply to the restricted breeds.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> These attacks are common enough and this latest attack has - not to use a pun - unleashed a debate among the people and public representatives from all parties. I am glad the Senator has provided her input today. There is no question but that we need to get this right.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply and for providing the number of prosecutions and dog wardens. I have just done the maths using the figures for the number of dog licences issued in 2021, that being 192,348 with a further 75,832 issued online. We know not everybody is compliant in getting a dog licence, but each of the 71 dog wardens, including those working part time, would be responsible for almost 4,000 dogs. I do not think anybody, whether he or she works full time or part time, could be responsible for making sure that number of dogs and their owners are complying with the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> In addition, we need to join the dots on the issue of canine welfare. Ireland is the puppy-farm capital of Europe. The dogs coming out of puppy farms are not properly socialised and are presenting with behavioural issues, therefore, we must tackle this in addition to the Control of Dogs Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> I ask the Minister of State to bring the issue of unregulated fertility clinics, which are prevalent in use among bulldog breeders, to the attention of the Minister. A huge amount of money is being made with many bulldogs being bred using those unregulated fertility clinics.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">I fully understand the concerns raised by the Senator and I will bring everything back to the Minister and the Government. As the Taoiseach flagged recently, a cross-departmental review of the laws on dog control is about to commence. I share and understand the concerns about the number of dog wardens and prosecutions under the Control of Dogs Act. I hope we will see an increase in warden numbers because there has been a large increase in the number of dogs owned. This includes my own family, which has taken on a lovely little dog. Our dog is not let off the leash because we would not allow that, even though it is a small dog. Owners have to take responsibility and most do, in fairness, and that is the reality of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> The Government is committed to working with all agencies to strengthen the issue of dog control and promote responsible dog-ownership. I must again say the law is clear in respect of restricted breeds in that there are requirements that need to be enforced, and that is a matter for local authorities. It is also a matter for local authorities to determine the number of dog wardens they have but they will have to look at this again because there are increased numbers of dogs, including an increase in the number of restricted breeds in public without a muzzle. This is commonly seen throughout the country and that needs to change. I know there are arguments made that it is the owner's responsibility, and the owner certainly is responsible, but the law is there and it needs to be enforced.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> The Department of Rural and Community Development will continue to do its part, along with colleagues in the local authorities, including local authority vets, and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to consolidate efforts in the areas of safety and responsible dog ownership, as well as animal welfare. I will also take back to the Minister the point raised about fertility clinics in back garden sheds.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> The Department of Rural and Community Development will once again support media campaigns on responsible dog ownership as it has always done and, indeed, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine always makes a grant available at Christmas time for animal welfare agencies, which is also important. I thank the Senator for raising this matter.</p>

          <speech by="#RobbieGallagher" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Senator Robbie Gallagher<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_33">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit chuig an Teach ar maidin. I would like to discuss the role of the peace commissioner with the Minister of State and request that a review of the duties of peace commissioners is carried out with a view to expanding that particular role.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> Peace commissioners have been working in communities across the country since the early 1920s. A peace commissioner is an honorary position and every single area in the country has people performing these duties, which makes them very accessible to the public. It is estimated that there are more than 5,000 peace commissioners around the country, but very little is known about them unless they come into contact or someone needs their service at some point.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> Peace commissioners are responsible for a wide range of duties currently, including taking statutory declarations and oaths, witnesses' signatures on documents required by various authorities and signing certificates and orders under various Acts. They are required to be persons of good character who are well established in their local community. They receive no payments, fees or expenses for the services that they do; they do it as good citizens. They also have the authority to sign summonses and warrants, although these powers are not exercised very often, as in most cases, applications for search warrants are made to the local District Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> One duty that they are not currently allowed to do is to witness and sign affidavits for social housing applications. This is one duty in which peace commissioners could be of benefit to the local community, particularly where the applicant seeking a signature is affected, like many people are, by cost-of-living issues or perhaps a separation from a partner and simply cannot afford the cost of going to a solicitor for the purpose of that declaration. </p>
            <p eId="para_37"> I firmly believe that now is the time to examine the expansion of the role of the peace commissioner to look at this particular function and perhaps any other possible functions they could perform for the benefit of the communities in which they live.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_38">I thank the Senator for raising the matter. As the Senator will, of course, be aware, peace commissioners are appointed by the Minister for Justice, and I am here on her behalf. She is on maternity leave and the Minster of State, Deputy James Browne, is also absent today, so he asked me to take this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> Peace commissioners are appointed by the Minister for Justice under section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924. As the Senator said, a peace commissioner is an honorary appointment and those appointed receive nothing - no remuneration or compensation by way of fees or expenses for their services. </p>
            <p eId="para_40"> The powers and duties of peace commissioners consist primarily of taking statutory declarations, witnessing signatures on documents if required by various authorities and signing certificates and orders under various Acts. The Courts of Justice Act 1924 also gives peace commissioners the power to issue summonses and warrants, however, these powers are now rarely used, but they are there. I certainly know peace commissioners who have had to do that. Peace commissioners take statutory declarations for things such as a declaration of residency associated with passport applications and donation statement returns for members of local authorities or, indeed, Oireachtas Members.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> The Senator will be aware that the Minister for Justice now has no role in social housing applications. However, we have been informed by the relevant Department, which is the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, that the social housing application form does not need to be witnessed by a third party in any way. However, a signed affidavit or letter is required in circumstances where there is no separation or divorce agreement in place. Where it is in place, an affidavit or letter confirms that there is no formal separation agreement and no court proceedings, as well as the position regarding maintenance payments, overnight access and custody arrangements for children, and property ownership. The Department considers it appropriate, given the sensitivity and complexity of these issues, which is only a subset of the application for social housing, as I understand it, that such confirmation is provided by a solicitor or by a commissioner for oaths, for example, which often can be both, but not necessarily. This requirement has been in place since the social housing assessment regulations were introduced in 2011, which standardised the assessment process. I understand from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage that there are no plans to change this requirement at this time. Given the nature and requirements of this document, it is not the type of document that should be signed by a peace commissioner, as this affidavit is more than witnessing a document - it is a sworn legal statement. As such, I am sure the Senator will appreciate that the rules around affidavits need to apply. </p>
            <p eId="para_42"> If the Senator has concerns about how this works in practice or about social housing applications themselves, I would be happy to make sure these concerns are passed on to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Indeed, if the Senator has a particular case in mind, I would advise him to make this known to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> Peace commissioners play an important service to communities. However, I am sure the Senator will know, of course, that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage would decide if those services are appropriate for the different documentation that may be required in support of certain parts of certain social housing application forms.</p>

            <p eId="para_44">I thank the Minister of State for his response on behalf of the Minister. I tabled this Commencement matter having been contacted by a number of peace commissioners who have people coming to them stating that they incurred fees in getting documentation signed. Peace commissioners were of the opinion that perhaps their role could be expanded to facilitate situations such as the ones that I outlined. Many of the people concerned are experiencing financial difficulties, perhaps in the middle of a divorce, and by the nature of social housing applicants, many are stretched. The peace commissioner was of the opinion that perhaps if documents could be signed by the peace commissioner, there would then be no need for any fees to be outlaid to someone from the legal profession.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> I note the contents of the response from the Minister. It is something that perhaps should be kept on review. I do not know what the Minister of State’s thoughts are on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">I thank the Senator for raising the issue. As I said, a signed affidavit is required where there is no separation or divorce agreement in place, which would be probably considered fairly complex to make sure that is done properly. I appreciate that it is normally in circumstances where there are particular difficulties in that person's life. However, we have taken careful note of the comments made by the Senator and will advise relevant colleagues and officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> The 2022 justice plan contains a commitment to review and reform the role of peace commissioners, and I am informed that the Department of Justice is currently drafting terms of reference, which include reviewing the existing functions, powers and appointment procedures for peace commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> Anyone who wishes to avail of the services of a peace commissioner can contact their local Garda station, which may be able to provide the name and address of a local peace commissioner. Alternatively, they may contact the peace commissioner unit in the Department of Justice, which is pleased to help individuals who require the services of a peace commissioner. </p>
            <p eId="para_49"> As noted earlier, the requirements relating to supporting documentation for a social housing application are prescribed in the relevant regulations. Any change to these regulations would need to be considered by my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">The Minister of State is welcome. I thank the Office of the Cathaoirleach for choosing this matter for debate this morning.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> As the Minister of State will know, Galway has a very proud record of job creation at IDA Ireland-sponsored plants in a range of sectors, including technology, pharmaceuticals, medtech, international financial services, business services, engineering and food. We want to see the pipeline of investment continue. The Oranmore-Athenry economic corridor was designated and included in the Galway county development plan many years ago, when I was a councillor. There are land banks at Parkmore, the airport site in Carnmore, the IDA Ireland site in Oranmore, which comprises 80 acres, the Department of Defence lands in Oranmore, which are substantial, and Athenry, where there are 230 acres.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> We know the history of some projects. Some did not happen, including those relating to Apple in Athenry and Intel in Oranmore. While we did not secure the latter, Oranmore was one of the final two options for the location of the new plant. That is a testimony to the work of IDA Ireland and the land bank available in the Oranmore area. We also have a bank of land in Knocknacarra, in the west of the city.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> The area between Oranmore and Athenry contains the necessary infrastructure, including electricity infrastructure, a motorway and rail links. There are some downsides, including in the context of wastewater infrastructure. I am wondering what engagement the Department will have with Irish Water on developing the east Galway main drainage scheme. It has been talked about for many years. I am concerned that the current circumstances are an impediment to future expansion. Irish Water, Galway County Council and the Minister of State’s Department need to engage to ensure there is no impediment to future job creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> Last year, some 500 additional jobs were created through IDA Ireland in Galway, including by Medtronic, Genesys and Integer. We have seen an increase in employment in the multinational sector. We are aware of its importance to an area like Galway. So many people from Galway city and county and Mayo work in the multinational sector in Galway. We want to ensure the jobs are secure. There are bigger issues at play in the context of competition, tax rates and other matters of which the Government is and needs to remain conscious. However, regarding what we are doing in government, it is important that we ensure IDA Ireland promotes the land banks and that replacement land banks will be available should the existing ones be utilised in the very near future. While a substantial number of acres are available, I understand there is substantial interest in the sites. Intel’s proposed Galway site was among the last two options in Europe before a decision was made to build in Germany. I am wondering about the current level of engagement and interest. Has IDA Ireland plans to secure additional lands within this area or others within the city and county?</p>

            <p eId="para_55">I apologise for the delay. I thank the Senator for raising this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> Senators will recall that 2021 was a record-breaking year for foreign direct investment in Ireland, with total employment in IDA Ireland client companies now standing at 275,384, which is up over 29,000 on the 2020 figures. Growth in the regions is particularly buoyant, with 53%, or 133, of the 249 investments won by IDA Ireland going to regional locations. In the west, there are 120 IDA Ireland-supported companies that employ 29,419 people. Ninety-four of these IDA Ireland-supported companies are in Galway city and county, and they employ 22,801 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> The timely provision of appropriate and cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions to meet the needs of multinational companies remains essential to winning foreign direct investment. Over the past five years, IDA Ireland’s regional property programme has enabled the winning of capital-intensive projects of significant scale for regional locations. In the current IDA Ireland strategy, Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021–2024,<i>
							</i>IDA Ireland has committed to strategic land acquisition in the west and keeps its land portfolio under constant review. As Senators are aware, IDA Ireland is committed to ensuring a good supply of suitable property solutions for foreign direct investors in regional locations and, as such, has a network of business and technology parks across every region to support both its own and Enterprise Ireland’s client companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> The Senator is correct about Galway, in which he has expressed an interest. To quarter 3 of 2022, IDA Ireland hosted 31 site visits to Galway. It is heartening that in-person site visits to Galway have returned to pre-Covid-19 pandemic figures, with the 2022 site-visit data comparable with those of 2018 and 2019. IDA Ireland completed an advanced building solution at Parkmore, within the economic corridor referred to by the Senator, in 2021. I am informed that IDA Ireland is currently engaging with those actively interested in the building. IDA Ireland secured planning permission from Galway County Council for an additional advanced building solution at Parkmore in the summer of 2022. It has completed a detailed design. The project is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> I am advised that IDA Ireland has regular engagement with client companies and stakeholders in the county. During 2023, IDA Ireland will continue to market Galway and the rest of the west through its overseas offices to target mobile foreign direct investment opportunities and will arrange corresponding site visits as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> I will raise the issues relating to Irish Water to which the Senator referred with the property section of IDA Ireland, which would have the best people to pursue that project.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">The Minister of State is right to talk about the region. What is good for Galway is good for Mayo, and vice versa. There is engagement between both counties regarding both employment and movement. It is heartening that there have been 31 site visits to Galway by IDA Ireland-sponsored companies, that the Department is keeping the land banks under constant review and that there has been an advanced-buildings solution for Parkmore. I understand there is interest in acquiring some of the lands in Oranmore, so it is important and prudent that, where possible, additional lands be identified and sought that are close to - I will not use the phrase “contiguous to” - the infrastructure, including rail, motorway and electricity infrastructure. The economic corridor from Oranmore to Athenry is important as an economic driver for the county and, indeed, the city. So many people who live in the city work in the county, and so many who live in the county work in the city. Of course, the city-county boundary skirts through some of the sites the Minister of State has identified, including at Parkmore.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">Again, I thank Senator Kyne for raising this issue. He will be aware that the provision of appropriate property solutions is a key element in the IDA Ireland offering for Galway and the rest of the west. IDA Ireland positions the west as home to the leading cluster in the life-sciences industry, employing the highest number of medical technology staff in Europe per capita. Along with the infrastructure the Senator referred to, the presence of the University of Galway and the Atlantic Technological University is very significant in this offering, as it is for the entire west.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">The overall trend in job creation in Ireland, which is very important to emphasise, remains positive. The Industrial Development Authority, IDA, had another year of strong growth in 2022, with record levels of employment and investment, and we look forward to the 2022 results being finally published later this month. Senator Kyne can be sure that we will continue to keep Galway and, indeed, the entire west region very much on our priority list. </p>

            <p eId="para_65">I thank the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach. I also thank the office of the Cathaoirleach for choosing this very important matter and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, to the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> I raise with the Minister of State social housing schemes in Galway and Galway city and acknowledge that there is a considerable amount of work going on in respect of them. Significant social housing is being built in Galway city, especially in the Knocknacarra and the Galway city west area. It is also important to point out that there are a number of schemes in Galway city centre and in Galway city east which are much-needed and positive. The point I raise with the Minister of State is that this is very limited in respect of affordable housing schemes, at best. I spent 11 years on the local authority and I am very familiar with Galway city. The number one issue there is housing in our city.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> As I am sure is the case for many Members of the House and in Kilkenny, the Minister of State’s home area, this is the number one issue. I receive representations on a daily basis from people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s and it is essential that this Government makes progress on the issue because if we do not, we will be in serious trouble.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> As with elsewhere in Ireland, there is an urgent need for affordable housing. The level to which affordable housing is bring being prioritised in Galway seems to differ when one looks at Cork, Dublin, Limerick or Waterford. I have strong concerns that not enough attention is being placed on this in Galway. Given the billions of euro that have been committed in this housing area in budgets, I am informed that this is not a financial issue. It does not seem to be a lack of resources or financial backing at Government level which is responsible for this situation. My issue is that it is not happening on the ground. </p>
            <p eId="para_69"> We may also need to consider the message the Government is putting out. It is vital that local authorities are aware that affordable housing is as much a priority as social housing. That may require a change of communications.</p>
            <p eId="para_70"> There may also need to be more regular communication between the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and local authorities and this communication needs to be upped and to be considered. For example, can we get more up-to-date progress reports on a monthly basis as it will be easy enough to count the affordable housing in Galway now in both city and county. I will await the Minister of State’s response and I do not want to pre-empt it.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> Of course, I do not want any substantial time wasted on paperwork or on the limited resources of local authorities but ask for a document outlining same to put pressure on the director of housing and on the chief executive officers, as that is certainly not happening in Galway city and county, which is an area I can speak about, being very familiar with it. </p>
            <p eId="para_72"> I am open to alternative suggestions from the Minister of State that perhaps these are not needed but from my perspective, it is clear the local authorities may need to be made aware of how important affordable housing is viewed by Government, and that urgency is required to make progress in this area. </p>
            <p eId="para_73"> We have passed the midway point in the term of this Government and Covid-19 obviously had a major impact, which all Members of this House accept, but the number of affordable housing schemes in Galway certainly needs to increase quickly. I am greatly concerned now that this is not happening and will not do so under the current conditions. I await the Minister of State’s response to see how we are going to improve the situation on the ground in Galway city and county. I thank the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach and the Minister of State.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Malcolm Noonan)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T11:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_74">Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach Gníomhach agus le Seanadóir Crowe as an gceist seo. The Housing for All strategy delivers on the programme for Government commitment to step up housing supply and put affordability at the heart of the housing system.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> Delivery of affordable housing, in accordance with the schemes set out in the Affordable Housing Act 2021, and the funding being made available, is underpinned by local authorities' housing delivery action plans. Local authorities, including Galway City Council and Galway County Council, each published their finalised plans in July. They provide a comprehensive overview of projected delivery of affordable housing in Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_76"> Funding is made available by Government to assist local authority and approved housing bodies for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase or rent through the affordable housing fund, AHF, previously known as the serviced sites fund, SSF, and the cost rental equity loan, CREL. A planned affordable housing development at Merlin Woods in Galway city, to deliver approximately 85 affordable homes to purchase at sales prices of at least 15% below average prices for the area, is being supported by the SSF. I understand that Galway City Council are planning to make further applications for funding to the Department in support of further affordable housing schemes. </p>
            <p eId="para_77"> Affordable housing officials met recently with Galway County Council's chief executive officer, director of housing and other members of the housing team to discuss their plans for a number of affordable purchase schemes in Galway county. The council intend to apply to our Department for affordable housing fund, AHF, funding to support these schemes in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> The Land Development Agency, LDA, is progressing two major projects in Galway City, at Dyke Road and Sandy Road, as part of their initial tranche of State lands. Overall projected delivery from these sites is for more than 1,500 homes with the first 170 to be achieved by 2026 on Dyke Road. </p>
            <p eId="para_79"> The Dyke Road site forms part of a strategic brownfield land bank located on the edge of Galway City centre and the LDA has advised the Department that it has reached an agreement with Galway City Council to progress a residential-led development at this site. Following the most recent draft city development plan, the Land Development Agency intends to progress a phased planning application for the site. </p>
            <p eId="para_80"> On Sandy Road, the LDA has advised my Department that it is currently preparing a framework masterplan to guide development of the site, currently owned by Galway City Council, Galway County Council and the ESB. The Land Development Agency will align with the timetable for the draft city development plan and will consult on the framework masterplan in early 2023. A design team has been commissioned, stakeholder engagement is under way, and a public consultation will be undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> As the Senator can see, there is quite a significant level of activity being undertaken by both Galway City Council and Galway County Council on affordable housing. I note the points the Senator is making specifically on communication. From our Department perspective, in funding and the asks that we have of local authorities around affordable housing, this is the same message. We are trying to achieve a balance and mix right across housing delivery in local authorities and it is a matter for the local authorities to develop their own plans for housing delivery. It is critically important that the local authorities work with our Department. There are quite a number of schemes under way. It takes time and public consultation is critically important. From our Department's perspective, however, we will certainly not be found wanting in respect of funding projects and innovative schemes around affordable housing delivery in Galway city and county.</p>

            <from>Senator Ollie Crowe<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T11:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_82">I have needed ten minutes to raise this with the Minister of State and the senior Minister, Deputy O'Brien. I do not want to be giving out too much but, with respect, what I got from this answer is that there will be 85 affordable houses built in the lifetime of this Government. We are talking about 17 affordable houses for all of Galway, with a population of 200,000 people. We are moving on to 2026, 2027 and 2028, which is just too far. I do not see the urgency with the executives in either Galway City Council or Galway County Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_83"> It is not acceptable for the Minister of State to come in and tell me that in the lifetime of this Government, 85 affordable houses will be built, and that this will be part of a planned affordable housing development. I will give the Minister of State an example, of which I am sure he is familiar. Cork City Council and Cork County Council have eight schemes of affordable housing under way at this moment in time and are moving onto the next eight. Galway has a population of 200,000 people and the Minister of State is telling me that 85 affordable houses will be built in the lifetime of this Government. This is not credible.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">I will not be able to go back to Galway city and give the people there that message because there will be riots in the street. It is very disappointing. I plead with the Minister of State and his Department to contact the officials in Galway City Council and Galway County Council to work with them to see if we can provide more affordable housing. I have acknowledged in my contribution that there is significant social housing, but this should be looked at in comparison with Limerick or Cork. I have given the information on Cork and it is factual. I am disappointed with the Minister of State's answer.</p>

            <from>Deputy Malcolm Noonan<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_85">With all due respect, the priorities around housing delivery in Galway City Council and Galway County Council are a matter for Galway City Council and Galway County Council. Our Government sets the policy agenda through Housing for All, but it is down to the local authority to strike the balance in respect of social and affordable housing delivery. That is a matter for the elected members of those councils to prioritise. Again, I stress the point that it goes back to the local authority. If the Senator feels that the local authorities are not delivering enough in that regard, it is really a matter for them to drive a more ambitious agenda. As I said in closing, our Department will not be found wanting in funding schemes. There is also the first home scheme and the affordable purchase scheme. We are delivering a range of schemes under Housing for All as well as Croí Cónaithe. There are other options available in respect of Town Centre First and infill delivery of housing. We should be looking at innovation in the urban centre. That is critical. Really, though, it is a matter for the local authority to set the agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> I will take back the points the Senator has raised to our Department for further engagement with the local authority and to try to achieve a greater balance and greater ambition because we will fund that ambition.</p>

            <from>Senator Martin Conway<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_87">Before I get into my Commencement matter, I wish to let the Minister of State know that <i>checktheregister.ie</i>, which is under his stewardship, is not digitally accessible to the blind and visually impaired community in Ireland, so more than 150,000 people in Ireland cannot register to vote using the website. I urge the Minister of State to look at that as a matter of urgency. It came to my attention last week when a young person who was trying to register to vote was not able to do so. I do not expect the Minister of State to reply to that, but he might just take it back to the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_88"> The Commencement matter I raise today is about a scheme that has been in the pipeline for more than two years. The scheme is ministerially led within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to facilitate small communities that need wastewater sewerage schemes. One case in point in County Clare is Broadford. The village of Broadford has many people who want to invest in it, many people with money who have ideas as to what they would like to do with the village, and people who are prepared to build houses and to pay for that out of their own pockets. The problem, however, is that the system there has reached capacity and the answer they get back from Clare County Council is that it is premature pending the upgrading of the systems there.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> We have a housing problem in this country. This is not the panacea that will resolve all the issues to do with housing but it would be a step in the right direction. It is all about taking steps in the right direction.</p>
            <p eId="para_90"> As for this scheme, there was an engagement with numerous representatives in Clare and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, about a year and a half ago in the Department. He suggested this pilot scheme, and each local authority in the country, I understand, was written to and asked to nominate either one or two schemes. Clare County Council, like every other county council, submitted a scheme, and Broadford was the scheme that was submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_91"> We are now three weeks away from the end of 2022. We expected that the successful schemes would be announced at this stage because the expressions of interest to the local authorities were sent out a number of months ago. I think the indication was that in September or October we would have confirmation as to what the successful schemes would be. Now we are moving into January and there has still been no announcement. The question, therefore, which is reasonable for people to ask, is when the successful applicants will be notified. Will the Minister of State give me a specific date? The people in Broadford are getting very nervous at this stage. This has been going on month after month and we do not have an announcement. This scheme will address one project or one town per county. In County Clare alone we have about 50 or 60 schemes that need upgrading.</p>
            <p eId="para_92"> There was a meeting in Doonbeg last night. Unfortunately, I could not make it, but it was a meeting of residents because the village water periodically stops and starts. We are talking about an area which has a huge tourist population as a result of the golf and leisure outlet there, whose name I will not mention. We are talking about 200 or 300 working there and thousands of people visiting it every year, yet the water system in the town is not fit for purpose and keeps breaking down. It is very unfair on the people living there 24-7, all year round. We really need to escalate the progression of these schemes in general. The pilot project announced by the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is a start but it needs to get up and running because it will not be felt before the Government comes to an end. Will any of the schemes be done?</p>

            <p eId="para_99">If anything, it is quite the opposite, so again, I thank the Senator for raising that with me.</p>
            <p eId="para_100"> I thank the Senator for raising this issue also. I am aware of the demand for wastewater infrastructure in villages where there is no access to public infrastructure, including Galway, Clare and other areas around the country. The Department builds its strategic water policy and infrastructure delivery programmes around the national planning framework for 2018 to 2040 and the National Development Plan 2021-2030. Investment is delivered primarily through Irish Water, while my Department operates the rural water programme directly. The national planning framework supports proportionate growth of rural towns and villages to attract people to build their own homes and to live in these areas. The programme for Government includes a specific commitment for investment in wastewater services in villages - those not currently provided for under Irish Water's small towns and villages growth programme - including commitments for regeneration of these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_101"> In response, the Minister, Darragh O'Brien, announced on 28 April 2022 a funding initiative to enable progressively the development of wastewater infrastructure in villages and settlements that do not have access to such public infrastructure. This initiative, an advance phase of the multi-annual rural water programme 2022-2025, is funded under the national development plan in conjunction with an appropriate local contribution. An allocation of €50 million for the measure has been committed for the period 2021 to 2025 under the plan. The measure was open to all rural local authorities to submit, on a priority basis, up to two applications for funding by the deadline of 15 September 2022. Twenty-three applications in total were received from 13 local authorities, including two from Clare County Council, namely, Broadford and Cooraclare.</p>
            <p eId="para_102"> The demonstration project model - the pilot scheme, as the Senator refers to it in his Commencement matter - allows for the development of appropriate longer term strategies and protocols and better informs future funding needs for the progressive development of public wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure in villages that are currently without these services. An expert panel is in place to support the evaluation process. In addition to providing an expert perspective, the panel brings independence, openness and transparency to the bids evaluation process. The panel's membership includes departmental, stakeholder and independent representations. The Department has recently completed validation of all the applications for funding. Arising from this, the panel is carrying out a detailed evaluation of all valid applications. Based on the recommendations of the panel, a report will be submitted for consideration and approval by the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_103"> That is where my script ends. I am not sure where the timeline is in that but I will come back and try to get a specific date as to when that evaluation process will be complete.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Senator Martin Conway<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_104">I am not looking for a specific date but I would like to think it will be in quarter 1 of 2023. It is right to put an evaluation panel in place. That is good governance, and I welcome that. I spoke about Broadford, but Cooraclare is a key scheme as well. I would also name Carrigaholt and Doolin.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">No development of any significance can happen in Doolin - this has been the case for the past 15 to 20 years - simply because of the wastewater systems in the area. Some small development has taken place, but people have had to invest in systems themselves. Doolin is probably one of the biggest tourist attractions in the country because it is located next to the Cliffs of Moher. It is also the gateway to the Aran islands. Thousands of people visit Doolin each day during the summer. This scheme is welcome but it needs to be scaled-up as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">We will come back with a timeline on that. Now that the validation and the applications are being processed, as the Senator indicated, the first quarter of 2023 would be reasonable in the context of the Minister submitting them. These projects will end up with Irish Water in order to be brought into operation. This is extremely important for tourism, local economic development and local communities. It is a key commitment of the Government to ensure that we have balanced regional development and that our rural communities can thrive into the future. That has to include water and wastewater infrastructure. We will respond to the Senator with a time line and ensure that these projects are prioritised.</p>

          <p eId="para_108">Before I call the Leader to outline the Order of Business, I welcome to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery the ambassador from Finland; our great friends in the European Union. On 6 December 1917, 105 years ago, a country with its own government and unique language and rich culture, like ourselves, came into existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> Over the years, Finland has transformed from a poor, agriculture-based society to a highly digitalised and thriving economy with, I am glad to say, the happiest people in the world for five years in a row. We look forward to learning the secret to happiness from our friends in Finland. Of course, we established strong diplomatic ties more than 60 years ago. We are like-minded partners in making the world a better place for all of its citizens. We work together on the appreciation of peace, nature and heritage and that connects us at a deeper level.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> Of course, Finland's contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process is well known and recognised by its former Prime Minister, who was involved in that very important process. I would also like to recall a Finn who was involved and actually participated in the 1916 Rising, although the ambassador informed me that he was not great at shooting so he was put to other duties. One of the most famous citizens to come from Europe, of course, is Santa Claus. He has promised to bring light, brightness and happiness; the secret the Finns have that we would all like to learn.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> On Finland's national day, I thank the ambassador for honouring us with his presence in Seanad Éireann as we approach our 100th anniversary. I wish him and all the people of Finland a very happy independence day. I thank him for being here with us today.</p>

          <p eId="para_114">Like others, I want to join in wishing the Finnish people all the best on their day of commemoration. I welcome the ambassador to the House. It is a pleasure to have him.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> Like many other people, we woke this morning to yet another report on our national air waves about the shooting of two individuals yesterday evening in the city of Dublin, and the sad passing of one of those people. It has become somewhat of a regularity. It is not just in the city of Dublin, however. We had the situation of a shooting in Ennis, although nobody was injured, thankfully. It is happening in other county towns around the country. I do not want to single out any one place. I certainly do not want to stray into what is happening in the courts at the moment as a very significant case is ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">If we are learning anything from that as it progresses, we are learning that just having gardaí on the street is not the solution to the problem. Good intelligence gathering is an important feature of it, but we need more specialist services. We need more covert operations in place. We need greater scrutiny of individuals. This applies to all our counties. I see it in the county that I have the pleasure of living in, County Clare, around Ennis and other towns in County Clare. I see individuals who seem to have the trappings of wealth with no visible means by which they could have it. We have to target individuals much more. We have to use the specialist services of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB. That will have to be devolved down to regional levels. It would be a far greater use of time now if we trained gardaí in those specialist services. I think there is actually more need for armed units. I do not believe we need to arm every police officer, or garda, in the country, but we certainly need that as a deterrent. There is a fraternity emerging now that has no regard whatsoever for law enforcement or those who try to patrol the area. I would like a debate in this House at the earliest possible opportunity with the Minister for Justice with a view to reorganising, to some extent, the attack on crime. It is not just the so-called gangs in the city of Dublin. There are little units developing all over the country and that needs to be targeted. </p>
          <p eId="para_117"> I was back in Doonbeg in west Clare last night. I was meeting with members of the local community, as others have done in the past. There is a situation where there is an old pipe network. It is the same throughout many counties in Ireland, but it is specific to west Clare. There is an old asbestos pipe network. As the ground dries out at certain times of the year, it cracks and breaks. People are being left for hours on an ongoing basis. The leak is fixed and it bursts somewhere else. It goes on day after day. People are finding it difficult, particularly those in the tourism sector. Could we have a debate, at the Leader’s convenience, with the Minster for the Environment, Climate and Communications? I accept that Irish Water is an independent entity, but we need to find a better way to address the investment in water infrastructure.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I welcome the ambassador to the Chamber. I wish the Finnish people a happy national day as well. I had the pleasure of visiting Helsinki back in 2004 and it is a beautiful city.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> First, I recognise the establishment 100 years ago of the Irish Free State. It was a turbulent part of our history. We know the divisions that ensued are still with us. It is important, at the same time, that we recognise the establishment of the Parliament here and all that we have achieved since then – the continuous democracy in this country uninterrupted since then, the peaceful transfer of power in 1932 and, subsequently, that historic coalition that was reached at the last Government formation as well between the two civil war parties. I am sure there will be other occasions to remember some of the happenings over the past 100 years as well during the course of the next number of months.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> I have raised on numerous occasions the issues surrounding Inland Fisheries Ireland. Since the last time I raised it and commented that I wished to put matters on the record, my mother got a phone call. It was nothing sinister because we know the individual; it was just advising that perhaps I should be careful. I got another anonymous letter from somebody who told me they are an employee. I would rather they had come forward rather than writing me anonymous letters and if they have any issues they might go to the Garda rather than putting it to me. They did not sign the letter, but that is okay. I also had an ex-employee contact me, a good supporter of mine, again giving both barrels because they feel that I will say something. To cap it off this week, I notice from the correspondence on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that the chief executive officer of Inland Fisheries Ireland has written to the Cathaoirleach.</p>

          <p eId="para_122">Yes, but the letter has been written by the CEO. It will be dealt with at the meeting subsequently. Again, it was urging caution, which I find strange.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> There are a number of issues here and there is talk of Garda investigations. I have no idea who has been investigated by the Garda in relation to Inland Fisheries Ireland, but I am of the view there should be an investigation by the Minister. The Minister needs to investigate issues that have come to pass surrounding Inland Fisheries Ireland. They have hounded one family. I could not go into the issues that the family is facing, but we all know the story of Maurice McCabe and I believe this is something similar at this stage. Any existing IFI employee who would be seen talking to or calling this former employee is being taken aside. Even former employees are being blacklisted in relation to contacts with this individual within Inland Fisheries Ireland. Yet, we have the CEO contacting the Cathaoirleach, effectively threatening how he does his business in and how he organises the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> The Minister investigated the board. Why did he investigate the board? He did so because his advisers told him it was the right thing to do. Why did they tell him that? They wanted the Minister to dismiss the board because the board was not complying with the CEO’s wishes. There was a 7:3 split. He wanted the board gone; not the Minister, but the advisers and the CEO wanted the board gone to put in people who were more manageable. That was what was going on in relation to Inland Fisheries Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_125"> I spoke with senior people in this Government on carrying out investigations. They carried out the investigation in relation to the board. Now it is time for them to carry out investigations into matters within Inland Fisheries Ireland at its more senior level over the past number of years. If that happens, there is then no need for me to put things onto the record. However, if they do not, I am then obliged to. The Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has the information. Other senior politicians have the information. Politicians and colleagues of mine within Galway West, Galway East and Mayo have the information and they are all of the view that there are issues here and questions to be answered within Inland Fisheries Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#TomClonan" eId="spk_37">
          <from>Senator Tom Clonan<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_126">I just want to echo Senator Dooley’s concerns about the shooting incidents last night. I am from Finglas originally and I grew up there. It is a great community. It is not the set of “Love/Hate”. It is a real community with real people. We should be appalled, as legislators, at the casual manner in which a 21-year-old was shot in a car on Cardiffsbridge Road - and then the killing of a man in Ronanstown in Clondalkin last night. According to initial reports, six to eight shots were discharged in rapid succession. As is very often the case with these shootings, there is a person who is high on drugs - polysubstance abuse - and they are using a weapon very often like these Glock automatic pistols. They are weapons that are designed for conventional combat and they have a planning range of between 30 m and 50 m. They were discharged, in the case of the Ronanstown incident, outside a family home, where there are children, neighbours and people sleeping. It is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> At the moment, Ireland has a homicide rate roughly the European average of about 0.7 per 100,000 people. However, that statistic masks an underlying trend that is deeply disturbing. For example, in Ireland between 2005 and 2015, 201 Irish citizens were murdered by firearm. In the same period in the UK, which has a population approaching 80 million people, only 450 were killed by firearms. Homicide by firearm, or gun killings, in Ireland are five times the European average. Think about that as legislators - five times the European average. </p>
          <p eId="para_128"> The principal victims are young men with criminal convictions. We did not tolerate that level of gun crime during the Troubles. I suspect this was partially because legislators, Senators, Deputies, judges and senior police officers felt that they might be targets. However, because it is happening in our working-class communities and because it is happening to young men, we are allowing this situation to get a grip in our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 38% of Ireland's homicides are by firearm. This year, we have had seven gun killings, five of which were drug-related. We have also had countless shooting incidents where, by a miracle, there have been no fatalities. These communities are being intimidated by these gangs. This is narco-terrorism and these are groups that have links to the Lyra McKee shootings and the shooting of gardaí up around Dundalk. There is an intimate link between organised crime, drug trafficking, people trafficking and these type of shootings and we should not allow them to intimidate good communities and the great people of places like Finglas and Clondalkin. We should not abandon them to this rule by force and intimidation. I agree with Senator Dooley that the answer to this is not to arm the Garda but to get the guns out of our communities and away from those young people. We need increased investment in education, a health-led approach to drugs and so on. I hope that some time in the new year we could get the Minister for Justice to come in to debate this because gun culture and the disproportionate number of homicides by firearm is a sinister problem that is getting a grip in Ireland.</p>

          <from>Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_131">I agree with Senators Clonan and Dooley. It is important that we have that debate with the Minister for Justice because, as has been said by both Members, people are dying on our streets and communities are being left behind. We need to have that debate with the Minister as early in the new year as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> I also want to welcome the announcement from the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, under the shared island initiative, of a €7.6 million investment in tourism and marketing initiatives, which will include connecting the Wild Atlantic Way and the Causeway Coastal Route. The Leader will know, because I have raised it with her numerous times, that this is something I have been advocating for over a number of years. It is my firm belief, whether it is in crime prevention, community safety, our fantastic tourism offering across the island, our sporting endeavours or any issue, Ireland works best when we work together.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> An announcement was also made yesterday of €2 million for cross-Border Irish language and Ulster Scots initiatives. When the Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and the Irish-speaking Community visited Belfast a number of weeks ago, we heard a keen interest from the groups we met across the city that they wanted to do more on an all-island basis. The Cathaoirleach will know the interconnectedness of the Irish-speaking community and they really want to tap into that. Hopefully that is a sign of things to come in the future. Sinn Féin published its Explore More tourism document last year, which set out our plan for tourism, including extending globally recognised brands such as the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East in order that we can help to create jobs, rebuild our economy and put money back in people's pockets. I say all this fully conscious of Tourism Ireland's role and remit to promote the island internationally as one tourism destination and conscious of the fact that we have no equivalent Minister in the North. That is yet another reason the Democratic Unionist Party should get back to work and stop blocking the opportunities that initiatives like this present to people. Even that unfortunate reality should not stop the local authorities, particularly those along the north coast and through the east, coming together with tourism promotion agencies to tap into the opportunity offered by this.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> As indicated by my colleague, Senator Boylan, last week in her contribution on Thursday's Order of Business, we will be opposing today's Order of Business because of the nature of the Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2022 that is before us this week. The committee had not concluded pre-legislative scrutiny of it and there are a number of serious concerns with this Bill. I appreciate the Leader's work in this regard and she did her best for us but for the reasons Senator Boylan outlined last week, this warranted much more time, attention and respect to Members to be able to contribute and make input to this Bill going forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">I want to bring to the Leader's attention the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018, which was passed in the Seanad in 2019 by former Senator Colette Kelleher. Oein de Bhardúin also did a lot of work on that Bill. We got it through the Dáil thanks to Deputy Pringle and we are looking at Committee Stage of the Bill. Unfortunately the money message has come into play with the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018. We wrote to the Minister, as did Deputies, and unfortunately we have not received a reply. This is a critical Bill, not only so that young Travellers will feel more valued within the education system, but to educate all of the students within our schools. It might sound a bit stupid for me to say this but the benefit to people's culture, feeling valued and feeling part of a society in which we never felt accepted is more important than the few hundred or few thousand euro that the Department would be out. After everything we have been through as a community, it is worth it. I would like the Minister to rule out the money message. Money is being drawn down in further education and this morning I was speaking to a Cork disability group that wondered where the support was to draw down some of that higher education funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> There is an awful lot of hatred and discrimination on our streets at present. It is very sad to be part of the Seanad during these horrible times but I want to use this platform for a positive note. I would encourage the Government and people in this House to send a positive message on their social media that we support refugees in our country. Divide and conquer and pitting communities against each other works for the Government, and I do not mean to sound bad by saying that. Everyone ends up talking about "them" and "us" instead of talking about what is happening at a higher level. Is it possible that we could get a campaign going? We always hear employment campaigns that state they are brought to you by the Government of Ireland and all that jazz. Is it possible that we could have a campaign that says refugees are welcome? I do not know what it would look like but that would be a positive message we could send to welcome refugees because after all, these people are fleeing war. They are in our country and it is up to us as a society to look after people who are here, who live here and who belong here. The Government could do a positive campaign.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">I would like to ask the Leader to arrange, possibly in the new year now, a debate on the shared island movement. The shared island initiative was one of the Taoiseach and a sum of €500 million was set aside in the programme for Government for a number of projects that were aimed at benefiting communities North and South and improving relationships North, South, east and west, particularly relationships between the two traditions on this island. From a slow start, the shared island initiative has become a movement and it is time the Seanad got behind it more fully. At a forum in Dublin Castle at the weekend, the Taoiseach outlined the further €50 million that will be spent in the near future, on top of the €140 million that has already been spent on a number of projects. It was announced that €10 million will be provided for a cross-Border peatland restoration programme led by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, that €7 million will be provided to tourism agencies to progress a collaboration between the Wild Atlantic Way and the Causeway Coastal Route and that €12 million will be set aside for development of a new innovation hub in the north west. There are a load more projects that Members can read about themselves; they are easy to access.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> This is a practical way of trying to unite people on this island. The shared island initiative threatens nobody and it is not, as has been suggested, a Trojan horse towards luring unionists into a united Ireland by stealth. It is anything other than that and unionists appreciate that. We are having an awful lot of conversations about constitutional change and a united Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"><i>The Irish Times </i>has published a definitive poll. To be honest, any reasonable person can see there will not be major constitutional change on this island for the coming decades, and certainly not in my lifetime. I regret to say that but it is a fact. All of us, including me, aspire to a united Ireland that unites people in friendship, understanding and partnership. No other kind of united Ireland is of interest to me or to the vast majority of people. It is time for the Opposition in particular to get behind the shared island initiative. They are behind other talking groups that are having conversations left, right and centre, while spending what appears to be a shocking amount of money. In reality, it is time to get behind something that is practical. We are putting our money where are mouths are for the first time in years. The incoming Taoiseach will take on this project and give it the same full support that the current Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, has given it. He deserves full credit as the man who has initiated a new way of looking at the problem for the first time in a long time. We are sick of the old rhetoric and methods. We are sick of green versus orange and the tribalism and sectarianism involved. We are sick of it. We want peace and harmony on our island. Let us make a start.</p>

          <p eId="para_140">Every time we see the flag flying over Leinster House, it creates a great sense of pride in the freedom of the country and the fact that we live in a democracy. That was recognised by the world 100 years ago today. It is fitting and appropriate for us to recognise that it was a difficult and traumatic time for our country. However, it was at that time we were first recognised by the world as a free state, the Irish Free State. The people who led to the creation of the Free State more than 100 years ago deserve full credit and recognition.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> The celebrations 100 years ago today were solemn and respectful, even though a terrible civil war, which got more bloody and terrible after the formation of the Free State, was taking place. We need to realise that our democracy has lasted 100 years. We are one of the longest lasting democracies in Europe. Our small country was ruled for 700 years prior to that by a foreign nation. We maintained our democracy and when it came to the transition of power from Cumann na nGaedheal, Fine Gael, to Fianna Fáil, it happened peacefully. When power transferred again in 1948, it happened peacefully. While there is a lot we need to do to improve our small country, we are one of the best little countries in the world. We are one of the most democratic little countries in the world. It is appropriate, today of all days, for us to salute the flag that flies over Leinster House and to salute our forefathers who created what we have today and those who, during the past 100 years, maintained our democracy in a peaceful way in this part of our country. We are all looking forward to the important celebration next Monday of the 100-year anniversary of Seanad Éireann.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">I will pick up on what Senator Ned O'Sullivan said about the shared island initiative. The Cathaoirleach and I were at Dublin Castle yesterday to hear the Taoiseach set out his stall. What passion and enthusiasm he displayed, and what grá he has for this initiative. We had amazing speakers and contributions, and major engagement. Dublin Castle was packed both inside and out. There was a great sense of optimism and hope. The Taoiseach touched on all-Ireland actions he has planned in areas such as biodiversity, tourism and brand collaboration. He spoke about the shared Ireland civic society fund and the shared island dimension for creative thinking, and creative cultural, arts and heritage projects. He also talked about the North-South research programmes, administered by the Higher Education Authority, and the co-centres of research, innovation and excellence. He is passionate. My hope is that he will carry that with him to whichever Department he moves. He may well move to the Department for Foreign Affairs but that is not a matter for me. I left Dublin Castle feeling I had looked at a man who was passionate about his vision and who was heading towards Iveagh House. I felt he would continue to have his hands firmly on the shared island initiative. I hope that comes to pass because that is the right place for him. That is a personal view rather than anything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> Senator Ó Donnghaile spoke about the Planning and Development Foreshore (Amendment) Bill that will be before the House later today. The members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, some of whom are here today, completed pre-legislative consideration of the Bill at noon. It is shambolic that the committee has only just completed its work. We have not yet seen the final copy of our report. I thank the staff of the committee. It is shambolic that this House will not have the results of pre-legislative scrutiny before it. In addition, the time limit for amendments to this Bill expired at 11 a.m., at which time the committee was still discussing matters relating to pre-legislative scrutiny. That is disappointing. Having said that, I recognise that there is much positive reform within the Bill. I will talk about that later.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> I will say one final word because I will be killed if I do not do so.

          <p eId="para_145">I raise an undesired situation in Donegal. The chief executive of Donegal County Council yesterday had to write to some of the protesters who attended the chambers in Lifford last week in respect of the mica scheme to raise the intimidation of his staff by certain individuals both online and at the protest that day. What is going on is completely undesirable. It is not on and a stop must be called to it. What is going on is beyond the pale. I have taken a great deal of abuse over the past 18 months. I am big enough to take it and I do not mind it. However, abusing officials is beyond the pale. The mica scheme is good and the people of Donegal want it. We are sick of people in the Opposition trying to create blocks. I am calling it out today. This is not happening in Mayo because Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh would not have it. Designers in the Sinn Féin Party in Donegal are behind this and are trying to muck up the scheme. It reminds me of Deputy Cullinane's message after he was elected in the general election - tiocfaidh ár lá and eff the establishment. They are trying to eff the establishment in Donegal by blocking this scheme. It is not on and it is not good enough. We are having no more of it. I, for one, am not standing for it. We as politicians can take it but without officials, we cannot have this scheme. We lost a good official in the housing department in Donegal. That person was a number of years from retirement but could not take the online abuse anymore. It is uncalled for. We cannot have a scheme in Donegal without officials and without Donegal County Council making the scheme work. I will make one last call to Sinn Féin to pull in their dogs in Donegal. Have a bit of law and order in Donegal. We are not taking it anymore. If one more official is called out in Donegal, I will ask for a full-scale Garda inquiry into what is going on.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">I had the privilege of visiting Goldenbridge Cemetery this morning and quietly paying tribute to W.T. Cosgrave to thank him and those who led our country. The testimony to their vision and leadership is that for 100 years, despite turbulent and contentious times - and Senator Ó Donnghaile is correct that we have a way to go yet - we have had democracy, the right to vote and the right to self-determination. Those things are precious to us on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">We should salute those men and women today. As Senator Conway rightly said, it is important we remember that democracy held. I want to remember in the House today Ernest Blythe, Desmond FitzGerald, Joseph McGrath, James J. Walsh, Kevin O'Higgins and W.T. Cosgrave and to thank them for what they did for our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> I ask for a debate on our aviation policy. Today, Government announced its regional airport fund of €21 million, of which Cork Airport is to get €10.4 million. The fund is very important to the running of all of our regional airports. I hope we can have the Minister for Transport come to the House as a matter of urgency. </p>
          <p eId="para_152"> Today is an important day and we, as a House, should acknowledge and remember those who led.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">I welcome Councillor Barry Sweeny from Ballyshannon, which is a great part of the country. I join my colleagues in celebrating the democracy that started from very small beginnings to become the democracy we have today. We have had enough of your past now give us our future. Those were very keen words when spoken but there is still much more to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> I will also speak to the funding the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has announced, which totals more than €21 million. Along with my colleagues here from the west and the councillor in the Gallery, I know how crucial it is to have supports for our regional airports. We are seeing in excess of €21 million being allocated throughout the country. Ireland West Airport Knock, a hub for Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, is to receive €1.78 million. There is to be €6.83 million for the regional airport at Shannon and more than €600,000 for Donegal in addition to funding for the airports in Cork and Kerry. These airports are crucial because they support investment in the west. It is about jobs and bringing more people to live and work in our region. Those airports are lifelines for many communities, for towns and villages and for families, including families who are returning home this Christmas, perhaps for the first time in two or three years. They will be travelling into our great airports at Knock, Shannon and Donegal. We need further support for those airports. I look forward to further discussion and hope the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, may be able to come to speak before the House on these types of investments.</p>

        <speech by="#GerardPCraughwell" eId="spk_50">
          <from>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_155">On 25 November, groups from across Ireland came together to honour the forgotten fallen of the National Army Civil War dead. Representatives of the deceased families, veterans, members of the public, public representatives and expert historical groups came together to honour the memory of those who gave their lives for the foundation of the modern Irish State. As of yet, these 1,000-plus men are not commemorated in any formal Irish State commemorative ceremony. Their stories have been forgotten and their service is unaccounted for at national level. The group came together to remember them and it is my hope the National Army will be remembered every November from now on. They were the men who saved our democracy at the time. I know the Civil War was bitter and that what happened on both sides was terrible. That is the nature of civil war. However, we cannot remember one side and forget the other. It is as simple as that.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> On a second issue, the Leader and everybody in this House will be aware of the pressure county councillors come under when something happens in their local area. Right now, the Department is moving into various areas to take over hotels for either asylum seekers or Ukrainian refugees. We and they fully understand this has to happen, but a number of councillors have contacted me in recent weeks to express real concern about the way things are done. They are not consulted before any decision is made. The first they hear of a decision is when a bus arrives in the area carrying refugees or asylum seekers; there is a difference between the two. I am aware of one hotel in Dublin that, up until a few days ago, was taking bookings for family gatherings. A leisure centre had been negotiated and all sorts of events were planned for this hotel but, all of a sudden, people were told the hotel was no longer available because it had been taken over for asylum seekers. Surely the least we could do is to prepare those on the ground, whom we represent, for what is about to happen in their communities. The one question I was asked is whether there is a need for planning permission for change of use for these hotels. Will the Leader look into that for us?</p>

          <from>Senator Sharon Keogan<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_157">I am glad it is the Leader who is sitting in the chair today because there are a couple of things I want to raise that I know are of interest to her. The first is the stalemate between the HSE and Vertex in respect of the drug Kaftrio. We have not moved on the provision of that drug at all. I note that Cystic Fibrosis Ireland is calling for the health technology assessment to be fast-tracked and for Kaftrio to be provided without delay to the 35 affected children. The HSE can then reimburse Vertex after a pricing agreement is reached. We are talking about 35 children. We are better than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> The second issue I will raise was brought up in the Dáil on 20 September, when the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, gave an update to the Dáil on the Cass report. He stated the HSE was reviewing the report. I remember the Leader gave me a commitment on the day Senator McDowell and Deputy Flanagan had a briefing on gender identity services and told me the HSE was also doing a report on the issue. This report has not appeared yet. Will that be forthcoming?</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> I support what Senator Craughwell has said. I welcome the idea that has been mooted that, under the new Administration when the Government switches around portfolios next year, a Minister for refugees could be created. I welcome that idea. Such a Minister is needed. We also needed a Covid Minister at that time. This is something unprecedented. We have never seen anything like this before just as we had never seen anything like Covid before. An individual Minister would provide a more holistic approach to the management of the refugees coming into this country, which would very much be welcomed.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">Fine Gael and this Government understand that businesses as well as people are facing difficult and uncertain times with their energy bills. That is why we introduced the three cycles of a universal energy credit of €200 in budget 2023 and why we introduced the temporary business energy support scheme, which is now open for applications. It is one of the biggest measures introduced in budget 2023 and was introduced to protect businesses at this difficult time. It provides funding for 40% of the increase in energy bills from the start of September through to the end of February up to a figure of €10,000 per month per business based on the uplift in the energy costs between 2021 and 2022. It is a very important measure that will protect jobs and businesses through the winter period. I appreciate it has taken some time for the Government to get approval from the European Commission for this scheme and to get the legislative provisions in place but these are now in place and the scheme is open for businesses. I encourage them to apply online. It is there to support businesses and to protect jobs. That is what we are about as a Government. I encourage businesses to take this up.</p>

          <from>Senator Erin McGreehan<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_161">I, too, want to highlight and talk about the shared island unit and today's 100-year anniversary. The €190 million that has been invested in people on this island is incredible. Projects that have been talked about for decades, particularly the Narrow Water Bridge, which I have spoken about constantly, are genuine, real and concrete proof that we are bringing people closer together. We have to look at the shared island unit because it is the only body working on an all-island basis across the Thirty-two Counties of this glorious island and thinking about how we can work closer together. That is progress on the island. The only way we will get true progress is to think about the one-island concept, which is exactly what the shared island unit does.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> I have to talk about the 100 years we commemorate today. It is very important we do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">There is a reason I would have been on the anti-Treaty side. It is because I did not celebrate all of that. We live with the failures of our politics 100 years ago. When I stand on top of the Cooley Mountains and look over to the Mournes and know they are in a different jurisdiction, I remember the pain and heartache that brought us to where we are and that continues. Many people in the North want and long for reunification, but we have to consider and remember what we had 100 years ago. We had a broken country. It was violent, and there was violence perpetrated on behalf of the State. We must remember the people who were executed and murdered. I think of local men such as Thomas McKeown, Thomas Lennon, Joseph Ferguson, James Melia - all Louth people who were executed by the Free State. They were put down, but they have always been remembered. I also think of Private Giles and Captain Boyle of the Free State, who were commemorated recently. They were men who thought they were doing the right thing for their country. Let us not forget that many people look back on what happened 100 years ago without celebrating it. There is great pride but also a sense of great loss regarding what happened 100. It was a failed politics. The Good Friday Agreement represents politics that worked. We have to work together to make sure politics works. That will bring about progress and the reunification of the island.</p>

        <speech by="#EmerCurrie" eId="spk_54">
          <from>Senator Emer Currie<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_164">I warmly welcome our Fine Gael colleague, Councillor Barry Sweeny, from Ballyshannon in County Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> I will be generous and say I have found an irregularity in car parking charges at commuter train stations in Dublin West. All of the County Dublin train station car parks charge €30 per month, but the Navan Road Parkway in Dublin West charges €70 per month. It is a privately owned facility. I have appealed to the owner to reduce the tariffs but have not had a positive result. I ask about this matter again, particularly as we talked before about bringing in the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, for a debate on transport. This is a key issue. It is about getting people out of their cars and onto trains. This is a barrier. There is no doubt about that. It is an unnecessary outgoing for families and people in the area in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> A few years ago, we were informed about 41 new intercity railway carriages that were purchased and that were expected to be put into service in 2023 with the purpose of lengthening the trains on commuter lines. I have had a worrying email back from the National Transport Authority to say that it is re-evaluating this matter on the basis of changed Covid travel patterns. It is also reconsidering locations where frequency is needed and has indicated that decisions will be taken in the coming months on the basis of an evaluation of demand across the network. What are those measurements? We need to be part of that conversation. People in Dublin West are crying out for more trains, especially from the M3 Parkway, Clonsilla and Hansfield. We have been informed 95 DART+ carriages are expected in 2024 but these seem to be destined for northern commuter rail lines and existing DART services. We need a debate on this and we need to hear from the Minister.</p>

          <from>Senator Micheál Carrrigy<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_167">I welcome our colleague, Councillor Sweeny, from Donegal. As a politician, he works extremely hard on behalf of his constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> I was running in because I have just come back from the Mansion House where there was a presentation from SMA Ireland. This is an issue I raised in the House some months back with regard to the heel prick test used in Ireland that does not identify a significant number of possible diseases. Particularly with spinal muscular atrophy, SMA, it is not done. Unfortunately for children who then show signs of SMA, it is too late. We have the medical know-how to help these kids. If they do not get that help within the first number of weeks after they are born, however, they cannot benefit from it. In a list of countries in Europe, we, who consider ourselves a first world country, are 20th with regard to the number of diseases covered by the heel prick test. I ask that that be reviewed and, in particular for SMA, where we have the medical to treat kids and give them a good quality of life, we should be putting it in place. I met families today and know others personally at home for whom it is too late because that has not been put in place. The cost is €5 per test, roughly €300,000 per year on the basis of the fact that 60,000 children are born each year. I ask that this matter be brought to attention of the Minister for Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> I come from Longford. For a small county, we excel at many things. Unfortunately, however, we do not win many all-Irelands. The Longford Slashers ladies team will contest the All-Ireland intermediate club final on Saturday at Croke Park against Mullinahone from Tipperary. I look forward to them being successful. As a small club that has only been in existence for a few years, they have brought great honour to our county. I wish them well and look forward to them bringing back all-Ireland success to Longford.</p>

          <p eId="para_171">It would be remiss of me not to give Councillor Sweeny the same good welcome everybody else has given him. I thank him for being here.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Senator Carrigy spoke about the SMA test and sought a review to include it in the process relating to the heel prick test. He has raised it on a number of occasions and, given the relatively small charge and the significant impact it can have in the intervention of the disease, it is worthwhile. I raised it with the Minister the last time the Senator brought it up here but will do it again to refresh his memory.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> Senator Currie sought a debate on transport with regard to anomalies in parking charges at train stations. I will ask again. We were lucky enough to secure the Minister for a climate debate this week and his brief is very extensive, but we will try again after Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Senator McGreehan spoke about the merits of the shared island unit and the €500 million investment on behalf of the Taoiseach and State.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> Senator Cummins told us of the grant scheme opened last week to support businesses with their ever-increasing energy costs and the €10,000 per month that is available to help with those costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> Senator Keogan spoke on Vertex. I follow it now on social media to keep abreast of any changes. For a while I thought there was a political dance involving the HSE. The post I saw at the weekend made me sad and I contacted somebody involved with the 35 children. The HSE has agreed to give it and all we are dancing around now is about whether it will cost X or Y amount of money. I do not understand why we cannot have that argument and long debate, if that is what the HSE wants, after giving the kids the drugs which will have a massive impact on their lives. It is disingenuous. It is incumbent on us to keep raising it here week-in, week-out until we get it. I will contact the Minister again today. It is disingenuous that there is a political debate going on over money while children's lives are at stake. It is disgusting.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> As I said the night we had the review around gender services in Ireland, Dr. Colm Henry and his senior officials have conducted a thorough report on Tavistock, including meeting with Dr. Hilary Cass. They went to the United Kingdom to meet her and discuss how the services had been run, the concerns she had raised and how Ireland had interacted with those services. I was of a mind that that report was to be published a couple of weeks ago but it has not yet. I will make a phone call today and find out when it is coming, and then we can have a proper conversation about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> I note the Senator's welcome for the suggestion made by Cabinet sources this morning that we should have a Minister with responsibility for refugees. The latter would mean that there would be a single person to whom people could address their concerns. My only worry is that it would let all the other Departments that are required to ensure we have proper integrated services off lightly.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">Whether we are talking about education, healthcare or community supports, they do not all rest with one Minister. Given my experience, no one Minister has control to the magnitude of what they would need over other Departments. While it might look like a good idea, I am not sure it would have the authority that I think it would need, given the concerns that have been raised. It is a welcome suggestion to have a conversation about it. Senator Buttimer again spoke about consultation being an absolute must, not just with local authorities but with communities, when we are trying to resettle the large number of refugees coming into the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> Senator Dolan welcomed the €21 million funding that was announced this morning, particularly for regional airports, and it is very welcome. Senator Buttimer welcomed the fact that €10 million of the funding went to Cork Airport, as he would, and sought a debate on aviation.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> Senator Blaney made a very impassioned speech. It is very disturbing to hear the revelations he made this morning, especially the abuse of officials. While we do not all agree 100% with decisions governments or local authorities make, the only way we ever get change is to support each other and to make sure the authorities activate the money and schemes the Government has decided to give to help people in distress. I acknowledge what the Senator said here.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Senator Boyhan spoke about the shared island event the Taoiseach held yesterday. It was particularly nice of the Senator to mention the Taoiseach's passion and enthusiasm for the topic, and I do not think that could be underestimated. The Senator also objected to the Order of Business, which is fair enough. Senator Conway spoke about saluting the flag and especially about the people who have maintained our democracy over recent years. Senator O'Sullivan spoke of his real grá for the fact the shared island unit was started by the Taoiseach, that it has done tremendous work and spent a significant amount of money of more than €140 million in recent years. Only a short two years has elapsed since its inception. The Senator is right that this is the first time people North and South are doing something in a positive way, working together and collaborating. Long may that last, regardless of which Department the Taoiseach ends up in over the next couple of weeks. The Taoiseach's enthusiasm will still make sure the initiative is driven. The Senator mentioned, and I thought it was a really nice to describe it, that it is a practical way to make sure everybody's boat gets lifted and not just some communities, as may have happened in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> I am sorry Senator Flynn does not have a reply and I will definitely get her one. I have not heard about money messages for a long number of years. When my party was in a minority Government, there were money messages and they were used considerably to make sure Bills did not pass. The Bill she mentioned is a very positive one and a small amount of money is involved. A money message is not something we should use to thwart proceedings and we should get around it. I will get the answer for the Senator today and at least will get back to her.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> Senator Ó Donnghaile spoke again about Sinn Féin's opposition to the Order of Business, which I totally understand.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">Senator Clonan captured everybody's attention because he spoke so poignantly about a community that both he and I come from. It is not just Finglas, Ballymun, Clondalkin or Cherry Orchard but any other community. We have a growing and deeply disturbing rise in the use of guns in this country. What is equally as worrying is the growing acceptance by people when they hear about shootings, as we did last night on the radio. We think it is only those gangland people killing themselves and we just carry on as if it is not important. What is significantly important about shootings is that, first, these people are human and have families. Second, these incidents are happening in communities that have many other families and children who are blighted by their actions and live in fear. The issue is definitely worthy of a debate and I will try to organise that.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> Senator Dooley spoke about the need for more specialist services. We definitely need more scrutiny. It is a telling sign that young people and young males in particular are walking around with the trappings of wealth, such as wearing designer label gear, that in no way could be afforded by the average 16- to 26-year old. While we may be asking questions, we are not getting to the root of where these guns are coming from and what the organisations' connections are with criminality and drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> Senator Kyne opened today by talking about inland fisheries, as he has done here over recent weeks. There is potential that he will seek a review but we will get to that on another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> Today is a very important day in the context of the decade of centenaries because the foundation of the State and the bedding down of the democracy we enjoy happened 100 years ago today. Saorstát Éireann officially came into being and, for the first time in 753 years, the island of Ireland became a single and sovereign nation. A lesser known fact is that the Six Counties of Northern Ireland were a part of the original Irish Free State on this day in 1922 but they opted out a day later through a vote in Stormont. The new Irish Government was a pro-Treaty faction of the then Sinn Féin Party, which went on to form Cumann na nGaedheal, which was a precursor to my own party of Fine Gael. William T. Cosgrave, a Dublin publican, Easter Rising veteran and Minister in the underground Dáil ministry, was elected to be the first President of the Irish Free State; in other words, our first Taoiseach. He was described in Michael Laffan's biography of him as "an extraordinary ordinary man". The Free State Constitution established a second Chamber, the Upper House or Seanad Éireann, of which we will celebrate the 100th anniversary next Monday. This monumental day had no pomp nor ceremony. The bitter and tragic Civil War was still raging and absent from the Dáil was Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins, who were two of our most formidable founding fathers.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> Today is a day for us to reflect on the foundation of our State what our founding fathers sacrificed to create Saorstát Éireann, which was declared a Republic in 1949 by the then Taoiseach, John A. Costello. I agree with Senator Craughwell when he said we should remember the National Army soldiers who loyally served the Irish State in 1922, many of whom made the ultimate sacrifice. They defended the institutions of the State, our democracy and the will of the people. Their legacy is the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> Finally, I wish to quote President W.T. Cosgrave on this day 100 years ago. He said, "On this notable day when our country has definitely emerged from the bondage under which she has lived through a week of centuries, I cannot deny that I feel intensely proud", and I think we all still are. I wish everyone a very happy 100th anniversary. This is our Independence Day, the fourth oldest democracy in Europe.</p>

          <from>Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Darragh O'Brien)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_232">I am pleased to introduce this Bill to Seanad Éireann today. I thank the Seanad for facilitating this important and urgent legislation. I acknowledge concerns about the limits on debate time and the fact that the pre-legislative scrutiny report has not been published. However, the urgency of the issues at hand to address the housing crisis requires immediate legislative action. I appreciate the Seanad's assistance in achieving that. I want to set out the background and why such swift actions are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> The Bill was part of the An Bord Pleanála reform agenda agreed by the Cabinet on 4 October and then submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny, which commenced on 10 November. For clarity, as was indicated in the letter to the Seanad Leader to facilitate the expedited passage of the Bill, Department officials fully engaged in this pre-legislative process. I indicated to Opposition parties on 22 November that I intended to introduce additional measures in the Bill to expedite the supply of social and affordable housing. However, the pre-legislative scrutiny report has still not been published, which means it would not have been possible to seek and receive Cabinet and Oireachtas approval of the Bill before the Christmas recess. I have made my officials available for briefings, as required, on any aspect of the Bill to ensure every Member is fully informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> I want to emphasise two points on which we need to move forward quickly that require this urgent approach. The first concerns the immediate need to put in place a new chairperson for An Bord Pleanála to help unlock the planning delays affecting our housing system. Overhauling and reforming An Bord Pleanála to rebuild and restore public trust after a turbulent period and to ensure it can play an efficient and effective role at the apex of our planning system cannot be delayed any further. Second, the pressing need to ramp up supply and address the impact of inflation, higher interest rates and supply-chain issues means we need to take further steps to boost housing delivery. In this light, I am bringing forward accelerated measures to support local authority social and affordable housing delivery through the planning system and by using modern construction methods. I am aware that all Senators understand the urgent need to prioritise the tackling of our housing crisis through all means available. This proposed amendment, subject to Cabinet approval, reflects that. </p>
          <p eId="para_235"> I will now go through the broad policies underpinning the Bill. Since its establishment in 1977, An Bord Pleanála has become an integral part of the Irish planning system, providing an independent, impartial and objective appeals process, in addition to numerous other functions. The provisions concerning the board of An Bord Pleanála contained in the Bill are necessary to ensure the full functioning of the board to allow it to process its significant workload efficiently.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> While the main legislative provisions relating to An Bord Pleanála are being examined in detail as part of the review of planning legislation currently being led by the Attorney General, this Bill deals with certain initial matters requiring immediate action on foot of the action plan for An Bord Pleanála, phase 1, which resulted from the Office of the Planning Regulator's review of An Bord Pleanála and other matters relating to addressing board vacancies and the board's caseload in light of its new marine functions. These new functions include providing for the appointment of a chairperson of An Bord Pleanála, for an interim period, while a permanent chairperson is recruited through open competition; increasing the limit on the overall number of ordinary members of the board to ensure the increasing caseload can be managed and the appropriate quorums and suitable allocation of case files can be assured; expanding the provision to appoint temporary ordinary board members to allow for the appointment of serving or former civil servants, public servants or employees of the board for a term of up to a year; providing for a suitable, independent, objective and transparent procedure by which recommendations may be made to the Minister concerning the recruitment and appointment of ordinary members of the board through an open competitive process; clarifying and streamlining the investigative powers of a new chairperson under section 110; and removing the option for a two-member board quorum so that the minimum quorum will be at least three.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> The Bill provides for a new appointment process for board members of An Bord Pleanála through open competition where any member of the public can apply if he or she believes they have the relevant experience or qualifications to serve on the board. This process will replace the outdated panel nomination process with a new structure to replenish the board. The reform of the appointment process for members to the board of An Bord Pleanála is a critical step to ensure board impartiality and transparency and will restore confidence in An Bord Pleanála as the independent planning body that is foundational to the success of the planning system in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> Part 3 of the Bill introduces an amendment to the definition of "foreshore" to ensure the body of water above the seabed and the subsoil below it are included. The Bill provides that this revised definition should be understood to have always been the definition of "foreshore". It also provides that leases, licences and consents granted and made by the Minister under the 1933 Act that include an area that would not have fallen under the definition of foreshore prior to this amendment shall be understood to be foreshore in accordance with the amended definition. Likewise, applications on hand with the Minister under the Act can be consented to on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">It has been always understood since 1933 that the foreshore as described and defined in the Foreshore Act included subsoil, bed and shore, as well as the water column. This is how the State and foreshore users have operated for many decades, with leases and licences applied for and granted on that basis. In the summer of 2022, a developer in the foreshore area raised for the first time, an issue as to whether the water column was indeed included in the definition. The intention of the amendments is to put beyond doubt the State’s authority to regulate the use of this water column. This is particularly important when it comes to developer-led activities that take place solely in the water column and which do not impact the seabed; in order that the State can meet its obligations with respect to range of directives for the protection of the maritime area; and to ensure that there is a coherent consenting process in the maritime area ahead of the commencement of the new regulatory regime provided for under the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> I wish to advise that I am working with the Attorney General to develop an amendment to be tabled on Committee Stage to provide in defined circumstances for the accelerated delivery of social or affordable housing on local authority or other State lands that do not require an environment impact assessment, EIA, or an appropriate assessment, AA, for a defined period. The precise criteria underpinning this provision are subject to final technical amendment by the Office of the Attorney General. In essence, the provision would seek to allow for exemption from section 179 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in strictly defined circumstances where: the land is owned by the local authority or another State body; the land is zoned for housing development; the proposed development is in accordance with the relevant local authority’s housing strategy; the land is serviced or will be serviced within the timeframe of the development; the local authority has regard to the section 28 ministerial planning guidelines on the planning system, flood management, Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, guidance and relevant information on monuments and protected structures; and the chief executive has consulted with the elected members and has given public notice of the proposed development.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> This measure would be time-bound and is required. We already have planning exemptions in place to facilitate accommodation solutions for the beneficiaries of temporary protection from Ukraine, and we are delighted to be able to help them while the Russian invasion of their country rages on. This proposed planning exemption will enable us to make quicker progress on providing much-needed housing, including for the most vulnerable on our housing waiting lists, while also providing an opportunity to accelerate affordable and cost-rental delivery. The area is complex and the provisions being prepared by the Attorney General will be time-bound provisions subject to Cabinet approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> Given the short space of time remaining to me, an outline of the sections within the Bill are provided in the copy of my speech I have provided to Senators. The Bill is about moving forward with the reform of appointments to An Bord Pleanála to make sure we have an open and transparent system for appointment of members to the board and to allow the Minister to appoint an interim Chair to the board, which is needed right now. While we continue with the reform agenda for the board, we need the board to be able to function now. The other element, which is very important and which will come by way of amendment on Thursday, is to allow us, on lands that have already been identified as owned by local authorities or by State bodies, to expedite the delivery of social and affordable housing specifically focusing on using modern methods of construction. All of us in this Chamber agree that we have a housing crisis and that we need to ramp up further delivery. Although we will deliver more than 10,000 social homes this year, we need to do more next year. This amendment will enable us to do that. I welcome the support of all Senators in the House, who all believe in the delivery of social and affordable housing. I ask for support for this measure on a time-bound basis, which will enable us to deliver even more social and affordable homes by allowing the planning process to expedite planning in that regard.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryFitzpatrick" eId="spk_65">
          <from>Senator Mary Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_243">I welcome the Minister. We have been discussing this legislation at the Oireachtas joint committee. We were in the process of trying to conclude pre-legislative scrutiny on the legislation. We had good engagement with the Minister's Department and with others. As a committee, we support the Government's and the Minister's objectives to deliver on Housing for All, which is the ambitious plan to deliver 300,000 homes, with a mixture of social, affordable, and private homes, and for the very first time the affordable cost-rental homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> We also support the Government's objectives to facilitate, increase and champion the delivery of renewables and offshore wind energy generation. Ireland is a leader in onshore wind energy but offshore wind energy presents such an enormous opportunity for our country - not just for ourselves but also for wider Europe - for energy security, for energy sustainability, and to help us achieve our climate action objectives. We support all of those efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> As a committee there is unanimity around our ambition to have strong, independent, objective planning processes in order that the public can have confidence in our planning processes. This brings me to the disappointment that we have been unable to complete our pre-legislative scrutiny in advance of consideration of this important legislation. I agree with the Minister that it is urgent. The urgency required to solve the housing crisis cannot be overstated. On that basis, the Fianna Fáil group will support the Bill and we look forward to progressing the legislation, and any legislation that can enable our local authorities, approved housing bodies and anybody who wants to help to solve the housing crisis, to solve our energy crisis and to restore public confidence in our planning system.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> This legislation aims to do all those three things. The legislation aims to facilitate and ensure independent, transparent and strong decision-making in terms of our planning processes. I commend the Minister on ending the strategic housing development process and for introducing the large-scale residential development planning process. That has done a number of things. It has restored decision-making at a local level. The party believes that the primacy of our democracy is at a local level. Our local governments are independent authorities in each of their jurisdictions. They work in partnership with central government and it is our job to ensure they are equipped and enabled to deliver for their communities. I believe that the reforming change introduced by the Minister to return the planning decision-making processes to our local authorities is an incredibly valuable one that our local authority members appreciate and value. I believe they will exercise it with very good effect for their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> This legislation deals with An Bord Pleanála and the need on an urgent basis for the appointment of an interim chairperson. I do not want to delay the debate so I will not discuss the issues that have gone on with An Bord Pleanála. It is not an overstatement to say the public's confidence in the board as a body to perform very important functions around planning is at an all-time low. There is an urgent need for the appointment of a strong chair to that body. The Minister has brought forward a reforming action plan for An Bord Pleanála and there is a real desire from the public to see that action plan implemented as soon as possible and to see confidence being restored in An Bord Pleanála's ability to deliver planning decisions that are independent, objective and, most importantly, transparent. It is very important that we get this done and that the Minister, through this legislation, is able to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> The foreshore licence is a critical issue for our marine activities. Again, we will support the Minister's Bill on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">On the new powers that are proposed, they give the local authorities, which are the closest, in our democracy, to the communities we all aim to serve, the power to accelerate the delivery of social and affordable homes at the time of a housing crisis. The Minister's Department and the local authorities are to be commended on the massive acceleration that they have already achieved in just over a year since Housing for All was introduced. Everyone involved should be commended, including the local authorities, the Department, the approved housing bodies, and the private developers - everybody who has put their shoulder to the wheel and has already delivered more than 55,000 homes in construction or commencements. When we consider that we were coming from such a low base 12 to 24 months ago, it is encouraging, but we have to push on with the ambition to deliver a minimum of 35,000 homes per year to get us to somewhere in the region of 40,000 homes a year. The urgency that is required for that is really pressing. It is an ambition that everybody must be involved in. We must enable our local authorities to use lands that are already zoned or serviced for housing in locations where there is housing demand and where there are plans that are consistent with the city and county development plans and the housing plans. One of the additional values and benefits that local authority members have told me Housing for All has given them is the ability to have an input into their housing action and delivery plans, and to know that there is going to be sustained funding over many years to deliver. This is another important development. I thank the Minister for bringing the legislation to the House today and I look forward to the debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#VictorBoyhan" eId="spk_66">
          <from>Senator Victor Boyhan<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_250">First, I welcome the Minister to the House. We are discussing the Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2022. I want to start by saying that it is somewhat disappointing. The Minister has acknowledged that we were not in a position to complete our pre-legislative scrutiny. It was only completed at 12 p.m. today. If we put that into context, the deadline for the submission of amendments to the Bill was 11 a.m. today, so it is very unsatisfactory. There have been a number of similar timelines with previous legislation. I recognise the importance of what has to be done in the legislation and the importance of addressing the issues around housing, homes, affordable housing and the Minister's brief.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> At the outset I want to thank the staff of the secretariat of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, because they did a lot of work in preparation for this. There was some discussion and tidying up of amendments to the recommendations of the committee. I think the recommendations are strong ones. There might be one or two that are at odds with the Minister's proposals, but I would like to think he will consider them and perhaps bring amendments to the Bill later in the process. I thank the staff of the secretariat and the committee members for their constructive work on the Bill. I also acknowledge the important work of the Library and Research Service, which published a digest on the Bill and circulated it yesterday. That is important. The kernel of all of this is that pre-legislative scrutiny is important. It brings value to legislation. The Minister's party colleagues and his colleagues across the Houses are represented on the committee. </p>
          <p eId="para_252"> The Bill comprises 17 sections and three Parts. I want to focus on Part 2, which I have a particular interest in. First, I wish to state that confidence in An Bord Pleanála is waning fast. The Minister and I both know that. I put in a freedom of information request to An Bord Pleanála to check some facts once I realised there were issues with the board. I think everyone knew there were problems with the board. We must not forget that the Minister's party was a partner in the previous Government, although it was not a coalition government. The strategic housing developments, SHDs, were a challenge for the board. I was a member of the committee and I constantly raised the issue. Indeed, the Minister was a member of the committee for some of that time. We flagged that there was a problem with resources. The final SHDs are really only flushing through the system now. The large-scale developments are also placing huge pressures on the board. I wrote to the board. I will share the correspondence with the Minister later. I want to reference one letter dated 6 October 2021, addressed to "Dave". Dave happens to be Mr. Dave Walsh, the chairperson of An Bord Pleanála. The letter is one of a number I received. Clearly, there were tensions between the Minister's Department and the board on the appointment of staff. The chairman made cases for the recruitment of staff, and the Department's principal officers responded that there were serious concerns on the part of the Department in terms of legal and corporate services. The letter stated that the Department was also agreeable to an increase in resources to support the planning and the digitalisation that has been discussed. The letter went on to note that a sanction request form would need to be completed for each and every post filled by the board. That is all proper housekeeping and good governance. I am not suggesting there is anything wrong with that. However, I ask the Minister to look again at the blockages between his Department and the board, in terms of the frustrations that the board expressed about filling posts. I am happy to share the correspondence with the Minister in a constructive way. I do not think it is appropriate to keep reading into the context of it. The request is on the FOI register and I am happy to share it with the Minister. I acknowledge that there are some many good people in An Bord Pleanála, who do an exceptionally good job. I support the Minister's call for an interim chair to be appointed to the board. That is essential. We have to get on with it. I do not support the calls to abolish An Bord Pleanála, but I support the calls for reform. I think that is we where we can do something with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> Clearly, the credibility of and confidence in An Bord Pleanála is at an all-time low. Much of that is due to its failure to deal with its applications in a timely manner and, more importantly, to explain in a open and transparent way the rationale of many of its appeal decisions. That is a matter of concern. The public at large are unable to understand why the decisions of An Bord Pleanála inspectors are overturned by the board. We have heard some suggestions - which are only suggestions, might I add - in the media of outcomes being manipulated. We have heard of frustration being expressed by members within An Bord Pleanála in the exercising of their functions. They are only allegations. At this point I want to make a request of the Minister. A number of inquiries and investigations were set in place. When it is appropriate to do so, the Minister should make a full statement on them. The public at large wants to know what is happening. We know there are ongoing investigations behind the scenes, and there is good reason for that. However, there is a need to instill in the public a sense of confidence in the independent planning board.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> I also want to raise to the issue of panels. The Minister's colleague, and president of the Association of Irish Local Government, Councillor Pat Fitzpatrick from Kilkenny County Council, wrote to every member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage via email yesterday. He has made a request, which I think is a reasonable one. Indeed, I wrote to him last night to indicate that I would raise the matter here. The request is that the panels be retained. We need to reform the panel system. We discussed the matter at the committee meeting earlier. It is true that the panel system is not good enough, it has failed and it has shortcomings. We should look at reviewing the panel structures. I want to make a strong case today that local government has a role to play. Local authorities should not individually pick people, but they should have a consultative role and feed into some reformed panel system. As someone who is strongly committed to local government, I ask the Minister to look at that proposal or to come up with something more imaginative perhaps. </p>
          <p eId="para_255"> In principle, I support most of this legislation. We need a planning system that is open, transparent, honest and full of integrity. We want an appeals system that is fit for purpose and is resourced by the Minister and the Government. I note a substantial increase in funding has been provided in budget 2023, which is to be welcomed. We want to bring people into the planning process and to journey with the citizens. I am not in the business of excluding people from a process. The reality is that so many community groups have had to come together to raise funds to take judicial reviews. They are not bad people. They are making a case and have a right to do so. They have a right to an audience and to be heard. It is important that the message does not go out from the Minister, the Government or this House that in some way we are out to frustrate, block or stymy people in their participation in a public planning process. I would like to see language that talks about inclusiveness and enabling people to participate. People do not dip their hands into their pockets and hand their cash to a load of lawyers lightly.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">They had no option. That was partly because of the historical SHD system and no third-party appeals. I accept that we need reform, but we need to bring the community groups with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> I acknowledge all those who made submissions to the pre-legislative scrutiny process, namely: Maria Graham and the staff at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage; the Irish Environmental Network; the Irish Planning Institute; the Office of the Planning Regulator; the Marine Renewables Industry Association; An Taisce; the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland; and Coastwatch. They made submissions and came in good faith to engage in this process. I wish the Minister well with the Bill but let us not put up blocks or send out messages suggesting we are against citizens' participation in our planning process.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">I welcome the Minister and thank him for choosing Seanad Éireann as the venue for the introduction of this very important legislation. The Planning and Development and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill provides for the efficient discharge of business of An Bord Pleanála; I will touch on that shortly. It also makes some minor amendments to the Foreshore Act 1933 to ensure that the body of water above the seabed is included in the definition of the foreshore. Along with other Members, I attended the briefing with departmental officials yesterday. I thank those officials for making themselves available to Senators for questions on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> My two Seanad colleagues mentioned the difficulties at An Bord Pleanála of which we are all very well aware. Confidence in the board has deteriorated over the past 12 months. The revelations of the governance issues are a deep concern to all of us. That is why it is essential and timely to have this legislation in order to ensure we can appoint an interim chairperson to take the helm at the organisation and bring about the change that is needed within that organisation. The Bill provides that the board will have 14 members but can be go beyond that where the Minister deems it necessary. I would argue that he will need to go beyond those 14 members in light of the acute challenges we are all aware of in meeting timelines for planning decisions, not just in respect of housing developments but also with consents for offshore wind energy projects, which all go through An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> Despite what builders and developers want, it is not possible to have certainty in the planning system. It is not possible to guarantee that something will come out the way that they want. However, we can have predictability on the timelines. That is very important both in this and the wider review of the planning legislation which is ongoing at present. What is happening cannot continue. I refer to situations where a planning decision is appealed to An Bord Pleanála, reaches the deadline, An Bord Pleanála informs the developer that it has not been able to meet the deadline and is extending it to a future date and then the developer does not hear about the matter again. Many housing developments are in the ether of having gone past the deadline and gone through the extended timeline. When they contact An Bord Pleanála, it states that it cannot give a time as to when a decision will be made. That is simply unacceptable when we have such an acute shortage of housing. The Minister will need to go beyond the 14 members in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> As the officials said yesterday and as the Minister said today, the foreshore piece is a minor amendment that has arisen more as a clarification of the existing provisions. Wind Energy Ireland has expressed some concerns in that context. Those concerns relate more to speeding up the process of applications for surveying. We all know how important offshore wind is in meeting our 2030 targets for emissions reductions. The sector is being hamstrung as a result of not being able to get through the process. Again, it comes back to the timelines. In the wider review of planning legislation, we need to consider significant penalties for An Bord Pleanála not meeting its deadlines.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> I appreciate that the Minister will provide more details on Thursday in the form of the amendments he intends to bring forward. From what he has outlined, it seems he is exempting certain developments from the planning process or expediting the planning process, as he put it, in the context of modern building technology. I assume he is referring to rapid-build homes. We are often criticised for not utilising those modern building techniques. They have come on in leaps and bounds in recent years, and could provide a quicker and more efficient housing solutions in the short term. I look forward to hearing the Minister expand that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> From what the Minister outlined, I understand that the chief executive will be required to have consulted elected members and he or she will be required to give a public notice of the proposed development. Am I to assume that if the chief executive is so minded, it will not require a vote of elected members and that the chief executive may proceed with a development but must consult? I ask the Minister to expand on that. Everyone in the House will support any endeavour on the part of the Minister to speed up the delivery of social and affordable homes for individuals and families throughout the country. We need to ensure that we get it right. I am sure that the Minister's team along with the Attorney General are poring over that as we speak. I look forward to those amendments coming before the House on Thursday.</p>

        <speech by="#FrancesBlack" eId="spk_68">
          <from>Senator Frances Black<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_264">I welcome the Minister. I am disappointed that, once again, right before recess, the Government is rushing legislation through this House with no regard for proper parliamentary process or legislative scrutiny. That is disrespectful in the context of how our parliamentary democracy should function. I urge all Members to reflect on the fact that our constitutional role and mandate here are not being respected. The Bill was only published in full at the end of last week. Second Stage is being taken today. On Thursday, we will have Committee and Remaining Stages. As we will have no distinct Report Stage, we will have no opportunity to submit Report Stage amendments. I am concerned about the entire Bill being rushed through the House inside a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> What is happening is disappointing because the alleged conduct on the part of An Bord Pleanála that has been revealed in recent months has deeply impacted on public trust. I am concerned that the manner in which this legislation is being conducted will further erode public trust in the institution. For that very reason, this legislation could really benefit from more robust and thorough scrutiny. A very thoughtful and transparent legislative response to the An Bord Pleanála scandals might have gone some way towards restoring some of the public confidence that has been eroded.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">We want the public to have confidence and trust in our planning system. An independent planning system is part of a functioning democracy. That independence is threatened by this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> I also want to express my concern that we will not see a substantial number of the proposed provisions of the Bill until Committee Stage. The Minister has indicated that he will bring forward amendments to provide for the accelerated delivery of social housing on local authority lands in exceptional circumstances in the absence of normal planning prerequisites such as environmental impact assessments. I am particularly concerned by reports that the Minister intends to table amendments to give himself the power to unilaterally rezone land for social housing. We all know that we are in a housing emergency . We desperately need social housing, but local authorities and councillors should be empowered to deliver social housing on public land. The proposal in this regard would amount to a drastic overreach by central government into the area of power of local government. That the Minister would expect Members of this House, 43 of whom are elected by councillors, to sign off on a drastic interference with councillors' powers and role is unacceptable. Attempting to introduce this amendment in the Dáil to circumvent the Seanad would add to the litany of abuses of proper process we have seen with this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> There is a sensible provision in the Bill that seeks to address one specific governance issue at An Bord Pleanála. The extensive abuse of the two-person quorum highlighted by <i>The Ditch</i> is a serious issue. The provision in section 9 to remove the option of a two-person quorum is probably sensible in light of the evidence that this mechanism has been repeatedly misused.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> Unfortunately, there seems to be little sense to other proposed reforms within the Bill. I am concerned by the provisions that seem to give undue powers to the Minister to dictate the size and composition of the board. The Bill grants powers to the Minister to increase the number of ordinary members of the board virtually at his discretion. Most disturbing is that protections within the existing Act that require the Minister to obtain Oireachtas approval before expanding the board are being removed. The Bill will also remove any existing limits on the proportion of board members that can be appointed by the Minister. Currently, no more than one third of the ordinary members can be appointed by the Minister. The Bill will remove this limit. </p>
          <p eId="para_270"> If we are to have an honest conversation about this legislation, then we must be frank about the fact that the reforms I have just outlined amount to a power grab. Under the proposed new rules, a future Minister could theoretically expand the board by whatever number of ordinary members, and stack it with his or her own appointees. While the Minister may not have any intention of using the powers to which I refer in such a way, we just do know how future Ministers might misuse them. We must be mindful of that. The legislation we pass in this House should be future-proofed and should contain sufficient safeguards against any potential abuse of power. I am afraid that the Bill fails this very important test.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> It is clear that the undermining of public trust in An Bord Pleanála requires a complete review of the appointment and oversight processes of the board. I am concerned that this Bill does not deliver the additional safeguards, scrutiny and oversight that are so badly needed and instead delivers a short-term, quick-fix solution to address a backlog of planning applications. I am surprised not to see rigorous standards set out in the Bill in respect of the declaration of interests of board members and other key issues. I am also surprised by the weak provisions in respect of the required expertise of board members and cannot understand why there are not far more robust measures as to the qualifications of board members.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> It seems clear that what a future board needs in order to regain the faith of the public is absolute transparency and rigorous oversight. Instead, the Bill proposes a system that seems to rest largely on discretion. The discretion of the Minister seems to be the main basis for determining the appointment of civil servants to the board, the qualifications of members, and other crucial issues. We also see these words cropping up in regard to the chairperson. I am disappointed to see it stated in section 10 that it will be at the chairperson's absolute discretion as to whether he or she will investigate complaints made against board members. I wonder how this discretion-led system could possibly be a winning formula for reviving public confidence in our planning institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> I have mentioned public trust a number of times . It is a phrase I keep coming back to because it should be guiding these reforms and yet it seems utterly absent from the conversation. Public trust in the board has been decimated. It is up to us to restore this trust and to legitimise the planning process once again. I am deeply concerned that this Bill will fail to achieve that very important aim.</p>

          <from>Senator Fintan Warfield<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_274">I welcome the Minister and his officials. I also thank the officials for the briefing they provided yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> I begin by expressing again my deep concern and unease, as many others have done, about the introduction of legislation in this last-minute fashion. Like others, I wish to place on record the fact that is not a good way to make law. There have been far too many instances of last-minute rushed legislation from both this Government and that which preceded it. This has resulted in a range of unintended consequences and measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> Planning legislation is particularly complex and must be dealt with in a thorough, considered and comprehensive manner. It should be adequately scrutinised, discussed and debated over a sufficient period of time. The manner in which the Minister has chosen to introduce this legislation has eroded and undermined much of this crucial consideration. While I acknowledge Senator Doherty’s refusal to concede to the Minister’s request to have all Stages of the Bill taken in one day, I nonetheless continue to have grave concerns about this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> I am particularly concerned by the Minister’s disregard for the pre-legislative scrutiny process and the work that was undertaken by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Time-honoured procedure and best practice require a committee to complete pre-legislative scrutiny, send the report to the Minister, the Minister and their officials then consider the report and either publish or perhaps make changes to the legislation on the back of the report. The joint committee only met this morning to finalise its report and to address amendments. The gazumping of the pre-legislative scrutiny process makes a mockery of the significant work undertaken by the committee to date and prevented my colleagues in the Seanad and I from considering this report before the deadline for amendments fell due this morning. Prior to 11 a.m. was the only point at which we could avail of the opportunity to submit Committee Stage amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> It is crucial that we get this legislation right. An Bord Pleanála is an institution in crisis. If is affected by bad management and bad decisions. Bad underlying legislation has led to a collapse in public confidence in the work of the board. The board is repeatedly making legally questionable decisions on SHDs that are then being challenged successfully in the courts. These challenges not only cost the taxpayer millions of euros but result in undue delays to developments. They also fundamentally undermine public confidence in the board. The board is also delaying decisions on controversial SHDs, which costs the taxpayer through fines. More than €1 million has been paid out to developers in this regard. There is no doubt that reform is needed. However, given that the more substantive changes to the board are to be included in the Bill, can the Minister clarify why these aspects have been detached from it?</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> The reform proposed in the Bill is rushed and does not adequately address the public concerns about the board. We need a clear, open and transparent process that is independent of the Department and the Minister. The proposed reforms do not provide for this. The proposals in the Bill are too general and do not provide sufficient clarity as to what the procedures for appointment would be. As the old saying goes, justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done. I propose that the board must not only be independent, it must also be seen to be independent.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> The proposed method of appointment that has been put forward does not guarantee sufficient independence from the Minister and his Department. Appointment of a member of the Civil Service to a position such as that of interim chairperson is entirely unsatisfactory. In order for the board to be independent of the Government, this role must be filled by someone with appropriate professional expertise and not by someone coming from within a Department. We do not need to reinvent the wheel, however. Retaining and improving the panel system would provide more effective reform and would address the actual issues that have resulted in the lack of public confidence that exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">However, the board should be extended to include environmental organisations and organisations representing citizen and community interests. This combined with an open and transparent interview process of public competition would create a hybrid system that takes the best of both the panel system and the open, transparent and competitive public application process.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> We welcome the fact the Government has removed air space from the definition of foreshore. Nonetheless, serious problems remain with the Foreshore Act 1933, specifically the licensing regime that is not fit for purpose. However, I will raise these concerns and provide more technical comments when tabling amendments on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> The Minister said he will bring forward an amendment to the Cabinet that would introduce other amendments to the Bill that are related to social housing. We will look favourably on anything that accelerates the delivery of social and affordable housing, however, Members have not seen nor been briefed on these amendments. Given the extent of the emergency we are facing, I urge him to publish the amendments on social housing either today or tomorrow and to provide a briefing on them by tomorrow at the latest.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> We want to work with the Government and the Minister to provide social and affordable homes, but introducing complex last-minute legislation intended to amend planning and procurement processes is a huge cause for concern. It disrespects the Legislature and the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

        <speech by="#RebeccaMoynihan" eId="spk_70">
          <from>Senator Rebecca Moynihan<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_285">I am deeply concerned about the attempt to rush through this last-minute planning legislation. The repeated disregard for the importance of legislative scrutiny and the not giving of time to consider complex Bills, such as this, is becoming a dangerous habit. It is not the first time the Minister has attempted to rush a Bill through the House before the recess. The Planning and Development, Maritime, and Valuation (Amendment) Act 2022, which was pushed through the Houses before July, included controversial amendments the Minister had to subsequently withdraw. Substantially and more importantly, before the Christmas recess of 2016, the Minister's predecessor pushed through the mess that is strategic housing development, SHD, which was supposed to speed up housing delivery, and we have all been dealing with the consequences of this decision to rush legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> We will not be voting in favour of this Bill because we do not agree with unilaterally pushing through reforms, such as these, in an information vacuum. For example, we have not even seen the Farrell report on An Bord Pleanála. While I understand the reasons and rationale for this, as it involves legal issues, a full and comprehensive reform of An Bord Pleanála or the provision of a best-practice planning authorities is needed. The public has clearly lost faith in the planning process. The SHD process was introduced in December 2016 and most people do not know what the planning authority is going to do. We are in chaos with it. On Committee Stage, the Labour Party will propose that any reforms introduced now will include a sunset clause. This would allow the proper functioning of the board for the coming months and we could take on board the points made about the chairperson. That should be done on the basis of wider reform of our planning system and wider consolidation of our overly complex planning laws, as well as reform of An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> I refer to social housing amendments. Similar to the SHD process, we have to be careful that we do not hand over powers that are supposedly intended to speed up housing delivery but which, in fact, delay it because the process does not stand up to legal challenge. That is an important point. We are being asked to vote on something that we have not seen and that will come through at a later stage by way of an amendment that has not yet been drafted. We in the Seanad will not get the opportunity to submit amendments in the full knowledge of what is there and what will be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> We welcome the Government's commitment to social and affordable housing and to the speeding up of delivery, however, it must be done in a timely fashion and perhaps by way of a stand-alone Bill after Christmas. It is our understanding, following legal advice, that something such as this must constitute an emergency. In order for an environmental impact assessment, EIA, and an appropriate assessment, AA, to be waived that has to be demonstrated. I can certainly see circumstances where that may be allowable and may stand up to legal challenge, but we do not know this because we have not seen the amendments. Governments may say it will introduce reforms, such as the SHD process, to speed up housing delivery, but it actually delays housing delivery because so much of it gets bogged down. If we are sincere about cleaning up the mess of planning rules in Ireland, we ought to introduce a consolidated, omnibus Bill on planning reform in 2023 that is well thought out, subject to proper legislative scrutiny, has proper feedback from all the different players involved, and where sufficient time and information is provided to consider it.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> Even if the Bill were perfect, we still believe every Bill should be assessed properly by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. In addition, outside bodies and environmental groups should be allowed time to consider it. Unfortunately, the Bill is far from perfect, and our concerns lie where any independence of An Bord Pleanála or a reformed planning body would be sacrificed.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> As it stands, the Bill proposes to provide the Minister with unchecked powers over changes to the size of the board and its appointment of ordinary members. While there is an argument to be made to increase the number of board members, we have significant concerns about the ministerial or, in fact, the departmental power grab of such a provision. It is unclear what the committee or panel meant to advise on appointments, as set out in the general scheme, and whether it is mandatory or if their recommendations are binding, or merely advisory for the Minister. There is concern that this is an alternative attempt to give control of the foreshore to vested industries, as happened when a controversial amendment that allowed a new regulatory body to sell off State-owned portions of the foreshore, without Oireachtas oversight, was withdrawn by the Minister during the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> We are growing too accustomed to last-minute rushed legislation on this area. This caused things to become bogged down in the courts. There is a lack of clarity from professionals, lawyers and people involved in this area. There must be separate social housing provision and if that were allowed, it could be introduced after January. We need proper, planned, considered reform of the planning authority and planning legislation.</p>

While the board is entitled to do that, it is happening all too often. That raises significant questions. Regarding the ring road in particular, before a decision was made by the High Court, An Bord Pleanála conceded that it had not taken into consideration the climate action plan. It has specific obligations as a relevant body under the climate Act. It was aware of those obligations for some time before this decision was made. It is beyond time and it is correct that the Minister is taking urgent steps to reform An Bord Pleanála. In this way, the Minister is doing that in a number of ways such as increasing the size and ensuring that the quorum could not be reduced; they are worthy and important pieces of the legislation. It is also important to point out, which I think the Minister did in his speech, that there is no way we are not going to see EIAs completed; that is simply not correct. It is important that the public understands that.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> People have concerns, one of which is that legislation could stop us from taking judicial reviews. It is important for the Minister to come back on that point because we want there to be no doubt but that we have the ability to take judicial reviews. As I have been forthright that I would back and support anybody who took a judicial review on the ring road in particular, I do not want to stand over that. We have urgent renewable energy targets that we must meet. In some instances, however, applications for foreshore licences are taking up to 20 months whereas in Britain, it takes 15 to 20 weeks. We are completely out of step and because of that, it means we cannot compete. It is a competition at the moment to get renewable energy companies investing in Ireland and off our shores. We can do all we like with the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, but if we cannot speed up the foreshore licence element, we will still be in difficulty. Therefore, it has to be done. There is a concern in the industry, of which I am sure the Minister is aware, that there also may be issues around the elements introducing this Act on the foreshore. Will the Minister comment now or on Thursday about the concerns expressed by the industry? We must ensure that we do all we can to protect the marine environment. I hope that is what this Bill will do. There are plenty of opportunities for the Minister's Department to look at it and come back with amendments; it is not going to be completed this week or by Christmas. It is going to go to the Dáil after Christmas. At that point, from what I understand, if what we are hearing is correct, there will be Government amendments in any case, which means there is an opportunity, if it is felt amendments are needed, for other amendments. If there are Government amendments, it will have to come back to the Seanad following that. Those are all the stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> There were concerns around the speed of this going through. It was unfortunate that pre-legislative scrutiny was not completed until today or published until today. It is important to take the time now to make sure that everything that was submitted during the pre-legislative scrutiny stage is looked at properly by the Department. Fundamentally, however, we have to see these kinds of reforms, particularly in the make-up of An Bord Pleanála, if we are to see significant changes in how the board carries out its functions. It is not just about the delays, it is about decisions which are highly questionable, when the board itself admits it did not take into consideration key legislation and key elements of Government plans.</p>

          <from>Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Darragh O'Brien)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_302">I thank the Senators for their thoughtful contributions today. To put this in context, it is about urgent interim measures regarding An Bord Pleanála. Senator Moynihan and other Senators raised issues about the need for a consolidated planning Bill; we are doing that. We are bringing forward consolidated planning legislation, which I intend to bring to Cabinet on 13 December. It is the culmination of about 15 months of work looking at the various issues regarding planning since the Planning and Development Act 2000 and bringing that into a consolidated item of legislation. Should it get Cabinet approval, we will publish the Bill, hopefully in advance of Christmas, and that would then go to pre-legislative scrutiny early in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> On Senator Pauline O'Reilly's point, that other legislation leaves it open for changes to be made that people may wish to see in that legislation. I hope, with the agreement of both Houses, that the consolidated legislation will pass by the end of the first quarter next year. We are implementing this Bill now because at present, there are five members of An Bord Pleanála; there is effectively no chairperson and there have been a number of highly critical reports that are not in the public domain for legal reasons. It is important that people see the content of them once the legal process is concluded; I have had said that publicly. The existing Act provides for the appointment of interim board members and we need to do that but the Minister cannot appoint a chairperson under the existing legislation right now. A deputy chair needs to be in place, which I have moved, to a point, but this Bill will give the deputy chairperson the powers of an interim chairperson. A director of planning that can allocate files to people is also needed. A big part of this Bill is making sure that the board can function right now at board level. Many Senators, such as Senators Cummins, Boyhan, Fitzpatrick and others have called for a transparent appointment process within An Bord Pleanála and that is what this Bill, once enacted, will bring forward. There will be a clear, transparent public appointment system through an expert panel that will advise the Minister. The current panel system is archaic and is not fit for purpose. By passing this legislation, we will reform that system and create a modern planning system for a modern Ireland. The measures we are taking in this Bill mean that we can bring the capacity of An Bord Pleanála in terms of board members up to what is needed, that is, up to 14 or 15 board members. We need that number to carry out the work that is there.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> Senators have raised the issue, rightly so, of resourcing of the board. With Government colleagues, I approved 24 additional posts through the board earlier this year and more are being appointed now. We are looking at the workforce plan. We have also got agreement that there will be a director of legal affairs sitting on the board, which we want.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">We are moving forward right now, including with the advertisement for the marine planning expert to underpin what we want to do for our maritime area, around protecting and enhancing its biodiversity and restoring some the lost biodiversity and also harnessing the offshore renewable capacity and doing so in the right way. That is why the Seanad, although not with the agreement of all parties, passed the Maritime Area Planning Act to ensure that we tidy up and making it more efficient particularly around granting marine area consents for foreshore.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> Senators Cummins and Pauline O'Reilly mentioned concerns that may have been raised by the wind energy sector. All we are doing with the foreshore amendments is clarifying an issue that came up in the summer. It is to ensure that it is dealt with and that it is very clear that the column of water above it is covered under the Act. That was raised with us and we were asked to deal with it. There are no further changes to it but people will know that once MARA is established, which I intend will happen in the first month of next year, where we have the board in place and will have a chief executive in place, then the marine area consents will be done through it. There will be a streamlined process. Senator O'Reilly rightly mentioned the difference between how long it takes to provide consents in Ireland compared with our nearest neighbour and that is not sustainable. As a country, we either want to be able to move forward in an efficient but respectful way, respecting our marine environment, with the offshore renewables or we do not. That is why the Maritime Area Planning Act is important. I thought we would get that through the Houses without dissent but we did not. There are people who say they want it but they do not want that legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> I have made a commitment to the Dáil that once we get approval at the Cabinet tomorrow on the amendments, which are about expediting the delivery of social and affordable housing on land that is already zoned and has already been identified by the local authority and is owned by a local authority or a State agency such as the HSE, that we will, of course, provide a briefing. That will form part of this Bill. I am doing that because I want it to be in place in January. A few weeks ago, people were calling for emergency measures. We have done emergency measures like the winter eviction ban but when we bring something forward that seeks to help that and address it, then people say they will not vote for something they have not seen. They will see that. I would say to Senator Moynihan that she will see the amendment in advance of voting for it. We will provide briefings on it too. We are very serious about using that amendment to ensure we can further step-up the delivery of social and affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> Senators Cummins and Fitzpatrick spoke about specifically focusing on using off-site construction, modular build. Some of the development land here has been in council ownership for decades but has not been developed. Everyone here will know schemes like that. The three parties in government have decided to provide a write-down of legacy debt on council lands, which councils hold but have been unable to develop, and we are tying that in with this. The State will write-down councils' debt if they bring forward schemes that we can start developing in 2023. It is responding directly to the housing need that we have right now.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> Every Senator and all parties and none will have an opportunity to support this Bill or not. I respect the different views people have but we are either serious about the situation right now or we are not. No one is gazumping pre-legislative scrutiny, by the way. I want to remind Senators that the measures here were approved by the Cabinet on 4 October and we sent it forward for pre-legislative scrutiny on 4 October. Early on, some detailed engagement happened. It was the pre-legislative scrutiny report that was outstanding. That is all. It was not as though there were no discussions or briefings. That all happened. Maybe we need to look at how the pre-legislative scrutiny system itself works. I believe completely in pre-legislative scrutiny but these are measures that we need to take now to make sure the board is operating at capacity. We should do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> I am trying to find the exact date when we sent it. On 4 October, the An Bord Pleanála reform agenda was agreed by the Cabinet and was then submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny which commenced on 10 November. Today is 6 December and it has been nearly two months. I am talking about legislation that was not that complex for those who read the Bill. We must also look at how long it takes to do pre-legislative scrutiny. Committees are busy. I really respect the work the joint committee has done on many things but we are looking at interim reform measures, which some of these measures are. The full reform agenda for An Bord Pleanála will be part of the consolidated planning Bill I will bring to the Cabinet on 13 December, which will come to the Seanad and the Dáil early next year after pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> I urge Senators to support the legislation in the spirit in which it has been asked. We have had to get the agreement of the Leader and the Seanad on this and I thank Members for having seen the urgency of the measures we need to bring forward. There will be further discussions on Thursday. I give a commitment. I am serious about delivering more social and affordable homes. This year this Government will deliver more social homes than have been delivered decades as well as affordable homes for purchase and rent for the first time in a generation and cost rental for the first time ever but I want to ramp that up. That is why we are bringing forward a time-bound measure to expedite planning for that particular cohort. It is about using modern methods of construction, which we will bring forward by way of an amendment on Thursday. I give a commitment that once the amendment has been approved by the Cabinet, we will provide a briefing on it in advance of Committee Stage on Thursday. I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate in a pretty constructive way.</p>

          <from>Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_317">Gabhaim buíochas le baill an tSeanaid agus an chuireadh a bheith ina dteannta. The National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2022 provides the basis to enable the continued provision of capital funding to the National Tourism Development authority, Fáilte Ireland, for the purpose of supporting tourism product development and the tourism industry</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Section 24(1) of the National Tourism Development Act 2003 gives the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance moneys provided by the Oireachtas to Fáilte Ireland. Section 24(2) limits the amount of money that can be advanced by the Minister to Fáilte Ireland for capital expenditure. Assuming the allocated funding in 2022 is drawn down by Fáilte Ireland, the current limit of €300 million will be reached close to the end of 2022. No further voted capital funding can then be advanced to Fáilte Ireland. Accordingly, I am bringing this Bill to the Houses of the Oireachtas to provide for the new spending limit of €500 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> Before giving further details of the Bill, I pay tribute to those who form part of the tourism ecosystem and make an important contribution to Ireland's overall economic performance. I particularly recognise the way in which the tourism industry reaches across the country and its importance for the regional economy. The contribution of tourism is not confined to directly generated employment, economic activity and exports. The sector has an important multiplier effect on other employment sectors such as agriculture, transport, retail, food and beverage, which are particularly important to regional economies. Apart from its economic value, tourism also plays an important role in promoting Ireland's image abroad and generating a positive impression of Irish people, our landscape and culture for visitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> Recent years have been challenging but I am confident that with all of those engaged with Irish tourism working together with the relevant agencies, Ministers and the Government, we can ensure the quality and competitiveness of the Irish tourist offering is continually improved and that the industry generates increased earnings and more jobs as part of our economic recovery. As with all industry, it is important that the tourism sector keeps innovating and developing in order to keep Ireland in the minds of potential travellers. In that regard, we know how important it is that brilliant visitor experiences, attractions and activities are available to visitors both international and domestic. As a significant proportion of tourists are drawn to attractions and participative experiences that bring local culture and heritage to life, Fáilte Ireland offers a range of supports to help tourism providers across the country to maximise their individual and collective offering in a way that attracts and engages tourists and enhances their overall experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> Ireland's tourism sector provides a wealth of opportunities for great offerings for visitors. In order to enhance those opportunities from a strategic perspective, Fáilte Ireland, broadly speaking, has four main funding channels for its capital investment in tourism product development. These are the large grants schemes provided under the platforms for growth approach, the small grants schemes, which are targeted schemes usually aligned with the tourism experience brands, strategic partnerships and other collaborations, and direct investment in experience brand infrastructure. In addition, part of Fáilte Ireland's capital funding programme uses platforms for growth to drive development in specific areas. The first platform for growth was launched in May 2019 and focused on developing immersive heritage and cultural attractions. These are attractions that appeal to overseas visitors looking for experiences that help them to connect with Ireland and bring the country's culture, heritage and people to life. Through this platform, Fáilte Ireland aims to ensure strong growth in development by investing in heritage and cultural attractions of scale that will motivate visitors to travel, either to and-or within Ireland, but without displacing the existing attractions of a destination or disturbing the competitiveness already attached to mature destinations. The overall objective is to deliver brilliant experiences that allow visitors to connect with Ireland and bring the national and local culture, heritage and people to life, while also delivering a greater regional and seasonal spread of tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> In April last year, €19 million worth of investment was announced for the second platforms for growth strategy, to be used to develop world-class facility centres at 20 locations across the country at which water-based activities are a key visitor attraction. This includes locations such as Tipperary, Sligo and Leitrim, to name but a few. These facilities, designed to serve as a hub in each locality from which multiple water sports operators can base themselves, will provide hot showers, changing and toilet facilities, secure storage, induction spaces, equipment wash-down and orientation points. They will be fully wheelchair accessible and built using sustainability best practice such as solar heating panels. This sustainable tourism investment scheme was developed in partnership between Fáilte Ireland and local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> In addition to funding provided under the platforms for growth approach to large grants schemes, Fáilte Ireland also provides further capital supports to tourism attractions and experiences in Ireland through other channels, including small grants schemes, strategic partnerships with other State bodies and some direct investments. The strategic partnerships include entities such as Waterways Ireland, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Rural and Community Development. Fáilte Ireland supports a wide range of projects. This year alone, these have included projects in the Céide Fields in Mayo, the Blasket Islands in Kerry, Knowth in Meath and the National Famine Museum in Strokestown. From a tourism perspective, Fáilte Ireland's investment of €3.9 million is one of the largest ever investments in a visitor attraction in Ireland's Hidden Heartlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> There is a knock-on impact on the local economy both in terms of employment in attractions such as the National Famine Museum in Roscommon and in the wider tourism sector and economy. Fáilte Ireland's capital investment in tourism product development is further enhanced by complementary programme supports, including for festivals and events, business supports and training, and marketing and promotions, which are aimed at enhancing, animating and promoting the overall visitor experience. The intention is to optimise key assets for the benefit of tourism and sustainable tourism development through increasing the geographic spread of visitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> My Department has initiated the development of a new national sustainable tourism policy that seeks to mainstream sustainability. The development of this new policy will involve extensive consultation with the tourism industry and our communities to help set out a path for the coming years to support a sustainable recovery and subsequent growth in the sector. The policy will seek to support sustainable development in communities throughout the country, while protecting our environment and natural resources and encouraging a greater spread of demand across the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> I will now deal with the purpose of the Bill. The National Tourism Development Authority Act was passed in 2003 to dissolve Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT Limited and establish the National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland. Section 24(1) of the Act gives the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance, out of money provided by the Oireachtas, such sums as the Minister may determine. Section 24(2) limits the total amount of money that can be advanced by the Minister to Fáilte Ireland as capital expenditure on projects or enterprises. However, annual funding allocations are made in the normal way through the Estimates and budgetary process. This limit on total capital funding was originally set at €65 million but was later increased to €150 million and then €300 million under the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Acts 2011 and 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> Taking into account the 2022 capital allocation to Fáilte Ireland, investment in tourism capital projects is now approaching that limit. Once the spending limit has been reached, no further voted capital moneys may be advanced to Fáilte Ireland for tourism capital investment projects. Accordingly, it is now prudent to legislate for an increase in the limit. Is trí eispéiris agus áiteanna turasóireachta a fhorbairt gur féidir linn tairbhe a bhaint as an bhfás domhanda sa turasóireacht agus a chinntiú go bhfaigheann Éire, agus gach réigiún di, a sciar de na buntáistí a chuireann turasóireacht ar fáil go sóisialta agus go heacnamaíoch.

Cuirfidh an Bille seo ar chumas an fhorbairt seo leanúint ar aghaidh. I am introducing this Bill to make the necessary legislative change and I commend it to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#VincentPMartin" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Senator Vincent P. Martin<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_328">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach. The Bill is technical in substance and quite straightforward. Its main purpose is to permit the Minister to increase the aggregate level of advances that can be made to the National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland, out of capital moneys approved by the Oireachtas. This funding is of use in supporting enterprises and projects related to the development of tourist traffic and tourism facilities and services.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> Tourism is a hugely important indigenous and labour-intensive sector that generates substantial export earnings and tax revenues. Apart from its economic value, tourism also plays an important role in promoting Ireland's image abroad and generating a positive impression of Irish people and our landscape and culture for visitors, which no doubt plays a big part in attracting tourists. Fáilte Ireland has used the platforms for growth strategy to drive development in specific areas. For example, using funding provided by the Government, Fáilte Ireland has provided €90 million to 20 locations throughout the country for water-based activities, which are key visitor attractions.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> In respect of sustainable tourism, Ireland's commitment to pursue a climate-neutral economy will help us to realise our ambition to be among the world's leaders in sustainable tourism. The Minister has initiated the development of a new tourism policy that seeks to mainstream sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">It will seek to support sustainable development in communities while protecting our environment and natural resources with a greater spread of demand across the full year. In addition, the creation of an all-Ireland walkways development plan to establish long-distance off-road walking and cycling routes as well as to promote sustainable outdoor adventure and tourism and develop food trades, to name but two examples, will build on our reputation of high-quality produce, which is renowned throughout the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> I think of how the roll-out of supports would really help my home county of Kildare. Our walkways and canals are second to none. We have three racecourses in County Kildare as well as the Irish National Stud and Gardens. We have huge potential, which is largely untapped, to reach a global audience by celebrating our patron saint, Saint Brigid. We have our forests and bogs. Now, of late, we can add Féile Liam O'Flynn, the annual music festival in Kill and Naas, which celebrates the legacy of Liam O'Flynn but also the legacy and celebration of music in County Kildare. That has reached a national audience and it is hoped it will reach an international one in the years to come. That is just one microcosm of an example in my own county. I am sure other counties have that rich bank of heritage and tourism potential and attractions. I welcome, support and commend the Bill on Second Stage.</p>

          <from>Senator Sharon Keogan<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_333">The Minister is very welcome. I understand the need for this Bill but I wonder how much difference this funding will make when it comes to solving the problems facing tourism in Ireland. It seems the biggest barrier facing the future of tourism in this country is hotels. The Irish Hotels Federation warned that a return to the 9% VAT rate may be needed as the hospitality industry faces very turbulent times, with forward bookings from Britain and continental Europe running below 2019 levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> The contracting of hotels for use as emergency accommodation by Ukrainians has created unprecedented levels of hotel scarcity in the country's top tourist destinations, as attested to by the chief executive of Fáilte Ireland, Mr. Paul Kelly. A breakdown of the contracts awarded by the State reveals deals worth €337 million with 270 hotels and bed and breakfast accommodations between April and September this year. A spokesperson for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth said the actual figure is far higher because of the deals awarded in the last quarter of 2022, details of which would not be released until January 2023. Tourism hot spots such as counties Kerry, Donegal, Clare, Cork and Galway have a significant number of hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in use by the State, with contracts ranging from €20,000 to €12.5 million. From late November to the end of the year, the Government plans to take in 11,000 more Ukrainians, bringing the total to 72,000 alongside more than 17,000 persons who have arrived here this year seeking international protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> Contracts for 360 of the 500 hotels in contracts with the State are up for renewal this month, and the Department is expecting the majority to extend their deals. The Irish Tourism Industry Confederation said "nearly one in every four tourist accommodation bedrooms is currently being used to fulfil Government contracts and the number seems to ... [be growing week by week]". Hoteliers and hostel owners accommodating more than 1,000 Ukrainian refugees are owed millions by the State. Many have not been paid in three months and are threatening to kick their guests out onto the streets unless this issue is resolved soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> Last month, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which is responsible for housing the Ukrainians, nearly all of whom are women and children, admitted to difficulties in paying people and expressed regret. One hotel owner expressed how he was owed more than €1 million. He is housing between 100 to 200 refugees and is feeding them every day. He had to borrow money from the bank so he could keep the Ukrainians on his premises. A Department spokesperson said more than 650 contractors are providing accommodation for Ukrainian beneficiaries of temporary protection for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. The Government admitted that some providers are still waiting for payments due to a backlog but said the additional staff had been allocated to process payments to hotels as soon as possible. Really, this is the elephant in the room when it comes to tourism. How is it going to be dealt with? How does one resolve this? I sense modular homes might be involved in the solution. Where will we put these? What supporting infrastructure will be put in place around them? How will this Government manage to make it sustainable? These are the questions that need to be answered. Will the Minister provide any updates on this?</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> There are also energy costs for hotels, restaurants and businesses, and the tax warehousing will be up by the end of this year. Many of those businesses may just close their doors next year. There are many issues affecting our tourism trade before the end of this year that the Minister might need to address very quickly in 2023.</p>

          <from>Senator Shane Cassells<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_338">I thank the Minister for bringing forward the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2022. I commend her on using her Second Stage speech to set out in detail the ecosystem of the tourism industry and explain why this Bill and the increase in extending the limit of capital expenditure is so critical and why it will make a major difference. That capital investment broadens our appeal as a destination. People who are spending their money in this sphere want quality. We must ensure the nature of the offer that is put forward is of the highest quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> From our work as members of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, we see the benefits across the board at a national level, not just economically but socially and culturally. In terms of that capital investment, being from County Meath, I see a substantial part of that expenditure by Fáilte Ireland in my county around the heritage offering to our international and, most importantly, our domestic tourists, who, maybe because of staycations in recent years, are appreciating the heritage offer on their doorstep. On that doorstep is a wealth of internationally rated heritage sites in which Fáilte Ireland has invested in the past year. I commend it and the Minister on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> The Minister touched on some of those sites in her speech, in particular the investment at Brú na Bóinne. Everyone knows of Newgrange but, as a child growing up in County Meath, I always found Knowth a more interesting site to explore. Fáilte Ireland, working with its partners in the Office of Public Works and the Minister, has now invested €5.5 million in the Brú na Bóinne site. This year, it invested almost €1.4 million in the new tourist attraction at Knowth. That is greatly significant for the broader attraction of the whole Brú na Bóinne area, reimagining that Boyne Valley drive to connect the historic points that exist in County Meath and making sure more international and domestic visitors come. That Boyne Valley drive is being reimagined from a point-to-point journey between some of Ireland's most important and compelling heritage sites to a wider immersive visitor proposition that becomes a 5,000 year journey through time.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> One of the big initiatives launched this year by Fáilte Ireland in conjunction with Meath County Council and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media was the Trim destination town, on which nearly €500,000 was spent. I was delighted to be there with members of Meath County Council, Fáilte Ireland, and Councillor Aisling Dempsey, our chairperson from that region, on the Porch Field project, which will provide outdoor performance spaces in County Meath. It will use that natural heritage in our town of Trim and the carefully chosen spectacular views of the River Boyne beside Newtown and Trim Castle as a backdrop to the performance area. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> In conjunction with that we have the Púca Festival, which is an international festival celebrating our heritage in terms of Hallowe'en and the ancient tradition of Samhain over 2,000 years. This three-day vibrant and contemporary festival in places like Trim, Athboy and Ráth Chairn is supported by Fáilte Ireland to make sure our centre of County Meath is highlighted on an international stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> Finally, one of the big and really significant projects being invested in is the Boyne greenway and navigation restoration scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">This would link the heritage towns of Navan and Drogheda and use the national heritage there. It would also bring places like Slane Castle and the international visitor centre that will be happening there into play. Fáilte Ireland and the Minister are working with partners on that multimillion euro investment. Work to date has included identification and topographical studies, surveys and constraint identifications of the area because of the sensitivities involved. That will be a game changer for the towns of Navan and Drogheda. When we talk about capital investment and allowing the thresholds to increase, these are the examples where real and significant change is happening because of investment by Fáilte Ireland and the Minister in a heritage county like Meath. It will make sure that, in a county where I started out as a public representative 24 years ago and was lucky to be a member of the board of Meath tourism, we were way down the rankings as a tourist destination in Ireland. As a result of investment like this, we have grown steadily by using what is on our doorstep, namely, our heritage. We have risen up the rankings as a result of that investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> I commend the Minister and Fáilte Ireland. I look forward to the Bill progressing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichealCarrigy" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Senator Micheál Carrigy<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_346">The Minister is welcome. I also commend and fully support the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> Tourism has been one of the major success stories in the country with significant investment being made. It is important that we insulate and nurture it because the figures seem to be going in the right direction but we have to make sure that continues. We have so many things going positively for tourism, but there are also some negatives. Around each corner there are many beautiful amenities. In the midlands, where I come from, we have the Hidden Heartlands brand, The latter showcases our natural environment, scenery, culture, history, dance and music. I was involved with former Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran in having the Hidden Heartlands brand developed. There was a certain level of resistance from Fáilte Ireland to add another brand to its offering. When it looked into the and carried out feasibility studies, however, it found that it was what people were looking for. People want slow and easy tourism in the natural environment among our lakes, waterways and rivers. Those are things we have plenty of. We have the development of the Royal Canal, which has been completed from Cloondara on the River Shannon right up to Maynooth. Ultimately, the plan is to redevelop it all the way from Maynooth right up to Spencer Dock. When I was a member of Longford County Council - and I am still involved with Longford tourism - we had plans to try to connect with the western greenway in order that there would be an off-road walkway the entire way from Dublin to Achill Island.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> The Minister mentioned Platforms for Growth. I was disappointed because we had a submission in last year for a project on the former Army barracks site in Longford, which made it to the last 11, but, unfortunately, which was not one that was picked. We have lots of fantastic initiatives that have been supported by Government, however, including the Knights and Conquest Heritage Centre in north Longford, which is in receipt of over €3 million, between rural regeneration and Fáilte Ireland funding, to develop a project on the site of the highest moat in Ireland. We also have the Maria Edgeworth Centre in Edgeworthstown and we have Corlea Trackway Visitor Centre. A great deal of investment has gone into a county that has had the lowest tourist numbers for many years. The development of the Hidden Heartlands brand has given us an opportunity to showcase what we have. Centre Parcs brought an investment of more than €230 million to the county, with an extra €90 million to be invested with the additional planning application it put in to increase the number of lodges on-site. Ultimately, this will bring the number of visitors to County Longford each week up to more than 3,500. It is up to Longford County Council and its tourism group to make sure that they show what we have and that people will stay and visit other sites in the county so we will get the benefit of that. I want to put on record my thanks to the Hidden Heartlands team, led by Paddy Matthews. They have done a fantastic amount of work. Post Covid, that team will drive those figures up and increase the tourist numbers coming into the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> There are risks to the industry too. We have skill shortages, a lack of hotel accommodation and increased costs due to the economic uncertainty. Government has put in place the scheme for high additional energy costs, which was only opened in the last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> I recently met the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to discuss skills shortages.. While great strides have been made under the apprenticeship scheme, we need to do more. We have seen the opening in the Cathaoirleach's county of Kerry of a tourism and hospitality link with the college of further education there. Another such college needs to be opened in the midlands. We even have the ideal site at the Connolly Barracks site in our county, next door to the college of further education, where we could develop a college of culinary excellence in tandem with courses in tourism and hospitality. In so doing, we could make sure we service the tourism and hospitality industry with people who are qualified and make sure that people look on it as a good career. The Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media has been hearing that all businesses are struggling to get employees, so that is something that needs to be looked at. I spoke with Tús, the Longford and Westmeath Education and Training Board, the local authority, the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and Centre Parcs about this matter. Everyone knows that this needs to be done; we just need to make it happen. I would welcome any support from the Minister on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> Tourism was a success story after the recession. We built it up to provide over 260,000 jobs in our economy. We need to continue to support it. We heard anecdotal evidence that the numbers will be down next year. I am not an opponent of the 9% VAT rate; that needs to be kept for another year. I ask that this be considered. We also have to take a serious look at hotel accommodation. There are certain towns, including my county town, where if you want to get a hotel bed, you cannot do so. That needs to be looked at. I know we have a situation whereby we have to provide support, but we also need to have a maximum percentage limit on the number of beds that can be taken up by the State in order to have at least a certain number of beds available for the tourism industry or for people coming into a town. I ask that this be considered. There has been a lot of negativity towards hotels because a small number of them engaged in price gouging. However, many did not do so. I know that from experience. I went west to Enniscrone during the summer, in August, and had a three-night break for under €700 for a family of five. That was quite reasonable. We should not knock the entire industry for what a small number of hotels did, but we need to look at the availability of rooms if we want our tourism industry to continue next year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FintanWarfield" eId="spk_90">
          <from>Senator Fintan Warfield<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_352">I welcome the Minister. This short and technical Bill will provide the statutory basis to allow the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to increase the aggregate level of funding that will be made available to Fáilte Ireland. As has been said, the current ceiling is €300 million and the Bill will see it increase to €500 million. Sinn Féin will support the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> I have said in the past that our heritage projects and communities that save and protect our heritage should never have to justify their heritage on the basis of visitor numbers. When Fine Gael was alone in government for many years, the Heritage Council lingered without its funding being restored during the period of austerity. A very Fine Gael-like approach to heritage was that communities would have to justify their heritage projects. This was because Fáilte Ireland was the only State agency funding heritage on the basis of visitor numbers and tourism offering. That is problematic because heritage is extremely important to our country and to communities that protect and save it.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> Tourism is Ireland's biggest indigenous industry. Hundreds of thousands of people are employed in tourism. It is especially important along the west coast and in the midlands. Fáilte Ireland is integral to that. It has played a central role in the development of tourism and its work should be commended. It would not be possible, however, to speak about tourism without referencing the pandemic and the resultant restrictions. The years 2020, 2021 and 2022 were among the most difficult ones for the industry and as we know, the industry was the first to close and the last to reopen.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Despite Government funding for wages and overheads, it was a very difficult time for the industry. We emerged from the crisis and went straight into the cost-of-living and energy crises. Some parts of the sector, especially restaurants, face a very difficult winter. Some will have warehouse debt to deal with, along with energy bills and difficulties with recruitment. This is before they contend with staff shortages due to the large number of workers who left the sector during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> We all know that hotels, especially those in our cities, engaged in significant price gouging during the summer months this year. However, it is important to recognise that this is a very wide-ranging industry and that different sections will have different experiences. The actions of some hoteliers should not be allowed to tarnish the entire industry. We must not punish one section of the industry for the actions of another. Despite various Ministers having commented on the VAT rate for the industry, it is, in Sinn Féin's view, possible under European law to apply different tax rates to different sections of the tourism and hospitality sector. Hotels could have one tax rate and other tourist attractions or restaurants could have another. We need to consider this seriously. I ask the Minister to investigate that further. We cannot continue to allow price gouging to go unchecked. A failure to act would only add to the reputational damage that has affected Irish tourism recently and allow the actions of a small minority to have an impact on the industry as a whole. We need to act now before businesses' livelihoods and reputations are damaged beyond repair.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> Another issue that needs to be addressed is the pay and conditions of workers in the industry. I, like others, have mentioned this at meetings of the joint committee. We have written a report on this matter that is due to be published soon. We held hearings that exposed some outrageous behaviour by certain parts of the sector, with hospitality workers being treated terribly, abused, overworked and underpaid. There was much talk last year about staffing crises in the sector. It should come as no surprise that retention is such a struggle in the industry when one sees how poor conditions are in some places. I urge the Minister to get involved. It is not right that industry lobby groups, but not workers, would be represented. I hope the Minister will bat for ordinary workers in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> I hope the Minister will consider taking responsibility for this in her own Department and consider the report that our committee has compiled. Some very serious issues were raised in the report. Unless action is taken, the situation will remain the same and the industry will suffer from constant staff recruitment and retention problems. Sinn Féin will support the Bill; however, I ask the Minister to consider the pay and conditions of those who work in the industry. I probably do not need to tell her that heritage should not have to be justified on the basis of visitor numbers and the tourism offering; it is important in its own right. The Heritage Council has an important role in that regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarkWall" eId="spk_91">
          <from>Senator Mark Wall<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_359">I, too, welcome the Minister to the House and the chance to speak about this Bill. It is a relatively short technical Bill that will provide a statutory basis to allow an increase in funding to Fáilte Ireland. The current ceiling is set at €300 million and the Bill will see that increase to €500 million. The Labour Party will, of course, support the Bill, as it did in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> There can be little doubt that the Irish tourism industry has gone through a devastating time in the past two years or so. However, every attempt must be made by the Government and sector to rebuild this powerful industry, ensuring it provides sustainable pay and employment throughout the sector while developing our tourism offering across the State. As colleagues have said, it is clear from having spoken to many in the sector over the past two years that the recruitment and retention of staff has been identified as a major challenge as we come out of Covid. I have previously raised the need for a comprehensive review of how we train staff in the sector. We must use, expand and develop the various courses provided by our technical colleges and universities. I am aware this is an area on which both Fáilte Ireland and the Minister have engaged, and I am also aware it is one that many in the industry would like continued support with. Many I have spoken to want to invest, and reinvest, in rebuilding their tourism offering and developing their excellent hospitality; however, many recognise that, without properly trained staff, this will be very difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> The opportunity presented by this Bill allows me to speak about the terrific tourism and hospitality offering in my county, Kildare. I am sure the Minister and her office will be aware of the forthcoming tourism offering in Kildare, Brigid 1500. Brigid 1500 is a programme of national and international events and initiatives to celebrate and commemorate St. Brigid – the woman, the life and legacy. Launched very recently at St. Brigid's Cathedral, Kildare town, Brigid 1500 will culminate in 2024, when many experts agree marks the 1,500th anniversary of the death of St. Brigid. Thus, St. Brigid's Day, 1 February 2024, will be a key date in the programme. The main aim of Brigid 1500 is to create a meaningful cultural and societal legacy that appeals to a diverse contemporary audience. The project is being delivered by Kildare County Council and supported by a steering committee of leading experts across the fields of arts and culture, academia, tourism, industry, spirituality and faith, community education and much more. The Minister's ongoing support for this very important initiative for County Kildare will, as always, be appreciated.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> Our close ties with St. Brigid are not the only attraction we can offer to potential tourists in the short grass county. The developing equine tourism offering in Kildare needs to be supported in every way. The linking of Tipperary and Kildare as a tourism offering is something I have discussed with my colleague, Deputy Kelly, since I attended the launch at the Irish National Stud. The Irish National Stud is, of course, a magnificent and expanding jewel in the crown of the tourism offering in County Kildare.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> My home town, Athy, is currently developing two terrific tourism offerings that I know the Minister will continue to support. The Barrow blueway is due to open next year, offering a tourism and recreation attraction extending 47 km all the way from the beautiful town of Athy, through the spectacular landscape of south Kildare, to the picturesque village of Robertstown. Many cannot wait for its opening. It is already attracting tourists, not only from Ireland but also from many other European countries. Indeed, I met a couple from Holland on the tourist trail only this weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> The development of the Shackleton Museum in the town will create a world-class attraction celebrating the life of the world-famous explorer and exposing the town and rest of south Kildare to many new tourism markets that we all hope will create much-needed employment and opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> There are many parts of this country, such as rural south Kildare, that will not see the major manufacturing outlets that are more likely to locate in large urban areas. The potential for tourism and employment and other opportunities that can be realised in these areas must be maximised, developed and, most important, supported. As such, we welcome this legislation. I look forward to working with the Minister on these important projects as they are rolled out in the coming years.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">I thank the Minister. I very much welcome this Bill and the increased availability of capital. I worked for Fáilte Ireland. It was my client when I worked in advertising and marketing. I was part of the team that started the process of marketing home holidays with the Right Here, Right Now and The Fun Starts Here campaigns, so I recognise the multiplier effect and how much our tourism proposition has changed over the years. It is not just about attractions but also about experiences and packaging them in light of the unique selling points that Ireland has to offer. The domestic market is important. After Covid, the local market has been also.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Over the past couple of years, there has been capital expenditure on larger projects such as Westport House. I wish to signpost places such as Dunsink Observatory, Dublin 15. The Liffey valley is another potential tourism project in Dublin 15 that should be considered. Fingal has its own marketing proposition but the whole area of Dublin 15, stretching from the starting point of the Phoenix Park, has much potential. As the Minister says, one could have strategic partnerships and collaborations involving the likes of cycling and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. We had our own time zone in Ireland at one stage and Dunsink Observatory was at the meridian line. There is much potential in Dublin 15 that I would urge the Minister's team to look in that direction.</p>

          <p eId="para_369">I thank the Minister for being here today, and particularly for mentioning the National Famine Museum in Strokestown Park. It is an amazing facility. Over €3 million in funding has been granted to the museum and the Minister was there at the opening of it. I like the joined-up thinking between Departments. Strokestown has also benefited from Town Centre First investment and the €200 million investment in the N5 Ballaghaderreen to Scramogue road project, which will bring more visitors to the region and will also take the heavy traffic out of the middle of the town. Christmas markets were on in Strokestown last week and the place was absolutely hopping. It is great to see it.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> I want to focus on how we can increase accommodation capacity in these regions. One can travel long distances in many rural areas and there is no access to accommodation capacity for tourists to stay in the region. It is enough to bring them there, but we would like them to stay and to enjoy what we have to offer in the west of Ireland. In Ballinasloe we are very fortunate to have the new investment coming with the Dublin to Galway cycleway. That will bring more visitors to the area, which will be a benefit to our communities. I ask the Minister to comment on how we can maximise the potential that this groundbreaking piece of infrastructure will bring in the next three to five years. </p>
          <p eId="para_371"> Last Sunday I was invited to go on a battlefield walk in Aughrim, which is a few miles outside Ballinasloe. As we know, the battle of Aughrim was fought in 1691 and changed the history of Ireland and Europe. We need more investment. Currently, the site is owned by Galway County Council. It would be great to look at opportunities for how Fáilte Ireland might support the development that particular site for tourism. </p>

          <p eId="para_372">Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí go léir a labhair sa díospóireacht seo agus a chuir a dtuairimí faoi fhorbairt earnáil turasóireachta na hÉireann in iúl. It is proof of the importance of the tourism industry, which reaches into all parts of the country, rural and urban, and is a valued source of employment for many thousands of people in Ireland. In the time given to me, I will try to address some of the issues raised today. If I do not get back to Senators, I will ask my officials to follow up with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> Some Senators raised concerns about hotel accommodation. I wish to point out, firstly, that since Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine in February of this year, more than 65,000 people who have been forced to leave their homes in the most horrific circumstances have sought refuge here. Approximately 50,000 of them are being provided with accommodation by the State. It is by far the largest humanitarian operation ever undertaken by the Irish State. Tourism accommodation has played a vital part in this national response. I should highlight, at the outset, that tourism accommodation should be seen as a short-term solution not just for the tourism industry but also for the families who reside in those hotels. It cannot be seen as a long-term solution. I recognise the growing concern among the wider tourism industry and sectoral bodies for the 2023 season. As we know, St. Patrick's day kicks off the peak season, although Senator Wall might argue that St. Brigid's day will mark the start of the season. I am aware that the contracting of tour group accommodation is significantly down on normal levels, and of the potential knock-on effect that the lack of availability of tourism accommodation could have on the wider tourism economy. Officials from my Department have communicated these concerns to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and I know that the Department is working urgently across Government with agencies, NGOs and local authorities to bring new accommodation on stream. I am aware that alternative modular housing will come on stream from January, with a number of sites in place. Allied to that is the increase in the monthly recognition payment to €800, effective from 1 December. The local authorities have launched a new initiative, appealing to those who have unoccupied properties to offer them as temporary homes for those fleeing the war in Ukraine. Senators will be aware that the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation has published a report outlining the consequences of an overdependence on tourism accommodation stock and its proposed policy recommendations. I met with representatives of the confederation last week to discuss this issue in particular and the report. My officials have also highlighted the recommendations of the report at the meetings of the senior officials group that is engaged in the humanitarian accommodation effort. At all times, we remain resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine. We are honouring our commitment to help people who have been displaced by this horrendous war. </p>
          <p eId="para_374"> A number of Senators raised the issue of VAT. Obviously, the responsibility for VAT lies with the Minister for Finance. When the 9% VAT rate was introduced, it was initially planned to be for a period of 14 months. The rate was then extended for another eight months to 31 August 2022, and extended again to 28 February 2023. The Minister for Finance stated, on budget day, that he was not going to extend the lower rate of VAT beyond 28 February. I really believe, given the uncertainty ahead, that we must remain vigilant and we must keep reviewing the situation in case there are any downturns in the recovery in the coming months. We will keep that under review after Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> The issues of the recruitment, training, development and conditions of staff were raised by a number of Senators. The recruitment and retention of staff continues to be a significant challenge for the tourism sector not just in Ireland, but in many countries around the world. Prior to Covid, the sector had registered consistent increases in the numbers employed in Ireland's regions, and was an important driver of greater regional balance and dispersed economic activity. A sustained and sustainable rebuild is essential, as tourism supports communities and drives regional development in a manner unlike other sectors. I have worked with colleagues across Government to secure funding supports to keep the tourism sector alive during Covid, and to support the initial rebuild phase in 2022 and beyond. My Department participates in the tourism and hospitality careers oversight group, which brings together industry representatives, State agencies, Government Departments and the education sector. My Department and Fáilte Ireland are also working with industry and across Government Departments to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages in the sector across all roles. </p>
          <p eId="para_376"> With regard to the working conditions in the sector, Fáilte Ireland's research indicated that 70% of people within the sector see tourism as a long-term career option. While this is a good proportion, Fáilte Ireland has arranged programmes to build skills and capability for businesses and individual employees, including a suite of online self-directed professional development courses. The number of vacancies across the industry has fallen, and is now estimated to be 22,000, down from the previously estimated 40,000. Around 70% of businesses that are recruiting are increasing pay and offering flexible work patterns, more stable work schedules and other perks such as compensation for working unsocial hours, which is becoming increasingly common. The research also shows that staff retention has become less difficult, with employers reporting improvements in day-to-day operations. As part of the drive to promote tourism as an attractive sector, Fáilte Ireland has risen to the challenge and has launched the new employer excellence programme to help all participating businesses to improve their employer practices and enhance their reputations as excellent employers. This will help employers to drive great employee engagement, build the appeal of the workplace and unlock greater levels of performance across businesses. Hopefully, this programme will also lead to greater retention of staff and improve the view of the industry as a career choice. </p>
          <p eId="para_377"> Senator Cassells spoke of the value of the Fáilte Ireland investment to date and the ongoing work in County Meath and south Louth. Senator Carrigy spoke of the development of hidden heartlands as a brand. It has been and is making a difference. I will ask my officials to communicate Senator Currie's suggestions on the potential of Dublin 15 to Fáilte Ireland . On Senator Ward's comments on St. Brigid's day, central to it will be Kildare County Council's plans which are being developed at present. Fáilte Ireland, through its Ireland's ancient east brand, is engaging with Kildare County Council to offer advice and support with promotion, particularly through Fáilte Ireland's Discover Ireland platforms. </p>
          <p eId="para_378"> Finally, to conclude, I would like to take the opportunity acknowledge the work of two tourism State agencies, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland. While this legislation does appear technical in nature, it has an important outcome in that that allows the continued funding of Fáilte Ireland's work in the area of tourism, the value of which Senators have commented on. We continue to further develop Ireland's tourism offerings in order to entice visitors to come to Ireland and to return time and again. However, that is dependent on continued innovation in the experiences we offer, and that is where Fáilte Ireland comes into play. This Bill will allow the channel of funding to Fáilte Ireland to continue its incredibly important work in this area. I thank Senators for their engagement. </p>

In accordance with Standing Order No. 148, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in Seanad Éireann and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question "That the Bill be received for final consideration", the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments by the Dáil. This is looked upon as a report on the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of the Dáil amendments. The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments. I have also circulated the proposed groupings in the House. A Senator may contribute only once on each grouping. I remind Senators that the only matters that may be discussed are the subject matters of each grouping of amendments made by the Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">This group contains a range of technical amendments made to the Bill during its passage through the Oireachtas. The purpose of amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10 is to clarify that the definition of programme schedule in the Bill encompasses both audiovisual programmes and sound programmes and that references to programmes in the definition of sound broadcasting services are references to sound programmes. The purpose of amendment No. 11 was to correct a typographical error in the definition of video sharing platform service in the Bill. The purpose of amendments Nos. 17, 18, 21, 23 to 24 inclusive, and 37 was to align the wording in the Bill regarding the roles of the Minister with responsibility for Coimisiún na Meán and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to certain financial and staffing matters with the wording in the public spending code. They are technical amendments as such and do not have any substantive effect on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> Amendment No. 22 changes a reference to "a nominee of the person" in line 36 on page 25 to "a person acting on behalf of the person". The wording to be inserted is considered more suitable for the section which relates to the disclosure of interests as it is more encompassing than the term "nominee". The purpose of amendments Nos. 35, 36, 39, 40, 51, 74, 77, 78, 79, 90, 119, 292 and 293 was to correct typographical errors in a range of sections of the Bill. The purpose of amendments Nos. 68, 291 and 296 was to take account of the enactment of the Electoral Reform Act 2022 and in particular, amendments Nos. 68 and 291 update references to sections of the Referendum Act 1998 and to the Referendum Commission so that they now refer to the Electoral Reform Act and An Coimisiún Toghcháin, the new Electoral Commission. Amendment No. 296 amends a reference in the Electoral Reform Act to the Broadcasting Act 2009 so that it now refers to the relevant section of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_397">The purpose of this group of amendments was to make provision in the Bill for an individual complaints mechanism as recommended by the online safety expert group in its comprehensive report. I acknowledge that this issue was of considerable interest and concern for Senators in this Chamber, particularly those who are members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, and one that I committed to examining in detail before returning to this House. When I established the expert group earlier this year, I made it clear that if it was feasible to introduce an individual complaints mechanism, then I would provide for it in the Bill and that is what I am proposing to do with these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> The expert group has done its work and has given detailed consideration to the wide range of issues raised in the context of an individual complaints mechanism including through a public consultation and engagement with experts such as the Australian eSafety Commissioner. The group's report and recommendations chart a practical way forward for the introduction of an individual focused on the operation of the mechanism on a phased basis, firstly for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> These amendments were drafted on the basis of the heads contained in the expert group's report and hew closely to the group's recommendations, save for necessary legal adjustments by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. In this regard, amendment No. 89 provides for the substantive provisions for the phasing in and operation of an individual complaints mechanism, including how An Coimisiún can make schemes for complaints about various kinds of harmful online content, the threshold which must be met before An Coimisiún will handle complaints, the kinds of resolutions for complaints available to An Coimisiún, and a requirement for An Coimisiún to set out a plan for operating these provisions. The remaining amendments in this group are consequential.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">Senators will recall that during the debate in the Seanad, I signalled that "party political programme" was intended to have the same meaning as "party political broadcast", namely, the short programmes carried on our public service broadcaster during electoral periods for the purpose of promoting a registered political party. The term "programme" was used in lieu of the term "broadcast" to ensure it encompassed both broadcasts broadcast by broadcasters and programmes made available by a relevant media service provider. It was to ensure it covered both party political broadcasts on RTÉ 1 and on the RTÉ Player. Senators and a number of stakeholders, including RTÉ and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, sought clarity in the Bill that "party political programme" had essentially the same meaning as "party political broadcast". Given the importance of providing clarity on this matter, I introduced amendments on Committee Stage in the Dáil to provide for a definition of "party political programme" in the Bill. I also introduced amendment No. 53 to provide that media service codes which will apply to broadcasting and video on-demand services may provide that party political programmes may only be available at specified times. Currently, party political broadcasts are only made available during electoral periods. This provision is intended to make explicit coimisiún na meán's authority to specify the timing of party political programmes. The intention is that these times shall continue to be during electoral periods. However, to provide flexibility, the provision refers to "specified times" rather than "electoral periods" to allow coimisiún na meán adapt to any change in policy in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> I also introduced amendment No. 50 to clarify the meaning of a phrase regarding not giving unfair preference to any political party in respect of the allocation of broadcasting time or the positioning of content in a catalogue.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">To provide flexibility, the provision refers to "specified times" rather than "electoral periods" to allow coimisiún na meán adapt to any change in policy in this regard. It will be a matter for the electoral commission. This will allow coimisiún na meán to change if anything happens at the electoral commission. It gives a flexibility to adapt but it is a matter for the electoral commission. It relates to how those commissions will work with each other because one will affect the other. There may be a need to come back to that point, depending on a decision of the electoral commission. This gives flexibility to coimisiún na meán.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">During the Seanad Committee and Report Stage debates on the Bill, a number of Senators indicated they considered the provision that prohibits broadcasters and providers of video on-demand services making available programmes which may reasonably be considered to cause harm or offence as being potentially contrary to the principles of freedom of expression. At that stage, I committed to examining the matter. Having examined and considered the matter, I brought amendments on the Dáil Committee Stage to qualify the standard applied to broadcasters and providers of video on-demand services from "offence" to one of "undue offence". This aligns the language in the Bill with the standard of harm or undue offence to material applied by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland through its code of programme standards, ensuring the statutory provisions align with the practical implementation of the prohibition.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">This group of amendments is intended to allow coimisiún na meán to make media service codes which promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes on radio, television and video on-demand services, and to promote the broadcasting of musical works composed or performed by women on radio services. A key goal of mine, as Minister, is to further gender equality within every sector under my remit and to collaborate closely with my Government colleagues to drive change across other key Departments. It is an issue that Senators raised with me and one I had committed to examining and returning to. Young girls cannot aim to be what they cannot see or hear and there needs to be a significant improvement in the ratio of women to men on radio and television, so that both genders feel represented in public discourse, as well as better representation of women in music on our airwaves. Following careful consideration of the compatibility of gender balance measures with the rights to freedom of expression and competition law, it is considered that the most appropriate approach to further this goal is to empower coimisiún na meán to make codes setting out standards and practices in relation to the promotion of greater representation for women in music and news broadcasting. Such codes will be binding on providers of radio, television and video on-demand services and, where breaches occur, such codes could be subject to enforcement action by coimisiún na meán. This approach will allow coimisiún na meán the flexibility to identify appropriate measures to promote gender equality that are consistent with our legal framework.</p>

I commend them on having the wherewithal to make that change themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_442"> Amendments Nos. 278 and 279 clarify that all aspects of the development of European works may benefit from funding under a content production scheme. Amendment No. 279 also brings the content production scheme into line with the sound and vision scheme, pursuant to section 154(2)(a) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, in respect of requirements that audiovisual programmes funded under the scheme are made available on a free television service or video on-demand service.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> Amendment No. 280 sets out that at least 80% of annual funding provided through a scheme must be allocated to independent producers.

          <p eId="para_444"> Amendments Nos. 281 to 286, inclusive, set out the guidelines and principles to be followed in defining "independent producers" for the purposes of any scheme.

Should the EU not come back with a proposal on that, we should look at it. We need to protect our young kids from the harm that is on social media. The Bill will go a significant way towards that.

          <p eId="para_459"> There were some very terse exchanges between members of the committee and the tech giants who came as witnesses because the Bill shone a light on the manner in which they do business and earn money, which went to the core of everything we discuss, and how algorithms and driving hate allowed them to earn money by funnelling ads into a particular sphere.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> By acknowledging the importance of the online media presence in our society, we shone a light on an ailing and - I say this with regret as an NUJ member - maybe dying sector, namely, traditional media. By engaging with them in the committee and, in the Minister's case, personally, and by establishing coimisiún na meán, we hope to provide a structure that allows them to adapt. These institutions have served us extremely well. We are lucky to have a high standard of traditional media, whether broadcast, print or sound. I hope the new funds the Minister has established for journalistic practice, which allow the spreading of resources, gives them the chance to survive and thrive. We have to acknowledge they are in a difficult sphere, and we did so in this Chamber two weeks ago when representatives of the NUJ and the industry came before us to outline the challenges they face.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> I thank the witnesses who participated in the lengthy preparation of the Bill. They felt their voices were heard in the feeding-in of the recommendations made. As a result, we have significant legislation. I thank the departmental staff, who were so accommodating through the long process of debate. I commend the Minister on a significant day for her and, more importantly, the regulation of the media sector. It will be one of the big achievements of this Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_463"> As Senators stated on the first day we debated this, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is crucial legislation. It modernises the regulation of the media ecosystem in Ireland and lays the foundations for the new regulatory frontier of online safety, which will be of great importance when it comes to protecting our children online.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> Key to this is the establishment of a robust and agile regulator, coimisiún na meán, whose remit will continue to grow in the coming years. An coimisiún will ultimately be responsible for enforcing key pieces of EU regulatory legislation, including the revised audiovisual media services directive, the Digital Services Act and aspects of the terrorist content regulation. It will have an important role in ensuring media sustainability and development.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> This Bill is the first step in a rolling legislative programme in this space in the coming years. I thank the officials in my Department for their tireless work and engagement with Senators and Deputies on my behalf during the passage of the Bill through both Houses. The Bill is of fundamental importance to protecting our society, particularly our children, from serious forms of harmful online content and finally ensuring online platforms are appropriately held to account. I know all Senators and Deputies are cognisant of the significance of the legislation. I acknowledge and thank Senators and Deputies for their constructive feedback and input inside and outside the Houses over the past year.</p>

          <p eId="para_477"> The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, as we all agree, provides an easier, quicker and cheaper means of resolving claims. This benefits the injured person, the person or company the claim is against and, indeed, society as a whole. Nevertheless, the Bill will enable PIAB to do much more. I acknowledge the significant work the former Minister of State, Deputy Troy, put into this legislation, including in his extensive engagement with stakeholders. I also thank Deputies and Senators for engaging on the Bill and ensuring its swift passage through the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> I met the team in PIAB a number of weeks ago at its headquarters in Tallaght. They have been preparing for the changes in the board’s operation the Bill will bring about. I will continue to engage with PIAB to ensure an appropriately resourced mediation function will be in operation as soon as possible. It will take time for the board to be able to undertake all its new functions, but my intention is to commence the new provisions of the Bill as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> The enactment of the Bill is a milestone in the Government’s Action Plan for Insurance Reform. The Government has prioritised insurance reform and our current focus is on completing the reform agenda this year. These reforms have been sought by interest groups and the insurance industry, and the Government has delivered. Across government, significant work has been undertaken under the action plan to address issues in the insurance market. The personal injuries guidelines have been introduced, legislation to strengthen the laws on perjury has been enacted, the office to promote competition in the insurance market and the insurance fraud co-ordination office have been established, and changes to occupiers' liability are being considered by these Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> The Tánaiste has rightly said the success of this plan will be measured not by the number of completed actions but rather by whether the reforms, implemented over the lifetime of the Government, result in reduced premiums and increased availability of insurance. While we have seen some evidence of improvement in the availability of insurance, premiums have decreased only for motorists to date. This ongoing improvement, at a time of overall price increases, indicates these actions have laid a solid foundation for change and are delivering positive outcomes for consumers. In light of the current inflationary pressures, it is vital all savings from the reform package be passed on to customers, and I am sending that message loud and clear to the insurance industry from here in Seanad Éireann. Only then will the full benefits of the action plan be realised.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> I again thank the officials in the Department, who have worked exceptionally hard, particularly John Maher and Anne Barrett, who are with me here this evening. We will continue to ensure the work that is necessary for the Bill to take effect will produce the desired outcome, namely, reduced insurance premiums. I also thank the Acting Chairperson for his chairing of the debate; he has learned well from Senator Horkan.</p>

          <p eId="para_483">I am pleased to be in Seanad Éireann to present the Credit Union (Amendment) Bill 2022. In accordance with Standing Order No. 149(2)(i), I confirm that the reason pre-legislative scrutiny did not take place under Seanad Standing Order No. 143 is to meet a programme for Government commitment to review the policy framework for credit unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> Credit unions are the most trusted brand in Ireland and the Government wants credit unions to provide a much wider range of products and services to their members. All credit union members should be allowed to access full-service community banking regardless of their credit union’s size. This Bill will help the credit union movement to grow as a key provider of community banking in the country. The passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas will help credit unions to seize this opportunity. It is a priority for the Government to have this Bill enacted as quickly as possible. </p>
          <p eId="para_485"><b>
						</b>The appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for credit unions in August 2020 was historic. It was the first time ever a Minister of State had been given direct responsibility for credit unions. I am very pleased to be in this role. The review of the policy framework which led to this Bill is a culmination of work done since the programme for Government was agreed. Over the past two years I have held over 50 stakeholder engagements and have met with more than 60 credit unions, either individually or in groups, and many more at conferences across the length and breadth of the country, both north and south. I have met with all representative bodies, the registrar of credit unions, the Credit Union Advisory Committee, the credit union CEO forum and several collaborative ventures. My officials and I analysed more than 100 proposals for legislative and regulatory change. On 10 March this year I held a one-day stakeholder engagement session with sector representatives and all stakeholders gave broad support for the proposals in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> Credit unions are an important part of Irish society. They are a social community organisation providing vital financial services. I have seen first-hand the strengths of the sector. Credit unions are the largest provider of personal unsecured loans, a lifeline for many families in Ireland today. They hold approximately €17 billion of savings, €5.5 billion of loans and serve 3.5 million members across a network of 204 credit unions and over 400 branches. Credit unions are co-operative, not-for-profit organisations governed by over 2,500 volunteer directors and board oversight committee members whose objective is to pursue the economic and social goals of members and wider local communities. This role is even more important given the withdrawal of Ulster Bank, KBC and the closure of many bank branches. </p>
          <p eId="para_487"> When I came into office the statistic that struck me most was that credit unions are only lending 27%, or €5.5 billion, of their €20 billion assets. This figure is too low. It is important that credit unions continue to develop plans for lending in the community such as loans to small business, agri-lending, retrofit loans and mortgages, in a safe and cost effective way through collaboration. Collaboration can work well. Roughly 75 credit unions provide current accounts and debit cards and now make up more than 10% of all new current account openings, all supported by two collaborative vehicles. These collaborative vehicles are member owned and provide back-office support for the delivery of common products. Challenges arising from the negative interest rate environment have abated materially and provide a positive tailwind into 2023. It is important we acknowledge the challenges the sector faces while at the same time explaining how we, and more importantly, the sector, will address them.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> The Bill itself contains 56 sections amending the Credit Union Act 1997. The Explanatory Memorandum clarifies which amendments are policy, technical or consequential. This is the first substantive credit union legislation since the 2012 Act. The sector has changed a lot in those ten years. There are fewer credit unions now but they are much larger and provide a much wider range of products and services than heretofore. The average asset size is now roughly €100 million and the largest is above €500 million. </p>
          <p eId="para_489"> In my stakeholder engagement a number of key issues arose. First, if a member’s local credit union does not provide a current account, that member cannot join a credit union that does provide same. Furthermore, the credit union cannot introduce the member to another credit union.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">While the common bond may appear to protect a credit union from competition from other credit unions, it does nothing to prevent competition from banks or non-banks. I have carefully considered the value of the common bond and would not like to see it being a barrier to members accessing the widest possible range of financial services. </p>
          <p eId="para_491"> Second, while a local focus is a great strength of the credit union sector, it can lead to fragmentation. In many areas, there are multiple products, price points and varying terms and conditions. This makes it almost impossible for the sector to market itself as a nationwide option to consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> The Bill contains measures to address these issues, which I identified in my engagement with the sector. It will support investment in collaboration by allowing for corporate credit unions, a new type of regulated vehicle. Corporate credit unions are credit unions whose members comprise solely other credit unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> The Bill will also amend section 43 to clarify that credit unions can invest in ventures supporting credit unions. It will support enhanced governance by including: the option of making the manager a member of the board, in line with best practice in corporate governance; a reduction in the minimum number of board meetings to six per annum; a mandatory review of policies every three years, from annually at present, and a removal of the requirement for the board to review procedures; a reduction in five administrative issues to be mandatorily approved at board level; four amendments to streamline the work of the board oversight committee; and a provision to allow credit unions to seek deemed consent from members to receive the annual accounts by electronic means. This could save significant sums in print and postage costs for individual credit unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> The Bill will improve member services by providing flexibility to the common bond in four aspects, namely, to allow for the referral of members to other credit unions, to provide a service not provided by the referring credit union, to allow for loan participation between two or more credit unions, to allow for more businesses to be members and to allow credit unions to lend to certain public sector entities designated by the Minister. The Bill will also amend section 38 to allow the Minister to set a maximum interest rate, currently fixed at 1% per month. </p>
          <p eId="para_495"> I believe the draft Bill addresses the core issues I discussed earlier. To fully exploit the Bill, the sector must work together to lessen fragmentation, provide strategic direction and leadership and drive business model change. There are three non-legislative policy actions. First, the Central Bank, CUAC and the Minister will enter into a memorandum of understanding to improve co-ordination on policy matters while respecting regulatory independence. Second, the Central Bank has agreed to introduce an enhanced engagement protocol with credit unions. Third, we have amended the terms of reference of a stakeholder group to widen attendance and enhance transparency with the sector. These are all welcome and sensible changes that are in progress. </p>
          <p eId="para_496"> The core elements of the Bill come directly from detailed engagement with the sector and research by the credit union advisory committee. My work is fully supported by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe. I look forward to a constructive debate on the Bill as it progresses through the Oireachtas, and I commend it to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#PatCasey" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Senator Pat Casey<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_497">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He referred to the credit union movement as an integral part of the community, and that is what it is. Whenever we speak of the movement in this House or the Lower House, we all speak of it in a positive manner because it is an integral part of the community. If it retains those values, the Bill will add to that service it provides. The pillar banks have resiled from face-to-face meetings with people and devalued in-person contact with people, which is a retrograde step. I hope credit unions will not go in that direction but rather will keep the value of that community sprit they have instilled. Interestingly, credit unions and An Post are the two brands to which the Irish people are most loyal, and that must be maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> We all know from our history dealing with banks that years ago, there was one-to-one contact with managers. The bank knew the person it was dealing with and understood the business he or she was doing, but that is all gone now. Our banking has gone online, we fill out forms on apps and the personal contact has been removed. That will be an advantage to credit unions, once the Bill progresses through the Houses, if they can maintain that face-to-face contact with the people they serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> The Bill represents more than two years of work, led by my party colleague the Minister of State, to fulfil the programme for Government commitment to reviewing the policy framework within which credit unions operate. It represents the commitment in the programme for Government to growing credit union lending through the expansion of services and encouraging further community development. It is the first substantive item of credit union legislation since 2012, which related to the Commission on Credit Unions. The review of the policy framework focuses on five key areas, namely, recognition of the role of credit unions, supporting investment and collaboration, supporting enhanced governance, improving members' services, and transparency and regulatory engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> Since his appointment, the Minister of State has held more than 50 stakeholder engagement sessions and met representatives of more than 60 credit unions, either individually or in groups, and many more at events. In total, more than 100 proposals, including all those submitted by sector representatives, for legislative and regulatory change were carefully considered. On 10 March 2022, the Minister of State held a consultative roundtable discussion regarding the Government's proposal with the Irish League of Credit Union, the Credit Union Development Association, the Credit Union Managers Association and the National Supervisors Forum. The proposal received the support of all the bodies represented at the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> The Minister of State has outlined the provisions of the Bill, so there is not much point in me going through them again. I thank him for his engagement with credit unions. I know, from dealing with him on a personal basis, that he too values the credit union movement in the community. To help credit unions seize this opportunity, it is a priority to have the Bill passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible. On that note, I will say no more.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MariaByrne" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Senator Maria Byrne<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_502">I thank the Minister of State for attending to discuss this important issue. Senator Casey covered much of what I had intended to say. As a member of a credit union, I know credit unions are at the heart of our communities. When I joined my local credit union, it was the confraternity credit union. Applicants had to be members of the confraternity to be admitted and it was restricted to certain streets. If you lived to the left of one street, you could not join, and nor could you if you lived across the road from the credit union because it was in a different jurisdiction. We have come an awfully long way in respect of credit unions. I compliment the Minister of State and his staff and officials on their engagement and the work they have done to bring the Bill before the House. Having spoken to the manager of a credit union locally and met others elsewhere in the country, I know they are delighted with the level of engagement that has come, which has been led by the Minister of State and his team.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> As Senator Casey eloquently outlined, with the banking sector reduced in size to only three pillar banks, more and more people are turning to credit unions for matters such as small loans, whether for a car or event, and investments. Many people also use credit or debit cards from credit unions as well, whereas 20 or 30 years ago, credit unions did not have those kinds of facilities. Indeed, some credit unions can even offer mortgages. That the sector is being expanded whereby companies too can join is very important. Some companies might run a Christmas club for their staff or whatever the case may be, and they now have the facility to use the credit union. Moreover, staff still work behind the counter in credit unions and that is very welcome, especially for older people, many of whom cannot get used to the fact banks have reduced their staff numbers and, in many cases, there are mostly just machines.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">If you want to deal with a staff member, you have to queue up for quite a while to get that personal touch. I believe that credit unions bring that personal touch. The credit union movement has grown from strength to strength, not just in the towns and villages, but in cities. The key element of this is to recognise the credit union services organisations under the Credit Union Act as authorised investors and to provide for the establishment of corporate credit unions as entities through which credit unions can further collaborate. Credit unions can collaborate with one another and this is a healthy way to go because they will be able to work together on projects. There is also the fact that the Minister of State is there as their representative or point of contact. If they have suggestions, they can speak to the Minister of State and his team. This is important because the people in the credit unions have been working for so long with members of the public. </p>
          <p eId="para_505"> This Bill seeks to permit public bodies to become members of the credit union and to provide for certain changes to the governance of credit unions. We all recognise how important governance is. The staff do an annual governance course and are fully trained. The Bill is to provide for the setting of the maximum interest rates by the Minister and that can be changed on loans by the credit unions. I am aware this provision came out of the Minister of State's engagement with the credit unions. The Bill also provides for the provision of services by credit unions to members of other credit unions within certain parameters and to provide for the participation by credit unions in loans to members of other credit unions. Some credit unions can give out bigger loans than others so that is important. The Bill also seeks to require credit unions to publish a digital map to provide a description of their common bond on their website or in their annual accounts for greater transparency. </p>
          <p eId="para_506"> From listing those out, we can see the work that has gone into bringing this Bill forward. It is a positive step in the right direction. I would love to see credit unions growing because there is huge potential there. There is also the fact that now one can do many transactions there, when one had to go to the bank for them. That is positive. I compliment the Minister of State and the Fine Gael grouping will be supporting this Bill. </p>

        <speech by="#NiallODonnghaile" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_507">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit agus cuirim fáilte chomh mhaith roimh an reachtaíocht atá os ár gcomhair anocht. It is important to begin, as Senator Maria Byrne did, by acknowledging how important the credit union is in the fabric of Irish life and how it permeates across all parishes, communities, cities and counties. While listening to Senator Maria Byrne, I thought back to my late grandmother, my granny McVeigh, who said to me as a young fellow, “Make sure you join a credit union, son. Get into the credit union”. I am sure that is reflective of many people’s experiences. Certainly, when I got to the age of 18, when I finished school and when I wanted to go on my first foreign holiday, I was glad that I was a member of the credit union because it enabled me to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> There are over 300 credit unions across Ireland, North and South. One in two people in Ireland have a credit union account. It is a movement that is considerate of the needs of a community, it generally places people above profits, and it seeks to benefit its members, not shareholders. Credit unions are trusted, they are visible and they understand what makes and strengthens community. Irish people really depend on their local credit union, not least at this time of the year, and they are so popular because they treat their customers and members with respect, always trying to respond to their needs and circumstances. </p>
          <p eId="para_509"> The Credit Union (Amendment) Bill is welcome because it comes at a time when Ulster Bank and KBC are closing their doors. Other banks are whittling down their services and providing machines instead of fully functioning branches. Commercial banks during the pandemic used the public health restrictions as an opportunity to close many branches across the country, negatively impacting customers and communities that are remote, that lack decent access to broadband or that require assistance in adapting to digital services. </p>
          <p eId="para_510"> Credit unions, in stark contrast, have remained accessible, responsive and adaptive. This Bill is the first substantive credit union legislation since 2012, which followed the Commission on Credit Unions. In the recognition of the importance of the role of credit unions, the Bill includes an additional object into section 6 of the principal Act, namely, "to promote and provide support to co-operative groups and voluntary associations". Currently, there is no recognition of or reference to the volunteer ethos of credit unions in the Act, so this is particularly welcome. </p>
          <p eId="para_511"> In terms of what the Bill does, this Bill makes it possible to support investment in collaboration, through the creation of corporate credit unions. It will also amend section 43 to clarify that credit unions can invest in ventures supporting credit unions. This enhanced collaboration is vital for the future of the credit union movement. It will allow credit unions to better serve their members by increasing the range of services offered. Corporate credit unions allow for an additional regulated structure through which credit unions could collaborate. The Bill seeks to improve members' services by allowing credit unions to refer members to other credit unions and to participate in loans of other credit unions. At the moment, whether a member can access the fullest range of services depends on what his or her local credit union does or does not provide, and members cannot just go to a different credit union to access other services. You can only be a member of the credit union in your local area. If a member's local credit union does not provide a current account or mortgage lending, he or she cannot join a credit union that does, nor can the credit union introduce the member to another credit union, though it can introduce a member to a bank or non-bank. It is therefore great to see that the amendments in this Bill aim to increase the flexibility of the common bond and to allow for practical improvements to help credit unions increase competitiveness and to deliver a greater range of services to more members. We must empower credit unions to be more competitive in an environment of aggressive competition from banks and newer actors in the market, such as Revolut, PayPal and Starling, amongst others. </p>
          <p eId="para_512"> The Bill will also amend section 38 to allow the Minister for Finance to set a maximum interest rate, which is currently fixed at 1% per month. The Irish League Of Credit Unions, ILCU, has been calling for the introduction of a significantly reduced statutory maximum interest rate. This is important to help to prevent situations where the high cost of borrowing often results in unmanageable debts for vulnerable people and families. </p>
          <p eId="para_513"> The Consumer Credit (Amendment) Act is also important legislation which sets out a number of significant regulations in this regard. There are also measures to support enhanced governance of their boards to ensure it is in line with best practice in corporate governance. The Bill has the full support of the Irish League of Credit Unions. I know that they have been campaigning for legislative changes since 2016, so getting the legislation swiftly through the Oireachtas would be something I am sure they would appreciate as well. Indeed, the need for reforms in this area have been long awaited and the Government has been quite slow to react to calls for these reforms. </p>
          <p eId="para_514"> The final report of the credit union advisory committee implementation group was published in January 2019. I think people would have liked to see a quicker response but it is welcome that we now have some movement and the Bill before us this evening. We will look at it in more detail on Committee Stage but Sinn Féin broadly supports this Bill and we hope that it will move swiftly through the legislative process in order to give effect and to make a difference to credit unions and to communities they are a part of. </p>

        <speech by="#JoeOReilly" eId="spk_181">
          <from> An Leas-Chathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_515">I now call on Senator Kyne and I offer him my apologies for almost missing him, as I thought he was here in a supervisory capacity.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Senator Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_516">The Leas-Chathaoirleach does not need any supervision. The Minister of State is welcome. I want to briefly welcome the publication of this Bill and to compliment his own engagement with the credit union sector. He has met various credit unions, has engaged with them in stakeholder engagements and has toured the country to meet the front line in relation to credit unions. We all agree that they do tremendous work and they are a trusted brand. They cover so much of the country and are available to communities. In comparison with this, there is the matter of the poor regard that people might have for the traditional banks because of various issues of which we are all aware during the financial crash etc. The growth and the power of the credit union is reflective of the impact of the financial sector and the financial crash of that time. I welcome the level of engagement the Minister of State has had.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> There has been enough talk about the assets that the credit unions have, as well as about the amount of them. There is the matter of their ability to fund other projects and to be involved in larger loans. It is important to give them the choice, as long as there is adequate regulation in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">That is the important thing. While I did say that the credit unions are trusted and that there were issues with the banks, there were a small number of credit unions, although not in my area, that got too large too quickly during that time and ran into problems. That happened under the original legislation. While I accept the need to look at that Act again, we have to be conscious and careful that we do not do anything that will undermine the good work credit unions have done over recent years or their trusted brand.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> In the Minister of State's speech, he said the Bill will support enhanced governance by making the manager a member of the board. That makes perfect sense. The member could be an <i>ex officio</i> member of the board and therefore accountable to it, as would be the case with any good board. I presume there is a rationale for reducing the minimum number of board meetings. I am not exactly sure of the purpose of the reduction in five administrative issues to be mandatorily approved at board level. The Minister's sixth point regarding the electronic transfer of accounts makes sense. With regard to the flexibility to allow for loan participation, to allow for more businesses to be members and to allow credit unions to lend to certain public sector entities designated by the Minister, the question is whether this flexibility is to be open-ended. Will it be done by regulation once the Act is amended? What does the Minister of State have in mind? Has consideration been given to the certain public sector entities that will be designated to allow lending to take place? Those are some of my main points.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> Oversight is the biggest issue. While major changes could be sought or initiated by the credit union with the best of intentions, one has to question whether they are in their interests. Again, if they grow too large, could they run into problems? That is my only concern. As I have said, it is a trusted and important brand that is community-driven and community-owned. There is great potential in the sector. We just have to ensure the right balance between what the credit unions want themselves and proper regulation and oversight.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanFleming" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Sean Fleming)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_521">I thank all of the Senators who have contributed to the debate. It is very clear that everybody who spoke has a deep personal knowledge of and connection with the credit union movement through their own local credit unions. We accept that, in itself, this Bill will not solve all of the issues in the credit union movement, many of which are issues that will have to be sorted out by the movement itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> The first point I will make is that this is enabling legislation. It facilitates credit unions in making changes to the way they do their business. They are not being forced to do anything. Some of these issues will be a matter for individual credit unions. The amendments are targeted at the core issues that arose during our consultation process and will provide a much wider set of products to members, allow greater investment and confidence in collaboration and support volunteer directors in a practical way. There are aspects of the Bill that will require consequential changes to Central Bank regulations, a process which will proceed after enactment and which will require consultation with the sector at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Senator Casey spoke about the valuable community spirit of the credit unions and mentioned the role of An Post, which has a significant role to play in communities, and the fact there is personal contact when you go into a credit union building. Senator Maria Byrne said she was a member of the credit union and precisely explained the issues of the common bond and boundaries. We have provided in legislation that credit unions will have to provide a map or electronic means of showing the extent of their common bond. I have been around the country and I know there can be issues as to what street is in what area. Amalgamations take place. In Limerick, there are particular streets covered by more than two or three credit unions. We are not interfering. We just want this information laid out so that the public and members of the credit union know. I thank the Senator for her thanks to all of the departmental staff for all of the work they have done in the past two years in getting this Bill to this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile said that Sinn Féin supports the Bill. I am very pleased to hear that and look forward to it passing. If there are positive amendments that can be incorporated, we will have an open mind to them. This Bill has not come about as a result of some preset view in the Department but from having listened to the credit union movement. If amendments are practical, feasible and to the benefit of the credit union movement, we will have an open mind to them as we go along. The Senator also mentioned the value of the credit unions, especially in the context of the banks closing, and their voluntary ethos. He also said their collaboration is very good and praised significant aspects of the Bill. I hope it will move through the Oireachtas well and will be enacted as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> Senator Kyne mentioned how broad-based the credit union movement is. It is now giving out larger loans than heretofore, but that implies a need for good regulation, which there is. The issue of regulation is between the Central Bank and the credit union movement and it is not for the Minister for Finance, the Department or the Oireachtas to intervene. We have to trust both sides. There is no reason that should not continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> The issue of governance was also raised. I will explain that most of what we are doing is enabling. We are saying that, when it comes to the issue of a manager being a full member of a credit union's board, the decision is up to each credit union. Up until now, that could not happen but we are enabling and facilitating credit unions that want to do that. Those that do not, do not have to. We are removing the blockage for those credit unions that do. On the number of board meetings being reduced to six, this is the minimum number. A credit union can still have ten board meetings a year if it wants to. At the moment, they have to hold almost double that number. They also have other meetings. It becomes quite difficult for the volunteer board members to attend all the meetings of the board and its subcommittees. If we reduce the minimum number to six, it may be easier to attract people onto boards. Otherwise, they may have to attend a board meeting every second week. Again, this is at the discretion of each individual credit union. The six is a minimum. If some want to have eight, nine or ten, they are free to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> On the issues relating to the policies of the board, I am open to correction but I believe there are 36 different policies that have to be cleared at board level. These range from regulatory matters to HR matters, staffing matters, the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and freedom of information. I am actually not sure about the freedom of information and GDPR rules. All of these policies have to come through the board every single year. Some of them are quite repetitive and involve a lot of documentation. This will facilitate some policies only having to come to the board every three years. Obviously, the significant ones will have to be cleared every year but some of the more routine ones can be cleared less often than annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> I thank the Members for their contributions here today. I hope that, when people have had time to study the Bill in further detail, they will see that, as has been reflected here, everything we are doing is to help and support the credit union movement in growing in the increasingly changing financial landscape in the country. We are here to support the credit union movement. As I have said already, if positive suggestions are made during this legislation's passage through the Oireachtas, we will certainly be open to taking them on board.</p>
